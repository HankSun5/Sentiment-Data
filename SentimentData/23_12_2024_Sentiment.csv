Cardano (ADA) , renowned for its scalability and eco-friendly blockchain, is set to leverage upcoming upgrades to fuel a breakout surge. Adding to the excitement, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a game-changer in the decentralized AI and blockchain space, thanks to its advance ecosystem. With its presale at $0.003, LCAI is gaining momentum as a disruptive force, attracting investors seeking exponential growth in a rapidly evolving market.

Recent checks show that XRP has good backing near the $2.42 mark, hin͏ting at a strong base for its present price points! Also, the launch of Ripple’s new RLUSD coin has made good mood in the market, helping to boost XRP’s rise. Market pros think that XRP might hit $5 by Christmas, showing more hope among buyers. These news along with XRP’s known spot in the money market, back up the guess that it will hold on to the $2 point soon. Cardano’s bullish momentum- what’s fueling the anticipated surge? Cardano (ADA) has recently exhibited significant bullish momentum, with its price surging by approximately 52% over the past month. This upward trajectory can be attributed to several key factors. Increased Whale Activity-There has been a notable rise in large transactions, indicating heightened interest from major investors. Technical Breakout- ADA has surpassed critical resistance levels, suggesting the potential for continued upward movement. Enhanced Network Activity- Metrics such as daily active addresses have shown significant growth, reflecting increased user engagement and confidence in the platform. These developments collectively contribute to the optimistic outlook for Cardano, positioning it for potential further gains in the cryptocurrency market. Lightchain AI- the emerging contender poised for a breakout in the crypto market Lightchain AI is a decentralized platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, aiming to address challenges in both fields by creating a transparent, efficient, and privacy-preserving ecosystem for AI computations. Tokenomics The platform utilizes the Lightchain Token (LCAI) as its native cryptocurrency, serving multiple functions within the ecosystem. LCAI’s tokenomics are designed for sustainability and equitable distribution, with a total supply capped at 10 billion tokens. Utility LCAI tokens are used for payments for AI tasks, staking for governance participation, and accessing premium features of the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Distribution The token distribution is designed to incentivize early adoption and long-term participation, with allocations for early developers, validators, an ecosystem growth fund, and community rewards. Economic Design The economic model includes mechanisms for inflation control, token burning, dynamic pricing, and a sustainability fund to ensure ecosystem balance and value retention. Roadmap Lightchain AI has outlined a comprehensive roadmap to guide its development. Phase 1- Prototype Development Focuses on creating and testing core components like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the AIVM in a controlled environment. Phase 2- Testnet Rollout Involves deploying the testnet to allow developers and node operators to validate functionalities and provide feedback for optimization. Phase 3- Mainnet Launch Marks the full deployment of the platform, enabling all core features, including decentralized AI computations and tokenized transactions. Phase 4-Ecosystem Growth Aims to expand the platform’s reach by onboarding developers, enterprises, and establishing cross-chain integrations to foster a thriving ecosystem. These strategic phases are designed to ensure the platform’s robustness, scalability, and widespread adoption in the evolving crypto market. Strategic insights: Comparing XRP, Cardano, and Lightchain AI’s market potential As evident from the discussions above, XRP, Cardano, and Lightchain AI each possess unique features that make them attractive investments. While XRP remains a top choice for investors seeking stability and regulatory clarity, Cardano’s upcoming upgrades and growing network activity position it as an emerging contender for exponential growth. On the other hand, Lightchain AI presents a promising opportunity with its unique approach to bridging AI and blockchain technology- two rapidly evolving industries. Its early-stage development makes LCAI a high-risk but potentially high-reward option for investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge technologies. Why Lightchain AI could outperform all Lightchain AI’s potential for success lies in its ability to address critical challenges in the fields of blockchain and AI, ultimately creating a sustainable and efficient ecosystem for decentralized AI computations. Lightchain AI’s plan includes several key milestones. In 2024, it will launch its testnet and begin bringing developers onboard. By March 2025, the mainnet will go live, unlocking complete functionality for both PoI and AIVM. From 2025 onward, the focus will shift to building cross-chain compatibility and forging partnerships with enterprise-level AI applications. This forward-looking approach positions Lightchain AI as more than just a blockchain — it’s an AI-powered platform with the promise to transform decentralized technology.

A $0.0013 cryptocurrency is gaining investor buzz, poised to surpass Cardano and Shiba Inu with its market potential. Table of Contents DOGEN soars through stage 9 presale, positioned for explosive growth on Solana Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Shiba Inu: The Ethereum-based meme coin driving innovation Conclusion A new cryptocurrency valued at only $0.0013 is drawing remarkable attention from investors. This low-cost token is generating buzz for its potential to surpass well-known players like Cardano and Shiba Inu. The excitement surrounding its rapid rise is fueling speculation about its future impact on the market. DOGEN soars through stage 9 presale, positioned for explosive growth on Solana DOGEN continues to make waves, advancing to Stage 9 of its presale with tokens now priced at $0.0013. For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, DOGEN’s projected 500% pre-launch surge highlights its strong potential for substantial returns.

A vision beyond meme coins DOGEN’s roadmap signals a shift from meme status to a functional asset, with the upcoming DogeTap app exemplifying this movement. Prioritizing transparency and regular audits, DOGEN differentiates itself in the volatile crypto market, establishing itself as a credible and resilient option within the Solana ecosystem. With its strong growth trajectory, innovative features, and mounting investor interest, DOGEN is poised to capitalize on the momentum of both the meme coin market and Solana’s robust framework. Early investors have a unique opportunity to ride this promising wave. Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts, enabling decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano stands out for its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, Ouroboros, which is more sustainable than traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to a million transactions per second. With its focus on scalability and sustainability, ADA shows strong potential. In the current market cycle, the coin appears attractive due to its innovative technology. Shiba Inu: The Ethereum-based meme coin driving innovation Launched in August 2020 by the pseudonymous developer Ryoshi, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has quickly grown into a standout meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB leverages Ethereum’s ecosystem for enhanced functionality and scalability. With an initial supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half were famously sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the supply, significantly reducing its circulation. Unlike its predecessor Dogecoin, SHIB is building a robust utility-focused ecosystem. Key developments include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and governance framework, highlighting its ambition to go beyond meme status. SHIB’s Ethereum integration positions it as a versatile asset with potential applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based innovations. Conclusion With the bull run of 2024 underway, DOGEN stands out as a token designed for those seeking luxury and success. While ADA and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN aims for significant growth, following in the footsteps of successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. It builds a community of market leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

Kiyosaki tells his 2.6 million followers on the social media platform X that the United States has a history of devaluing its currency at the expense of Americans saving their wealth in the dollar. The best-selling author refers to the dollar as “fake money,” highlighting that the government can always print more out of thin air. “I stopped trusting my government in 1965 when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of cooper. In 1971, President Nixon continued the theft of our wealth via our money, when Tricky Dicky Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard… If you do not [like] being ‘bent over’ and your wealth stolen via your fake money…. Keep being ignorant, working hard for fake money, and continue listening to financial planners who will tell you what to do with your fake money.” Kiyosaki calls on investors to instead store their wealth in scarce assets like gold, silver and Bitcoin ( BTC ). He notes that investing in these three commodities can save people in the event of a severe financial crisis. “THANK YOU gold, silver and Bitcoin HODLERS… Today the best assets for your money are real gold, silver, and Bitcoin. The world is about to crash financially. Please take care.” Last month, Kiyosaki said he plans to accumulate about 100 BTC regardless of price. He notes that he’s comfortable trading his dollars for “real money” like BTC despite Bitcoin’s rising prices. “Today I own 73 whole Bitcoins. A year from now, I intend to own 100 Bitcoin, regardless of price.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $97,222.

The billionaire blockchain visionary plans to meet Democratic Senators, including Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, to probably push a bipartisan agenda for the crypto industry. Charles’s strategy is to bridge the gap between political parties and get lawmakers to stop fighting long enough to see what crypto can actually do. Fetterman recently went viral for his comments on Trump’s 2024 win, calling out Kamala Harris for labeling Trump a fascist. “A lot of Democrats, especially in my state, that I know and I happen to love, people that [voted] for Trump, and they are not fascists,” Fetterman said. “I think people are going to decide who protects and projects their version of the American way of life. And that’s what happened.” Charles sees opportunity in Fetterman Charles wasted no time reacting. “When people ask how we make crypto a bipartisan issue, these are the Democrats we need to talk to next year,” he said . For Charles, Fetterman represents a type of leadership that crypto needs—Democrats willing to challenge party lines and think differently. Crypto has been caught in political crossfire, with the Biden administration and Senator Elizabeth Warren taking a hard stance against the industry. Charles has been vocal about this. He slammed what he called Biden and Warren’s anti-crypto “deal,” claiming it stifles innovation and locks legitimate businesses out of the system. But his plan doesn’t stop with a few meetings. He’s already proposed a “Bill of Rights” for crypto users, focusing on consumer protection, fair taxation, and clear asset classification. In November, he launched “Operation Baseline,” a campaign for identifying inefficiencies in the U.S. crypto market and pushing for legislation to fix them. Charles even floated the idea of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong becoming a “White House Crypto Czar” under a potential Trump administration. Armstrong, he argued, could unify the fragmented industry and offer a strong voice in Washington. The president has since chosen someone else. A polarizing figure with big ideas Charles isn’t your typical suit-and-tie tech founder. Critics call Cardano a “zombie chain,” accusing it of lacking activity compared to Ethereum and Solana. Charles doesn’t flinch. He fires back with the same energy, saying, “People see what they want to see.” His outspoken personality is both his strength and his Achilles’ heel. He likes to drag critics, calling them the “paint chip brigade” and taking aim at journalists and competitors alike. It’s a style that alienates some but resonates with others who admire his no-nonsense approach. Though earlier this year, he ran a Twitter poll asking, “Am I cancer for Cardano?” Over 50,000 people voted, and 51.6% said yes. Instead of sulking, he turned the results into another talking point. While Charles’s critics stay busy, so does he. With a net worth of $1.2 billion, he’s funding projects that sound straight out of a sci-fi novel—glow-in-the-dark plants, research to detect extraterrestrial life, and more. He has met with Argentine President Javier Milei more than once to discuss using blockchain in government systems. He’s also urged U.S. lawmakers to align crypto regulations with global standards, pointing to countries like Switzerland and Singapore as examples. He has more than one friend in Trump’s cabinet. “Crypto isn’t a Republican issue. It’s an American and global issue. Only by bringing everyone together can we get to the next level,” Charles said.

Analyst Highlights Bollinger Band Retest Mirroring Jan. 2024 Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-178k-target-in-sight-analyst-highlights-bollinger-band-retest-mirroring-jan-2024-rally/,"Bitcoin has been on a correction path since it reached a new all-time high of $108,135 on December 17. Notably, this correction has seen the leading cryptocurrency decline by about 10% up until the time of writing and even breaking below $93,000 very quickly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Above $10: Historical Data Shows How High DOGE Will Go This Bull Cycle This notable decline has seen Bitcoin retesting the Bollinger Bands, and technical analysis suggests a bounce from here to reach a price target around $178,000. Bitcoin Retests Monthly Upper Bollinger Band Bitcoin’s recent price correction has caught the eye of crypto analyst Tony Severino, who highlighted a critical retest of the monthly upper Bollinger Band. Sharing his insights on social media platform X, Severino emphasized the significance of this technical indicator, which measures market volatility and potential reversal points. According to him, this development mirrors a similar pattern observed in January 2024, which eventually led to a substantial rally after a similar retest. According to the daily candlestick chart shared by Tony Severino, the upper Bollinger Band is currently situated just above $96,000, which is around Bitcoin’s current price. This Bollinger Band retest suggests that Bitcoin might be entering a new phase of upward momentum after the recent corrections. Historical Echoes: January 2024’s 86% Rally Offers A Blueprint Severino’s analysis draws parallels between the current price movement and Bitcoin’s behavior earlier in 2024. He noted that in January 2024, a similar retest of the monthly upper Bollinger Band preceded an 86% rally in Bitcoin’s price. At that time, Bitcoin was trading near $46,000, following a strong price rally that was brought forward from late 2023. However, January saw a brief correction, with Bitcoin’s price dropping to $40,000 to test the upper Bollinger Band. This test acted as a launchpad for not only a continued rally but also pushed Bitcoin to break its then all-time high and surpass $70,000 in March for the first time in its history. If Bitcoin were to replicate this 86% rally at this point, it could soar to approximately $178,000, which Severino noted is aligning with the upper range of his target zone. In another analysis, the analyst predicted that Bitcoin could reach its market top as early as January 20, 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading $96,402, still hovering around the upper Bollinger Band. Interestingly, the leading cryptocurrency is currently down by 2.11% and 5.4% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. This pullback has led to the realization of over $5.72 billion in Bitcoin profits, which has added to the short-term selling pressure. The impact of this correction is evident in Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has fallen sharply from 69 on December 17 to its current reading of 45.

This is because the RSI level of 43 has acted as a significant support zone for Bitcoin since September. If this support holds, it could provide the foundation for Bitcoin’s move towards $178,000.

Table of Contents Move over XRP: XYZ targets 7,400% gains to steal the spotlight XRP Conclusion XRP has been making headlines with ambitious price targets, capturing the interest of crypto enthusiasts. Yet, an emerging altcoin boasting an astounding potential return of 7,400% is poised to steal the limelight. Could this under-the-radar cryptocurrency become the next major player, overshadowing XRP’s goals and seizing the market’s attention? You might also like: Cardano, Dogecoin, XRP, and XYZVerse: Bold 2025 bull run price predictions inside Move over XRP: XYZ targets 7,400% gains to steal the spotlight In a crypto market rife with contenders, XYZ stands apart. Its presale has already demonstrated its potential, with the token’s price leaping from $0.0001 at launch to $0.001 in just a few months — a staggering 1,000% surge. Now priced at $0.001333 in its current presale stage, XYZ is set to rise again to $0.002 in the next stage, climbing toward a projected $0.1 at launch. This trajectory marks a remarkable 7,400% potential increase, making XYZ a serious contender for the top spot in this altcoin season. Why XYZ could overshadow XRP More than just another token, XYZ embodies the spirit of sportsmanship and competition. As part of the XYZVerse ecosystem, it combines meme coin hype with the booming demand for sports-themed dApps, prediction markets, and sports betting. Its robust roadmap and high utility position it as a long-term player, not a flash-in-the-pan trend. While XRP garners attention with price speculation, XYZ delivers tangible progress: Presale Momentum: With rapid stage progress, XYZ has already shown its ability to attract a loyal following. First-Mover Advantage: As the first all-sports meme coin, it taps into a massive, underserved market. Rock-Solid Foundations: Audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for major CEX/DEX listings ensure a secure and credible investment. XRP’s $5 and $10 targets may turn heads, but XYZ offers something truly extraordinary — a chance to secure exponential returns while riding the wave of an altcoin movement. With its presale stages flying by and the final target of $0.1 in sight, XYZ is a rare opportunity for those who act fast. Don’t wait for XRP’s next move; seize the chance to invest in a token with real growth potential and a unique edge. XYZ is more than a meme coin; it’s a movement set to reshape the altcoin landscape. XRP Over the past six months, XRP has shown significant growth, with its price increasing by over 360%. In the last month, the price surged by approximately 105%, indicating strong upward momentum. However, the past week saw a slight dip of about 3%. Currently trading between $2.03 and $2.73, XRP is approaching its resistance level at $3.02. A break above this could propel it toward the next resistance at $3.73, representing a significant gain. On the downside, support levels at $1.61 and $0.9041 provide a safety net against declines. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.28, just below the 100-day SMA of $2.44, suggesting short-term bearishness. The Relative Strength Index is around 43, indicating the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0252, hinting at potential consolidation. Overall, XRP’s robust performance suggests potential for further growth, especially if it can surpass key resistance levels. Conclusion While XRP’s ambitious goals are impressive, XYZVerse’s 20,000% growth potential and unique sports-meme blend might steal the spotlight in the 2024 bull run.

As investors navigate this challenging landscape, it’s essential to examine the factors contributing to these declines and to identify any potential opportunities amidst the chaos. Biggest Losers in the Last 7 Days The biggest losers among altcoins over the past week were: • $WIF: With a loss of 34%, it thus becomes a prime example of why we should always be careful with altcoins in general.• $OP: Down by 32%, its continued decline — is the optimistically-themed Optimism in name only now? • $PEPE: Down 28% for the week, the meme coin that has been taking us all by storm — Pepe ($PEPE) — seems to have suffered a time-out together with all those other manias. • $RENDER: The render token Render ($RENDER) saw its value go down by 25%. This is another example of how even utility-driven coins can face setbacks. • $SOL: After rising to great heights, Solana ($SOL) is now 20% less than it was a week ago. Even the top-tier altcoins are struggling. These declines highlight the many problems that exist in the altcoin market — some contribute to it, others reflect wider economic trends. Half a dominion others believe the downturn began in part due to an exodus from stocks on profit-taking hopes. Will Altcoin Season Even Happen? Historically, Q4 — and December in particular — has always been a bountiful harvest time for those in cryptocurrency markets. But this year defies all the rules: altcoin markets seem to have lost momentum as they struggle for a footing. Therefore, when a seasonal rally fails to appear, worries quickly arise. People who have long awaited such time are now anxious to know, indeed wonder if ever there will be an altcoin season. However, there is cause for hope. Coins like Altura ($ALU) Project all carry the prospectus of a renaissance in Q1 of 2025 or thereafter. By using remarkable technology and carving out a unique place in the market, these coins may lead an about-face to current trends and open up opportunity for next-stage growth. They may yet be a beacon of optimism. Altura ($ALU): A Beacon of Stability Amidst the turbulence, Altura ($ALU) has emerged as one of the most stable and promising AI-integrated cryptocurrencies. Unlike many of its counterparts, Altura has managed to maintain relative stability, drawing the attention of savvy investors. What Makes Altura Stand Out? 1. Machine Learning: The Altura ecosystem makes extensive use of artificial intelligence, especially for its smart NFTs. Altura has already given use cases to their AI-infused NFTs that update based on user interaction and real-world data.2. Humongous Market Cap Potential: As a relatively small market cap that pales in comparison to the other AI and NFT-themed projects we cover, it is a great source of potential. This makes it a prime candidate for upside potential.3. Community and Developer Support: Altura's active developer community and loyal user base have enabled it to withstand market fluctuations, demonstrating its resilience. Bullish Outlook for Q1 2025 Now, if we take a glance at the future, Scripts are super optimistic over Altura ($ALU) for Q1 2025. If you take into account the fact that Altura's market cap is now under $100 million, this is a unique opportunity for a dramatic increase. If it matches its lofty vision, then it can realistically reach a 500M+, 1B+ market cap and 10x+ returns for early-stage investors. • Increasing Demand for AI-Powered NFTs: Altura’s novel application of AI to drive smart NFTs places it in position to capitalize on an emerging trend. The paradigm is shifting from static assets to dynamic, AI-driven tools, and Altura is right there at the forefront.• Strategic Partnerships and Ecosystem Expansion: Altura is actively pursuing strategic partnerships that contribute to its utility and promote ecosystem development. These partnerships will lead to more adoption and would further cement it as a leader within the AI and NFT sectors. Market Recovery Potential: As the broader cryptocurrency market recovers, Altura's unique value proposition and relatively low market cap can make it an enticing investment for those seeking high-growth opportunities. Analysts are already predicting that we could see the start of an early-phase bull run for Altura in Q1 of 2025, with increasing interest in AI teleportation in the broader blockchain arena. With innovative technology, community involvement, and scalability, Altura remains a top-tier project within the space. A low entry point with high potential growth makes it one of the hottest opportunities for 2025. Conclusion: Altura ($ALU) – A Stable Choice in Uncertain Times While the altcoin market struggles to regain its footing, Altura ($ALU) stands out as a beacon of stability and potential. Its innovative approach to AI and NFTs, combined with a supportive community and strategic vision, makes it a compelling investment for those looking ahead to Q1 2025 and beyond. Investors seeking opportunities in the crypto market should keep a close eye on Altura, as it continues to defy the broader market trends and position itself for an “insane rise” in the coming months.

Adam Back is among the names claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Quantum computers could theoretically break the cryptographic security that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, prompting concerns that BTC wallets could one day become vulnerable to hacking. Adam Back explained that Bitcoin is already “quantum-ready” thanks to Taproot, a technology implemented in Bitcoin in 2021. Taproot uses “leaf nodes” in its design that can hold placeholders for future advanced cryptographic technologies, including quantum-resistant (post-quantum or PQ) signatures. In simpler terms, Bitcoin’s current system is like a house built with extra empty rooms that can later be equipped with advanced security doors if needed. For now, these rooms are unused but ready for upgrades. Related News: El Salvador Announces New Bitcoin Step Despite IMF Warning Back cautioned that there should be no rush to enable quantum-resistant signature technology: The Threat is Decades Away: Quantum computing powerful enough to break Bitcoin's cryptography is still decades away from becoming a reality. Future Innovations: Cryptographic research is constantly advancing. When quantum computers become a real threat, more compact, efficient, and well-studied solutions for quantum-resistant signatures will likely become available. Bitcoin users can prepare for this without immediately enabling quantum-resistant cryptography. This includes: Future-proofing Wallets: Wallets can use new cryptographic formats compatible with future technologies while continuing to use the existing signature system (Schnorr signatures). Seamless Transition: If quantum computing becomes a real threat, Bitcoin can migrate to these quantum-resistant systems without major disruptions. These preparations should ease fears about quantum computing, Back says. In the possible scenario where quantum computing advances faster than expected, Bitcoin has a system in place to adapt. But that likely won’t happen for several decades, allowing researchers to develop and improve compact, efficient solutions in the meantime. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum’s price drops to below $3,400 amid scalability concerns Ethereum ‘s price has remained sluggish in responding to the bull market even though its recent uptick past $4,000. After surging to a striking distance of $5,000 in 2021, Ethereum’s price plummeted to lows of $1,000 but has recovered amid critical resistance at the $4,000 mark. Now, Ethereum’s price has been rejected above the $4,000 mark three times, and market watchers are less optimistic that the leading DeFi ecosystem could surge further to $5,000 – $6,00 during this bull run. Some of the obstacles that have hindered a rally on Ethereum’s price include Ethereum’s bloated network, which has registered skyrocketing network fees at peak congestion. With the advent of scalability solutions such as Cardano’s ADA, Ethereum’s price could experience further sluggish growth. What’s more, mass adoption by institutions will require a lot more liquidity to move Ethereum’s price.

Is it the technological innovation, its market resilience, or the return potential for investors? As blockchain technology evolves, projects like Qubetics ($TICS) , Polkadot ($DOT), and Near Protocol ($NEAR) have emerged as top contenders for delivering transformative value to both their ecosystems and their investors. But among them, which project offers the best coins for massive return potential in 2024? Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Convenience with Multichain Wallet Qubetics has quickly gained traction as a revolutionary blockchain project. Now in the 13th stage of its presale, Qubetics has sold over 367 million $TICS tokens, raising more than $7.5 million from 11,300+ holders. With its current price of $0.0342 per token , analysts predict extraordinary returns of up to 43,711.73% ROI if $TICS reaches $15 post-mainnet launch. An investment of $50,000 at this stage could potentially grow into over $21.8 million. A standout feature of Qubetics is its multichain wallet, a tool that exemplifies its commitment to solving real-world blockchain challenges. This wallet provides users with seamless access to multiple blockchain networks within a single interface, eliminating the complexity of managing assets across fragmented ecosystems. Consider a scenario where a business operates on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Traditionally, managing these assets would require separate wallets, creating inefficiency and security risks. With Qubetics’ multichain wallet, users can consolidate these operations into one platform, streamlining workflows and enhancing security. With such practical applications and a clear vision for the future, Qubetics positions itself as one of the best coins for massive return potential in 2024. Its unique features and exceptional growth prospects make it an unmissable opportunity for investors looking to capitalise on the blockchain revolution. Polkadot ($DOT): The Interoperability Powerhouse Polkadot is widely recognised as one of the most innovative blockchain projects, designed to address the need for interoperability across networks. Its unique architecture enables multiple blockchains, or “parachains,” to operate seamlessly while sharing security and governance features. This makes Polkadot a cornerstone for decentralised applications and cross-chain communication. Since its launch, Polkadot has established itself as a leader in the blockchain industry. $DOT, its native token, plays a critical role in governance, staking, and bonding for parachains. With an ever-expanding ecosystem, Polkadot has become the go-to choice for developers aiming to create scalable, interoperable applications.

This Viral New Meme Coin Presale Is the Next Big Move,https://thecoinrise.com/couldnt-buy-neiro-this-viral-new-meme-coin-presale-is-the-next-big-move/,"The world of meme coins has been a wild ride, hasn’t it? From Dogecoin’s humble beginnings to Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise, these quirky tokens have captured the imagination of millions. What started as internet humour has grown into a massive financial movement, proving the power of community and creativity. A new contender has entered the scene, poised to shake things up: BTFD Coin . With its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, referral program, and juicy staking rewards offering up to 90% APY, BTFD is rewriting the meme coin playbook. Meme coins aren’t just about the laughs anymore—they’re serious business. Over the years, these coins have evolved from mere jokes into powerful tools for community-driven wealth creation. Think about it: Dogecoin paved the way, Shiba Inu raised the stakes, and BTFD is pushing the envelope even further. With over $4.3 million raised in its presale and features that make it more than just another meme coin, BTFD is making waves. Its P2E game went live in beta during Stage 10, giving the community a sneak peek into what’s coming. Meanwhile, the staking and referral programs ensure that holding $BTFD is as rewarding as it is exciting. If you’re still sitting on the sidelines, wondering if this viral new meme coin presale is worth your time, let’s dive in and see how BTFD stacks up against Neiro, another standout in the meme coin universe. BTFD Coin: Turning Chaos Into Opportunity BTFD Coin isn’t just another name in the meme coin lineup; it’s a movement. With a rallying cry of “ buy the dip ’,” this coin invites investors to turn market downturns into wealth-building opportunities. Remember the economic crash of 1973? Inflation was through the roof, stocks tanked, and the financial world seemed freefall. However, smart investors like Warren Buffett saw the chaos as a chance to scoop up undervalued assets, and they came out on top. BTFD channels that same energy, encouraging its community to seize the moment and build their fortunes. The BTFD presale has been nothing short of phenomenal. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 12, priced at $0.00013. Early investors have already seen impressive returns, but the real excitement lies ahead. Analysts predict $BTFD will hit $0.0006 upon listing, a staggering 837.5% ROI for those who got in at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. Let’s break it down: if you had invested $25,000 at the Stage 7 price, you’d have secured 390,625,000 $BTFD coins. When the coin reaches $0.0006, your investment will balloon to $234,375. Not bad for riding the dip, right? BTFD’s P2E game, which launched its beta version in Stage 10, has already captured the community’s imagination. While rewards aren’t live yet, the gameplay hints at an engaging ecosystem that keeps users returning. Add in a referral program that lets you earn extra tokens by bringing in friends, plus staking rewards of up to 90% APY , and you’ve got a meme coin that delivers on every front. The Bulls Squad, a dedicated community of BTFD supporters, adds excitement, driving engagement and ensuring this coin’s momentum doesn’t slow down. Neiro: The Meme Coin With a Legacy Neiro has been making waves as one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year. Born out of the iconic Doge meme, it’s backed by the Own the Doge DAO, which acquired official IP rights from Atsuko Sato, the original owner of Kabosu (the Doge meme dog). This connection to the meme’s origin story has given Neiro a strong cultural foundation, and its value has skyrocketed. Neiro’s Ethereum-based token boasts a market cap of $663 million, while its Solana-based counterpart is valued at $5 million. These numbers reflect a growing community and solid market interest. However, it’s not all smooth sailing. Neiro faces legal challenges, including a dispute over trademark rights, which has caused some hesitation among potential investors. Still, its innovative approach to blending humour with blockchain technology makes it a compelling option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Neiro’s community-driven model is its strongest asset. Through voting and active participation, token holders have a say in the coin’s direction. This decentralised approach has helped build a loyal following, making it one of the standout meme coins of the year. While it doesn’t offer the same utility-packed features as BTFD, its cultural significance and established market presence make it a worthy contender in the meme coin space.

The charges stemmed from his actions between October 2019 and October 2022, during which he raised funds to assist female ISIS members in Syria. Guilty of Financing ISIS Operations In an official press release, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed that Chhipa’s efforts included financing the escape of women from prison camps and supporting ISIS fighters. He also collected funds through various online social media accounts, receiving electronic transfers, and physically gathering money by traveling long distances. The authorities revealed that Chhipa then converted the money into cryptocurrency, which was sent to Turkey and smuggled into Syria for use by ISIS. Chhipa’s primary accomplice was a British-born ISIS member in Syria who played a key role in the fund-raising efforts, including for terrorist activities. Over the course of the scheme, Chhipa sent over $185,000 in cryptocurrency to support ISIS operations. The jury convicted him on one charge of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group and four counts of providing such support. Chhipa now faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count. A sentencing hearing is set for May 5, 2025, where a federal district court judge will determine the sentence based on US Sentencing Guidelines and other legal considerations. Crypto’s Role in Terrorist Fundraising Many experts have flagged that ISIS has been using crypto for fundraising. TRM Labs’ report from last August revealed that pro-ISIS networks in countries such as Tajikistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have raised significant funds using crypto assets like Tether (USDT) on the Tron network. One such campaign, which operated for over a year, raised nearly $2 million in USDT for ISIS affiliates in Afghanistan. TRM Labs also traced over $517,000 in 2022 sent from an Indonesia-based platform to pro-ISIS accounts. However, it is also important to note that industry experts such as Chainalysis have previously clarified misconceptions regarding the use of cryptocurrency in terrorism financing. While entities like Hamas and Hezbollah use crypto for fundraising, these transactions represent a minor fraction of illicit crypto activities. Chainalysis stresses that terrorism financing remains a small part of overall illicit crypto transactions, with traditional methods such as financial institutions and shell companies being the primary sources of funding. The firm also pointed out that blockchain transparency makes it difficult for terrorists to hide transactions, as seen when Hamas ceased accepting Bitcoin donations.

Hines, a former college football player and 2022 Republican candidate for North Carolina’s 13th congressional district, steps into the role with the support he received from pro-crypto political action committees (PACs) during his campaign for Congress. While his political candidacy was unsuccessful, his new role signals Trump’s intent to advance crypto-related innovation and regulation. “In his new role, Bo will work with David Sacks to drive innovation and growth in the digital asset space while ensuring industry leaders have the resources they need to succeed,” Trump said. “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can thrive and continue to be a cornerstone of our Nation’s technological advancement.” Related News: Alleged Satoshi Nakamoto Candidate Responds to Claims that Quantum Computers Will Crack Bitcoin's Password! David Sacks, who Trump previously appointed to oversee crypto and artificial intelligence (AI) issues at the White House, will work with Hines in shaping the administration's vision for digital assets. Trump’s focus on digital assets comes amid a broad range of economic appointments. Earlier today, he appointed former Treasury Department official Stephen Miran as chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers. Miran, who has drawn attention for his stance on financial regulation, recently voiced his concerns on The Bitcoin Layer podcast, saying: “I think financial regulation is overly burdensome and prevents banks from lending as much as they want to into the economy. And I think sometimes that can really stifle innovation in areas like [the crypto economy].” *This is not investment advice.

The crypto community, including prominent crypto commentator Bitcoin Archive, has questioned the legitimacy of these reports. Meanwhile, some sources tout this claim as a sign of the UAE’s growing crypto influence. The $40 Billion Bitcoin Claim: Fact or Fiction? The claim that the UAE holds $40 billion in Bitcoin has raised eyebrows, especially as no credible sources have confirmed this. The Bitcoin Archive has expressed skepticism about the report, questioning the lack of supporting evidence. According to the Bitcoin Archive, a move of this magnitude would have made global headlines, given the UAE’s influence in the crypto space. He revealed that the original report by Bitcoinist lacked trustworthy sources. Upon further investigation, the Bitcoin Archive found no verification of such a purchase. He cast doubt on the authenticity of the $40 billion figure. UAE’s Crypto-Friendly Environment In recent years, the UAE has established itself as a global leader in the crypto space. Through strategic initiatives like the crypto center in Dubai, the country has created a thriving ecosystem for blockchain startups. These initiatives have made t he UAE a prime destination for crypto entrepreneurs and investors worldwide. The government’s forward-thinking approach to digital assets has helped attract billions of dollars in crypto investments, including a significant portion in Bitcoin. If accurate, the surge in Bitcoin holdings is aligned with the broader global bull market, which has seen many nations increase their crypto reserves. UAE’s Expanding Crypto Market While the $40 billion Bitcoin claim remains unproven, the UAE’s growing involvement in the crypto space is undeniable . Between 2023 and mid-2024, the country saw a massive influx of $34 billion into the crypto market. This marked a 42% increase from the previous year. This surge highlights the country’s growing role in the global crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin remains a major player in the UAE’s crypto landscape, holding 19% of the market share. However, stablecoins like Tether’s USDT dominate 51% of the market. Tether has plans to launch a dirham-backed token . This further shows the UAE’s commitment to digital assets and its vision of becoming a central hub for crypto innovation. By 2025, the number of crypto users in the UAE will reach 3.78 million. Additionally, a recent report revealed that 72% of UAE residents had already invested in Bitcoin by early 2024. Institutional investors and big funds play a significant role in this growth. These statistics show that the UAE is rapidly becoming a leader in crypto adoption.

As the market faces a bearish phase, certain meme coins are defying the odds, proving they’re more than just internet jokes. Among these, BTFD Coin (BTFD) has skyrocketed in popularity, with its presale exceeding $4.3 million in just over a month. Meanwhile, Memecoin (MEMECOIN) and Ponke (PONKE) are holding their ground, rallying their communities to weather the storm and come out stronger. Meme coins have evolved dramatically over the years. What started with Dogecoin as a playful experiment has transformed into a booming sector of the crypto world. These tokens now offer ecosystems with real utility, staking rewards, and innovative use cases. BTFD Coin is leading this charge with its P2E game, referral programme, staking opportunities, and the irresistible BIG50 bonus code, which allows investors to get in at an earlier presale price. If history has taught us anything, it’s that moments of economic uncertainty can create incredible opportunities. During the 1973 financial crash, savvy investors seized the chance to buy undervalued assets. Today, meme coins like BTFD Coin, Memecoin, and Ponke are providing that same chance for bold investors looking to secure significant returns . BTFD Coin: The Star of the Meme Coin Revival BTFD Coin is making waves for all the right reasons. Its presale performance has been nothing short of phenomenal, raising over $4.3 million and selling 57 billion coins to more than 6,300 holders. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, the coin is priced at $0.000064, but with the BIG50 bonus code, you can snag it at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064—a move that sets you up for an 837.5% ROI when the coin lists at $0.0006. BTFD isn’t just about hype; it’s built on a solid foundation of utility and community engagement. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game is a massive draw, attracting gamers and investors alike. Add in the referral programme and staking rewards, and you’ve got a meme coin that’s redefining what these tokens can do. Let’s put this into perspective. Say you invest $75,000 at the discounted Stage 7 price using the BIG50 bonus code. At $0.000064 per coin, you’d bag approximately 1.17 billion BTFD coins . When the presale ends and the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment would balloon to $702,000 . That’s the kind of return that turns heads. Getting in is simple. Visit the BTFD Presale Page , connect your wallet, enter the BIG50 bonus code , and lock in your discounted price. This isn’t just another presale; it’s your chance to be part of a project that’s shaking up the meme coin world. Memecoin: The Heart of the Meme Coin Culture Memecoin, often dubbed the “OG” of internet-inspired tokens, continues to prove its mettle in a volatile market. MEMECOIN is built on a philosophy of humour, community, and simplicity, making it a staple for investors who value grassroots initiatives. One of Memecoin’s biggest strengths is its community. Active social channels, meme contests, and charity initiatives have created a sense of belonging among holders. But MEMECOIN isn’t just about laughs. Its team has been quietly building features like staking pools and NFT integrations, giving the token real-world use cases that appeal to a broader audience. Despite the bearish market, Memecoin’s resilience is impressive. Analysts predict that its strong community backing will help it weather the storm and position it for significant growth when market sentiment turns bullish. For those who want to invest in a token that embodies the spirit of meme culture while offering potential returns, MEMECOIN remains a compelling choice. Imagine being part of a movement that started as a joke but grew into a legitimate asset class. That’s what MEMECOIN represents, and it’s why it continues to attract both new and seasoned investors. Ponke: Where Community Meets Purpose Ponke might not have the high-profile hype of its peers, but it more than makes up for it with a passionate community and a focus on meaningful impact. This meme coin is all about giving back, with fundraising events and charity drives at its core. If you’re looking for a token that balances fun with purpose, Ponke is the one to watch. What sets Ponke apart is its decentralised governance model. Every holder has a voice, ensuring that the project evolves in a way that reflects its community’s values. This approach has fostered a loyal following that’s willing to stick with the token through thick and thin. Ponke’s roadmap includes plans for NFT collaborations, staking options, and even a marketplace for meme-inspired goods. While it’s still early days, the token’s focus on combining humour with utility is winning over investors who want more than just another pump-and-dump coin. In a bearish market, Ponke’s grassroots approach is a breath of fresh air. It’s a reminder that meme coins can be about more than just making money; they can also create a sense of community and shared purpose. And for investors, that kind of authenticity can be a game-changer. How to Buy BTFD Coin with the BIG50 Discount If you’re ready to jump on the BTFD bandwagon, here’s how to get started.

Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain with Innovation and Accessibility Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in the cryptocurrency space. In its 13th presale stage, the project has already raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and gained a growing community of 11,300+ holders. Priced at $0.0342 per token in the 13th stage, Qubetics offers a lucrative opportunity for those looking to get in early. This phase will soon see a price increase of 10%, and analysts predict the $TICS token could reach as high as $1 after the presale ends, offering a 2820% return on investment. One of the core features that make Qubetics an exciting option among the best cryptos to invest in for long term growth is its focus on blockchain accessibility and interoperability. The platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. By utilising the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Qubetics ensures that developers can easily build decentralized applications (dApps) and integrate tokens across various platforms without a hitch. This interoperability is a game-changer, as it removes the silos that currently exist in the blockchain ecosystem and allows for greater scalability, security, and efficiency. But it’s not just the technology that makes Qubetics stand out. The platform is also fully cross-platform compatible , available on iOS, Android, and desktop, ensuring accessibility no matter where you are or what device you’re using. Plus, it’s compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making transactions smoother and more convenient . This will have a massive impact on businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Imagine being able to execute blockchain transactions on the go, without worrying about whether your device or wallet supports the transaction. For businesses, this means greater flexibility when paying or receiving payments in $TICS tokens, enabling them to reach a broader audience. Qubetics isn’t just about technology—it’s about making blockchain accessible to everyone. It’s bringing forward Web3 integration to create an all-in-one platform that bridges the gap between multiple ecosystems and drives greater adoption of blockchain technology. Qubetics’ network architecture further enhances this potential by building a Web3-aggregated chain, which unifies disparate networks into a single, interoperable platform. This is a crucial step in ensuring the seamless transfer of assets, data, and cross-chain transactions. The result? A platform that facilitates collaboration across ecosystems and enhances the scalability of decentralized technologies. With so much potential, Qubetics is certainly one of the best cryptos to invest in for long term growth. Avalanche: Dominating the Blockchain Landscape Avalanche has long been considered one of the best cryptos to invest in for the long term, and for good reason. The blockchain platform has made waves with its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. Avalanche introduced a revolutionary consensus mechanism that allows it to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), something Bitcoin and Ethereum can only dream of. This scalability has made it a favourite among DeFi (Decentralised Finance) developers and institutions looking for efficient and secure blockchain solutions. In recent years, Avalanche has also gained traction as a go-to alternative investment. It’s no surprise that institutional investors have shown a keen interest in this blockchain, as it offers both security and scalability—two critical factors for any financial institution looking to tap into the crypto market. With its unique architecture and focus on creating subnets (custom blockchains), Avalanche is poised to continue expanding its ecosystem and establishing itself as a key player in the global crypto market. Avalanche’s market position is further cemented by its continuous growth in total value locked (TVL) across decentralised applications. This metric shows how much capital is being deployed on Avalanche’s network, and it’s been steadily increasing, indicating that more and more users are seeing the value in Avalanche’s offerings. Analysts predict that Avalanche’s TVL could reach new heights, further strengthening its position as a top-tier blockchain. For those looking to diversify their crypto investments, Avalanche represents an excellent alternative to traditional stocks and bonds. With its high scalability and low transaction costs, it’s well-positioned to serve the growing demand for decentralized applications. Whether you’re a DeFi enthusiast, an investor looking for long-term growth, or a developer wanting to build on a highly efficient blockchain, Avalanche is one to watch. Aptos: The New Kid on the Blockchain Block Aptos has been making waves since its mainnet launch in 2023, positioning itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in for the long term. With its advanced, high-performance blockchain, Aptos aims to provide a scalable and secure platform for decentralized applications. The project was created by former Meta (Facebook) employees, which gives it a unique edge. Aptos combines years of experience in building scalable infrastructure with cutting-edge technology, making it one of the most promising blockchains in the space. Aptos’ most notable feature is its Move programming language, which is designed to make smart contract development more secure and efficient. Move allows for better execution of transactions and improves the overall performance of decentralized applications. Developers who are looking for an alternative to Ethereum’s Solidity will find Aptos’ Move language particularly attractive due to its focus on safety and flexibility. The Aptos blockchain has already gained traction in the DeFi sector, where its scalability and low fees have attracted both developers and investors. Its fast finality and ability to process thousands of transactions per second have made it a favourite for projects that require high throughput. As the demand for blockchain solutions continues to grow, Aptos is well-positioned to take advantage of the increasing appetite for decentralized finance, gaming, and other blockchain applications. Looking at its market performance, Aptos is a strong contender in the race for long-term investment opportunities. Its unique value proposition, coupled with the backing of industry veterans, makes it one of the most exciting projects to keep an eye on. As more users adopt Aptos and its ecosystem continues to grow, the token’s value is expected to rise, making it a smart choice for investors looking for alternative assets in the crypto space. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto Investment So, which of these projects should you invest in for the long term? While Avalanche and Aptos offer proven track records and established market positions, Qubetics is the one to watch in the coming years. With its focus on interoperability, cross-platform compatibility, and a robust Web3 ecosystem, Qubetics has the potential to revolutionise how blockchain networks communicate with one another. The presale is a golden opportunity for early investors, and with analysts predicting astronomical returns, it’s hard to ignore the growth potential of $TICS. If you’re serious about diversifying your portfolio and gaining exposure to the future of blockchain technology, investing in Qubetics presale could be your ticket to massive returns. Avalanche and Aptos are solid picks, but Qubetics represents a new frontier in blockchain development. Whether you’re looking for immediate gains or long-term growth, now’s the time to act. So, what are you waiting for? Get in on the action and invest in the best cryptos to invest in for the long term today!

The preference of the 18 to 24-year-old age group has evolved as they appreciate the convenience of digital tools but value the trust and personalization that comes with in-person banking. Their drive to in-person banking is the advice they get from the bank and a sense of engagement. The approach has made the bank branches a centre for advice rather than transaction spots. The blend of physical and digital , “Phygital” approach might bring back life to bank branches in 2025. The World Economic Forum advises on how to cement the new order: To build lasting relationships with Gen Zers, however, banks need to combine their physical presence with a competitive, exciting digital offering. Banks must also provide services that satisfy Gen Z’s demand for convenience, choice, value, sustainability, and hyper-personalization. ~ World Economic Forum Modern Banks are customizing services to fit clients’ needs Modern branches customize services extensively. Most are transforming into financial experience hubs. They drive tech-enabled consultations like video conferencing while also offering physical education workshops. These steps ensure that both demands are met, with room for the human element to guide one in making difficult financial decisions like a mortgage or wealth management. Gen Zers appreciate the digital world but also recognize that physical spaces are integral in fostering trust. The deeper customer relations emanating from brick-and-mortar banking are a great motivation for the young generation. Banks also take commendable steps to ensure they provide relevant services to Gen Zers. With the pattern, it is not easy to wish away physical banking any time soon. Is Gen Zer’s physical banking desire a threat to crypto? Gen Zers are drawn to physical banking for various reasons, but the convenience of accessing safety boxes is a unique one. Besides, it’s easier to process documents while present physically, which saves time. They also get a lot of free advice there. The desire for physical banking does not negate their drive for cryptocurrency, which is digital money. A survey done in the US supports the claim that Gen Zers embrace crypto more than any other group. Although the report says more than 50% of America’s population recognizes that cash is king, different demographics have different trends. Digital wallets and contactless payments are the hallmarks associated with young generations, including the Gen Zers.

He will serve as the council’s Executive Director, working alongside Trump’s ‘Crypto Czar,’ David Sacks. The goal is to cement America’s dominance in blockchain and digital assets while driving innovation in a sector that Trump says will be a “cornerstone of our nation’s technological advancement.” “I am pleased to announce the brilliant team that will be working in conjunction with our White House A.I. & Crypto Czar, David O. Sacks,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “Together, we will unleash scientific breakthroughs, ensure America’s technological dominance, and usher in a Golden Age of American Innovation!” Bo Hines: Trump’s choice to lead the Crypto Council Bo’ appointment has raised eyebrows, but Trump seems confident in his decision. Bo, who played football at Yale before earning his law degree from Wake Forest, brings a unique background to the role. In 2022, he ran as a Republican for North Carolina’s 13th congressional district but lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel. While Bo’ crypto credentials aren’t public, Trump has made it clear that his trust in Bo stems from his potential to deliver results in this high-stakes role. Meanwhile, Sacks has stood proud in his love for crypto. He first invested in Bitcoin literally two years after it was invented. “Bo will work with David to foster innovation and growth in the digital assets space,” Trump said. “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can flourish.” The council’s work will also align with Trump’s broader tech ambitions, which include advancements in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies. A star-studded tech lineup Michael J.K. Kratsios has been tapped as the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and will serve as an Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. She’s gonna be part of the Council too. Kratsios is a Princeton graduate and Stanford Fellow, and he is no stranger to Washington. During Trump’s first term, he served as the United States Chief Technology Officer, a position unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Later, he took on the role of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, where he earned the Department of Defense’s Distinguished Public Service Medal. Another member is Dr. Lynne Parker, who will join the administration as Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology (PCAST) and Counselor to the OSTP Director. Parker previously led the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from MIT and has been instrumental in shaping U.S. AI policy. Trump emphasized the importance of PCAST, saying it will bring together “America’s most distinguished minds in science and technology.” David Sacks will also chair PCAST, doubling his responsibilities as a central figure in Trump’s tech agenda. Next is Sriram Krishnan, a former Microsoft engineer and founding member of Windows Azure, will serve as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence. Working closely with Sacks and Parker, Krishnan will help coordinate AI policy across the government. The crypto market’s mixed reaction The announcement comes during a turbulent time for the crypto market. Bitcoin is on track for its first weekly decline since Trump won the election victory. It has dropped over 7% this week, sitting around $95,000 as of press time, down from its record high of $108,000 on December 17. Ether and Dogecoin have seen steeper declines, with a wider crypto market gauge falling by 10%. Analysts point to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone and also its dismissal of Bitcoin as a major factor. Despite this, Trump’s genuine pro-crypto stance has kept the market incredibly optimistic in the long-term. Another one of the president’s key priorities is extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is set to expire in 2025. “We must act to ensure that the tax cuts I implemented continue to benefit American families and businesses,” Trump said today. He’s also proposed eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, introducing tax deductions for car loans on American-made vehicles, and reducing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for U.S. manufacturers. Trump is also targeting clean energy tax incentives established under the Biden administration, which he argues have led to higher costs for consumers. “We cannot allow these subsidies to distort our energy market,” he said. He has proposed eliminating “double taxation” for Americans living abroad, simplifying their tax obligations and ensuring they aren’t penalized for their global ties.

The comments came from the country’s Deputy Minister of Energy Denis Moroz. The Deputy Minister said that Minsk is now “meeting with” crypto mining “investors.” Per BelTA , Moroz said that the government is holding “consultation” sessions with unnamed parties. Mining firms are also “analyzing” possible sites for new “farms” in Belarus. Belarus Courting Crypto Miners? Government officials have noted that crypto miners are already consuming 120 MW of electricity. Moroz said: “Crypto mining is a promising sector, and it has been given a new lease of life in Belarus.” Denis Moroz, Belarus’ Deputy Minister of Energy. (Source: Oblgas/YouTube) Moroz added that the Ministry of Energy only wants to work with players who are “interested in working long-term” in “the Belarusian energy system.” The Deputy Minister also insisted that incoming crypto miners should also help “create the necessary infrastructure” to help Minsk foster the size of its crypto mining capacity. “We see very big prospects. We have received many requests. I think that we will see new projects launch in the near future.” Denis Moroz, Belarus’ Deputy Minister of Energy Nuclear Power Bonus Moroz added that “until recently,” it has been impossible to understand which power sources miners using were to power their grids. While Belarus has sizeable renewable power generation operations, most of its energy mix has traditionally come from imported gas. However, the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as the Astravets Nuclear Power Plant)’s first unit came online in June 2021. The Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant. (Source: DBatura) Minsk got a fresh inflow of power when a second unit entered commercial operation in November 2023. And, Moroz, said, this had now “created conditions” whereby Belarusian officials can now offer “incentive tariffs” to attract “crypto miners to the country.” The new power plant is fitted with two VVER-1200 reactors, both built using the Russian AES-2006 design. Its total capacity is 2400 MW, officials claim.

The Deputy Minister added that these “new tariffs for crypto miners” are “linked to consumption volumes.” Moroz said that “the more electricity miners consumed, the lower the rates they would have to pay.” Potential customers could include a number of bigger Russian players, who are already looking beyond traditional hotspots like Siberia.

He's worrying about the wrong threat, says @mihirssharma https://t.co/C4ZefV0ky4 via @opinion — Bloomberg (@business) December 16, 2024 Siberian power providers have complained that crypto mining puts an unacceptable strain on their power grids in the winter months. Russian authorities have responded by issuing temporary bans on crypto mining in the winter months in many Siberian regions until 2031. In recent months, BitRiver, the biggest Russian crypto mining firm of all, has unveiled plans to team up with the Russian government in a bid to build crypto mining centers in BRICS states . Belarus announced in mid-November that it has officially been granted BRICS “partner country” status. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko this year said he wants to go a step further. The veteran leader says he hopes to secure full BRICS membership in the near future.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 23:41:10

Dogecoin kicked things off, and Shiba Inu followed with its explosive rise, proving that meme coins can deliver jaw-dropping returns. Today, a new crop of meme coins is making waves. Among them, BTFD Coin is stealing the spotlight thanks to its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, generous staking rewards, and a referral program that’s making early investors smile. If you’re wondering about the best new meme coins to buy this month , we’ve got you covered with a deep dive into BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Notcoin. With the BIG50 bonus code, you can lock in the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000064 and maximise your gains. It’s a deal that’s too good to pass up—especially when you see the explosive potential of BTFD Coin’s presale. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Raising the Bar Let’s cut to the chase— BTFD Coin isn’t your average meme token. It’s a bold, feature-packed project built for those who want more than laughs from their investments. If you’ve ever heard the saying “buy the dip,” that’s exactly what BTFD Coin encourages—seizing opportunity during market chaos. And let’s not forget, the coin’s presale is nothing short of legendary. The presale kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin and has now surged to $0.00013 in Stage 12—that’s an 837.5% ROI. Over $4.3M has been raised, with more than 57 billion coins sold to over 6,300 holders. The best part? Investors who use the BIG50 bonus code can still lock in the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000064. This bonus alone is a game-changer, letting savvy buyers maximise their potential gains. Now, here’s where BTFD Coin really shines. Its beta P2E game went live in Stage 10 of the presale. While rewards aren’t available during the beta phase, players are raving about the experience. The full launch is expected to offer lucrative incentives, making it a win-win for gamers and investors alike. What about staking? BTFD offers a jaw-dropping 90% APY. Staking went live on December 2, allowing holders to earn passive income while holding their tokens. Add to that the Bulls Squad—an exclusive community of top investors—and the referral program that rewards users for bringing in new buyers, and you’ve got a coin that’s built for success. Imagine this: You invest $40,000 at the Stage 12 price of $0.00013 per coin. That nets you over 307 million tokens. When BTFD hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006, your investment will skyrocket to $184,200. That’s the kind of return that turns heads and changes lives. BTFD’s success story is even more remarkable when you think about the global economy. Back in 1973, the world experienced a major financial crash, but those who bought the dips emerged victorious. BTFD Coin is a modern-day opportunity to capitalise on chaos. Head over to the BTFD presale page, connect your wallet, and don’t forget to enter the BIG50 code for a sweet discount. Neiro: The AI-Powered Meme Coin Next up, we’ve got Neiro, a meme coin with an AI twist. Unlike traditional meme tokens that rely solely on community hype, Neiro uses artificial intelligence to add real value. Its standout feature is an AI-powered trading bot that helps users optimize their investments. This isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a legitimate tool gaining popularity among both crypto enthusiasts and casual investors. Neiro’s presale performance has been strong, with significant funds raised so far. The coin is priced at $0.00009, and analysts predict it could reach $0.0005 after launch. While its return on investment potential might not be as dramatic as some other coins, Neiro’s steady growth and innovative features make it an attractive option for those looking for something different in the meme coin market. The community behind Neiro is another key strength. Its Telegram group is active, offering regular updates, AMA sessions, and giveaways. Neiro’s developers have also hinted at potential partnerships with major crypto platforms, which could further elevate its visibility and value. However, Neiro does come with some risks. The integration of AI adds complexity to the project. While it offers additional utility, it might not appeal to those who prefer a simpler, more straightforward investment. But for those open to exploring the intersection of AI and crypto, Neiro presents an intriguing option. Notcoin: The Meme Coin for Minimalists Finally, let’s talk about Notcoin. Its slogan, “It’s not a coin, it’s a movement,” perfectly captures its essence. Notcoin is a satirical take on meme coins, designed to highlight the absurdity of crypto while still offering real value. Its simple, stripped-down approach resonates with minimalists who appreciate its no-frills, no-nonsense vibe. What sets Notcoin apart is its anti-hype strategy. Unlike other coins that rely on flashy marketing and bold promises, Notcoin stays grounded. Its presale performance reflects a steady and modest start, appealing to those who see it as a long-term hold. A standout feature of Notcoin is its “Burn the Hype” initiative. With every transaction, a small percentage of tokens are burned, reducing supply and gradually increasing scarcity. This deflationary model has proven effective in enhancing token value over time. However, Notcoin’s minimalist and ironic approach might not be for everyone. Those seeking excitement, flashy features, or high-stakes drama may find it underwhelming. But for investors who value subtlety, irony, and a slow-and-steady strategy, Notcoin is a unique choice among the latest meme coins to consider this month. How to Buy BTFD Coin with the BIG50 Discount Buying BTFD Coin is simple, and using the BIG50 discount code makes it even better. Start by visiting the official BTFD presale page. Once there, click on “Connect Wallet” and choose your preferred wallet, such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or any other supported option. After connecting your wallet, look for the bonus code field and enter BIG50 to unlock the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000064 per coin. Next, decide how many BTFD coins you want to buy, input the amount, and review the final price. When everything looks good, click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction through your wallet. By using the BIG50 code, you’re not just saving money—you’re also taking advantage of a potentially lucrative opportunity . With the presale already raising over $4.3 million, now is the perfect time to make your move! Bottom Lines Whether you’re into the high-octane world of BTFD Coin, the AI-driven innovation of Neiro, or the minimalist charm of Notcoin, there’s no shortage of exciting opportunities in the meme coin space. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, catering to different investor preferences. But let’s be real—BTFD Coin stands out as the clear frontrunner. Its P2E game, 90% APY staking rewards, and explosive presale performance make it a must-have for anyone looking to turn a profit in 2024. Don’t miss your chance to join the BTFD Coin presale now at a discounted price by using the BIG50 code. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin presale. Connect your wallet, secure your tokens, and watch your investment grow. The clock’s ticking—don’t wait too long to dive in.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 00:44:00

Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 63,400 followers that “altcoin season,” which they say began in late November, could come to an abrupt end after alts witnessed deep pullbacks over the last seven days. According to the Glassnode co-founders, traders and investors will likely have a risk-off approach on altcoins unless Bitcoin recovers a key psychological price point. “Is This the End of Altcoin Season? Bitcoin dominance is surging after dipping below $100,000, while altcoins are losing critical supports. Dominance has risen and resumed its upward trend, signaling a stronger BTC environment. If BTC stabilizes above $100,00, we might see a pump in altcoins now in accumulation zones. Until then, Bitcoin appears poised to lead, leaving altcoins lagging behind.” Source: Negentropic/X The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart tracks how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC. In the current state of the market, a surging BTC.D suggests that altcoins are losing value faster than Bitcoin. At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 59%. Looking at Bitcoin itself, the Glassnode executives say long-term Bitcoin holders are massively unloading their holdings as other investor cohorts pick up the slack. “The Board Keeps Shifting. As BTC continues flowing out of exchanges during this dip, long-term holders are exiting forcefully, while short-term holders step in without hesitation. Whales quietly accumulate, miners remain neutral, and selling pressure has merely reshuffled the board. New hands are absorbing the sales.” Source: Negentropic/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $97,246.

Shiba Inu Whale Activity Rises & Polkadot Price Outlook Looks Positive,https://nulltx.com/final-2-days-of-blockdags-1m-giveaway-shiba-inu-whale-activity-rises-polkadot-price-outlook-looks-positive/,"People generally respond quickly to shifts in the crypto market, either by capitalizing on lower prices or by keeping up with new trends. This quick reaction is shown in the recent increase in Shiba Inu whale activity, with a significant movement of 2.79 trillion SHIB tokens valued at $76.48 million. Similarly, the Polkadot price outlook appears positive, with predictions of an increase to $30 following a breakout from a long-term downtrend. In this context, BlockDAG’s nearly concluded $1 million giveaway is gaining traction, providing an attractive chance for BlockDAG (BDAG) holders. By possessing $100 worth of BDAG, 50 fortunate individuals will win $20,000 each. This event is contributing to the success of BlockDAG’s $170.5 million presale, positioning it among the key crypto coins to watch currently. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Escalates with 2.79T SHIB Transferred Recent figures show a spike in Shiba Inu whale activity, with 2.79 trillion SHIB tokens moved, totaling $76.48 million. This represents a 41.39% rise in substantial transactions, suggesting a heightened interest from significant holders. Despite this increase, the price of SHIB is still struggling, decreasing by 3.49% to $0.00002736 over the last day. The trading volume has also seen a reduction of 18.25%, indicating a drop in overall market participation. Moreover, the token faces hurdles in surpassing a critical resistance level at $0.00003, crucial for any potential price recovery. Without a consistent positive outlook or broader market support, SHIB may face continued challenges. For now, it remains a crypto coin to watch, as its recovery hinges on overcoming these obstacles. Polkadot Price Outlook: Analysts Forecast $30 Polkadot is showing signs of recovery, with forecasts suggesting a possible rise to $30 after emerging from a prolonged bearish phase. This optimistic view follows a 150% surge from a price range of $4–$5, fueled by robust accumulation through its downturn. Yet, challenges remain. The current price is encountering resistance near the $9 mark, and failing to break through this barrier could restrict further advances. Market volatility also poses a risk to maintaining recent gains, casting uncertainty on continued growth. Despite these concerns, the Polkadot price outlook is still tentatively hopeful, with signs of stability as it tests its breakout zone. Final Days to Win Big with BlockDAG’s $1M Event BlockDAG is turning heads in the cryptocurrency market with its $1 million giveaway , where 50 lucky people could each win $20,000. To be eligible, one needs to own at least $100 worth of BDAG. The stakes are higher as participants can increase their chances by engaging in activities like referring friends and promoting the event on social media. With only three days remaining, time is quickly running out to take part in this opportunity. The event has also sparked a lot of interest in BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, which has already gathered a formidable $170.5 million, making it a hot topic in the crypto community. The price of BDAG has skyrocketed by 2240%, starting at $0.001 and reaching $0.0234 in the latest release, batch 26. This sharp increase has drawn significant attention, further enhancing the presale’s success. As the giveaway nears its end, more people are getting involved, seeing the potential for substantial rewards and the rising value of BDAG. With the presale moving swiftly and the $1 million prize drawing attention, BlockDAG’s presence in the market continues to grow. For those interested in joining and possibly winning part of this grand prize, now is the ideal time, especially with BDAG still being quite affordable. However, this opportunity might not last as the current batch is almost sold out, and the next batch will likely see a price hike. Key Crypto Coins to Keep an Eye On With Shiba Inu whale activity intensifying, marked by 2.79 trillion tokens being moved, and the Polkadot price outlook possibly climbing to $30, the crypto market is showing interesting shifts. Yet, BlockDAG stands out with its $1 million giveaway and rapid price increase. This giveaway is a chance for 50 individuals to win $20,000 each by simply holding $100 in BDAG, contributing to both the growth of its presale and increased market interest. With over $170.5 million raised and a remarkable 2240% increase in price, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the top crypto coins to watch now.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 01:40:00

As new technologies and utilities redefine the blockchain landscape, projects like Qubetics, AAVE, and SUI are making waves. Qubetics is rewriting the rules of blockchain innovation, particularly with its $7.5 million presale and groundbreaking features. Meanwhile, AAVE is strengthening its position as a DeFi powerhouse with its recent price surge and ecosystem developments. At the same time, SUI is capturing attention by integrating Bitcoin functionality into its network, enhancing its appeal to developers and investors alike. With each project bringing something unique to the table, let’s explore why they’re the best altcoins to invest in now. Qubetics: Driving Innovation in Blockchain Technology Qubetics is a blockchain ecosystem designed to simplify and expand blockchain adoption. By tackling critical challenges like scalability, interoperability, and asset tokenisation, Qubetics is creating a comprehensive platform for businesses, developers, and everyday users. The $7M Presale Success The numbers speak for themselves. Currently in its 13th stage, the Qubetics presale has raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and on boarded over 11,300 holders. At $0.0342 per token, there’s a limited window to invest before the next 10% price hike this weekend. Analysts are optimistic about $TICS’ trajectory, predicting a price of $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 630% ROI. Post-presale, the token is expected to hit $1, representing a 2,820% ROI, with projections of $15 after the mainnet launch—a jaw-dropping 43,711% ROI. For a $7,000 investment, this means potential returns of $50,732 at $0.25, $204,800 at $1, and a life-changing $3,072,000 at $15. The Power of QubeQode IDE The QubeQode IDE is a standout feature that simplifies blockchain development. Traditionally, creating smart contracts or decentralised applications required extensive programming skills. With QubeQode, developers of all levels can easily create, deploy, and manage their blockchain projects. Imagine a fintech startup automating cross-border payments or an artist tokenising their digital art collection—both without hiring a team of blockchain developers. QubeQode IDE is removing barriers and enabling more industries to embrace blockchain technology. Multi-Chain Wallet: Simplifying Digital Asset Management Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet is another game-changer. This feature allows users to manage multiple cryptocurrencies across different blockchains seamlessly. For businesses, this eliminates the inefficiencies of juggling various wallets and platforms. A freelancer working with global clients could invoice Ethereum, Bitcoin, or stablecoins, all while maintaining one central wallet. This innovation not only makes digital asset management simpler but also more secure and user-friendly, appealing to both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and new users. Real World Asset Tokenisation Tokenising real-world assets is at the heart of Qubetics’ vision. By converting tangible assets like real estate, intellectual property, or commodities into digital tokens, Qubetics is opening up new investment opportunities and improving liquidity. Consider a real estate developer looking to raise funds by tokenising a luxury apartment complex. Investors from around the world can now own fractional shares, enabling small-scale investors to participate in markets traditionally reserved for the wealthy. Qubetics is not just making investment more inclusive; it’s revolutionising asset ownership. AAVE: The DeFi Giant Nears $400 AAVE has long been a cornerstone of decentralised finance (DeFi), offering users a platform to lend, borrow, and earn interest on digital assets. Its adaptability and continuous innovation make it a mainstay in the crypto ecosystem. Recently, AAVE’s price has surged to nearly $400, representing a 420% increase from its April low. This bullish trend is supported by a rise in active addresses and strong on-chain metrics, reflecting heightened interest in the protocol. Beyond its price performance, AAVE’s utility in DeFi is unparalleled. Developers are leveraging AAVE’s flash loans for complex financial transactions, while users benefit from its flexible lending and borrowing options. As AAVE continues to evolve, it remains one of the best altcoins to invest in now. SUI: Bridging Bitcoin and DeFi SUI is quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with in the crypto world. Its recent integration of SatLayer brings Bitcoin functionality to the SUI network, allowing developers to secure decentralised applications with Bitcoin. The SUI ecosystem is thriving, with decentralised exchange volume exceeding $466 million in a single day. While a recent network outage temporarily affected its performance, SUI’s market cap has climbed to $2.73 billion, making it the 55th-largest cryptocurrency. By bridging the gap between Bitcoin and modern blockchain applications, SUI is positioning itself as one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Its focus on innovation and user engagement ensures its long-term relevance in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Take Away AAVE and SUI are undoubtedly impressive, each excelling in their respective niches. AAVE’s dominance in DeFi and SUI’s bold integration of Bitcoin functionality make them essential components of a diversified crypto portfolio. However, Qubetics is the project redefining what blockchain technology can achieve. With its $7 million presale success, innovative features like the Multi-Chain Wallet, and groundbreaking focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation, Qubetics is setting a new standard for the industry. The opportunity is now. Visit Qubetics’ presale page to secure your $TICS tokens before the price hike. As one of the best altcoins to invest in now, Qubetics isn’t just a cryptocurrency—it’s the future of blockchain innovation.

While seasoned investors are locking in gains, newcomers are looking for projects with explosive potential. The market is teeming with opportunities, and three projects stand out for their innovation, utility, and investment potential: Qubetics, Algorand, and SEI. Qubetics, a rising star in the blockchain world, is rewriting the rules of crypto presales with its $7 million success. Meanwhile, Algorand is scaling new heights with its robust blockchain architecture, and SEI is turning heads with its meteoric rise in market value. Each project offers a unique value proposition, making them some of the best altcoins to invest in December 2024. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is not just a blockchain platform; it’s an innovation powerhouse aimed at simplifying blockchain adoption for developers and businesses. With its user-friendly tools like the QubeQode IDE, Qubetics is removing the complexity of blockchain development and making it accessible to everyone. Qubetics is a ground-breaking Layer 1, Web3 aggregated blockchain. The Qubetics presale , now in its 13th stage, has already raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and attracted over 11,300 token holders. At $0.0342 per token, investors have limited time before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. Analysts are optimistic, predicting $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 630% ROI. Post-presale, forecasts suggest the token could hit $1 for a 2,820% ROI, with the potential to soar to $15 after the mainnet launch—a staggering 43,711% ROI. If you invested $6,000 today, your returns could grow to $43,841 at $0.25, $175,365 at $1, and an incredible $2,630,475 at $15. The QubeQode IDE is one of Qubetics’ standout features . This integrated development environment allows businesses and developers to create smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) without extensive coding expertise. Imagine a small business automating supply chain payments or a legal firm developing tamper-proof contracts—all without hiring expensive blockchain developers. The QubeQode IDE is democratising blockchain technology, making it one of the best altcoins to invest in December 2024. Algorand: A Blockchain for the Future Algorand has solidified its position as one of the most scalable and secure Layer-1 blockchains. Known for its innovative Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, Algorand offers unparalleled speed, security, and decentralisation. Its ecosystem supports everything from DeFi platforms to tokenised assets, making it a versatile player in the crypto space. Recently, Algorand has experienced a significant price surge, reaching levels not seen in over two years. This growth is underpinned by robust on-chain metrics, including increased Open Interest (OI) and Total Value Locked (TVL), reflecting strong investor confidence. Algorand’s focus on providing enterprise-grade solutions has attracted partnerships and use cases across various industries, from finance to supply chain management. Imagine a financial institution using Algorand to settle cross-border payments in seconds or a healthcare provider ensuring patient data security with blockchain-backed systems. Algorand’s versatility and reliability make it a go-to option for businesses and developers, earning it a spot as one of the best altcoins to invest in December 2024. SEI: The New Contender on the Block SEI is making waves as one of the fastest-growing altcoins in the market. With its focus on providing a decentralised and scalable ecosystem, SEI is quickly climbing the ranks of notable cryptocurrencies. Its recent performance, including a doubling of value in November, showcases its potential to deliver massive returns. SEI’s market capitalisation has reached approximately $2.73 billion, making it the 55th-largest cryptocurrency. Analysts believe SEI could hit the $1 mark in 2024, especially as the altcoin market continues to rise. Its growth trajectory is bolstered by increasing adoption and a supportive community, making it an attractive investment option. SEI’s use cases range from decentralised trading platforms to scalable dApps, catering to both retail and institutional users. For example, a decentralised exchange built on SEI could offer lightning-fast transaction speeds and reduced fees, appealing to traders worldwide. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Algorand and SEI are undoubtedly strong contenders in the cryptocurrency market, each excelling in their respective niches. Algorand’s focus on scalability and enterprise solutions makes it a cornerstone for blockchain innovation, while SEI’s rapid ascent showcases its potential to disrupt the market. However, Qubetics is the project that truly stands out. Its $7 million presale, combined with tools like the QubeQode IDE and groundbreaking Real World Asset Tokenisation, positions it as a leader in blockchain innovation. Whether you’re a developer, a business owner, or an investor, Qubetics offers something for everyone. The time to act is now.

Why Qubetics Is December 2024’s Most Promising Crypto Investment,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-thetas-early-days-why-qubetics-is-december-2024s-most-promising-crypto-investment/,"Ever kick yourself for not jumping on Theta’s bandwagon back in the day?

Qubetics is stepping up to tackle these issues head-on. With its multi-chain wallet and real-world payment integrations, it’s aiming to make crypto as easy to use as your everyday cash. Imagine paying for your morning coffee with crypto without breaking a sweat. That’s the kind of real-world problem Qubetics is looking to solve.

Theta’s Journey from ICO to Today Theta’s story is one for the books. Back in January 2018, it launched its ICO with tokens priced at a mere $0.15. Fast forward to its peak on April 16, 2021, and Theta hit an all-time high of $15.72. That’s a jaw-dropping increase, turning a modest investment into a small fortune. citeturn0search8 Today, Theta is trading at around $2.28, which, despite being below its peak, still represents a significant gain from its ICO days. Early investors who held onto their tokens have seen substantial returns, showcasing the potential rewards of getting in on the ground floor of a promising project. Theta’s success wasn’t just about luck; it tapped into the booming demand for decentralized video streaming, offering a solution that resonated with both users and investors. Its journey from a $0.15 ICO to a multi-dollar valuation underscores the impact that innovative blockchain projects can have in the market.

Enter aelf , an AI-enhanced layer 1 blockchain with a knack for solving complex problems with simplicity. Their latest development, aevatar Intelligence , aims to turn AI development on its head. aevatar Intelligence Imagine creating intelligent AI agents—capable of functioning across platforms and blockchains—without writing a single line of code. That’s the promise of aevatar intelligence, a cloud-native AI agent framework built for everyone, from beginners to seasoned developers. And here’s the kicker: it will be open-source. The Vision Behind aevatar Intelligence At the heart of aevatar intelligence lies aelf’s commitment to breaking down barriers. AI and blockchain technology are often seen as two separate realms, each with its own steep learning curve. But aelf believes the magic happens when you bring the two together—and make it accessible to everyone. “aevatar intelligence represents a turning point in the integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies for aelf,” said Brian Liang, COO of aelf. “In developing this framework, we set out a mission to eliminate complexity, unite ecosystems, and make AI accessible to everyone. Launching aevatar intelligence will transform how AI agents work and interact with each other, and unlock new opportunities on the Web3 frontier.” And it’s not just talk. The framework is powered by multiple large-language models (LLMs), giving users access to both general-purpose AI and niche models tailored to specific industries. Whether you’re in asset management, gaming, or decentralized trading, aevatar intelligence has you covered. Building AI Agents with No Limits (and No Code) So how does it work? aevatar intelligence lets users create and deploy AI agents without needing to dive into complicated code.

The Frax improvement proposal is undergoing a governance process; should it pass, BUIDL will be part of Frax. Securitize is the brokerage firm for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund and its BUIDL token. The firm developed the Frax Finance governance proposal. Part of the proposal mentions. “In addition to providing Frax USD utility, relative safety, and convenience, Frax USD can significantly reduce counterparty risk for its reserves by working with BlackRock.” Although the proposal must undergo a community vote, the prospects are good for BUIDL. The proposal has received public support, with one response from alexd3366 reading: I wholeheartedly support this proposal! As a proud investor and big believer in the project’s potential, I’ve witnessed the dedication and expertise that’s gone into shaping this initiative. ~ alexd336 6 BlackRock’s BUIDL is making a niche in the collateral market The Frax stablecoin proposal is not the first for BUIDL. If it goes through, it will join other stablecoins, including Ethena’s USDtb, which works with BUIDL token as a collateral asset. BUIDL has over $530 million worth of assets under management, most in short-term US treasury bills. Securize made the strategic move as Frax’s team is exploring rebranding its core stablecoin to Frax USD (frxUSD). The plans for rebranding are described in another governance proposal , which also talks of introducing Staked Frax USD (sfrxUSD) as a yield-bearing counterpart. The proposal clarifies that the frxUSD token will facilitate direct conversions into fiat currency while working with Paxos. New mint-redeem system, motivation for approval Frax Finance has put in place a new mint-redeem system, known as enshrined custodians, to accompany the stablecoin launch. Through the mint-redeem system, users will have mint-redeem rights to frxUSD if governance allows their assets to back the frxUSD. If BlacRock’s proposal wins, any authentic user can mint 1 BUIDL and send it to the on-chain custodian to receive a frxUSD. While BlackRock’s proposal receives a fair share of public support, it isn’t the only one that can authorize a proposal. Superstate, a competing tokenized fund platform, submitted two governance proposals . If their proposal is passed, frxUSD will adopt its USTB Treasury bills and USCC crypto-carry fund to support the stablecoin. Superstate’s proposals call on Frax to allocate up to $20 million to its USCC fund and up to $100 million to its USTB fund.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

Early awareness of key developments, such as technical updates, strategic partnerships, and ecosystem expansions, can lead to significant returns. One exciting opportunity to keep on your radar is the Lightchain AI Presale , a promising project combining AI integration and blockchain technology. Instead of reacting to price surges after the news breaks, savvy investors focus on projects with strong roadmaps and impactful milestones. From advanced privacy features to enhanced cross-chain functionality, these innovations have the potential to bring undervalued tokens into the spotlight. Below, we explore a few emerging cryptos that could see substantial price growth in the near future, helping you capitalize on these opportunities. Manta Network (MANTA) Privacy Upgrades Fueling DeFi Innovation As secrecy gets more and more key for both big groups and small buyers in crypto, Manta Network shines as a chief in the area. Its privacy-centered DeFi tools, driven by zero-knowledge proof, make sure that user data and plans stay secret. Manta is growing its system by joining with different DeFi platforms, decentralized ex͏change (DEX), and lending rules. These partnerships aim to widen the network’s scope enabling private and safe deals across many platforms. Also, Manta is improving its secrecy traits with the creation of Universal Circuits 2.0 which will give builders a library of ready-made zero-knowledge circuits making it easier to add privacy traits into current apps. With rules checks growing, secrecy answers like Manta are becoming more key. These updates could bring in funds looking for safe DeFi choices possibly raising MANTA’s token cost. Injective (INJ) Cross-Chain Growth and Beyond Injective is making waves with its focus on cross-chain interoperability, enabling seamless asset transfers and trading. By providing traders with access to multiple blockchains without the need to navigate separate platforms, Injective saves time and reduces complexity. The network is integrating Layer 2 solutions to improve transaction speeds and lower costs, with a notable collaboration with Arbitrum to build interoperable EVM infrastructure for cross-chain compatibility. Injective’s ecosystem is also growing with the addition of new decentralized applications (dApps), such as Helix, which offers Trading Bots and Pre-Launch Futures, and Neptune Finance with its peer-to-peer lending testnet. These developments enhance the utility of the INJ token and drive ecosystem growth. Interoperability remains a top priority for developers and traders alike, and advancements in this area significantly boost INJ’s market appeal. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Merging AI with Blockchain for Real-World Impact Lightchain AI (LCAI) combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, creating a platform designed to support AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism allow developers to build solutions that address real-world challenges in industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. The roadmap for LCAI includes a Testnet Rollout in December 2024 and a Mainnet Launch in January 2025, critical milestones for validating the platform’s technology and driving interest from developers and investors. Strategic partnerships with AI developers , enterprises, and other blockchain platforms aim to drive adoption and integrate AI across various sectors. With a presale price of just $0.003 and significant near-term milestones, LCAI’s technological advancements position it for rapid growth. Casper (CSPR) Enterprise-Grade Improvements and Upgrades Casper is designed for enterprise-grade scalability, adaptability, and upgradability, making it particularly attractive to businesses seeking reliable blockchain solutions. With a focus on predictable performance, Casper is well-suited for professional environments hesitant to adopt less proven blockchains. The network is refining its protocol efficiency and actively engaging with corporate clients, with each successful integration potentially increasing demand for the CSPR token. Additionally, Casper is introducing developer-friendly tools to streamline building on its platform, encouraging ecosystem growth and long-term token appreciation. As the corporate world gradually embraces blockchain technology, Casper’s advancements strengthen its reputation as a reliable solution for professional-grade applications, paving the way for steady token price improvements. Why Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale Stands Out as an Opportunity The Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale is generating significant buzz in the crypto community, positioning itself as a standout opportunity for early investors. Leveraging cutting-edge AI-powered blockchain solutions, LCAI aims to redefine efficiency and scalability in decentralized ecosystems. Priced at an accessible $0.003, the presale offers investors an entry point into a project that combines innovative technology with practical use cases across industries. What sets LCAI apart is its focus on ultra-fast transaction speeds and energy-efficient operations, appealing to both developers and eco-conscious investors. The ongoing presale provides a chance to capitalize on a promising project before potential market surges. For those seeking a blend of technological innovation and financial potential, the LCAI presale at Lightchain.ai offers a unique opportunity to secure a foothold in the future of blockchain technology.

In today’s market, savvy investors are no longer asking if crypto is worth the leap but rather, which coins are worth their money this week ? If you’re on the hunt for the best coins to invest in this week, the crypto scene has three standouts: Qubetics (TICS ), Polygon, and Algorand. These projects have earned their stripes in different ways, and they’re reshaping what financial independence and decentralised tech really mean. The crypto world is buzzing right now, and one name that keeps popping up in conversations is Qubetics (TICS). From its innovative Decentralized VPN technology to an insane presale run with record-breaking numbers, Qubetics is emerging as the next big thing. And while Polygon and Algorand have their own claim to fame, Qubetics seems to be taking centre stage, especially for those looking for high-growth potential in their crypto portfolios. But what makes these projects shine? Why are analysts and crypto enthusiasts dubbing them the best coins to invest in this week? Let’s dive in. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Kid with a Decentralised VPN Revolution If you’ve been tracking crypto presales, you’ve already heard about Qubetics. It’s smashing milestones faster than a meme coin goes viral, and the numbers don’t lie. Currently in its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 367 million $TICS tokens to more than 11,300 holders, raising a whopping $7.5 million so far. At $0.0342 per token, it’s still affordable, but here’s the kicker: the price is set to jump by 10% this weekend. Now, the big question: Why all the hype around Qubetics?The excitement surrounding Qubetics stems from its innovative approach to online privacy through its decentralized VPN technology. Unlike traditional VPNs that depend on centralized servers, which can be unreliable and untrustworthy, Qubetics leverages blockchain to enhance security, privacy, and efficiency. This decentralized model distributes the workload across thousands of nodes, making it nearly impossible for hackers or governments to monitor users’ online activities. For businesses, this means secure exchanges of sensitive data within remote teams, ensuring that company secrets remain confidential. Professionals, particularly digital nomads, can access geo-restricted content and use public Wi-Fi without worrying about security breaches. Individuals benefit from enhanced privacy while shopping or streaming, knowing their data is protected. Additionally, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN is more cost-effective than many leading VPN services. Analysts are optimistic about Qubetics, forecasting significant returns for investors. Predictions suggest that by the end of the presale, the price of $TICS could reach $0.25, offering a 630% return on investment (ROI). Following the presale, projections rise to $1, translating to a staggering 2,820% ROI. Long-term estimates post-mainnet launch indicate a price range of $5 to $15, with potential ROIs soaring to an astonishing 43,711%.If you invested $20,000 at today’s presale price of $0.0342, you’d snag roughly 584,795 tokens . By the time $TICS reaches $15, your $20k would balloon to $8.77 million . Unreal, right? Polygon: The Layer-2 Darling with Real-World Utility Polygon has cemented itself as a household name in the crypto world. Known for its scalability solutions, it acts as a Layer-2 protocol for Ethereum, reducing transaction fees and increasing processing speeds. If Ethereum is the highway, Polygon is the express lane that keeps traffic flowing smoothly. What makes Polygon one of the best coins to invest in this week is its real-world application. Major brands like Reddit and Starbucks have integrated Polygon into their ecosystems, showing the crypto world that scalability is key to mass adoption. Polygon is beloved by developers and investors alike because it bridges the gap between Ethereum’s decentralised power and user-friendly performance. With big players like Disney joining its Web3 accelerator programme, Polygon’s reputation continues to skyrocket. Let’s not forget its NFT and gaming roots. From powering decentralised marketplaces to enabling metaverse platforms, Polygon is setting the stage for the future of crypto-based economies. While it’s not riding the presale wave like Qubetics, Polygon’s steady growth makes it a safe bet for those who prefer a less volatile investment. Its native token, MATIC, is still a favourite among long-term investors, offering both stability and potential upside. Algorand: The Green Blockchain If crypto were a high school, Algorand would be the eco-friendly, straight-A student. Known for its carbon-neutral blockchain, Algorand has been championing sustainability long before it was cool. Algorand isn’t just green; it’s wicked fast and incredibly secure. Its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) mechanism eliminates the energy-guzzling processes of traditional blockchains. That makes it a darling for ESG-conscious investors. It’s also carving out a niche in decentralised finance (DeFi). With partnerships ranging from central banks to cutting-edge startups, Algorand is proving that you can be sustainable and scalable at the same time. Absolutely. While its gains might not be as explosive as Qubetics’ presale predictions, Algorand offers a reliable option for those looking to balance risk and reward. Why These Three Coins Dominate the Week Whether it’s Qubetics with its game-changing decentralised VPN tech, Polygon’s scalability solutions, or Algorand’s green innovations, these projects represent the best of what crypto has to offer right now. Looking to make a move? Don’t sleep on Qubetics. With its presale heating up and token prices poised to rise soon, this is your chance to get in before the wave.

The price is trading below $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,420 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

While Dogecoin continues to hold its ground as a classic in the meme coin universe, BTFD Coin has stolen the spotlight with a jaw-dropping presale performance. In its first month, it raised over $4.3 million and captured the attention of over 6,300 holders. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin is carving its niche by combining gaming with blockchain technology, taking meme coin innovation to uncharted territories. Meme coins have always been about more than laughs—they’re a cultural phenomenon. Ever since Dogecoin’s meteoric rise, they’ve turned casual investors into millionaires and transformed internet humour into hard cash. Over time, these quirky tokens have evolved into powerful financial assets. Leading the pack now is BTFD Coin, a project that combines entertainment, utility, and massive return potential with its play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and referral program. With a thriving community rallying behind it, BTFD is shaping up to be the next big thing in the meme coin universe. Buy The Dip Now There’s never been a better time to invest in innovative projects like these. History has shown that economic downturns can create incredible opportunities for those who take bold steps. During the global crash of 1973, savvy investors turned financial chaos into life-changing wealth. Today, BTFD—short for “Buy The F***ing Dip”—is urging investors to do just that. With its presale in Stage 12 at $0.000064 per coin, BTFD is an unmissable opportunity to get in early on a project with analysts predicting exponential growth. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin with Real Utility BTFD Coin has been making waves for all the right reasons. Its presale success is staggering, with over $4.3 million raised and 57 billion coins sold to more than 6,300 holders. Currently priced at $0.000064 in Stage 12, BTFD offers an 837.5% ROI opportunity when it lists at $0.0006 after the presale. What makes it stand out isn’t just its financial promise—it’s the ecosystem behind it. Unlike other meme coins, $BTFD is more than hype. It brings a robust platform that combines fun and functionality. The P2E game isn’t just a gimmick; it’s an immersive experience where players can earn rewards while enjoying the gameplay. Staking rewards add a layer of incentive for long-term holders, while the referral program strengthens community ties by rewarding participants for spreading the word. The numbers speak volumes. Imagine investing $50,000 at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. That would bag you 781,250,000 BTFD Coins. By the time the coin lists at $0.0006, that investment would skyrocket to $468,750. With only a few stages left in the 16-stage presale, the window to secure such returns is closing fast. Dogecoin: The OG of Meme Coins Dogecoin has always been the king of meme coins, and for good reason. Born as a joke in 2013, it grew into a cultural icon that turned “Doge” the Shiba Inu into a global sensation. While its journey has had ups and downs, Dogecoin remains a reliable name in the crypto world, backed by an active community and widespread recognition. Dogecoin’s strength lies in its simplicity and popularity. It’s the coin that introduced millions to cryptocurrency, proving that investing can be fun and accessible. Over the years, it has gained endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, which have kept its momentum alive. But Dogecoin’s appeal isn’t just about nostalgia—it’s about consistency. It continues to serve as a gateway for new investors and a favourite among seasoned traders. However, compared to newer projects like BTFD Coin, Dogecoin lacks the cutting-edge features that today’s investors crave. It doesn’t have a P2E game, staking rewards, or referral programs, which are becoming the norm in the meme coin ecosystem. While Dogecoin remains a solid choice for stability, those looking for massive return potential may find newer coins more appealing. Pepe Coin: Where Gaming Meets Blockchain Pepe Coin is redefining what a meme coin can be by bridging the gap between gaming and blockchain technology. Inspired by the internet’s beloved Pepe the Frog, this project taps into nostalgia while offering something fresh—a gaming platform that allows players to earn rewards in crypto. It’s like combining your favourite pastime with an investment opportunity, and who wouldn’t want that? What makes Pepe Coin unique is its focus on community-driven gameplay. Players can compete, earn, and trade assets, all while being part of a vibrant and passionate community. The integration of blockchain ensures transparency and fairness, giving players confidence in their rewards. It’s a bold move that positions Pepe Coin as a serious contender in the meme coin space. While Pepe Coin is still finding its footing, its innovative approach to gaming has captured the imagination of investors and gamers alike. It’s a riskier bet compared to established names like Dogecoin or promising projects like BTFD Coin, but the potential upside is huge. If you’re someone who loves gaming and crypto, Pepe Coin might just hit the sweet spot.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 03:50:00

Following this acquisition, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings have now reached 1,761.98 BTC. The average purchase price for the latest transaction was 15,330,073 yen per Bitcoin.

Metaplanet said that the Company has strategically grown its total Bitcoin holdings through capital market activities and purchases funded by operating revenues. Metaplanet took to its official X handle and shared a statement regarding the recent purchase. They also addressed recent speculations regarding its Bitcoin Treasury business. The company clarified that it has not issued convertible bonds in connection with its Bitcoin holdings. However, Metaplanet added that, as outlined in its “Notice Regarding the Launch of the Bitcoin Treasury Business” dated December 18, 2024, the firm may consider using bonds convertible into common stock as part of its fundraising strategy in the future. メタプラネットが追加で619.70ビットコインを購入。 pic.twitter.com/xgatgn6YzJ — Metaplanet Inc.

Major world powers and politicians may be investing and holding BTC, but bitcoin cash is aiming to expand and follow through on Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision: money for anyone, able to scale and work for low fees. While Blackrock bros continue to toot their Trump-ets about a compromised, NGU coin, and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor unbelievably posts vids that say there’s “no guarantee” bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap won’t be changed (destroying the currency’s soundness), development on BCH pushes forward in determined, relative silence — but not without enthusiasm. After all, permissionless money for the world is just as exciting as when Satoshi Nakamoto initially floated the radical idea back in 2008. And let’s make no mistake: it’s always been about payments , whether one likes it or not. And that fact has, of course, resulted in a historical schism in the Bitcoin community, and created a hard fork. On one side, the Saylor/Blackrock camp saying Bitcoin is not a currency but just a kind of digital property, and on the other, those that understand the whitepaper. A tweet from X user Unstoppable Cash citing the Bitcoin whitepaper. Still, even for those on board with the purely peer-to-peer (P2P) version of electronic cash that doesn’t require any financial institution, 2nd layer network, or deep pockets for heavenly fees , keeping up with bitcoin cash upgrades that have preserved the pseudonymous Nakamoto’s vision can be tough, especially in an online sea of grift-y, Kiyosaki fear-mongering posts and internet trolls trying to mock anyone who still wants to actually buy something with the stuff. Not everyone is in the market for a Lambo, by the way, or is transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars overseas. Some folks can barely afford shoes, and Bitcoin was supposed to be about helping them as well. Some folks want to buy a coffee, a beer, or a new winter jacket with crypto. Minisatoshi’s Upgrade History and Fork Map Luckily, BCH community member minisatoshi has an excellent resource at the ready for anyone who wants to follow the history of bitcoin cash upgrades. And that’s not all — there’s also an epic and fairly exhaustive BTC fork chart for crypto historians comparing BTC to BCH. Minisatoshi’s timeline starts with Bitcoin’s Genesis Block and goes from there, right up to the present era. So whether one is a fan of BCH, an absolute hater, or anything in between, minisatoshi’s resources provide a unique glimpse into the trajectory of the most groundbreaking economic concept to emerge in modern history. The Bitcoin Cash upgrade timeline was released relatively recently and comes ahead of the approaching May 2025 upgrade for the network, which will bring the “VM Limits” and “BigInts” changes that aim to streamline and enhance BCH’s relatively new UTXO (unspent transaction output) smart contract capabilities.

ATH Push Heats Up While Uniswap Faces Fresh Rivalry,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bnb-to-close-2024-strong/,"BNB to Close 2024 Strong? ATH Push Heats Up While Uniswap Faces Fresh Rivalry BNB and Uniswap have turned in scintillating gains in December—but both have cooled off in a big way as December comes to an end. Nevertheless, their respective December runs have been nothing short of a success after a new BNB ATH was minted at $793 and Uniswap price action resulted in a solid 32% gain in the past month. However, the smart money is already on to the next big crypto—and they’re buying in big to the best presale left on the board this year with the launch of cross-chain DeFi protocol Lunex Network . Here’s why. Cross-chain DeFi protocol Lunex offering big-time gains in 2025 The future of crypto is multi-chain. And one new presale investment opportunity offers way better upside than BNB and Uniswap—even with new BNB ATH and strong Uniswap price action. Low caps, after all, offer significantly greater potential to skyrocket in value than big caps—and that’s exactly what newcomer cross-chain DeFi protocol Lunex Network brings to the table with its presale. Lunex enables users to seamlessly bridge, sell, and swap over 50,000 trading pairs across 40 blockchains, simplifying the user experience across the board with its hybrid model. Through its Lunex Wallet, users can conduct complex trades while maintaining complete control of their digital assets without having to connect to third-party apps that expose their digital assets to fraud. Lunex users will be able to leverage its self-custodial wallet for the most economical cross-chain swaps through its liquidity aggregator partners, while its native token $LNEX can be staked directly through the self-custodial wallet for passive income. Given its ability to onboard new users into the DeFi fold, $LNEX could be in for a major pump. That makes its presale launch one of the best investment opportunities as the year draws to an end. New BNB ATH and robust Uniswap price action hints at strong finish Not too long ago, BNB holders were ecstatic after a new BNB ATH of $793 was hit at the beginning of December. But the BNB ATH train hasn’t stopped yet. Even as prices have come back down to earth at the $680 range, the Binance-adjacent L1 protocol is still up 4% on the month. It was all just a matter of time before traders cashed in on the BNB ATH. On-chain volume suggests another strong finish for BNB to close out the year. Nothing ever goes up in a straight line forever, but a BNB ATH retest is most definitely well within the cards in 2025. Uniswap price has followed the same trajectory. Uniswap notably pumped hard throughout November and December, with Uniswap prices following Ethereum’s rise to $4000. As Ethereum pulled back to $3300, so has Uniswap. Uniswap is down 32.5% in the third week of December, trading at the $11 range. If Ethereum pumps and retests its ATH in 2025, holders can expect Uniswap to pump along with it. Conclusion BNB and Uniswap have pumped in 2024, and traders have already taken profit. While a strong finish could still be in the cards, the risk to reward ratio isn’t worth it. The smart money is favoring new crypto projects that haven’t mooned yet—making Lunex an infinitely superior investment prospect for investors looking for real gains in 2025.

The price is consolidating and might struggle to start a fresh increase above the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP price struggled to clear the $2.40 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.25 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it stays below the $2.30 resistance. XRP Price Faces Resistance At $2.40 XRP price started a fresh increase from the $2.00 support level, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . However, the bears were active near the $2.38 and $2.40 levels. A high was formed at $2.38 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $2.30 and $2.25 levels. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.955 swing low to the $2.383 high. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.25 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.25 level. The next resistance is $2.30. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance or even $2.550 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.620. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $2.25 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.12 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.955 swing low to the $2.383 high. The next major support is near the $2.050 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.050 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.00 support.

In fact, these tokens have notched a new record in terms of monthly volumes after attracting liquidity and institutional players across the region. MiCA Spurs Euro-Backed Stablecoin Adoption Monthly volumes for euro-backed stablecoins reached a multi-year high, surging to nearly €800 million in November. According to the latest report by research firm Kaiko and Netherlands-headquartered crypto exchange Bitvavo, this sharp increase can be largely attributed to Banking Circle’s EURI stablecoin, which gained significant traction after being listed on Binance. Other MiCA-compliant stablecoins, such as fintech firm Circle’s EURC and Société Générale’s EURCV, also contributed to the rise, collectively capturing 91% of the euro-backed stablecoin market share by the end of the year. Regulatory clarity provided by MiCA, which took effect in June, has been crucial in instilling investor confidence, driving liquidity, and attracting institutional players into the market. However, Tether’s decision to cease support for its euro-backed stablecoin, EURT, citing regulatory concerns, highlights ongoing challenges within the evolving framework. Explosive Growth in European Crypto Markets Zooming out, the broader European cryptocurrency market experienced transformative growth in 2024, with euro-denominated trade volumes hitting record highs. November alone saw weekly trade volumes surpass €12 billion, more than doubling October’s levels, as Bitcoin reached an all-time high above $100,000. The euro consolidated its position as the third most traded fiat currency in global crypto markets, behind the US dollar and the Korean won, and its share in Bitcoin-fiat trading surged from 3.6% to nearly 10%. This growth reflects improved regulatory conditions and the rising institutionalization of Bitcoin. European exchanges like Bitvavo, Kraken, and Coinbase played a key role, with Bitvavo leading in euro-denominated trading volumes, accounting for nearly 50% of the market. These platforms expanded their offerings significantly, listing over 331 new euro-denominated pairs in 2024 to meet growing demand. Liquidity in euro markets also improved markedly, with the combined 1% market depth for euro-denominated pairs doubling by November.

Majority of the top 10 coins are trading in red, including Bitcoin. XRP continues to trade sideways as it remains in a consolidation phase. This range-bound movement is expected to exist as the market works through a correction. Here’s an update on the important price levels to monitor for XRP in the coming days. Key Support Levels XRP is currently facing support between $2.24 and $2.21. This range is based on Fibonacci retracement levels, but it is important to note that this support is relatively weak and could potentially be broken. The critical level to watch is the $1.94 swing low. As long as XRP stays above this level, the consolidation phase remains intact. However, if the price falls below $1.94, it could signal a shift toward lower support levels. Potential Lower Support Zone If XRP fails to hold above the $1.94 level, the next key support zone lies between $1.85 and $1.12. This could be the area where XRP finds strong buying interest if the current consolidation breaks down. Key Resistance Levels On the upside, XRP is approaching resistance near the $2.72 level. This price point is crucial because if XRP breaks above it, it could signal a potential rally toward previous highs. If XRP continues to hold its ground and eventually breaks out to the upside, this resistance level could be a significant target. Triangle Formation: Key Phases Currently, XRP may be in the D-wave of the triangle formation. This follows the previous A, B, and C waves, with the D-wave potentially developing now, followed by an E-wave, which should form a higher low.

For example, a meme coin investor might hold Shiba Inu in the hope that it will rise in value while neglecting Pepe, Dogwifhat, and some other top 10 meme tokens. However, with the Meme Index model, this is about to change. Users can now hold a meme coin basket, which gives them access to multiple cryptocurrencies at once without having to buy them one after the other. Meme index combines various meme coins into unique curated indexes. The innovative platform enables its users to unlock the explosive potential of meme coins while also having the flexibility to choose their risk levels. Meme Index allows users to participate in four meme coin baskets. These baskets vary based on their risk levels. There is the Meme Titan Index , which is filled with the top cryptocurrencies, especially the top 10 meme coins. The Meme Moonshot Index consists of meme coins that are about to challenge for a top 10 position. Many of these meme coins are already on centralized exchanges. We also have the Meme Midcap Index . The meme coins in this category are quite volatile, making this basket suitable for those who want to take on more risk. These tokens also have market capitalizations between $50 million and $250 million. This low market capitalization means that these coins could rise sharply and also fall very quickly, depending on market conditions. The Meme Frenzy Index is the last basket, designed for those who like to take significant risks. It contains the riskiest plays and is not for the faint-hearted. These cryptocurrencies can rise and fall very quickly, making them high-risk, high-reward tokens. Other Features of the Meme Index Platform The Meme Index platform gives its MEMEX token holders the opportunity to submit proposals and vote on them. This puts the future of the ecosystem in the hands of the platform users. The votes will also affect the types of coins included in the baskets, as users have the opportunity to vote on coins to add to a basket. The dynamic content of the baskets ensures that the project continues to meet the community’s needs. Users also can keep the baskets fresh by incorporating both established tokens and new contenders. The platform prioritizes security. All operations are fully decentralized, and all staking and governance functions are executed through audited smart contracts. As detailed in the whitepaper, the smart contracts will also undergo rigorous audits to ensure their safety and integrity. https://twitter.com/memecoin_index/status/1864383592182526132 MEMEX also allows users to stake their tokens from the presale for high APY. This requires them to lock their tokens in an investment pool to earn passive income from the beginning. Since MEMEX price will continue to increase at various stages of the presale, this means that those who buy early can enjoy a percentage increase on their purchases by just holding the tokens throughout the presale and doing nothing else. The staking rewards also add to the appeal and general benefits of buying early in the presale. 15% of the total supply of the MEMEX token will be distributed during the presale. 25% of the supply will service the staking pool and rewards. 20% will be used for marketing, including various PR efforts, digital media, social media, and billboards. Another 20% will go into community rewards and incentives to promote awareness about the token and attract more people. The last 20% will be used for treasury and governance, which is necessary for holding a token. It is important to have voting rights and access to the index. How to Buy the Meme Index (MEMEX) Token To buy the token , ensure that you have a compatible wallet. For desktop users, MetaMask is recommended; for mobile users, Trust Wallet is recommended. After this, ensure that you load your crypto wallet with the accepted cryptocurrency and then buy and stake the MEMEX tokens.

Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch and ETF prospects enhance XRP’s ecosystem and institutional appeal. Key 2025 price targets hinge on ETF approvals, with potential highs of $35 amid robust market sentiment. After a prolonged consolidation phase, XRP experienced a dramatic resurgence in late 2024, propelled by pivotal events reshaping the crypto landscape. The asset’s trajectory signals a promising outlook for 2025, with bullish momentum and potential catalysts lining up to push XRP to new heights. A Landmark Victory and Market Rebound XRP’s rally can be traced back to the favorable ruling in its SEC case by Judge Analisa Torres in August 2023. The court affirmed that XRP sales on exchanges weren’t securities, a monumental win for Ripple and the broader crypto market. While Ripple was fined $125 million for institutional sales deemed unregistered securities, the decision further clarified XRP’s regulatory status, setting the stage for its future. However, XRP prices remained subdued until November 2024, when the crypto landscape shifted dramatically.

Potts outlined his predictions, supported by historical data and current market trends while providing a clear timeline for when this milestone could be achieved. Market Performance and Outlook The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has shown strong recovery signs following a brief dip to a six-week low of $0.26216 on December 20. The token rebounded to close above $0.31, maintaining its upward momentum with an increase to $0.3226 as of the latest update . This steady recovery underscores growing confidence in the asset’s long-term potential among investors and analysts. Dima James Potts has set a minimum price target of $10 for the asset during this bull market cycle. According to Potts, Dogecoin’s performance aligns with broader market trends, where major cryptocurrencies often surpass their previous cycle highs during the fourth year of a bull run. For the token, this would mean exceeding its all-time high of $0.73995, achieved in 2021. Historical Trends Support Bullish Predictions Potts emphasized that the token has consistently outperformed its third-year performance during prior bull cycles. He highlighted that the cryptocurrency recorded gains of 72.37% in 2016 and 114.86% in 2020. However, the token’s growth in 2024 has already surpassed these figures, with an impressive 232.87% increase. Based on his analysis, Potts expects Dogecoin to close in 2024 at approximately $0.31. He projects the cryptocurrency will reach $10 in the coming years, with his base case targeting this milestone by 2025. Remarkably, his most optimistic scenario envisions the token soaring to $80, although this remains a speculative estimate. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potts has provided a specific timeline for when Dogecoin could achieve the $10 target. According to his analysis, this milestone is expected between February 11 and May 7, 2025. He attributes this potential growth to the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market and predicts the digital asset to peak alongside Bitcoin during the latter’s first cycle top next year. Potts also cited increasing adoption and technological advancements as key drivers of Dogecoin’s anticipated rally. The cryptocurrency gained significant attention in November following the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), further boosting its visibility and market presence. Other Analysts Share Similar Predictions Potts is not alone in predicting Dogecoin’s rise to $10. Analyst Ali Marinez has also forecasted similar growth, referencing Dogecoin’s movement within an ascending triangle pattern. Meanwhile, other sources, such as Changelly and ChatGPT, have speculated on the asset’s long-term potential. Changelly predicts the token will reach $10 by 2040, while ChatGPT provides a timeline between 2029 and 2034. Analysts and investors have focused on the asset’s potential to hit $10, with projections grounded in historical trends, market behavior, and technological developments. While the exact timeline and magnitude of growth remain uncertain, the cryptocurrency’s recent performance and positive outlook suggest it could achieve significant milestones in the coming years.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 04:51:00

Given their current market positions and ongoing advancements, such a milestone would likely significantly impact altcoins like XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Yeti Ouro (YETIO). XRP Price Outlook Amid Bitcoin’s $200K Prediction Ripple’s XRP can gain substantial upward movement with Bitcoin price set to rise to $200,000. Ripple currently trades at $2.51; the key resistance area for XRP is $2.72, while the support level is situated at $2.42. Some of the figures economists highlight are crucial to keeping these levels to support a bullish scenario. If Bitcoin’s growth sparks market-wide rallies, XRP could surpass its December high of $2.92 and aim for its all-time high of $3.43. A further breakout might take XRP to $5.85, marking a 133% increase. This aligns with Ripple’s network advancements and potential legal clarity. Source X However, short-term corrections pose risks. Analysts stress that holding support at $2.42 and $2.38 is crucial for a continued upward trajectory. XRP’s performance will depend on broader market trends and investor sentiment in the coming months. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Growth Potential In A Bull Market As Bitcoin approaches $200K, Shiba Inu (SHIB) might gain more energy. Since September, SHIB’s price increased, although there have been fluctuations and sales in recent weeks, such as the 250 billion SHIBs sold by a whale. The token is heavily staked and used at $0.00002424, essentially a profitable standing. Analysts predict that SHIB price will trade at $0.00003232 and $0.00004 by the end of 2024, up by 25.6% and 61.6%, respectively. However, in the long run, the forecast is to rise to $0.00007012, which is near an all-time high of $0.00007013, in effect increasing by 172.5%. Upcoming projects like Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain solution, are expected to enhance SHIB’s utility and boost investor confidence. Source X Maintaining current support levels and overcoming key resistance points will be crucial for SHIB’s next breakout. However, whale activity remains a key factor influencing price stability and market sentiment. SHIB continues to hold promise as it navigates these challenges amidst growing interest in the crypto space. Yeti Ouro’s Rising Potential In The Play-to-Earn Sector Yeti Ouro, a new Ethereum-based token priced at $0.017, is gaining traction within the Play-to-Earn (P2E) space. The token’s integration into Yeti Go, an upcoming P2E game, adds utility to the project. Yeti Ouro has already raised over $1.27 million during its presale and employs a deflationary model with token burns. Developers of Yeti Go are collaborating with industry leaders responsible for iconic games like Call of Duty and The Witcher 3 . The game aims to deliver a high-quality experience with immersive audio and dynamic gameplay. With a capped supply of one billion tokens, Yeti Ouro is positioned for long-term growth if market conditions align with Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. If Bitcoin hits $200,000, investor interest in utility-driven projects like Yeti Ouro may rise. However, the project’s growth will depend on its ability to deliver on its ambitious roadmap and attract a larger player base. Yeti Ouro has recently announced a meme contest! The top prize is $2,000 for first place, $1,000 for second place, and $500 for third place. To enter, unleash your creativity by crafting engaging Yeti-themed memes and sharing them on X.

The price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh increase above the $675 resistance. BNB price is struggling to settle above the $700 pivot zone. The price is now trading below $680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $675 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $640 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Holds Support After a downside correction, BNB price found support at $620. It is now recovering losses like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a move above the $675 level before the bears appeared at $695. There was a move below the $680 and $675 levels. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $619 swing low to the $693 high. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $675 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $675 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. However, the bulls are now active near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $619 swing low to the $693 high. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $675 level and the trend line. The next resistance sits near the $692 level. A clear move above the $692 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $705. A close above the $705 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $720 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $735 level in the near term. Another Dip? If BNB fails to clear the $675 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $640 level. The next major support is near the $625 level. The main support sits at $620. If there is a downside break below the $620 support, the price could drop toward the $612 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $600 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone.

The Australian reported on Dec. 23 that Pape and his team were reporting hundreds of fake Facebook groups claiming to be run by his image to trick people into scams. One of the fake groups using Scott Pape’s name. Source: Facebook Pape decided to engage with the scammers and explain their methods instead of waiting on Facebook to take down these groups since this could allow more scams to spread. He took up a fake name on Facebook and asked for investment advice from the scammers Within hours of contacting a fake Facebook page, he was solicited to share his phone number and then offered a chance to join an ‘exclusive’ WhatsApp group called the ‘DB Wealth Institute.’ Pape looked up DB Wealth Institute on Google and quickly sifted through a number of automated press releases about the ‘investing firm’ and even on Yahoo Finance, Forbes, and LinkedIn. One press release notes that “DB Wealth Institute, founded in 2011 by Professor Cillian Miller, offers practical financial training and developed ‘AI Financial Navigator 4.0,’ integrating AI with big data to enhance trading strategies. By 2024, it had trained over 30,000 students from more than ten countries”. US regulators and financial authorities had warned of such scams by “wealth institutes” Pape added that further research also revealed that many US regulators and financial authorities had warned of fake ‘wealth institutes’ trading crypto through WhatsApp. Such scams include a ‘professor’ who provides false trading signals to group members that they can invest their money in and an assistant who communicates with investors. As soon as the group realizes enough money has been gathered, it disappears with the funds, rebrands, and then goes after new victims.

Many holders are turning to modern protocols, such as Arbitrum and Lunex Network, to diversify their investments. While Arbitrum has established a strong reputation for its approach to security, Lunex Network ($LNEX) is amassing popularity for its extensive value offering. So why are Ethereum holders pinning their hopes on these two projects? Ethereum (ETH) Dips Despite Efficiency Progress Ethereum (ETH) has had a slow year, growing by 67% in total. Ethereum (ETH) has lagged behind other crypto titans who have largely seen bigger gains. There have been glimmers of technological progress for Ethereum, as the Ethereum developers managed to cut the network’s energy consumption massively, which was a long criticized shortcoming of Ethereum among holders. However, this hasn’t managed to spur much growth, and in the last 5 days, Ethereum (ETH) has dipped by 5%. Arbitrum (ARB) Activates Stylus Update On Mainnets Arbitrum (ARB) has found a new lease of life, with Arbitrum’s price soaring by 54% in the last month and 12% over the last 24 hours. These price increases followed Arbitrum’s activation of the Stylus protocol on its mainnets. This update allows developers to use a variety of additional languages to code smart contracts on the network. This massively enhances the appeal of Arbitrum (ARB) developers globally, as many networks are yet to make these adjustments. Arbitrum is looking strong going into 2025 despite some fluctuations earlier in the year. Lunex Network Offers A High-Performance Trading Platform Lunex Network ($LNEX) is gaining recognition as an advanced protocol, offering a suite of features tailored for traders and powered by state-of-the-art blockchain technology. At the heart of the platform is its dynamic native token, $LNEX. Engineered for resilience and long-term growth, $LNEX has a capped supply of 8 billion tokens, creating a deflationary effect as adoption rises. Besides potential gains from token appreciation, holders enjoy 18% of platform profits generated through transaction fees. With this revenue sharing model a sustainable ecosystem is created while attracting early adopters with the promise of passive income. A sophisticated portfolio tracker is integrated into Lunex Network, which outperforms standard exchange tools. Unlike standard trackers it supports cryptocurrencies as well as ETFs, stocks and other financial assets. This allows traders to track assets across diverse portfolios with ease. At one glance, users can assess their financial health and trading position. Lunex Network Attracts Investors In Droves Investor interest in Lunex Network ($LNEX) is surging, with tokens currently available at the appealing price of $0.0048. The platform’s innovative approach to crypto trading and its broad utility have fueled analysts’ predictions of a 1,800% increase in token value by the official launch. For investors looking to capitalize on the evolving DeFi market, Lunex Network ($LNEX) is a standout opportunity in 2024 that should not be overlooked.

37992717,https://coinpaper.com/6675/corporate-bitcoin-pioneer-micro-strategy-surpasses-2021-bull-market-purchases,1734931800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Corporate Bitcoin Pioneer MicroStrategy Surpasses 2021 Bull Market Purchases,https://coinpaper.com/6675/corporate-bitcoin-pioneer-micro-strategy-surpasses-2021-bull-market-purchases,"MicroStrategy, a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, has recently made waves with significant developments that show its strategic focus on cryptocurrency and its growing influence in both the traditional financial and digital asset sectors. The company set new records with its largest-ever Bitcoin acquisitions in November 2024, while simultaneously preparing for its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index. To bolster its leadership, MicroStrategy has welcomed three prominent executives as well, including former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks, to its board of directors. MicroStrategy’s Record-Breaking Bitcoin Acquisitions: A New Era of Corporate Crypto Investment MicroStrategy, led by its co-founder and Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, has once again made headlines by surpassing its previous Bitcoin acquisition records. The company’s recent purchases during November and December 2024 have not only eclipsed its previous all-time highs but also outpaced the buying intensity of the 2021 bull market. These bold moves solidify MicroStrategy’s position as a corporate leader in Bitcoin adoption and further reinforce the asset's potential as a cornerstone for institutional portfolios. According to Saylortracker , MicroStrategy purchased 27,200 BTC on Nov. 10, 2024, at an average price of $74,000 per Bitcoin. The pace only accelerated from there, with the company acquiring 51,780 BTC on Nov. 17 and culminating in its largest single purchase to date: 55,500 BTC on Nov. 24 at an average price of $97,000 per coin. These figures are staggering, even compared to MicroStrategy’s prior Bitcoin acquisitions during the 2020-2021 bull run. At that time, its largest single purchase was 29,646 BTC on Dec. 21, 2020, when Bitcoin traded around $21,000. The latest acquisitions demonstrate the company’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin's long-term value, even as the cryptocurrency reaches new price milestones. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy has long been a topic of interest and emulation. The firm’s approach is predicated on using Bitcoin as a superior store of value compared to traditional assets. By transferring capital from the stock market into the Bitcoin market, MicroStrategy has not only enhanced its corporate treasury but also inspired other institutions to follow suit. Traders and analysts alike see these acquisitions as a bullish signal, injecting institutional liquidity and interest into the cryptocurrency market. Michael Saylor has repeatedly voiced his long-term commitment to Bitcoin, stating in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, “I am sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin — probably $1 billion dollars a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin.” A Catalyst for Bitcoin’s Market Adoption The timing of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases aligns with broader developments in Bitcoin adoption and market dynamics. The inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100 index, effective Dec. 23, 2024, marks a pivotal moment. The Nasdaq 100 is a weighted index of the 100 largest companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange by market capitalization, and MicroStrategy’s entry provides indirect exposure to Bitcoin for stock investors. This inclusion means that holders of ETFs like the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), which manages over $322 billion in assets, will gain exposure to Bitcoin through MicroStrategy’s holdings. MicroStrategy’s persistent Bitcoin acquisitions are seen as a bullish catalyst by many in the crypto space. The company’s confidence in Bitcoin’s future — even at prices nearing six figures — reinforces its narrative as a robust asset class for institutional investors. Moreover, the increasing size of its purchases may reflect growing confidence in Bitcoin’s potential to outperform traditional assets. As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, MicroStrategy’s actions bring attention to a shift in the corporate landscape. The company’s strategic focus on Bitcoin could inspire similar moves by other publicly traded firms, further driving institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance of the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy Strengthens Board with High-Profile Appointments Amid Nasdaq 100 Inclusion In related news, MicroStrategy has appointed three prominent executives — former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks, Galaxy Digital board member Jane Dietze, and Fanatics Holdings' Chief Legal Officer Gregg Winiarski — to its board of directors. This strategic move comes on the heels of Nasdaq’s announcement that MicroStrategy will be added to the prestigious Nasdaq 100 index. The appointments, disclosed in a Dec. 20 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), expand MicroStrategy’s board to nine members. Each of the new directors — Brooks, Dietze, and Winiarski — brings unique expertise and deep connections across financial, legal, and regulatory landscapes. According to the filing, all three are eligible for equity awards, aligning their incentives with the company’s long-term goals. Among the appointees, Brian Brooks stands out as a pivotal addition. Brooks, who served as the United States Comptroller of the Currency for nine months in 2021, oversaw the entire US banking system and earned a reputation as a pro-crypto regulator. His appointment has been described as a “BIG deal” by Bitcoin platform Swan Bitcoin, which noted Brooks’ deep regulatory expertise and connections within the financial ecosystem. Brooks previously gained attention in the crypto community after being rumored as a potential replacement for SEC Chair Gary Gensler under Donald Trump. The timing of these appointments coincides with MicroStrategy’s upcoming inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, a benchmark index comprising the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. On Dec. 13, Nasdaq confirmed that MicroStrategy would join the index alongside Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON). The three companies will replace Illumina, Inc. (ILMN), Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI), and Moderna, Inc. (MRNA), which will be removed from the index. The listing positions MicroStrategy among the Nasdaq’s most significant stocks by market capitalization, reflecting the company’s evolution from a software provider to a de facto Bitcoin hedge fund. MicroStrategy’s inclusion also extends Bitcoin exposure to a broader audience, as Nasdaq 100-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as the Invesco QQQ Trust, indirectly represent the company’s substantial Bitcoin holdings. This development is seen as a milestone for integrating cryptocurrency into traditional financial markets. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and executive chairman, has consistently advocated for Bitcoin’s role as a superior store of value. Under his leadership, the company transformed its treasury strategy in 2020, accumulating billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin. Saylor has repeatedly emphasized his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, stating that MicroStrategy is committed to buying Bitcoin throughout its lifecycle. This bold approach has not only solidified MicroStrategy’s reputation but has also inspired other corporations to consider Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The company’s significant Bitcoin holdings have contributed to its reclassification as a Bitcoin-focused entity, drawing attention from institutional investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. A Strategic Inflection Point MicroStrategy’s recent developments demonstrate its dual role as a software company and a Bitcoin market leader. The inclusion of seasoned executives like Brooks, Dietze, and Winiarski, combined with its Nasdaq 100 listing, represents a strategic inflection point for the company. The appointments enhance MicroStrategy’s ability to navigate regulatory complexities, foster institutional relationships, and further integrate Bitcoin into traditional financial systems. As Brian Brooks takes his seat at the boardroom table, his regulatory expertise and industry insights are expected to play a crucial role in shaping MicroStrategy’s future. By strengthening its leadership team and achieving inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, MicroStrategy continues to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. As Michael Saylor and his team push forward, MicroStrategy is poised to remain a trailblazer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, inspiring other firms to follow suit and paving the way for broader institutional engagement with digital assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-23 05:30:00

Tron (TRX) is inching closer to a breakout at $0.65, exciting traders and enthusiasts alike. Meanwhile, Sui (SUI) and Lunex Network (LNEX) are gaining momentum, poised for potential price rebounds. With strong market sentiment and favorable technical indicators, these assets could be on the verge of significant price movements. Sui (SUI) Forecasted To Bounce To $5 In a recent tweet, a top expert called Suipiens.sui argued that the Sui (SUI) downtrend could be over. According to him, the next phase now is for the DeFi token to bounce back to former highs. The analyst congratulated those who refused to sell during the dip. He encouraged them to hold tight as the Sui coin could rise to $5 soon. Also, he highlighted a buying opportunity around $3.6 for those who missed the Sui token before. At the moment, Sui (SUI) is trading above a key level. Price information from CoinMarketCap shows the Sui price has increased by 3.8% in the weekly timeframe. We might see the cryptocurrency rising to retest higher levels as long as it holds above $3. A drop from this level could push the value of the altcoin to former lows in the coming weeks. On the flip side, most of Sui’s technical indicators are bullish. The relative strength index is above average, a sign that bulls are not perturbed by the ongoing downtrend. Tron (TRX) Poised For Breakout To $0.65 The Tron (TRX) coin is among the top performers in the market right now. Data from CoinMarketCap platform shows TRX’s price rose to $0.425 recently. Although it has witnessed a minor correction, most of its technical indicators are still bullish. Its relative strength index is above the midline, a signal that bulls are active. Also, the Fear and Greed Index is showing extreme Greed. Looking ahead, analysts have posted bullish predictions for the Tron token. One of them is Evan Luthra. He predicts the value of this coin is getting ready for an all-time high breakout retest. According to him, the Tron price might rise to two targets. The first target is $0.65. If this cryptocurrency’s upward movement continues, Luthra believes the altcoin price could rise to the second target, $1.25. Another analyst called UB is also bullish about the Tron crypto . However, he said TRX must reclaim the $0.31 level to continue its uptrend. Lunex Network (LNEX) Raises Close To $5M In Presale Lunex Network (LNEX) is currently in presale, attracting significant interest in the DeFi market . Priced at $0.0048 per token, the project has already raised over $5.4 million. Analysts predict a potential 18x rally, making Lunex one of the most promising DeFi projects . Lunex stands out with its privacy-focused approach, eliminating the need for KYC procedures. This allows users to trade and trade assets anonymously. It also saves them the stress of going through long registration processes that make centralized exchanges discouraging to traders. Additionally, the platform offers access to 65+ RPC nodes, supporting decentralized applications and empowering developers to build on various blockchains. Furthermore, Lunex Network has a unique revenue-sharing model. It shares a part of its revenue with those who stake their tokens for at least 30 days. This is how it works. First, Lunex Network will use a part of its revenue to buy back some coins from the market. 50% of these coins are shared with stakers while the other half are kep5 as incentives for other purposes. Lunex Network’s combination of no-KYC policies, robust RPC infrastructure, and user-friendly features positions it as a comprehensive DeFi platform. The presale is shaping Lunex into a versatile and privacy-oriented solution for both traders and developers. In Conclusion The best cryptos to consider right now are Tron (TRX), Sui (SUI), and Lunex Network. Analysts say investors should see the ongoing downtrend as a good buying opportunity to stock up their portfolios before the bull run begins.

The CEA's role is to advise the president on economic issues, including evaluating the effectiveness of federal policies and programs, analyzing economic trends, and crafting recommendations to foster growth and stability. Miran has long been an advocate for crypto, recently appearing on Blockworks' Forward Guidance podcast. He has previously tweeted about how crypto regulations need to be reformed in the U.S. to allow for innovation to flourish. Miran has previously criticized Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell as ""wrong politically and economically"" for urging Congress to pass a stimulus bill in October 2020. This appointment comes as Trump himself has pledged to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” and earlier floated the idea of a strategic bitcoin reserve. Recently, Trump announced he was appointing crypto advocate Paul Atkins as Securities and Exchange Commission chair. Atkins had previously served as a Commissioner at the SEC during the George W. Bush administration. Trump also appointed former congressional candidate Bo Hines as Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. In a post on Truth Social , Trump said Hines would collaborate with David Sacks , the incoming ""Crypto Czar,"" to advance the administration's crypto agenda.

Over the past 7 days, Sun has offloaded another 50% of his holdings worth $143 million. Market analysts predict that ETH price could further take a dip below $3,000 once again before resuming upside momentum. Tron’s Justin Sun on ETH Selling Spree Justin Sun is on a massive Ethereum selling spree since the coin resumed its upward journey after Donald Trump’s election win. This continued even until last week, when Tron founder offloaded $143 million worth of ETH causing Ethereum price to tank over 15% amid the crypto market crash. Blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain reported that Justin Sun redeemed 39,999 ETH (valued at $143 million) from liquid staking platforms Lido Finance and EtherFi. He subsequently deposited the entire amount into HTX. Since November 10, as Ethereum price has trended upward, Sun has deposited a total of 108,919 ETH (worth $400 million) to HTX at an average price of $3,674. Notably, many of these deposits occurred near local price peaks. Courtesy: Spot On Chain Spot On Chain also revealed that Justin Sun currently has 42,904 ETH (valued at $139 million) in the process of unstaking from Lido Finance. The Tron founder might potentially send this funds to HTX later. Ethereum Price Drop Below $3,000 Coming? With Ethereum price losing its crucial support of $3,500, the market sentiment for the world’s largest altcoin has turned bearish. Last week, crypto market analysts turned bearish on Ethereum expecting the ETH price to drop $2,800 on selloff by whales. Popular market analyst IncomeSharks stated that it was a “low-volume weekend,” for Ethereum following a volatile week for stocks. The analysts added that it won’t be the right time to sell. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator, a tool used to gauge buying and selling pressure, remains steady, oscillating within a channel. Recent Ethereum buyers are still in profit, providing some support for the market. However, the below chart shows that there’s still scope for Ethereum to take a dip to $3,000. Source: IncomeSharks Prominent crypto analyst “I am Crypto Wolf” also highlighted a bullish outlook with a potential inverse head-and-shoulders (iHS) pattern. According to the analyst, Ethereum price chart is currently forming the “right shoulder” of the iHS continuation pattern. Source: I Am Crypto Wolf This setup could provide the momentum needed to surpass the $4,000 resistance and aim for a $10,000 target by May. A breakout is anticipated by the end of January, though a retest of the $3,000 level remains a possibility before the rally takes off, he noted.

The overwhelming support of crypto-friendly US leaders has changed the entire perspective of digital assets, especially by institutional investors during the past few weeks. Furthermore, more investment fund managers have filed for spot altcoins ETF including Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, among others with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With the ongoing macro crypto bull market, more funds are expected to follow into the web3 industry ahead. When Dogecoin Spot ETF? Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained a leader in the memecoin industry, majorly due to the unwavering support from tech billionaire Elon Musk. The Dogecoin network, which is secured by the legendary proof-of-work consensus mechanism, takes pride in more than 5.9 million on-chain holders. However, none of the pro-crypto investment fund managers have filed for a spot Dogecoin ETF with the US SEC to date. According to Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, the inauguration of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump will set the precedent for investment fund managers to file for spot Dogecoin ETF. Moreover, the entrance of Paul Atkins as the US SEC chair will significantly improve the chances of crypto ETF approvals. “If I’m Vegas my favorite on reserver of $DOGE ticker is Venuto. That said Tuttle is my fav to file for the ETF,” Balchunas noted . Whales on a Buying Spree According to on-chain data analysis provided by Santiment , crypto whales purchased 250 million Dogecoins, worth more than $77 million, during the recent market dip. As a result, Dogecoin whales with a balance of between 1 million and 10 million units now hold more than 10.7 billion DOGE units, which is nearly 1 percent of the total circulating supply. Midterm Targets Dogecoin price has been trapped in a midterm correction phase after registering palpable gains in the past two months. The large-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $47 billion and a daily average traded volume of around $5 billion, is currently retesting the support level around the 0.5 daily Fibonacci Retracement, which could yield a major rebound soon. In the weekly time frame, DOGE price is aiming for an all-time high after the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rallied above the 85 percent level for the first time since mid-2021.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 05:46:25

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

As interest grows, analysts debate whether the token has what it takes to break into the $100 billion range by 2025. With meme coins often driven by community enthusiasm and speculative trends, PEPE’s trajectory will likely depend on sustained investor interest and market conditions. PEPE Holds Steady On Blockchain Activity According to data from Coinglass, PEPE spot metrics revealed over $2.61 billion in outflow over the past week. This massive outflow from exchanges typically indicates potential upside momentum as investors hold on to tokens in personal wallets or cold storage. The less PEPE in exchanges, the higher the value of its scarce tokens. On December 14 , a dormant whale account became active, moving its entire balance worth 2.1 trillion PEPE. The investor initially bought these tokens for $27, and now, the same tokens are worth over 1,900,000 times that amount. These kinds of big shifts typically indicate that whales have faith in the asset or are getting ready for price changes. At 4.15, Binance’s PEPEUSDT Long/Short Ratio shows a high level of trader interest. At the moment, around 20% of top Binance traders hold short, while 80% hold long positions. What are The PEPE Technicals Saying? Per technicals, PEPE has formed a descending triangle pattern after a short consolidation period around the $10 billion market cap. PEPE could close a week-long candle above the $0.000032 level with a breakout imminent. According to price prediction analysis , PEPE is forecast to rise by 226% and reach $0.000074 by January 16, 2025. With a 14-day RSI of 51, PEPE is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a chance for an upside rally. Combining these metrics, it makes sense that PEPE is slightly above its mid-November price. However, PEPE continues to trade above its moving averages as bull traders expect a significant surge in the coming days. Currently, large transactions are up to $1.82 billion on PEPE with 6,230 active addresses. With 90% of holders in profit, the token has experienced heightened investments in expectation of a bullish incline. According to data from IntoTheBlock, about 20% of PEPE holders came in the past month. The Next Thing For PEPE Holders As the Ethereum network expands, so have PEPE and RTX. With the launch of its cross-border payment system, Remittix (RTX) is forecast to yield a higher return on investment. The hot new crypto is focused on overcoming the hurdle of international payments with a crypto-to-fiat structure, low fees, and resilience to location restrictions.

In a separate case, influencer Haliey Welch is cooperating with legal representatives after allegations of a pump-and-dump scheme involving the Hawk Tuah token. Meanwhile, financial educator Scott Pape exposed crypto scams impersonating him. Additionally, the SEC fined Jump Trading’s Tai Mo Shan $123 million for deceptive practices related to stabilizing TerraUSD (UST) during its 2021 depeg event. Interpol Issues Red Notice for Hex Founder Interpol issued a Red Notice for Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, who is the founder of Hex. The notice was issued for alleged tax fraud and assault. This Red Notice is a global request for law enforcement to locate and provisionally arrest an individual, and was prompted by Finnish authorities. However, it does not constitute an international arrest warrant. Schueler has also been placed on Europe’s most wanted fugitives list, accusing him of assaulting a 16-year-old by grabbing their hair, dragging them into a stairwell, and knocking them to the ground. Richard Schueler’s Red Notice (Source: Interpol ) The remand order for Schueler was issued three months ago, on Sept. 13, with Finnish authorities suspecting him of tax evasion from June of 2020 to April of 2024. The allegations include discrepancies in Schueler’s reported income compared to estimates from tax authorities. On Sept. 18, a Helsinki police detective, Harri Saaristola, told Finnish broadcaster Yle that Heart’s financial disclosures did not align with the tax service’s calculations. Schueler has not publicly addressed the Red Notice just yet, but is still active on social media . In a Dec. 21 post, he commented, “If the haters really wanted to get me down, they could raise more than the $27M I did for medical research.” Schueler is also embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of unregistered offerings of three cryptocurrency tokens: Hex, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PSLX). The SEC accused Schueler of raising more than $1 billion through these unregistered sales, and claimed he marketed them as a way to achieve wealth. Schueler tried to dismiss the $1 billion lawsuit in August, but the SEC maintained its authority to pursue the case. Haliey Welch Addresses Hawk Tuah Token Scandal Richard Heart is not the only crypto founder currently facing some serious legal troubles. Haliey Welch, the influencer behind the viral “Hawk Tuah” video, addressed the controversy surrounding a meme coin bearing her nickname that experienced a dramatic pump and dump shortly after its launch in December. In a Dec. 20 post on X, Welch stated that she is “fully cooperating” with lawyers representing investors in the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) token. While Welch was not named as a defendant yet, crypto users have filed a lawsuit against the project’s creators and partners, accusing them of promoting and selling an unregistered securities offering. The HAWK token was launched on Dec. 4, and reached a market capitalization of about $500 million before crashing by 90%. This prompted allegations of a rug pull. Welch shared that she is very serious about the matter and encouraged the affected people to contact legal representatives. The controversy stems from her promotion of the token, which used her likeness and branding, as she transitioned from her TikTok fame into the cryptocurrency space. Welch initially gained internet fame in June after a viral clip earned her the nickname “Hawk Tuah” girl. Blockchain data revealed suspicious activity surrounding the token’s launch as one wallet acquired roughly 18% of the HAWK supply and sold it for a profit of over $1 million shortly afterward. Meanwhile, many investors suffered big losses during the token’s rapid decline. It is still uncertain whether Welch or the project’s founders could face criminal or regulatory actions in the United States. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has taken a very firm stance when it comes to treating most tokens as securities, though the agency’s leadership is expected to shift to Republican control in January. Barefoot Investor Exposes Crypto Scam Tactics Scott Pape, who is known as the “Barefoot Investor,” recently exposed how he tackled crypto scammers who used his identity to defraud his followers. Pape is an Australian financial educator, and shared that he and his team reported hundreds of fake Facebook groups impersonating him to scam people. Frustrated by the slow response from Facebook, Pape decided to engage directly with the fraudsters and investigate their methods. By using a fake name, Pape contacted a fraudulent Facebook page and was invited to join an exclusive WhatsApp group called the “DB Wealth Institute.” A quick search of the group revealed automated press releases about the supposed institute, bragging about its achievements and partnerships with well known platforms. Pape also discovered that U.S. regulators previously warned of similar fake “wealth institutes” that operated through WhatsApp and offered fraudulent crypto trading lessons. The scam followed a familiar pattern: members of the group were provided fake trading signals, encouraged to share fabricated successes, and pressured into making large investments. Bots likely generated the constant flow of messages claiming profitable trades. Pape was guided by an assistant named “Ally,” and even followed one of these signals and saw an 81% profit on a trade, which is a tactic to build confidence and greed. Soon after, he was pressured to invest larger sums, with exclusive programs starting at $20,000 and going up to $5 million. Part of the scam’s strategy is to instil fear and desperation in victims to extract even more money from them. He pointed out that scammers often target victims again after the initial scam by urging them to borrow money in an attempt to recover losses. Pape is the author of the best-selling book The Barefoot Investor, and has been very vocal about fighting financial fraud. According to Chainalysis, crypto scams and hacks in 2024 stole $2.2 billion, a 21% increase from 2023. SEC Fines Tai Mo Shan $123M In May of 2021, after a temporary depegging of the algorithmic TerraUSD stablecoin (UST), the token appeared to stabilize back to its $1 peg automatically. However, according to an SEC complaint , a subsidiary of Jump Trading’s crypto unit, Tai Mo Shan, intervened with $20 million in purchases to stabilize the token. This action allegedly misled investors in UST and its counterpart token, Luna, by giving the impression that Terraform Labs’ stabilization mechanism functioned as intended. The SEC and Tai Mo Shan reached a settlement which requires the firm to pay $123 million in fines, including over $86 million in disgorgement and $36 million as a civil penalty. The disgorgement amount was based on profits Tai Mo Shan allegedly earned by purchasing UST during the depeg event and subsequently receiving and selling unlocked luna tokens. These actions, according to the SEC, deceived investors about the efficacy of Terraform Labs’ arbitrage mechanism. Earlier SEC allegations also suggested that Tai Mo Shan profited $1.28 billion from these transactions, but the settlement was reached without the firm admitting or denying the findings. Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon publicly claimed that TerraUSD survived a severe stress test, and used the situation as proof of the algorithmic mechanism’s robustness. However, the SEC pointed out that the lack of transparency about Tai Mo Shan’s involvement misled the market about UST’s stability. Jump Crypto’s president, Kanav Kariya, invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a previous deposition about the deal. As part of the settlement, Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay the penalty without admitting any wrongdoing. Overall, the SEC holds firm that the intervention misrepresented UST’s stability and Terraform Labs’ system. Terraform Labs also agreed to pay over $4 billion in fines after the collapse of its ecosystem and received permission to start winding down operations under U.S. bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LUNA|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-23 06:17:33

Analyst Makes a Case Based On Repeating Bullish Pattern,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-5-85-and-8-76-analyst-makes-a-case-based-on-repeating-bullish-pattern/,"Dark Defender, a notable crypto analyst on X, recently shared a compelling technical analysis of XRP’s price trajectory. The post highlights a potential bullish movement using historical patterns and Fibonacci levels. The detailed chart compares a 4-hour timeframe correction to a similar structure forming on the daily timeframe, sparking discussions on XRP’s future price potential. According to Dark Defender, XRP’s previous correction on the 4-hour timeframe saw the cryptocurrency drop by 21% from $1.2680 to $1.0033. Following this correction, XRP consolidated within an ascending channel for a short period before a significant surge to $2.9070. This surge pushed XRP above $2 for the first time since 2018 and sent it to a multi-year high. What makes this prediction more intriguing, is that the asset shows the same pattern on the 1-day time frame. The comparison between the two timeframes suggests that an XRP break out is possible through key resistance levels, leading to substantial price increases. The asset has experienced a 34% drop, falling from that peak of $2.9070 to $1.9010, before a swift recovery and consolidation inside an upward channel. XRP imitates the 4-hour (4-H) correction structure on the daily time frame. After the 4-hour correction at that time, XRP ran from $1.2680 to $2.9070. With a daily break above $2.90, the Frog Leap first to the upper Fibonacci Level sits at $5.85 and $8.76 in the short term.… pic.twitter.com/iOeEz17drG — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 21, 2024 Targets For XRP’s Next Surge Dark Defender believes the current technical setup targets the Fibonacci levels at $5.85 and $8.76 in the short term. These projections indicate a potential rally that could more than double XRP’s current value of $2.19. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A key aspect of the analysis is its focus on Fibonacci retracement and extension levels, a widely used tool in technical analysis. The Fibonacci levels referenced align with prior resistance zones and the analyst has previously referenced these targets . More Bullish Technical Indicators The lower portion of the chart highlights the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is used to gauge market momentum. The 4-hour and daily charts indicate a cyclical pattern, with previous RSI behavior providing clues to future price movement. The RSI’s recovery following the correction in the 4-hour timeframe coincided with XRP’s strong rally, a pattern that appears to be unfolding on the daily chart. The detailed technical breakdown shared by Dark Defender outlines a potential roadmap for XRP’s price action. While the asset has shown some bearish momentum over the past 24 hours, his analysis and other bullish predictions shared by other analysts suggest this downturn will not last.

Through exposure to cryptocurrencies, NFTs and tokenized assets like art and real estate, individuals can dramatically diversify their investment portfolios and access new and exciting markets. With decentralized finance, investors can engage in staking, lending and liquidity provisioning, and potentially benefit from some attractive yields that are difficult to find in traditional finance. Anyone who is familiar with Web3 will know that it can provide enhanced financial flexibility within more dynamic and decentralized economies. But at the same time, most of those with significant funds available are cautious about increasing their exposure to digital assets. There are good reasons for this caution, as the Web3 industry’s regulatory status remains incredibly cloudy, and security is still a big question mark. It’s clear that some Web3 platforms are trustworthy, but there are many which are not, and even many of the honest DeFi protocols can still fall victim to glaring vulnerabilities in their underlying code. Still, that doesn’t mean that high-net-worth individuals should avoid investing in Web3 entirely, it just means they have to proceed with extra caution. They need to do their homework and identify legitimate platforms that have invested in strong security and worked hard to ensure compliance with global anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules. In addition, they can focus their efforts on platforms that have achieved compliance with financial authorities in key crypto markets, such as Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland, which have already created specific regulations with Web3 in mind. Strong encryption is a must The most reliable digital asset platforms are those that use strong encryption to secure user’s personal information and encrypt as much data as it’s possible to do. Some of the most reliable cryptographic security standards include biometric and homomorphic encryption, which can mask user’s transaction details from outsiders, while multiparty computation can offer further reassurances. Biometric security uses details such as the user’s facial scan, eye scan, fingerprints or even their voice as a kind of cryptographic key that’s required to access their accounts. Such techniques go a long way towards preventing unauthorized account access. Meanwhile, homomorphic encryption is a technique that allows data to be processed without ever decrypting it, meaning that it’s never exposed to bad actors, even when it’s stolen in a breach. As for multiparty computation, this is a computing technique that splits work across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server has possession of all of the encrypted data at the same time, so even if one is hacked, the data that’s stolen is useless to whoever gains access to it. Regulatory compliance provides reassurance Affluent individuals must also consider the compliance status of Web3 platforms, as well as other indicators of their financial health, such as their funding sources, investor backing and profitability. These factors aren’t always very apparent, but one way to ensure a platform is legitimate is to consider what kind of financial certifications it has achieved. Certifications to look out for include the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority or FINMA, which is the independent regulatory body that governs financial institutions in Switzerland, including banks, investment companies and crypto exchanges. It’s known for its risk-based approach to supervision of such institutions, and it works to identify threats that might put such organizations at risk of financial crimes. It’s especially vigilant about money laundering and the finance of terrorism, and conducts regular audits and reviews of any certified institutions. Others include the Dubai Financial Services Authority or DFSA, which is the guardian of financial integrity within Dubai’s financial economy. It ensures that institutions ranging from banks to investment firms and crypto companies are in full compliance with Dubai’s stringent regulatory requirements, in adherence to its ethical standards, and maintain market integrity. Finally, a growing number of Web3 firms adhere to the regulations of the Monetary Authority of Singapore or MAS. Singapore has become a hotbed of crypto startups, and MAS does the job of regulating all such businesses in its territory. Web3’s advantage in wealth management If you can find a platform that’s regulated by all three of those organizations, you can be reassured that your finances are in safe hands, which is why the digital wealth management platform Welf stands out as a promising option for high-net-worth individuals. Welf, unlike traditional private banking services, operates 24/7, providing instant access to funds globally. Its products include tailored and exclusive investment opportunities, cash management, high-limit credit and debit cards that are accepted globally, luxury concierge services and advanced security. With it, clients can access a modern, fully-digital wealth management platform that blends traditional financial instruments with DeFi-based yield-generating opportunities and tokenized investments, expanding their financial opportunities. Welf’s native token WELF is required to access the platform, and sits at the heart of its ecosystem, as the main currency for transaction and service fees, and also as the cornerstone of its community governance mechanism. Clients are required to stake WELF tokens for access to its services and additional yield opportunities. The token is currently available via pre-sale IDOs on Polkastarter and Ape Terminal. Summing up Web3 is a vast and exciting financial ecosystem that has lots of potential for affluent individuals to diversify their portfolios and increase their wealth. However, it’s also a risky new economy that’s plagued by security concerns and scams, and that means regulatory compliance is a must for any serious investor. By achieving regulatory compliance, Web3 platforms demonstrate they’re committed to growing the decentralized finance system in a secure and ethical way, reassuring stakeholders, creating new opportunities for high-net-worth individuals.",Information,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 06:46:30

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW.

The asset hit an intraday low of $93,810 during trading in Asia on Monday morning but recovered quickly to tap $96,000 before another slip. Those losses have resulted in a “bearish engulfing” weekly candle, as reported by crypto analyst “Rekt Capital.” All of the gains over the past month have now been wiped out in the correction. “Bitcoin is showing increasing signs of transitioning into a multi-week correction,” he said. #BTC Bitcoin has confirmed a Bearish Engulfing candlestick formation $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/KnIptVe958 pic.twitter.com/XwUWCkjTvM — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) December 23, 2024 Bitcoin Corrections Are Normal “Historically, week eight in Bitcoin price discovery tends to be a corrective week,” the analyst added while providing a comparison with previous market cycles. In 2017, week nine was also corrective, but to a much lesser extent than week eight, he observed, before adding : “Generally, once BTC clears the typically corrective weeks 7 and 8 – the retrace gets close to a bottom.” It is also the worst week for the asset since Donald Trump won the US presidential election in early November. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s cautious policy outlook has tempered optimism over Trump’s embrace of the crypto sector. Nevertheless, BTC remains up more than 40% since Trump’s victory. “We should hold the $90,000 level for Bitcoin into the year-end, but if we break below that could trigger further liquidations,” Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets, told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX, said the “low-liquidity environment may bring more volatility as we enter into the final days of the year.” He pointed out that Dec. 27 will also likely see the biggest crypto options expiry event of its history, with almost $18 billion in notional value BTC and ETH contracts expiring. Additionally, spot Bitcoin ETFs shed almost $950 million on Thursday and Friday as investors were rattled by the market pullback. Some Altcoins Showing Recovery There are a handful of altcoins showing minor bounces from their correction dips this Monday morning. Solana (SOL) made 2.2% on the day to reach $186, Chainlink (LINK) was up 5.1%, topping $23, Toncoin (TON) made 3.5% to reach $5.50, and Stellar (XLM) was up 3%, trading at $0.363 at the time of writing.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell 8.8% to nearly $95,000 last week, the biggest percentage drop since August, according to data source TradingView and CoinDesk Indices. The losses came as the Federal Reserve signaled fewer rate cuts for next year while stressing that it prohibited from holding BTC and doesn't seek a change in the law to do so. The so-called hawkish rate projections also roiled sentiment in traditional markets, leading to a 2% drop in the S&P 500 and a 0.8% gain in the dollar index, lifting it to the highest since October 2022. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the so-called risk-free rate, rose 14 basis points, breaking out bullishly from a technical pattern. The risk-off mood may persist for some time, according to Andre Dragosch, director and head of research Europe at Bitwise. ""The big macro picture is that the Fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place as financial conditions have continued to tighten despite 3 consecutive rate cuts since September. Meanwhile, real-time measures of consumer price inflation have re-accelerated over the past months to new highs as well judging by truflation‘s indicator for U.S. inflation,"" Dragosch told CoinDesk. Dragosch is one of the few observers who correctly predicted a massive BTC price rally in late July when the sentiment was hardly bullish. BTC put in lows near $50,000 around that time and recently topped $100,000 for the first time on record. ""So, it’s quite likely that we will see more pain in the coming weeks, but this could be an interesting buying opportunity given the ongoing tailwinds provided by the BTC supply deficit,"" Dragosch added. The hardening of the Treasury yields, representing higher borrowing costs and relative attractiveness of fixed-income investments, typically leads to outflow from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks. A stronger dollar also makes USD-based assets expensive, discouraging capital inflows. Inflation following the 1970s model? If you have been following financial markets for a while, you have likely encountered discussions that price pressures in the U.S. economy are on the same inflation rollercoaster ride as the 1970s. Back then, the second wave was more intense than the first. Dragosch notes that the sticky CPI inflation readings in recent months have raised concerns at the Fed about a potential second wave, leading to a more cautious stance on rate cuts. ""They are probably scared of the double hump scenario and a revival of the 70s twin peak in inflation which is why they are probably too reluctant to cut rates more aggressively,"" Dragosch said. ""They risk a significant acceleration in inflation if they cut rates aggressively, if they do little, the economy may suffer."" Eventually, however, the financial tightening caused by rising yields and the dollar index would force the Fed to take action, Dragosch added, stressing BTC's supply scarcity as a major bullish factor over the long run.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Trading,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-23 07:02:14

Dubbed the “Crypto Council,” Hines will work alongside tech entrepreneur and Artificial Intelligence and Crypto Czar David Sacks to create a regulatory framework for the digital assets sector, as confirmed by Trump in a Dec. 22 Truth Social post . Appointed last month as Trump’s AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks will spearhead the newly formed crypto council, tasked with shaping digital asset policies, collaborating with Congress on regulatory frameworks, establishing a Bitcoin reserve, and coordinating efforts with key agencies like the SEC, CFTC, and the Treasury. Sacks and Hines—both seen as staunch advocates for the crypto industry—are expected to drive innovation, create growth opportunities, and ensure industry leaders have the tools needed to thrive in an evolving digital economy, Trump wrote, adding: “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can flourish and remain a cornerstone of our Nation’s technological advancement.” You might also like: Crypto firms vying for a place on Trump’s ‘Crypto Council’: report In a Dec. 23 X post , Hines expressed his enthusiasm for taking up the new role, calling it an “honor of a lifetime.” The crypto community has largely welcomed Hines’ appointment with optimism, viewing it as a positive step toward regulatory clarity and industry growth. Prominent figures, including MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, have publicly congratulated Hines. See below. Congratulations, Bo. It's a tough job, but you're up for it — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 23, 2024 Hines ran for the House this year in North Carolina’s 6th District but fell short in the Republican primaries, placing fourth among the candidates. In his previous bid in 2022, Hines ran for North Carolina’s 13th District but narrowly lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in the general election. The former football player has also received backing from influential pro-crypto political action committees, including the American Dream Federal Action super PAC. Additionally, during his 2022 congressional campaign, he was supported by former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who is currently serving time for campaign finance violations. Hines’ appointment reflects Trump’s ongoing strategy of surrounding himself with pro-crypto allies as he builds his new administration. This approach aligns with his earlier nomination of former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, a well-known advocate for clearer crypto regulations, to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose tenure has been marked by regulatory uncertainty, frequent lawsuits, and aggressive enforcement actions against the crypto industry.

Given early DTX investors are currently enjoying over 440% gains, this new crypto is quickly flipping the portfolios of investors. Analysts estimate enormous gains for DTX, with up to 100x rallies post-launch, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) holders remain optimistic for a bullish continuation. Read on to discover why DTX Exchange is positioned to be the best crypto investment of this bull cycle. DTX Exchange (DTX) Promises Explosive Returns for All Investors By guaranteeing a fair and democratized token distribution method that levels the playing field for both retail and institutional investors, DTX Exchange is enhancing crypto investment. As a result, DTX Exchange removes the power of venture capitalists and whales by offering equal opportunity to all. Through its creative cliff pricing strategy, DTX encourages early involvement. While governance tokens empower token holders with a role in determining the future of the platform, token holders also gain from the earnings of the platform as well as from trade discounts. DTX holders tend to make substantial passive income because of this investor-centric approach. Meanwhile, DTX also gives access to over 120,000 financial assets including currencies, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. Supported by the robust VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange presents an unmatched trading experience distinguished by security, speed, and efficiency. Early DTX investors have already witnessed returns exceeding 440% as the current token price is just $0.12 in its sixth ICO round. Meanwhile, DTX is expected to get listed at $0.20 on key exchanges like Uniswap, Binance, and Bybit in Q1 2025. DTX is set for exponential growth as projections show up to 100x gains after its debut, making it the best crypto investment right now. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Consolidates Extensively The Shiba Inu price has lately gone through a phase of consolidation as it swings between $0.000030 and $0.000026 before falling to the main $0.000020 support level. Long-term hope is still intact even as the weekly Shiba Inu price chart shows a bearish pattern of lower highs and lower lows suggesting that bears are under control for now. Higher highs and higher lows on the annual Shiba Inu price chart point to the possibility of growing momentum. Although some may find the current Shiba Inu price action pessimistic, analysts are hopeful that the altcoin may rise toward its all-time high of $0.000088 soon, offering investors hope for a significant comeback. For those looking for even more exponential gains, DTX offers a more promising substitute nonetheless. Despite being one of the promising altcoins to watch, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has a market capitalization of about $11 billion, but DTX has far more room to skyrocket with a market capitalization of just $57 million. DTX is fast attracting attention as it gets set for its official launch in Q1 2025. Meanwhile, DTX has already yielded an amazing 440% ROI in just a few months during its presale phase. According to analysts, there could be up to 100x rallies post-launch, making DTX the best crypto investment right now. Bullish Sentiment Remains as Cardano (ADA) Eyes Potential ATH Retest The Cardano price has shown some volatility recently; last week the price dropped more than 22%, yet over the past month it rose by almost 4%. The Cardano price has primarily been consolidating between $1.35 and $0.74, but the community sentiment is still very positive and many see a possible bullish breakout soon. While the Momentum Oscillator advises prudence with its sell signals, technical indicators such as the MACD and Moving Averages are showing buy signals on the Cardano price chart, therefore boosting investor confidence. Though the Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin is trading more than 70% below its ATH of $3.10, analysts remain hopeful, predicting that the altcoin might retest its ATH in this bull run. Cardano (ADA) is among the altcoins to watch over the next few months as long-term investors are hoping for a great rally. Although Cardano’s (ADA) future seems promising, DTX offers a far larger chance for exponential increase. DTX gives investors much more opportunity for big ROIs than Cardano (ADA), with a market valuation of just about $57 million, compared to Cardano’s (ADA) $29 billion. DTX’s small market cap will make it much easier for the token to skyrocket in value. DTX Exchange Promises More Gains Than Shiba Inu and Cardano While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) face bearish pressure, DTX Exchange (DTX) is yielding big gains for holders. DTX is revolutionizing the crypto investing scene with its fair token distribution, modern VulcanX blockchain, and more than 440% ROI within a few months during its presale. This is an opportunity too great to overlook with DTX’s small market cap and ambitious rally forecasts of up to 100x post-launch.

The company has spent 20.872 billion yen in total on Bitcoin acquisitions, the document reads. The latest purchase is the largest so far for the Tokyo-headquartered company and comes just days after Metaplanet issued its 5th Series of Ordinary Bonds via private placement with EVO FUND, raising 5 billion yen (approximately $32 million).

Despite the retreat, on-chain metrics indicate that Bitcoin is still undervalued based on its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV-Z) score, which stands at 2.84 — below the threshold of 3.7 that historically signals an asset is overvalued.

The analysis, initially suggesting a big fall for XRP, is revealed upon closer examination to project a significant upward movement for XRP, with potential targets aligning with Fibonacci retracement levels. The chart shared by EGRAG CRYPTO appears visually inverted, which might be misleading at first glance. However, a closer look makes the bullish sentiment clear. The analyst identified three key levels derived from Fibonacci extensions, a common tool in financial market analysis to identify potential price targets after a breakout, and an analysis of the asset’s extended consolidation and repetition of historic patterns. #XRP – The Big Fall: It has already began At $2 Dollar Mark. Soon I'll be welcoming you in Valhalla. #XRPFamily STAY STEADY and STRONG pic.twitter.com/1PPh1jgyS0 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 22, 2024 Targets for XRP’s Next Run EGRAG CRYPTO noted the $2 mark as the beginning of XRP’s journey. In early December, the digital asset crossed over the $2 level for the first time since 2018, and EGRAG CRYPTO believes the asset has entered a new phase. The first target is $5.89, a level the analyst has previously described as a measured move preceding a pump to double digits . Notably, this target represents a new all-time high for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The digital asset is currently trading at $2.2, and this target represents a 167.7% increase from its current price. However, this is just the start, as EGRAG CRYPTO has much higher expectations for the digital asset. The second target is $15, a massive 581.8% increase that significantly exceeds XRP’s previous all-time highs. This prediction signals a potential for strong market adoption or major developments in the cryptocurrency space. The final target is $18.5, which is 740.9% higher than the asset’s current price, and would bring life-changing wealth to early investors. The Increasing Bullish Sentiment Surrounding XRP EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis has sparked excitement within the XRP community. His analysis reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, as many analysts have recently shared bullish predictions for XRP. The identification of Fibonacci-based targets at $5.89, $15.00, and $18.50 reinforces this bullish outlook for XRP. While the asset has a strong technical foundation, notable developments within the crypto space like the recent launch of RLUSD and growing adoption through Ripple’s global partnerships could speed up this predicted rally.

Will the Decline Continue? Analysts Answered!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-the-trump-rally-over-in-bitcoin-will-the-decline-continue-analysts-answered/,"As is known, although the FED cut the interest rate by 25 basis points last week in line with expectations, FED Chairman Jerome Powell made hawkish statements. Following these statements, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp decline to $92,000 levels, recording its first weekly loss since Donald Trump's US election victory. Bitcoin has fallen more than 7% in a week, suffering its first weekly loss since Donald Trump won the US presidential election, Bloomberg reported. This is the sharpest decline since September, driven by the cautious Fed stance that has cooled enthusiasm for Trump’s cryptocurrency-friendly stance. The Fed made its third consecutive rate cut on Wednesday, but Powell signaled that monetary easing, or rate cuts, would be slower next year to keep inflation under control, sending global stocks into a downward spiral. The decline in stocks also had a negative impact on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, while Powell's hawkish stance and his statement that he would not agree with Trump's promise of a national Bitcoin reserve deepened the decline even further. Evaluating the decline in Bitcoin and the latest situation, liquidity provider Arbelos Markets analyst Sean McNulty stated that the record outflow in US spot Bitcoin ETFs last week could lower prices even further in the short term. “We need to maintain the $90,000 level for Bitcoin until the end of the year for further upside, but if we fall below that level we could trigger further liquidation. “In the past week, options traders have also been hedging to the downside. At this point, we see big buyers at the $75,000 to $80,000 hits in January, February and March.” FalconX head of research David Lawant said there will be a major bull run in the first quarter of 2025, but prices will remain volatile in the short term before then. “As we enter the final days of the year, the low liquidity environment could lead to more volatility, especially with cryptocurrencies set to see the largest option expiration in history on December 27,” Lawant said. *This is not investment advice.

This rise highlights the growing interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Verge XVG Coin Recored Massive Gain As of now, Verge (XVG) has been gaining significant momentum, currently trading at around $0.013 . While it has seen a slight dip from its earlier peak, the token still boasts a 27% increase in the past 24 hours, showcasing its resilience. Over the past month, XVG’s price has surged by 90.7%, adding an average of $0.00034 to its value. This steady growth highlights its strengthening position in the crypto market. Additionally, with an impressive year-to-date (YTD) growth of 238%, XVG’s market cap now stands at slightly above $215 million. What Makes Verge Stand Out? Verge is a decentralized blockchain that focuses on privacy and anonymity. It improves on Bitcoin’s original blockchain by adding privacy tools like Tor integration and VergePay, which lets users send funds to stealth addresses. Originally launched in 2014 as DogeCoinDark, Verge was rebranded in 2016 to better align with its goals. It uses Simple Payment Verification (SPV) technology for faster transactions and competes with other privacy-focused coins like Monero and Zcash. XVG Price Prediction According to Coinpedia’s predictions , XVG could reach $0.0149 by the end of 2024 if its bullish momentum continues. Looking further ahead, the token might climb as high as $0.03508 in 2025, provided it maintains its resistance levels. With its robust performance and focus on privacy, Verge is gaining momentum as a noteworthy contender in the evolving crypto market. If its current trajectory holds, XVG may achieve new milestones in the coming months.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 07:17:36

The crowd has gone into a full Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) state, which could actually be beneficial for bitcoin’s upcoming price movements. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 23.12.2024. Source: TradingView Crowd Hints at Recovery? Just six days ago, the primary cryptocurrency was flying high above $100,000 and ever skyrocketed to its latest all-time high of just over $108,000. This put the gains following Trump’s victory at roughly 60%. However, the landscape changed on Wednesday after the hawkish comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell about fewer interest rate cuts for 2025. In what turned out to be the worst trading week for BTC since Trump’s win, the cryptocurrency dropped by 15% from the aforementioned peak to $92,000. Although it has managed to recover some ground, it still fails to bounce off in a manner similar to the previous corrections and is currently struggling to remain above $95,000. According to the crypto analytics platform Santiment, this extended correction has made the crowd fearful as the overall sentiment was sent “down to its most negative statistical point of the year.” However, this could be a blessing in disguise for BTC as the asset tends to move in the opposite direction of retail investors’ expectations, said the report.

The cryptocurrency currently sits at the lower end of the crucial support, which extends from $97,041 to $93,806. In fact, the asset slipped below the latter during the night but managed to bounce off, at least for now. The key support zone for #Bitcoin $BTC now lies between $97,041 and $93,806.

There are rumours that top crypto investors are preparing aggressive strategies to achieve tremendous benefits from the market. An acclaimed crypto investor, identified as VirtualBacon on X, grabbed the attention of the crypto community, revealing his crypto investment strategy to achieve $1M in gains in the coming year. In his X post, he explained meticulously how he aims to achieve his target, and even invited investors to track his portfolio. Let’s examine his strategy. Crypto Investors’ Crypto Portfolio & Strategy: A General Overview The crypto investor noted that in the year 2024 the crypto market benefited greatly from the approvals received for Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs. He also identified that the altcoin market has broken its consolidation phase and is likely to outperform Bitcoin soon. Considering key factors like the beginning of altseason, the outperformance of ETH over BTC in late bull runs and the exceptional performance of Solana in the current crypto cycle, he reduced his exposure in Bitcoin from 20% to 10%, and maintained his exposure to Ethereum and Solana at 20% each. However, he projected these three cryptocurrencies as the foundation of his portfolio. Notably, he revealed that his altcoin investment strategy would primarily focus on six categories: Layer 1, Layer 2, Gaming, AI, RWA, and DeFi. Is the 2025 crypto bull run your opportunity to 10x? #Bitcoin is hitting new all-time highs, altcoins are catching fire, and the Federal Reserve’s money printer is poised to return. This could be the biggest year in crypto history. Here’s how I’m building my $1M crypto… — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) December 22, 2024 Crypto Investor’s Layer 1 & Layer 2 Strategy: Top Picks He stated that his layer 1 choices would include Avalanche, Toncoin, Kaspa, Aptos, Sei, and Algorand, highlighting a wide variety of reasons from AVAX’s gaming, RWA, and DeFi roots and TON’s solid infrastructure to ALGO’s exceptional tokenomics. He also mentioned that his layer 2 picks would contain Metis and Mantle, pointing at reasons including METIS’s innovations in memecoins, gaming and AI, and MNT’s strong backing from Bybit. Gaming Altcoins: Top Picks of the Crypto Investor Expressing his interest in making the gaming altcoin category the largest in his portfolio, he revealed that his gaming altcoin portfolio would be composed of Superverse, Beam, Zentry, Wilder World, XBorg, Seedworld, Super Champs, Play Network, Sidus, pointing at a variety of reasons from infrastructure and growth potential to innovation. NEAR to NOS: Crypto Investors’s AI Altcoin Choices He noted that his Al altcoin choices would include Near Protocol, Bittensor, Arweave, HumansAI, AIOZ Network, BasedAI, Paal AI and Nosana, pointing at reasons including NEAR’s scalability, TAO’s tokenomics, AR’s plan to embrace decentralised computing, BASEDAI’s staking-focused tokenomics, and NOS’s Solana-based compute network. RWA, DeFI, and Memecoin: What We Know About The Investor’s Choice He revealed that his RWA picks would be Axelar and Clearpool, projecting reasons including AXL’s interoperability and CPOOL’s institutional backing. He added that his DeFI choices would be Wrapped Ampleforth, SwissBorg and mETH Protocol, highlighting reasons such as WAMPL’s dominance in the rebasing tokens category, and COOK’s high TVL and low valuation. He also announced that his memecoin picks would be PEPE, MOG, BRETT, WIF, GOAT, PUFF, FOXY, and M3M3, emphasising a wide variety of reasons from PEPE’s strong community backing and cultural relevance, to GOAT’s popularity as the first AI agent-backed memecoin. Snapshot of the Crypto Investor’s Aggressive Portfolio Sharing the snapshot of his aggressive crypto portfolio plan, he asserted that he would invest 10% in Bitcoin, 20% in Ethereum, 20% in Solana, 16.4% in Gaming, 10.9% in AI, 7% in Memecoins, 9% in Layer-1 and Layer-2, 3.1% in RWA and 3.7% in DeFi. He claimed that his three prime strategies to survive and thrive would be to avoid overleveraging, focus on high-conviction sectors and have an exit strategy. In conclusion, the cryptocurrency investor’s strategy highlights the need for adaptability, diversification, and calculated risk-taking. With careful allocation across proven narratives and categories, he hopes to maximise returns in the anticipated 2025 crypto bull run.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 07:26:59

Justin Sun Sells $143M ETH,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-ethereum-falling-justin-sun-sells-143m-eth/,"The post Why Is Ethereum Falling? Justin Sun Sells $143M ETH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is feeling the heat of bearish momentum. Ethereum has had a rough week, and Justin Sun seems to be right in the middle of it. The Tron founder has been selling off his ETH holdings, and it’s creating ripples in the market. Over the past week, he sold $143 million worth of ETH. This is about half of his ETH holdings. His action resulted in a big price drop for Ethereum. The community has a lot of questions toward him. Is he playing some games that others are unaware of? There are many more questions behind a single question about why is ethereum falling. Let’s explore the factors. Justin Sun: Selling and Staking Since November 10, he’s deposited 108,919 ETH into HTX (formerly Huobi), worth around $400 million, according to data by Spot on chain .Most of these deposits happened when prices were near their highs, averaging $3,674 per ETH. Source : Spot on chain Blockchain experts have noticed Sun is also unstaking large amounts of ETH. Specifically, 42,904 ETH, valued at $139 million, was unstaked from Lido Finance recently. People suspect he might move these funds to HTX as well. With so much activity, it’s no surprise Ethereum’s price has been struggling. Ethereum’s Price Takes a Hit Ethereum is currently trading at $3,304. That’s a 17% drop since its recent rejection at $4,000. In just the last 24 hours, it’s fallen another 2.19%. Trading volume is also down, dropping 8.57%. Source : Coinglass The sentiment in the market doesn’t look great either. Most traders seem bearish. Futures data shows that 54% of open trades are short positions, and the long-short ratio is at 0.8495. But there’s still a silver lining—78% of Ethereum holders are in profit at the current price. Looking at technical analysis, Ethereum is nearing a crucial support level at $3,260. If it falls below that, prices could go to $3,000, where the 200-day moving average might offer some stability. Still, with RSI sitting at 39.28 (close to oversold territory) and ADX showing bearish momentum, the outlook isn’t promising. What’s Next? The big question is whether Ethereum can hold above $3,260. If not, we might see it drop as low as $2,800, especially if whales like Justin Sun keep selling. Some analysts believe Ethereum is still in a “safe zone” for now. But others warn that low weekend trading volumes and stock market uncertainty could bring more volatility. This might have cleared your curiosity for the question why is ethereum falling. For now, investors should stay cautious. Ethereum’s price swings aren’t new, but the market’s reaction to Justin Sun’s moves has everyone paying closer attention.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 07:29:45

Pepeto is gaining traction as a standout meme coin, combining a compelling narrative with smart features, positioning itself as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. Table of Contents Adverse market condition plunge Pepe price Why is Pepe Falling? Will Pepe rebound? Pepeto vs. rising meme coin stars How to join Pepeto About PEPETO After many days of celebrating a level above $100k, Bitcoin’s price has dropped. As the Fed’s recent declaration led to a token sell-off, the entire crypto market is trading in the red zone. Pepe, the world’s third-largest crypto by market capitalization, has dropped by more than 16% in a month, with the majority of the drop occurring since last week. Will Pepe make a comeback, or should investors start to focus on alternative investments? Adverse market condition plunge Pepe price While the third quarter of 2024 proved beneficial for the crypto market, especially since Bitcoin’s surge past the $100k mark pushed other meme coins such as Pepe to new highs, in the last few days, Pepe has started to trade in the red. Since December 9th, the Pepe price has fallen by more than 43%. It is currently trading around the $0.000016 level and has a market capitalization of more than $7.11 billion. Why is Pepe Falling? Pepe’s recent fall has been the result of adverse market conditions, triggered by the Fed’s outlook for fewer rate cuts in 2025. Another reason behind the market’s downward trend was Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve’s Chair, dispelling any rumors of a potential Bitcoin reserve. “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin,” Powell said following the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, which highlighted that the US Central Bank has no intention of being involved in any government efforts to stockpile large amounts of Bitcoin. This dropped the BTC price, creating a chain reaction that adversely impacted the broader crypto space. Pepe’s price is a victim of this drop. Will Pepe rebound? Pepe’s recent drop has been very steep, with three large red candles forming recently. The RSI indicator shows that it is getting closer to the oversold zone (currently at 37). The MACD histogram has also painted a long red, indicating that a further drop may be coming soon. The critical support for the token right now is around the $0.000006 level. Once the Pepe price reaches there, there is a possibility of a rebound. Now, whether or not the token is able to recapture its recent high will depend on the community’s strength and broader market conditions. Pepeto vs. rising meme coin stars The rise of Pepeto mirrors the success of other standout memecoins like Pepe Unchained (PEPU), which secured $73 million during its presale and delivered over 171% gains post-listing, and CatSlap (SLAP), which rewarded early investors with an impressive 3,450% return.

Experts Even Predict a Potential 3x Growth in 2025,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/intelmarkets-intl-price-rises-710-more-upswings-ahead/,"The post Top Crypto Coins SOL and SHIB Facing Turbulence? Not This Rising Presale Star! Experts Even Predict a Potential 3x Growth in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is volatile, with tokens like Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) showing some price dips. However, market analysts like Batman and Del Crxpto remain optimistic about these crypto coins with their price predictions. Amid all these developments, a new phase eight presale star has only gone up—IntelMarkets (INTL). Early buyers of this altcoin are already 710% richer, and it has raised nearly $5M. Interest in it is so high that many experts foresee a potential 3x surge for INTL in 2025. IntelMarkets (INTL) Price Rises 710%, More Upswings Ahead While Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are showing some red price charts, IntelMarkets (INTL) is bucking the trend. This crypto ICO event has already seen a 500% price surge. Since this presale is now in phase eight, its value will rise as this event advances. With nearly 4M INTL tokens sold, traders are excited about what this token will offer. Speaking of which, holding this altcoin will result in: Reduced Trading Fee: Up to 30% discounts on trading fees on the IntelMarkets platform. Governance Rights: The ability to give input on the upcoming developments for this platform. Prioritized Feature Rollout: INTL holders will get first dibs on new features or products from IntelMarkets. The IntelMarkets platform is also getting attention as it will combine AI technology and blockchain. It will introduce the first AI-powered smart trading platform with self-learning trading robots and more. In other words, IntelMarkets is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the AI market, which Statista predicts may be worth $826B by 2030. Traders interested in this platform’s growth potential are now buying the INTL token . It costs only $0.073, a 710% rise from its starting price. However, this altcoin price will rise to $0.082 after phase nine of the presale starts. In fact, a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.11, potentially making INTL one of the best altcoins for fast returns. Solana (SOL) Price Dips, but Analyst Remains Bullish Solana (SOL) is among the best cryptos but has seen some red price charts. According to CoinMarketCap, its value fell over 20% in the past month alone. The Solana price moved between $240 and below $180 during that time. However, crypto analyst Batman remains optimistic for Solana (SOL). In a recent X post, he said that now is the ideal time to start scaling into crypto coins like SOL. As a Solana price prediction, he predicts a potential surge past $240. Although the Solana coin may see a price surge again, experts think it may not be as high as expected. As its price has increased nearly 150% in the past year, the highest upswings may have come and passed. Del Crxpto: A Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price of $0.01 May Come As one of the biggest meme coins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a lackluster performance recently. On the one-week chart, the price of Shiba Inu has fallen nearly 30% as per CoinMarketCap. Right now, traders are paying attention to market expert Del Crxpto. According to his X post, the dream of Shiba Inu (SHIB) hitting the $0.01 level may become a reality now. Therefore, investors are excited about this Shiba Inu price prediction. However, the Shiba Inu market cap now stands at $11B, which could slow down its growth. To clarify, this meme coin will need more money for its price to skyrocket. Meanwhile, tokens like IntelMarkets will not have this problem. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Surge Ahead of Solana (SOL) & Shiba Inu (SHIB)? While Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) face some challenges, IntelMarkets (INTL) is riding a bullish wave. This newcomer will bring innovation, real-world utility, and more. Plus, its low market cap means that this altcoin will need less money for its price to rise. Therefore, experts foresee a potential surge of 3x for INTL in 2025.

There are a few economic reports due out this week despite it being a holiday period. However, they are unlikely to impact crypto markets. “We expect volatility from last week to carry over into early this week,” commented the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events Dec. 23 to 27 Most of last week’s losses were due to the reaction to the news from the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, in which it made the decision to reduce rates by 0.25%. However, the central bank’s “Dot Plot” revealed that policymakers expect only two interest rate cuts next year, not the four they had predicted in September. Additionally, Fed chair Jerome Powell anticipated higher core inflation in 2025 than was previously forecast, adding that the central bank is “going to be cautious about further cuts.” Monday will see December’s Consumer Confidence Index report, which conveys the level of consumer confidence in economic activity, impacting their spending, which contributes about 70% of GDP. Also related to spending is November’s Durable Goods Orders report, which is due on Tuesday. This data measures the cost of orders received by manufacturers for durable goods, such as vehicles and electrical appliances. The report helps assess the state of US production activity and reflects the demand for big-ticket goods, which is also related to consumer confidence and economic sentiment. Key Events This Week: 1.

Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets continued to decline over the weekend, with total capitalization falling to $3.4 trillion on Monday morning as around $200 billion left the space on Saturday and Sunday. The correction has wiped out all gains over the past month, sending markets back to late November levels. Bitcoin continues to pull back with a daily loss of 3%, sending it back below $94,000 during the Monday morning Asian trading session. The asset has now retreated 13% from its Dec. 17 all-time high of $108,000 and is heading back to support level in the low $90K range. Ethereum has tanked even harder, plummeting 20% from its high of over $4,000 last week to bottom out below $3,200 in late trading on Sunday.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI.

With a market cap of $200B, these digital currencies, pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, provide stability and efficiency, making them an attractive alternative to traditional financial systems. SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, is one such company leveraging stablecoins to streamline the complex nature of global financing. Why Currency Risks Matter ? Before we dive into the benefits of Stablecoins let’s understand why it poses a risk for companies operating internationally. For example, a U.S. company receiving payments in Brazilian reais (BRL) could face losses when converting to U.S. dollars if the exchange rate shifts unfavorably. SpaceX, through its Starlink satellite internet service, serves customers worldwide, including regions with unstable or weak currencies. To mitigate these risks, SpaceX has turned to stablecoins. How SpaceX Uses Stablecoins According to venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya in his All-in podcast said that SpaceX collects payments from Starlink users in countries with volatile currencies. These payments are converted into stablecoins, which are then exchanged for U.S. dollars. This approach minimizes currency risks, simplifies transactions, and eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming bank transfers. Stablecoins also enable faster international transfers, providing a competitive edge in a rapidly digitizing world. Stablecoins vs. Traditional Financial Systems Moving on, Palihapitiya believes stablecoins could revolutionize cross-border payments, replacing outdated banking infrastructure and reducing excessive fees charged by traditional financial institutions. Beyond banks, stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle are emerging as competitors to payment giants such as MasterCard and American Express. Even a modest reduction in transaction costs, like the 3% charged by platforms like Stripe, could significantly boost global economic growth. Musk’s Crypto Vision Elon Musk’s interest in cryptocurrencies extends beyond SpaceX. Tesla’s Bitcoin investment has already proven successful, and Musk has integrated cryptocurrency tipping through X. The future of stablecoins is bright with Elon Musk’s support the industry may see a mainstream adoption soon. Presently it is also buzzing as Elon is expected to be Trump’s advisor in the white house and with these two top pro-crypto forces coming together AI, stablecoins, and Memecoins can be considered hot investment choices by big industrial giants.",News|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 07:48:19

While opinion remains divided, major asset management firm VanEck has claimed in its latest report that a strategic Bitcoin reserve could reduce the US national debt by up to 36% by 2050. VanEck analysts stated in a recent report that the United States could reduce its national debt by 35% over the next 24 years if it created a reserve of 1 million Bitcoins under a bill proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis. VanEck based his prediction on a Bitcoin assumption. Accordingly, if Bitcoin’s annual appreciation rate reaches 25%, its price could skyrocket to $42 million by 2049. As Bitcoin’s price increases, the US national debt will rise from $37 trillion at the beginning of 2025 to $119.3 trillion over the same period, with a 5% CAGR. At this point, VanEck head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel and investment analyst Nathan Frankovitz said, “A Bitcoin reserve created could represent approximately 35% of the national debt by 2049, offsetting approximately $42 trillion in liabilities.” Sigel and Franlovitz also suggested that the US halt the sale of Bitcoin and start initial Bitcoin purchases through the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The duo added that under the Bitcoin bill presented by Lummis, the US could reuse the 198,100 Bitcoins it seized, while financing the remaining 801,900 Bitcoins through Emergency Support Functions. *This is not investment advice.

Nonetheless, analysts are still concerned about the possibility of the XRP price reaching new highs sooner than later, with some giving projections into the two-digit threshold at $10 and beyond. Interestingly, crypto analyst Cryptoinsightuk recently shared his thoughts on social media platform X, drawing attention to a potential roadmap for XRP to achieve this ambitious target. Mirroring The 2017 XRP Price Pattern Cryptoinsightuk has brought a compelling perspective to the ongoing XRP price correction and its previous rally, highlighting how its current trajectory resembles the movement it experienced in 2017. Back then, XRP consolidated a little bit in early 2017 before undergoing a powerful rally that extended into 2018. Related Reading: XRP Battles Critical $2.20 Support Level — Will It Target $2.70 Or Slip To $1.96? With this in mind, technical analysis from Cryptoinsightuk adjusted the price action at that time to size in relation to XRP’s previous breakout in early October. According to this, if XRP continues to follow the 2017 pattern, the cryptocurrency could replicate this crazy move throughout 2025. Interestingly, the analyst’s overlay of the 2017 price action suggested that the XRP’s 460% price breakout from its early October range of $0.5 is already halfway into replicating this movement. If this were to continue playing out this way, the analyst expects XRP to break above $10 in the first quarter of 2025. However, Cryptoinsightuk’s projections extend beyond this initial $10 target in Q1 2025. If XRP’s price continues to mimic the historic movement beyond the first quarter, the analyst envisions what he describes as a “moon boy blow-off top.” This phase, which is characterized by a larger parabolic surge in price, could push XRP as high as $35 by the third or fourth quarter of 2025. Factors To Push XRP’s Bullish Trajectory CryptoinsightUK’s bullish outlook on XRP hinges on the cryptocurrency’s ability to replicate its 2017 movement. Back then, the parabolic surge saw XRP go from below $0.0060 until it reached its current all-time high of $3.40. Punching in the numbers, this comes up to around 56,000% gain over 12 months or so.

Analyst Highlights Bollinger Band Retest Mirroring Jan. 2024 Rally While XRP is currently in a positive market sentiment to continue a strong bullish move, market conditions in 2024 are different from those in 2017. Furthermore, the amount of inflow capital needed to reach $10 or $35 at this point would be far greater than what it took to reach $3.4 in 2018. However, increased institutional involvement and factors like political and expected regulatory positivity in 2025 suggest that the XRP price could nonetheless go on a comparable surge. Additionally, broader crypto market trends, such as Bitcoin’s performance, could contribute to the predicted XRP price surge. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.18. Reaching the $10 and $35 price targets would translate to a 358% and 1,505% move, respectively.

In a new interview on the Block Rewards podcast, Samson Mow says that BTC is almost ready to graduate from printing “god candles” – $10,000 daily moves – to “omega candles” representing $100,000 daily moves. Mow notes that in some countries with much weaker currencies than the USD, omega candles are already taking place on a regular basis. “The world’s going to change. After $100,000, I think everything starts to accelerate and go faster. So post-$100,000 we’re not going to be watching $500 candles. A $1,000 candle is already kind of normal in one day in terms of volatility, and I think the next step from that is the $10,000 and $100,000. We almost had a god candle a couple weeks ago. I think we went up $9,000 on the day. But $100,000 is the next step. Once we start to go well into the higher ranges of Bitcoin. But it just goes to show you the fiat system does not really make sense anymore because an omega candle is nothing in terms of fiat money. Like the debt increases by a couple of omega candles every day – many, many omega candles each day, but no one blinks an eye for that. There’s this disconnect between the fiat monetary system where that’s normalized. It’s growing very fast at ridiculous rates but it’s normal. But when you talk about Bitcoin, people are like ‘Whoa that’s crazy.’ But it’s not at all. So the omega candle is just a big move up in Bitcoin price. And the interesting thing is we already see omega candles in countries with weaker fiat currencies: Egypt, Turkey, Argentina even, it’s normal. Omega candles every day.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,126.

The small-cap memecoin project, with a fully diluted valuation of about $683 million and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $1.1 billion, dropped more than 50 percent two weeks to trade about $0.68 on Monday, December 23, 2024, during the mid-European session. After an impressive rally during and after the US 2024 elections, PNUT price has significantly slowed down in the recent past. Moreover, the ongoing Bitcoin correction has sent bearish shivers to the entire altcoin industry, resulting in further recovery of the BTC dominance to hover above 58 percent at the time of this writing. PNUT Fundamentals The PNUT memecoin has gained significant attention from speculative traders in the past few weeks following the notable listing on major cryptocurrency exchanges. Following the successful listing on the Binance exchange, which has over 240 million global users, Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) recently announced the listing of PNUT. As a result, the highly liquid memecoin with a locked liquidity of over $12 million, has attracted over 78k on-chain holders. However, the PNUT memecoin has faced significant headwinds from legal action filed by Mark Longo, alias the squirrel dad. Recently, Longo issued a cease and desist letter to Binance and Coinbase for using his former pet’s image without approval. Longo has been accused of being a memecoin scammer after allegedly rug-pulling several projects before launching Justice for Peanut (JFP).

In the four-hour time frame, the PNUT price has been forming a potential double bottom, coupled with a rising divergence on the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). In case of further crypto bullish sentiment, PNUT’s price could easily rally towards $1 and set the pace for a new pump towards a new ATH.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 08:04:42

Will HMSTR Price Hit $0.01 Before 2025? The Hamster Kombat token is valued at $0.002656 and requires a more than 73% jump to achieve the $0.01. Although the HMSTR token has previously achieved this milestone, this will be a bigger challenge for the token, especially considering the declining player interest in the game. The Hamster Kombat is a telegram mini-game that lets the players earn rewards by tapping and completing simple tasks. It achieved extreme popularity in mid-year, reaching an active user base of 300M plus, but the same has dropped to 27M per recent findings by Protos. Even the popular exchange Binance delisted the HMSTR token due to insufficient trading activity, confirming its poor performance. More importantly, the more significant issue with the HMSTR price hitting $0.01 is the time constraint, as 2025 is just a week away. Even during the previous rally, the crypto market’s bullishness favored the token, which is currently lacking, with two more Bitcoin crashes coming next . This eventually makes the challenge tougher, as the HMSTR price is under consolidation and has a downtrend since it created the ATH of $0.01004 in late September. Although the Hamster Kombat S2 news has brought people’s attention to the Telegram game, it requires a much stronger bullish push to help out the token. More importantly, there is intense selling pressure on the token as the seller attempts to profit from this season 2 influenced rally, which pushed the HMSTR price by 4% within a day. If bullishness stays persistent for the token, the Hasmter Kombat price might surge to 0.0041846 next. Now, the eyes are on the S2 beta launch to extend this rally. Hamster Kombat S2 Beta Out With $3K Prize Pool Season 1 of the tap-to-earn game ended successfully, but things began to fall, with the Hamster Kombat price struggling on the charts. In this, the user’s disappointment with the airdrop led to the token’s price struggle and declining user base. However, many analysts have anticipated recovery with the Hamster Kombat S2 launch, which is coming soon. According to an X announcement , the beta version of the second season is out, which will give players insights into what’s coming next. The team revealed that the second season will include three games, building the foundation for HamsterVerse. Additionally, there is ‘Cleam Contest,’ which offers a $3k prize pool for the contributors. The most important part is that the prize will be distributed randomly, so participation is only needed during beta tests to earn in the $3k price pool. Is Season 2 The Way For HMSTR Price Rally? A new season launch is the only way for the HSMTR price rally, as the holder’s interest is declining. Within a few months, the userbase for the Hamster Kombat game has dropped more than 90% from 300M to 27M, which is eventually impacting the token’s performance. Moreover, the long consolidating price pattern puts the token in negative sentiments. However, the Hamster Kombat S2 launch is still away, as only the beta version is out, so the current sentiments lack to push the token to $0.01 before 2025. However, things may change with the actual Hamster Kombat season 2 launch in the future.

More than 40% of the tokens have plummeted in value, and investors are now “raising eyebrows” on whether Binance Alpha projects are worth looking towards. According to an insight shared on X by @sankin_eth on X, 17 of the 29 tokens that debuted on Binance Alpha have yielded returns for investors, while 12, representing 41% of the total have shown a decrease in their Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) from their initial listing values. The market capitalization of these tokens at the time of listing ranged significantly, with the highest valued less than a billion dollars and the lowest above ten million. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) accounted for 41.4% of the listed assets. In terms of thematic classification or ‘narrative’, the tokens were categorized into six sectors, with artificial intelligence (AI) agents, animal-themed memes, and DeFi being the most prominent. Tokens plummet after Binance Alpha launch Although some tokens saw substantial gains after their launch announcement, several experienced sharp declines. BOB saw the steepest drop, plummeting 23.2% within 24 hours, while BANANA fell 14.4%. PSTAKE also faced a decline, albeit less severe, with a 7% decrease over the same period. 2024-12-23 #BinanceAlpha 上线资产统计 基于 Binance Web3 Wallet 的 Binance Alpha 在上周 3 天的时间分别分四批上线了 29 个代币（第四批时只上线了 9 个代币），过了一个周末，看看这些代币截至目前的市值表现如何？ 盈亏表现 29… pic.twitter.com/rgV4AZ0mva — 做表人小郭 (@sankin_eth) December 23, 2024 According to the analysis cited by Wu Blockchain on X, Solana memecoin Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), which was released in the project’s second batch, suffered a 16% FDV downtick. DeFi tokens SYRUP and SD, launched in the same batch, also suffered the same fate, dropping 15% and 21% in FDV values, respectively. Moreover, tokens with smaller market capitalizations have shown significant volatility, with Shoggoth, FROG, BOB, TERMINUS, and GNON leading gains, each surging over 100%. Conversely, APX and GRIFFAIN recorded the steepest declines of 28% and 25%, in the mentioned order. Per @sankin_eth analysis , Binance Alpha has not yet created a significant wealth effect, suggesting that the true potential might only be realized once selected projects are listed on Binance’s main spot market. The crypto enthusiast recommended Binance Alpha to consider tokens with higher FDVs, ideally over one billion, to provide substantial growth opportunities for secondary market investors. Additionally, they emphasized on the importance of diversifying the coins further, and implementing a delisting mechanism for underperforming tokens, akin to Binance’s main exchange strategy, to maintain a curated selection of assets. Binance US set to make USD services active in 2025 Binance US, the American subsidiary of global crypto exchange Binance, is preparing to reintroduce US dollar services, aiming for an early 2025 launch. The update was shared by interim CEO Norman Reed in a recent blog post, who believes the exchange is making huge progress towards restoring the platform’s USD offerings in the US. “We are closer than ever to bringing back USD services and are focused on achieving this milestone in early 2025,” Reed stated. He further emphasized the platform’s commitment to offering low fees and high rewards to solidify its position in the competitive crypto market. The announcement follows recent comments by the exchange’s CEO Richard Teng, who, in a December 9 Bloomberg interview , described discussions about re-establishing the exchange in the United States as premature. The crypto exchange debuted in 2019, offering regulated cryptocurrency trading for American users. However, its operations faced a significant challenge in June 2023 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance. The SEC accused the company of failing to properly register Binance US as a securities exchange, and that they violated several regulatory laws.

In just over 24 hours, BTC dropped from around $108,000 to its current level of $95,000, as the Fed’s announcement about reducing rate cuts in 2025 hit the market hard. The drop led to BTC posting its first weekly decline since Donald Trump won the elections, with the asset down 9% over the past week. Almost all cryptocurrencies registered double-digit losses over the weekend, with BTC’s losses dwarfed by those of Ethereum (ETH), down nearly 15% over the past week as it slipped below $3,500. Solana (SOL) is down almost 3% in the past 24 hours and nearly 16% over the past week thanks to substantial losses over the weekend. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 21% over the past week. The crypto market cap is down just over 1.1% and currently sits at $3.3 trillion. Major Crypto Bloodbath The cryptocurrency market faced one of its biggest meltdowns in recent memory with $1.2 billion in liquidations as prices tumbled across the board. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) fell from an all-time high of over $108,000 to below $95,000. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) registered double-digit losses as the crypto market took a bearish turn. The downturn started after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments after the FOMC meeting. The markets, slowing down after a huge rally since Trump’s election, tumbled after Powell and the Fed took a hawkish stance and raised concerns about inflation. Powell also said the Fed would reduce rate cuts in 2025 from the forecasted four to two, triggering a significant selloff. Bitcoin (BTC)’s sharp fall Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply over the weekend after the Federal Reserve’s warning about inflation. As a result, around $500 billion was wiped out from the market. BTC dropped around 10% but was dwarfed by losses by Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that interest rates will not come down as quickly as expected and reduced the number of planned interest rate cuts to just two in 2025. BTC is currently trading around the $95,500 level. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, the founder of Ark Invest Capital, has reiterated her stance on BTC’s price. Wood predicted BTC would touch $1 million by 2030, giving BTC a market capitalization of $20 trillion. “[Bitcoin] is becoming even more scarce than gold. The difference between gold and bitcoin is, when the gold price goes up, as it has, production goes up, the rate of increase in the supply goes up—that can not happen with bitcoin.” Analysts expect BTC and other cryptocurrencies to be prone to wild price swings over the holidays and the next few weeks. James Tolenado, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, stated, “In terms of what is coming over the holiday period, the first rule of Bitcoin is that it is always volatile in the same way water is always wet. Its behavior is always mixed, and there is zero discernible pattern at the end of the year and going into the next. Sometimes, the price rises in the new year, and at other times it falls. So, historically, we can say that bitcoin exhibits typically mixed behavior over Christmas and New Year.” Coinbase, Kraken Donate $1M Towards Trump Inauguration Several cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, have donated towards Donald Trump’s inauguration. Coinbase and Kraken have donated $1 million each to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee. The committee is organizing events surrounding the January 20 swearing-in ceremony, including galas, parades, and dinners. Ripple has also pledged $5 million in XRP to the committee. Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s VP of US Policy, stated, “Coinbase is committed to working with the Administration and both sides of the aisle to create regulatory clarity for crypto. We’re eager to work with the most pro-crypto Administration in U.S. history as we build the future of crypto in America.” MoonPay has also pledged to donate to the inaugural committee, although the exact amount was not disclosed. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $96,000 over the weekend and fell to an intraday low of $92,072 on Friday. The drop comes after BTC surged past $100,000 to set a new all-time high, as the asset witnesses wild price swings. Analysts have said the price swings are the result of traders locking in profits after BTC crossed $100,000. BTC has been highly bullish since Trump’s election victory but experienced its first weekly decline since after markets turned bearish. BTC’s decline can also be attributed to statements by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who announced rate cuts would be reduced in 2025. Powell also stated the Fed is prohibited from holding BTC or other cryptocurrencies as reserve assets Despite BTC’s slump, analysts are confident about a recovery, with some suggesting it could go past $150,000 in 2025 thanks to growing institutional interest and favorable policies under the Trump administration. However, the weekend’s decline led to $258 million in liquidations across derivatives markets, including $30 million in long positions. Sentiment around BTC changed after it set a new all-time high on Tuesday. The asset started the previous week on a positive note, rising 1.50% to $105,746 on Monday. BTC continued to push higher on Tuesday, setting a new all-time high as it raced to $108,269. However, sentiment around BTC changed on Wednesday as the price plummeted almost 6% to $100,195. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as BTC rose to $102,792. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level, allowing sellers to take control. As a result, BTC fell below the 20-day SMA and $100,000, registering a drop of 2.49% and settling at $97,703. Source: TradingView BTC fell to an intraday low of $92,072 on Friday as it slipped below key support levels. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $98,124. The weekend saw bearish sentiment return as BTC fell to $97,505 after a marginal decline. Sunday saw a jump in selling activity as BTC dropped by 2.26% to $95,303, ending the weekend negatively. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers try to build momentum and push towards $100,000. On the other hand, if sellers retake control, BTC could drop below the 50-day SMA and go as low as $90,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH)’s recent decline has seen the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency slip below $3,500 after surging past $4,000 last week. ETH reached an intraday high of $4,106 last Monday as bullish sentiment peaked. ETH dropped on Tuesday instead of consolidating above this level, falling by 2.33% to go below $4,000 and settle at $3,892. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH dropped almost 7%, going below the 20-day SMA and settling at $3,625. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as ETH reached an intraday high of $3,762. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping almost 6% to go below the $3,500 level and settling at $3,415. Source: TradingView ETH plunged to an intraday low of $3,096 on Friday, falling below the 50-day SMA as sellers attempted to drive it below $3,000. However, it recovered from this level to climb above the 50-day SMA, reclaim $3,000, and settle at $3,470. Any hope for a sustained recovery was dashed over the weekend as ETH dropped almost 4% on Saturday to go below the 50-day SMA and settle at $3,336. ETH continued to decline on Sunday after failing to mount a recovery, dropping 1.71% and settling at $3,279. The current session sees ETH marginally up as buyers attempt a recovery. Buyers will look to build momentum and push ETH above the 50-day SMA. If they are successful, ETH will target the $3,500 level. However, if sellers retake control, ETH could drop to $3,000 before seeing a recovery. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is looking to recover after dropping to its support level of $180 over the weekend. SOL suffered a monumental decline after turning bearish on Wednesday, with the altcoin down almost 16% over the past week. SOL started the week in the red in an indication of things to come, dropping 3.55% to $216. However, it recovered on Tuesday, rising to an intraday high of $228 before settling at $223, an increase of 3.23%. Bearish sentiment returned Wednesday as SOL dropped by 7.50% to go below the 50-day SMA and settle at $206. Sellers retained control on Thursday as SOL slipped below $200 after a drop of just over 6% and settled at $193. Source: TradingView SOL plummeted to an intraday low of $175 on Friday, briefly falling below the $180 support level. However, it recovered to thwart selling pressure and registered a marginal increase to settle at $194. The recovery was short-lived as SOL was back in the red on Saturday after a failed attempt to reclaim $200. SOL reached an intraday high of $202 before turning bearish as sellers took control. As a result, SOL dropped almost 7% and fell to $181, just above the $180 support level. Buyers attempted a recovery on Sunday as SOL rose to an intraday high of $187 before losing momentum. As a result, SOL registered a marginal decline and settled at $180. SOL has recovered during the current session but is witnessing significant volatility, having dropped to an intraday low of $176 and an intraday high of $187 before settling at $181, a marginal increase. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Bearish sentiment around Dogecoin (DOGE) intensified last week as it plummeted below the 50-day SMA and a key support level. DOGE started the week in the red, dropping just over 1% on Monday and settling at $0.401. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell just over 2% to go below $0.40 and settle at $0.393. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as DOGE dropped over 9% and settled at $0.357, just above the $0.30 support level. DOGE registered a more substantial drop on Thursday, falling over 12% to slip below the 50-day SMA and a key support level to settle at $9.313. Source: TradingView DOGE plummeted to a low of $0.262 on Friday as sellers attempted to drive it below $0.30. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $0.30 and register a marginal increase to settle at $0.317. Saturday began with DOGE surging to $0.35 before losing momentum. As a result, it dropped back and settled at $0.319, registering only a marginal increase. However, it was back in the red on Sunday dropping by 2.47% and settling at $0.312. The current session sees DOGE marginally down as sellers attempt to push it below $0.30. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) has been trading downwards since hitting an intraday high of $2.72 on Tuesday. After reaching this level, XRP fell back, dropping to $2.56, ultimately registering an increase of 3.38%. However, sentiment changed on Wednesday as XRP plummeted over 10%, going below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2.30. Buyers attempted a recovery as XRP rose to an intraday high of $2.43. However, it could not go higher and fell by 3.10% to settle at $2.23. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as XRP dropped to an intraday low of $1.95. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.83%, settling at $2.27. Source: TradingView XRP could not sustain its recovery and fell back in the red on Saturday, dropping almost 2% and settling at $2.23. Sellers retained control on Sunday, pushing XRP down by 1.58% to $2.20. XRP has remained in the red during the current session, down 1.27% and trading at $2.17. Aptos (APT) Price Analysis Aptos (APT) has plummeted over the past week and is down a staggering 35% in the past seven days as bears tighten their grip. APT’s decline began on Tuesday when it fell over 7%, going below the 20-day SMA and settling at $12.92. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price dropped 8.2% to slip below the 50-day SMA and settle at $11.85. APT rose to an intraday high of $12.72 on Thursday as buyers attempted a recovery. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level and fell back, dropping just over 4% to $11.36.

Sellers retained control on Sunday, pushing APT down by 3.16% to $9.21. The current session sees APT down by 1.42% and trading at $9.10 as sellers look to drive the price below $9. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) dropped to a key support level on Monday when it fell to $6.58. With sellers retaining control on Tuesday, TIA dropped below this level and the 50-day SMA to $6.26, registering a fall of almost 5%.

Named the Nexo 7RCC Spot Bitcoin and Carbon Credit Futures ETF , this fund aims to merge cryptocurrency investment with sustainability, addressing the growing demand for responsible financial products. The proposed ETF will allocate 80% of its portfolio to Bitcoin and 20% to Carbon Credit Futures . This approach blends digital asset growth with environmentally focused financial instruments. Carbon credit futures are tied to the predicted value of carbon credits, commonly used to manage emissions under cap-and-trade systems in regions such as the European Union, California, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative . This structure ensures adaptability to regulatory changes while fostering sustainable investment practices. According to Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store , Nexo and 7RCC Global have submitted an S-1 amendment to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . Geraci described the ETF as an ""ESG version of a spot BTC ETF"" and expressed confidence in its potential approval. He noted that this ETF introduces a fresh perspective in a competitive market. The spot Bitcoin ETF market has seen $36 billion in net inflows since January, underlining substantial investor interest. If approved, this ESG-focused ETF will directly compete with industry leaders like BlackRock and Fidelity , offering investors an option that combines financial returns with environmental responsibility. Additionally, this proposal aligns with global climate initiatives, including the World Economic Forum's Safeguarding the Planet program . Nexo Co-founder Kalin Metodiev, CFA , emphasized the long-term vision behind the initiative, stating: “Today’s generation seeks not only to profit but to make a difference.” This ETF represents a significant step toward integrating cryptocurrency investment with sustainable finance, setting a new benchmark for responsible investment solutions.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-23 09:20:42

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 09:21:45

With Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below the $97K mark from its all-time high of $108K earlier this week, the market experienced significant volatility, leading to a bearish sentiment across major coins including Ethereum and Solana. Yet, amidst the downturn, several altcoins are bucking the trend, holding onto their recent gains and even posting impressive upticks. Among these, four altcoins stand out-Numogram (GNON), Minotaurus (MTAUR), Horizen (ZEN), and Koma Inu (KOMA). 4 Trending Altcoins Recording Double Gains This Festive Week As we move into festive week, here’s an in-depth look at these altcoins and their exceptional performance, even in a bearish market. 1. Numogram (GNON): A Philosophical Approach to AI and Blockchain Integration Numogram (GNON) is a decentralized infrastructure platform on the Solana blockchain, facilitating agent-to-agent communication and interaction analysis via its Echochambers feature. Its whitepaper highlights that the platform aims to overcome censorship in communication, enhancing performance and autonomy assessment. Priced at $0.0454, GNON’s philosophical framework merges concepts such as Providence, Cattalaxy, and Natural Selection, distinguishing it from other crypto tokens by emphasizing the enduring forces of nature and law that align with its decentralization principles. GNON has recently been selected for the Ryze Labs AI Combinator program , which accelerates AI development within the cryptocurrency sector. With such backing, GNON’s position within the crypto ecosystem looks promising, with its value up by 318.56% in the last month, a testament to growing investor confidence. 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): Gaming Ecosystem Gaining Momentum Minotaurus (MTAUR) has been achieving notable progress in the gaming industry, taking advantage of the thriving $15B casual gaming sector. At present, MTAUR tokens are available at a substantial markdown, presenting a compelling opportunity for buyers preferring early-stage cryptocurrencies . The presale price of 0.00006001 USDT indicates a 70% reduction from the expected listing price of 0.00020 USDT, and early participants who bought at 0.000040 USDT are already benefiting. Serving as a fundamental element of the Minotaurus gaming ecosystem, MTAUR grants access to exclusive features and benefits, such as a well-organized referral system and prolonged vesting choices that improve player participation and retention. Security remains a crucial focus, with audits carried out by SolidProof and Coinsult. The presale is backed by a giveaway program of 100,000 USDT, which boosts the momentum even more. As the market’s interest in decentralized gaming ecosystems expands, MTAUR’s prospects appear promising. 3. Horizen (ZEN): Privacy and Scalability Leading the Way Horizen (ZEN) strengthens its role as a frontrunner in privacy-focused blockchain solutions by utilizing advanced cryptographic methods like zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs). Its modular framework enables developers to build both public and private blockchains, improving scalability and performance in decentralized applications (DApps). As a leader in blockchain environments, Horizen provides tailored solutions for companies and developers. A pivotal development is Grayscale’s establishment of the Horizen Trust , indicating increasing institutional confidence in ZEN. This trust enables accredited investors to access ZEN without the complexities of direct crypto ownership, aligning with Horizen’s vision to incorporate blockchain into mainstream uses. Additionally, Horizen features significant technological offerings, including sidechain technology for limitless scalability and improved privacy measures. Growing interest in real-world blockchain applications has led to the launch of projects such as supply chain and tokenized loyalty programs, further positioning ZEN as a reliable digital asset. Recent advancements include the Zendoo cross-chain transfer protocol and the Sphere Wallet for ZEN token management, supported by a decentralized network of around 45,000 active nodes. A noteworthy milestone was its recent listings and second halving in December 2024, enhancing tokenomics sustainability. With an 8.81% price increase over 24 hours, 91.33% and 204.72% rise over the week and month, respectively, ZEN’s future growth looks promising. $ZEN is officially listed for trading on @GainsNetwork_io ! On the heels of our final halving, and the upcoming prospective ZKV ( @ZKVProtocol ) token allocation for eligible $ZEN holders, we are growing ZEN’s accessibility across the ecosystem. There’s a lot on the Horizen! https://t.co/6wFhXpDdyv pic.twitter.com/D2uQn4NHth — Horizen (@horizenglobal) December 17, 2024 4. Koma Inu (KOMA): A BSC Altcoin with Big Ambitions Koma Inu (KOMA), is a new altcoin emerging on the Binance Smart Chain landscape, and it’s generating plenty of buzz. Launched in October 2024, this project has been gaining momentum rapidly as it focuses on community spirit, drawing inspiration from Shiba Inu’s strategies and other prominent meme cryptocurrencies. KOMA isn’t merely another meme coin to buy ; it aims high, seeking to disrupt the landscape with decentralized governance and injecting new vitality into the BSC space. KOMA’s price skyrocketed by over 150% in only the past month, reaching a market capitalization of $100 million. Additionally, individuals have exchanged $25.88 million of it within a 24-hour period. This significant surge is entirely attributed to KOMA being incorporated into Binance Futures, along with partnership with DWF Labs for strategic discussions. There is also an excitement surrounding USDT-backed perpetual contracts for KOMA that Binance just launched. Discuss the propellant for the token’s price surge! Moving ahead, Koma Inu plans to establish additional strategic partnerships and secure positions on various trading platforms. Analysts forecast that KOMA might reach the $1 threshold by 2025. As one of the best BNB coins to invest in, Koma Inu has generated a strong loyal fanbase. Its prospects looks quite positive, as it receives significant interest and support from major trading platforms. Final Thoughts Despite the broader market facing a decline, prominent coins such as Numogram, Minotaurus, Horizen, and Koma Inu are shining brightly with their impressive growth and appealing platforms. As the festive week proceeds, these alcoins are offering fantastic opportunities for quick profits or a long-term investment with your funds.

While altcoins were expected to follow the trend and some popular ones are doing so, cryptos like Algorand (ALGO) and Aave (AAVE) have stood apart. The growing interest in these tokens suggests that a liquidity flow from Bitcoin to altcoins has begun, which may continue for some time. Algorand (ALGO) Preparing for a 40% Upswing Algorand attracted huge bullish attention soon after its breakout in the first few days of November, which raised the price by over 470%. Currently, the price is facing some pullback, primarily due to less participation of bulls. However, this period is expected to fade off soon as the technicals have flashed massive bullish signals, suggesting a bullish close for the year. As seen in the above chart, the ALGO price faced a 35% correction followed by a decent rise in the price. Although the volume has entered the restrictive range, it may not ascertain the rise in the dominance of bears. The MACD suggests a drop in selling pressure while the DMI is heading towards a bullish crossover. Hence the price is stuck below 0.5 FIB and is expected to breach the levels and reclaim the yearly highs, probably before the year-end. AAVE Price May Reach $500 if These Levels are Secured in 2024 The AAVE price triggered a consolidated ascending trend since the start of the second half of the year that revived the possibility of reaching $500. Meanwhile, a couple of pullbacks hindered the progress of the rally but eventually, the latest rebound revived the upper targets. Therefore, the price is now believed to maintain a consolidated ascending trend for the rest of 2024 and secure the important resistance required to start 2025 on a bullish note. The AAVE price has broken above the rising parallel channel followed by a pullback. However, the token has revamped a strong rebound and is about to test the resistance of the channel, flashing bullish signals. Besides, DMI failed to validate a bearish crossover while the levels flipped completely and a strong bullish divergence in RSI suggests a continuation of a bullish trend. Therefore, it is now important for the token to secure an important resistance at $420.03 that may lead the price to $500 in the first few days of 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,AAVE|ALGO|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 09:23:42

According to the analyst, the next 10 days are critical for XRP’s trajectory, with the possibility of reaching $50 by early 2025. Various chart patterns, including yearly and bi-monthly candle trends, highlight a potentially explosive growth phase. #XRP – High Timeframe (HTF) Analysis: TRUST ME, U'RE NOT #BULLISH ENOUGH, EVEN THE OGs Time for a Thread (1/7) The next 10 days are crucial for #XRP . From a Pure TA perspective (ignoring fundamentals for a moment), this could be the most pivotal price action in XRP's… pic.twitter.com/Hrx225lglT — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 20, 2024 Key Price Milestone on the Yearly Candle The 12-month (yearly) candle provides a clearer view of XRP’s long-term direction. A crucial price level to monitor is $1.99. This corresponds to the closing body of XRP’s 2017 yearly candle. If XRP successfully closes above this level, it would represent a historic breakthrough, signaling the beginning of a new growth phase. Such a move could lead to increased investor confidence and heightened demand, reinforcing XRP’s upward momentum in the market. Impact of Demand Dynamics on XRP’s Price Demand dynamics play a vital role in shaping XRP’s price behavior. When prices rise, demand often remains inelastic, meaning buyers continue to purchase despite higher costs. This phenomenon is largely fueled by FOMO (fear of missing out) and investor anticipation of further gains. However, as prices escalate, demand can become more elastic, as some buyers may hesitate to commit at elevated levels. Key factors such as utility-driven adoption, institutional interest, and the introduction of ETFs could sustain demand even at higher price points, mitigating the risk of demand fatigue. Momentum from Bi-Annual and Quarterly Charts The 6-month (bi-annual) and 3-month (quarterly) charts provide insight into XRP’s market behavior. Unlike the highly volatile cycle in 2017, the bi-annual chart suggests a steadier and more controlled growth trajectory this time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Exponential Moving Average (EMA) reflects consistent upward momentum, with a 30-degree angle suggesting a sustainable growth pattern and reducing the likelihood of sudden trend reversals. Furthermore, the quarterly RSI (Relative Strength Index) is already above 70, signaling strong upward momentum. Analysts project the RSI could rise to 87 or even 96, indicating the possibility of substantial price increases in the near term. Bi-Monthly Chart Highlights a Bullish Scenario The bi-monthly (2-month) chart reveals a bullish setup as XRP is currently positioned above equilibrium, a level it last held prior to a massive 13x price rally. This positioning suggests that XRP could be on the verge of another significant upward movement, with potential targets as high as $13 becoming increasingly achievable. Current Price and Market Outlook As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.23. With the market becoming increasingly competitive, investors are closely monitoring critical price levels and indicators. If current momentum persists and key technical levels are breached, XRP could achieve the ambitious target of $50 by early January 2025.

Nokia Technologies Co., Ltd. reportedly filed for a patent on Dec. 23, 2024, under the title “Device method and computer program” to improve the encryption of digital assets. The patent was submitted to the National Intellectual Property Administration in Jun. 2024 and was given publication number CN 119155674 A. Nokia is making a big move by entering the rapidly growing field of digital asset encryption, which is becoming crucial in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. According to the abstract of the patent, this proposed system described in the patent will allow user devices to securely encrypt digital assets using a “first key,” which is employed to encrypt the assets and ensure their security. This key is likely part of a symmetric or asymmetric encryption system, where a single key (symmetric) or a pair of public/private keys (asymmetric) is used to ensure that only authorized parties can decrypt and access the digital asset.

Encryption guarantees that only people with permission can access and manage digital assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In the case of Bitcoin ( BTC ), for instance, encryption ensures that only the private key holder can access and manage the coins stored in a wallet. In the absence of encryption, any digital asset can be susceptible to theft and hacking. Following the application of the ‘first key’, a “first network function” is then provided with the encrypted assets and an index that monitors the encryption process for further handling, which may involve processing or verification. To ensure the secure and traceable management of digital assets across networks, the system also features a mechanism for identifying these encrypted digital assets. This identification is subsequently sent to a first entity for validation or authorization, with the first network function acting as a trusted node or service that processes the encrypted assets and performs tasks such as additional verification. The patent serves as an identification process that ensures that the assets are traceable and can be validated by the right parties before they are transferred or used in a transaction.

Analyst Explains,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/worst-case-scenario-bitcoin-right-now/,"In his latest video published on December 21, crypto analyst Rekt Capital tried to answer the question “What’s The Worst Case Scenario For Bitcoin Right Now?”. After reaching a new all-time high at $108,374 on December 17, the BTC price is down more than -11%. How Low Can Bitcoin Price Go? Rekt Capital put the Bitcoin price pullback in a historical perspective, underscoring the historical importance of weeks 6, 7, and 8 in a “price discovery uptrend.” Drawing upon past cycles such as 2013, 2016–2017, and 2021, he explained that Bitcoin has a strong tendency to correct during these specific windows, with some dips reaching as steep as 34% or even higher. “Understanding these weeks is crucial because they tend to be problematic for Bitcoin,” Rekt Capital stated, referencing past cycles where significant downturns occurred within this timeframe. For instance, in week 7 of the 2013 cycle, Bitcoin experienced a dramatic 75% pullback over 13 weeks. Similarly, the 2016-2017 period saw a 34% decline in week 8, underscoring the recurring vulnerability during these specific weeks. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In For This Cycle? On-Chain Signals You Need To Know As of the current cycle, Bitcoin has undergone a 10%+ retracement, bringing its price into a historically critical support zone at $96,537 on the weekly chart. Rekt Capital emphasized the importance of this support level, noting, “This area of historical support has enabled the move to $108,000.” He cautioned that failure to maintain this support could trigger a more severe correction down to $89,830. Examining the price action of the last few days, Rekt Capital pointed out the emergence of a bearish engulfing candle in the weekly timeframe—a technical indicator often associated with potential reversals. “We’re losing resistances that turned into support,” he observed. This loss signifies a potential transition into a corrective period, as the price struggles to maintain its upward trajectory. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Peak Lies Above $225,000, The Timeline Will Shock You Rekt Capital also pointed out the importance of maintaining the 5-week technical line in his analysis. “If we lose this 5-week technical uptrend and the orange trend line, it would be mounting evidence that we might be transitioning into a corrective period,” he warned. Furthermore, he addressed the CME gap between the $78,000 and $80,000 price levels, a critical area that has remained unfilled. “Delving into 26%, 27%, 28% dips could fill the entire CME gap,” Rekt Capital noted. Historically, CME gaps have the tendency to get filled whereas there are a few ones which have never been filled. Despite all cautionary signals, Rekt Capital maintains a bullish stance in the long-term “These pullbacks are what enable future uptrends in the parabolic phase of the cycle,” he explained. Drawing from previous cycles, he illustrated how corrections have historically provided the necessary “breather” for the market. In the 2021 cycle, for example, Bitcoin experienced a 16% pullback in week 6 and an 8% dip in week 8, yet the overall trend continued upward. Similarly, the current 10% retracement, while significant, could serve as a preparatory phase for the next leg of price discovery. At press time, BTC traded at $95,000.

Table of Contents Rollblock blends utility with meme coin culture in gambling industry Solana finds staggering success as top utility token of 2024 Dogecoin rally shows importance of community in crypto value AI sees stellar 2025 growth for Rollblock When we asked AI which crypto token was next to pump after Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE), it gave us a simple answer: Rollblock (RBLK). AI pointed out that this GambleFi protocol combines the utility of Solana with the meme coin community of Dogecoin. AI also mentioned that this altcoin’s small market capitalization means that it could rally more than 10,000% higher once its crypto presale ends, with early investors already seeing returns of over 300%. Rollblock blends utility with meme coin culture in gambling industry Rollblock has discovered the perfect opportunity in the lucrative gambling industry. The market generates over $500 billion in revenue each year, an increasing share of which is migrating online every day. Meanwhile, legacy online sites are plagued by backward technology and a poor player experience. Rollblock uses blockchain technology and meme coin culture to completely transform the online gambling experience. Instead of red tape, hidden fees and long delays, Rollblock players enjoy instant, transparent and seamless access to both global sports betting and over 7,000 of the industry’s best casino games. Rollblock has also used meme coin culture to enhance the player experience with its own massive social media ecosystem and a suite of generous rewards programs. Rollblock’s commitment to the community includes a weekly revenue-sharing program. This program operates RBLK buybacks through the casino’s own revenue and then either gives them out as high-APY rewards for staking or burns them in weekly events to drive market value. AI has identified Rollblock’s online gambling approach as the perfect blend of crypto utility with meme coin culture in a market that is primed for explosive growth. RBLK tokens are currently on sale at $0.043 at the time of writing, making now a fantastic opportunity to get involved. Solana finds staggering success as top utility token of 2024 AI identified Solana’s role in the meme coin market as the key to its staggering success. The Solana price rose over 1,000% from late 2023 as it came to redefine the market for Layer 1 blockchains. While other Layer 1 blockchains were struggling with the perennial problem of external scaling solutions, Solana’s internal solution set it apart. Solana was able to rapidly scale up to challenge the largest Layer 1 blockchain ecosystems by many metrics. Now Solana is poised to become the largest Layer 1 blockchain as it rapidly scales from its current price of $182.13. Dogecoin rally shows importance of community in crypto value The blistering year-end rally in the Dogecoin price was fueled not by utility but by its massive meme coin community. The Dogecoin price rallied over 300% in a matter of weeks as its community made it the top meme coin for celebrating Donald Trump’s election victory. Dogecoin’s meme coin rally demonstrates the importance of community in creating crypto value. Dogecoin continues to have the biggest and most dedicated community with some community members anticipating a price increase to $1 in 2025. AI sees stellar 2025 growth for Rollblock AI suggests that Rollblock perfectly captures the value created by both Solana and Dogecoin in 2024. Now this top altcoin is poised for more than 10,000% growth when its crypto presale ends, with only days remaining for its current stage nine price of $0.043.

The notice urges international authorities to locate and detain him for extradition. Heart, whose real name is Richard James Schueler, faces claims of failing to meet tax obligations worth hundreds of millions of euros and allegedly assaulting a 16-year-old. Despite the gravity of these accusations, Heart remains defiant, dismissing the charges as part of a conspiracy against him. He expressed confidence in his projects and voiced hope that the anticipated Trump administration would bring favorable outcomes for his legal battles. In a public statement, Heart said he feels safe and excited about the future, emphasizing that his platforms — HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX — are operating successfully. Earlier this year, Heart’s legal team attempted to counter the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ( SEC ) allegations of securities fraud in a letter addressed to Judge Carol Bagley Amon of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The SEC’s investigation is part of an ongoing scrutiny of his business operations. Surprisingly, the price of the HEX token surged by 30% following the announcement of the Red Notice, reflecting an unusual market reaction. However, this spike has been overshadowed by a significant drop in HEX’s market capitalization, which has reportedly halved in December. PulseX, another project tied to Heart, also experienced a sharp decline in total value locked, falling by nearly $200 million within the same period. Heart continues to maintain his innocence, portraying himself as a visionary being targeted by powerful adversaries. He claims his lifelong preparation for future challenges is now paying off and insists that his projects remain resilient despite legal and financial setbacks. While Interpol intensifies its efforts to apprehend Heart, the cryptocurrency community remains divided. Some supporters view him as a misunderstood innovator, while critics see him as a symbol of excess and unaccountability within the sector. Regardless of opinions, the outcome of Heart’s legal battles will likely have far-reaching consequences for the projects he founded and for investor confidence in his platforms.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-23 09:35:19

Hines will collaborate with David Sacks, who oversees both crypto and AI policy, signaling a structured approach to digital asset strategy. Trump’s announcement on Truth Social emphasized the need for innovation while providing the crypto industry with essential institutional support. Hines, a former congressional candidate from North Carolina, brings political experience and connections to the role. He previously secured the Republican nomination in 2022 but lost the general election to Democrat Wiley Nickel. In 2024, he attempted another primary run in North Carolina's 6th district but finished fourth with 14.4% of the vote. Despite these setbacks, Hines maintained visibility in conservative circles, partly due to his ties to pro-crypto funding sources during his campaigns. Hines’ appointment highlights his past financial backing from crypto-affiliated Political Action Committees (PACs) , including contributions linked to former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who is currently serving a prison sentence for campaign finance violations. These connections have sparked discussions about Hines' role in shaping future crypto policy. In his statement, Hines expressed enthusiasm for his new position, saying he looks forward to working with David Sacks to foster innovation in the digital assets industry. He emphasized the importance of ensuring the sector thrives as a key driver of the nation's technological progress. While Hines lacks a detailed public record on crypto policy, his appointment alongside an established figure like David Sacks suggests a shift toward a more structured and integrated approach to digital asset regulation. The creation of a dedicated ""Crypto Council"" under Trump's advisory framework signals a heightened focus on balancing innovation with regulatory oversight . This move comes at a critical time for the crypto industry, which faces ongoing regulatory challenges and increasing pressure for institutional adoption. The effectiveness of this advisory council will depend on how well it manages to address industry concerns while promoting sustainable growth. Trump’s decision to bring Hines and Sacks together reflects a broader strategy aimed at strengthening the role of digital assets in the U.S. economy. Observers will be watching closely to see if this team can deliver meaningful policy outcomes in an industry often marked by volatility and uncertainty.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-23 09:39:14

Saylor advocates for a clear framework to regulate digital assets in the U.S. He proposes classifying them into categories like digital commodities (e.g., Bitcoin), digital securities (e.g., stocks), digital currencies (e.g., stablecoins), digital tokens (e.g., utility tokens), NFTs (e.g., unique digital assets), and digital ABTs (backed by physical assets). Additionally, he calls for a system that establishes clear rights and responsibilities for issuers, exchanges, and owners to ensure confidence and legitimacy in the market. Key Proposals for Regulating Digital Assets He explained the opportunity for the U.S. to lead in the digital economy by implementing a strategic digital asset policy . This could strengthen the U.S. dollar, help manage national debt, and position the country as the global leader in digital assets.

It has launched its very own layer 2 solution. Currently active in testnet, the new product Unichain is attracting developers. Built using the OP Stack framework, this new project is all about improving scalability and security in DeFi. While the official mainnet launch is still months away, there’s already plenty to get excited about. Let’s have a look and explore if Uniswap Unichain is the future of DeFi. Achievements on Testnet Unichain has been quietly proving its potential on Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet since October. It handled over 50 million test transactions and deployed more than 4 million test contracts—numbers that show just how serious Uniswap is about this project. Even more impressive, the testnet has maintained 99% uptime for all critical systems. But it’s not just about flashy numbers. The project’s goal is security. That’s why Unichain plans to include permissionless fault proofs from day one on its mainnet. These proofs let users verify blockchain states and challenge any invalid transactions, building trust in the system. Unichain from its X account has shared the roadmap of the project. Back in October, we announced Unichain Today we’re sharing the official Unichain roadmap to public mainnet and beyond And we're also announcing that Unichain will go live with permissionless fault proofs from day one pic.twitter.com/BFtE9jvbIA — Unichain (@unichain) December 20, 2024 Before this can happen, though, the Sepolia testnet will go offline for maintenance starting January 6, 2025. This update will activate those fault proofs, setting the stage for a safer and more reliable network. What the Mainnet Brings The Unichain mainnet, set to launch in early 2025, isn’t just a copy of what’s already out there. It’s bringing some big innovations. Flashblocks will reduce block times to 250 milliseconds, making transactions almost instant. The Unichain Validation Network will let independent operators validate blockchain states, keeping things decentralized. Rollup-Boost by Flashbots is designed to securely build rollup blocks, ensuring both speed and safety. Once the mainnet is live, users will be able to bridge funds and interact with apps on Unichain. It will also join Optimism’s Superchain ecosystem, with Uniswap Labs taking a key role as a contributor to the OP Stack. What to Watch For Unichain, If delivers on its promises, it could set new benchmarks for Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. The emphasis on speed, security, and decentralization could change how we think about DeFi. With Uniswap already handling over $1 billion in daily transactions, the potential impact is huge. All eyes are now on the mainnet launch in 2025 . Would Unichain be able to deliver the revolutionary features it’s promising. What are your thoughts? Do you think that Uniswap Unichain is the future of DeFi?",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|UNI|OP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 09:43:25

Lummis believes this reserve could provide long-term financial stability and protect future generations from inherited debt burdens. VanEck’s analysis estimates that such a reserve could lower U.S. debt by approximately $42 trillion by 2049, assuming a 5% annual debt growth rate and a 25% yearly increase in Bitcoin's value. Under this projection, Bitcoin’s price would surpass $42 million , positioning it as a dominant global financial asset by mid-century. VanEck predicts that Bitcoin could eventually represent 18% of the world's total financial assets, which are expected to grow at an average rate of 7% annually. Mathew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research, highlighted Bitcoin's potential to become a major global settlement currency. He pointed out that Bitcoin could offer an alternative to the U.S. dollar, especially for nations aiming to bypass American financial sanctions. Sigel noted the increasing reliance on Bitcoin as a neutral asset for global trade agreements. To initiate this reserve, VanEck proposed several key actions, including halting the sale of Bitcoin from U.S. asset forfeiture reserves. They also suggested that policy adjustments under a potential Trump administration could accelerate the adoption of this strategy , such as revaluing gold reserves to market prices and utilizing the Exchange Stabilization Fund for Bitcoin purchases. These measures, according to VanEck, could bypass lengthy legislative processes and enable quicker implementation. However, not everyone is convinced. Venture capitalist Nic Carter expressed doubts about whether a Bitcoin reserve would genuinely strengthen the U.S. dollar or effectively manage national debt. Investor Peter Schiff offered an alternative solution, proposing the creation of a digital currency called ""USAcoin,"" modeled after Bitcoin but with improvements to enhance usability for everyday transactions. Schiff argued that such a digital currency, capped at 21 million units like Bitcoin, could provide financial stability without depending on volatile Bitcoin valuations. Despite the skepticism, VanEck remains confident that Bitcoin could play a transformative role in U.S. debt management and the global financial system. The debate highlights a growing divide between traditional financial approaches and emerging digital asset strategies. With influential figures on both sides, the future of Bitcoin in U.S. fiscal policy remains uncertain but undeniably significant.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-23 09:48:18

This proposal aligns with a bill introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, advocating for Bitcoin to play a central role in the country’s financial strategy. According to VanEck’s report released on December 20, the optimistic scenario assumes Bitcoin’s compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) at 25%, potentially reaching a staggering $42.3 million per Bitcoin by 2049. Simultaneously, the U.S. national debt is expected to grow at a 5% CAGR, climbing from $37 trillion in 2025 to $119.3 trillion. This strategic reserve could offset approximately $42 trillion in liabilities, VanEck’s digital asset experts, Matthew Sigel and Nathan Frankovitz, stated. For this scenario to materialize, Bitcoin’s price would need to start at $200,000 in 2025—more than double its current value of $95,360. Proposed Pathways for Bitcoin Reserve The Lummis bill suggests leveraging the 198,100 Bitcoin already seized by the U.S. government as a starting point. The remaining 801,900 Bitcoin could be acquired through creative financial measures, including reallocating part of the U.S.’s $455 billion gold reserves or using Emergency Support Functions, all without burdening taxpayers or printing more money. The prospect of Bitcoin’s price rising to $42.3 million would position it as a significant financial asset, representing 18% of the world’s $900 trillion market. This stands in stark contrast to its current 0.22% share. Geopolitical Implications Donald Trump’s incoming administration has also fueled the discussion around a Bitcoin reserve , with speculation that an executive order designating Bitcoin as a reserve asset could be issued on his first day in office. Meanwhile, Strike CEO Jack Mallers has echoed this possibility, adding to the ongoing Bitcoin price rally. VanEck believes global adoption trends could further bolster Bitcoin’s value. The report highlights potential influences from BRICS nations, suggesting that Bitcoin could increasingly serve as a settlement currency for global trade, particularly among countries aiming to bypass U.S. dollar sanctions. While Senator Lummis’ bill has yet to be reviewed by Congress, it represents a bold vision for integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. economy .

If true, this would make the UAE one of the largest holders of the cryptocurrency globally. However, these claims remain unverified . The speculation started after a vague tweet by Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao , on December 22. Zhao referenced an unconfirmed report suggesting the UAE has accumulated approximately 411,978 BTC, worth around $40 billion. This news ignited debate within the crypto community, with opinions ranging from excitement to skepticism. Crypto analyst Trader T highlighted that, if accurate, the UAE could rank among the top three Bitcoin holders globally and potentially hold the largest Bitcoin reserves of any national government. Despite the buzz, many in the crypto space have urged caution. Bitcoin Archive, a prominent source in the field, emphasized that there is no solid evidence backing these claims. They stated, “People are treating the UAE’s $40 billion Bitcoin purchase as a fact , but all available information suggests this is just a rumor circulating on social media.” This speculation follows a pattern of rumors suggesting that wealthy nations in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, might also be increasing their Bitcoin holdings. These rumors have gained traction as Bitcoin’s price recently surged past the $90,000 mark. However, much like the UAE claims, these reports are also unconfirmed. While the UAE’s alleged Bitcoin stash remains speculative, the idea of nation-states acquiring Bitcoin has been gaining momentum. One notable example is El Salvador , which has openly embraced Bitcoin as part of its national strategy. Recently, the country purchased an additional 11 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 5,993.77 BTC, valued at approximately $575 million. El Salvador’s decision to increase its Bitcoin reserves defies recommendations from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which had previously advised against such policies. Furthermore, Max Keiser, an advisor to El Salvador’s President, disclosed plans for the country to acquire an additional 20,000 BTC. He stated, “El Salvador is transitioning to a peaceful Bitcoin standard, with a goal to significantly boost its reserves.” Although concrete evidence regarding the UAE’s Bitcoin holdings is lacking, these discussions highlight a growing trend where countries are exploring Bitcoin as a strategic asset. For now, these claims about the UAE remain part of the broader speculation surrounding state-level interest in cryptocurrency.",,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-23 09:53:45

Near Protocol is gaining popularity for its scalability and developer-friendly design, and Render is redefining decentralized digital rendering with its platform. Meanwhile, Rollblock , a rising star in crypto gambling, is capturing interest with its unique DeFi integration. XRP, however, is notably absent from these projections, making way for these exciting contenders. Rollblock: Transforming online gambling with web3 technology Rollblock (RBLK) is redefining the traditional casino model for the modern era through its web3-powered platform. With the online gambling market valued at $450 billion and projected to grow by 8% annually over the next decade Rollblock is perfectly positioned to disrupt this thriving sector. Unlike traditional casinos known for dishonest practices, Rollblock ensures complete transparency. Each transaction is saved on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling players to place bets securely and fairly. The platform offers over 7,000 immersive games, including poker, roulette, slots, and new titles, including Candyland and Cash Compass. Rollblock also launched a sports betting option last month, and this upgrade has received overwhelmingly positive feedback. Trust is at the heart of Rollblock’s mission, reflected in its gaming license from the respected Anjouan Gaming Authority. The casino also offers a revenue-sharing model that rewards holders. Weekly, a percent of the casino’s revenue will be used to buy back tokens, burning 60% and distributing the remaining to holders. The platform’s unique approach has attracted over 32,000 presale registrants, with RBLK tokens now priced at $0.043 in stage 9 of its ICO.

Despite that, its 24-hour trading volume jumped 81%, suggesting that investors are buying the dip. In comparison, XRP also slid by 6% during the same period. Over the last month, Near Protocol lost 11% of its value, decreasing from $5.60 to $5.02. Nonetheless, the protocol is continuing to improve its blockchain scalability features. Near Protocol’s adoption of BlockDAG technology is set to improve efficiency, delivering faster transaction speeds and enhanced security. This innovation positions Near Protocol as a candidate for blockchain leadership. Render holds strong amid market volatility Render’s value has dropped by nearly 8% over the last 24 hours and is now trading at $6.94. Despite the dip, trading volume surged by 52%, indicating steady investor confidence in Render amid market volatility. Recently, Render achieved a $5 billion market cap and solidified its position as one of the leading AI coins. Currently ranking third in social dominance among the top five AI cryptocurrencies, Render trails FET and VIRTUAL, both of which have gained traction in recent weeks. However, Render’s robust market presence keeps it a significant player in the AI and blockchain industries. While XRP faces challenges in the broader market downturn, Render’s continued advancements set it apart. Analysts suggest RNDR could hit $15 by Q1 2025, aligning with growing confidence in AI-focused cryptocurrencies, much like XRP’s steady appeal among institutional investors. Rollblock outshines XRP, Render, Near Protocol with 3000% growth potential While XRP, Render, and Near Protocol face notable declines, Rollblock is gaining momentum as the most promising contender for long-term growth.

BTC Keeps Struggling A lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets within a week, and this has been the case for the past seven days or so. Just last Monday and Tuesday, BTC posted fresh gains and shot up above $108,000 to mark its latest all-time high.

Recent reports suggest that the United States could significantly reduce its national debt by establishing a Bitcoin reserve, while the cryptocurrency's current low social sentiment may indicate a near-term recovery above $100,000. US National Debt Could Shrink by 35% With Bitcoin Reserve, Says VanEck Report Asset management firm VanEck has suggested that the United States could reduce its national debt by 35% over the next 24 years by establishing a Bitcoin reserve of 1 million BTC. This idea, aligned with a bill proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, brings attention to the transformative potential of Bitcoin in offsetting the nation’s mounting liabilities. VanEck’s analysis projects a 25% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for Bitcoin , which could see its price soar to $42.3 million by 2049. Simultaneously, US national debt is expected to grow at a 5% CAGR, increasing from $37 trillion in 2025 to an astronomical $119.3 trillion by the same year. If Bitcoin’s growth aligns with these estimates, a 1-million-BTC reserve could offset roughly $42 trillion in liabilities, equivalent to 35% of the projected national debt. VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, and investment analyst Nathan Frankovitz detailed these findings in a Dec. 20 report . They emphasized that the plan hinges on an optimistic scenario in which Bitcoin’s price begins its growth trajectory at $200,000 in 2025, more than doubling from its current value of around $95,360. If Bitcoin were to reach $42.3 million, it would account for approximately 18% of the world’s financial assets—a staggering increase from its current 0.22% share of the $900 trillion global market. The concept of a national Bitcoin reserve has gained traction amid speculation that the incoming Trump administration might explore this idea. Reports suggest that former President Donald Trump’s administration is considering designating Bitcoin as a reserve asset via an executive order on his first day back in office, a move that has already fueled Bitcoin’s rally into six-figure territory. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a staunch advocate for cryptocurrency adoption, has introduced legislation to formalize such a reserve. However, her bill has yet to be reviewed by Congress. If enacted, the US could leverage its existing 198,100 BTC from asset seizures and acquire the remaining 801,900 BTC through measures like selling a portion of its $455 billion gold reserves. Crucially, this approach avoids the need for taxpayer funds or additional money printing. Ripple Effects on Bitcoin Adoption The proposal could trigger widespread adoption of Bitcoin at multiple levels of the US economy, including state governments, corporations, and institutions. VanEck’s analysts believe such adoption would support their bullish CAGR estimates for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s inclusion as a reserve asset could help stabilize its historically volatile boom-bust cycles, providing long-term market resilience. Beyond the United States, the report highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a settlement currency for international trade, especially among nations seeking alternatives to the US dollar. VanEck’s Sigel noted in a Dec. 21 social media post that BRICS countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—could increasingly adopt Bitcoin to sidestep escalating US sanctions, further driving its utility and value. Despite its promising outlook, the proposal faces significant hurdles. Bitcoin’s price trajectory must meet or exceed the optimistic CAGR estimates, and the US government would need to navigate the political and logistical complexities of such a strategy. Moreover, critics may question the feasibility of transitioning a portion of gold reserves into Bitcoin or the broader implications of relying on a highly volatile asset for debt reduction. VanEck’s ambitious proposal positions Bitcoin as more than just a speculative investment—it envisions the cryptocurrency as a pivotal tool in national debt management. While the road ahead is fraught with uncertainty, the potential for Bitcoin to offset trillions in US liabilities shows its transformative role in the global financial ecosystem. As Senator Lummis’ bill awaits legislative review, the world watches closely, pondering whether Bitcoin’s ascent could reshape not only markets but also national economies. Bitcoin’s Social Sentiment Hits 2024 Low: Signs Point to a $100,000 Recovery The cryptocurrency market has entered a crucial phase as Bitcoin’s social sentiment falls to its lowest point in 2024, raising hopes among contrarian analysts of a potential price recovery above the $100,000 mark. Despite a recent 10% correction from its all-time high of over $108,300 on Dec. 17, Bitcoin has managed to stabilize above $95,770 as of Dec. 23. Social media sentiment around Bitcoin has turned markedly bearish, with a ratio of four to five positive versus negative comments marking the lowest sentiment level this year. According to a Dec. 22 post by market intelligence platform Santiment, this widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among retail traders could signal an imminent price breakout. “Vocal traders are now showing severe FUD, and that's good news for contrarians who know markets move in the opposite direction of retail's expectations,” Santiment noted. Such contrarian signals often precede significant market movements, particularly in the cryptocurrency sector, where sentiment-driven trading plays a prominent role. Bitcoin’s current downturn has led to three consecutive daily red candles on its chart for the first time since early November, coinciding with the US presidential election period. This pattern has sparked discussions about the potential for a recovery, particularly among technical analysts relying on fractals and historical data to predict price movements. Fractal patterns, which identify recurring trends and key support and resistance levels, suggest an imminent rebound. Crypto analyst Elja Boom highlighted on Dec. 20 that Bitcoin’s current setup resembles past instances of rapid recovery, writing, “We have seen this before.” While optimism for a swift recovery above $100,000 is growing, some analysts caution that Bitcoin may face further downside in the near term. According to historical analysis by crypto strategist Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s price corrections in 2017 and 2021 extended into Weeks 8 and 9 of similar market phases. As Bitcoin approaches Week 8 of its current correction, this historical context suggests the potential for short-term bearish continuation. “In 2017, Week 7 as well as Weeks 8 and 9 were also corrective. In 2021, Week 6 and Week 8 were corrective. Bitcoin is currently in Week 7 and slowly transitioning into Week 8,” Rekt Capital explained in a Dec. 21 post. Long-Term Optimism: 2025 and Beyond Looking beyond 2024, analysts project an increasingly bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Crypto services provider Matrixport forecasts that improving global macroeconomic conditions and easing monetary policies could drive Bitcoin’s price above $160,000 by the end of 2025. As inflation cools and central banks pivot towards more accommodative stances, Bitcoin may benefit as a hedge against traditional financial instability. This potential shift could attract both institutional and retail investors, further solidifying Bitcoin’s role as a digital asset powerhouse. Despite the recent correction, Bitcoin remains a star performer in 2024, boasting year-to-date gains of nearly 130%. This momentum has attracted increasing attention from institutional players, whose long-term investments could provide a stabilizing force against the volatility often associated with retail-driven markets. The potential for Bitcoin to break out above $100,000 is also supported by growing adoption across various sectors. As more corporations and institutions integrate Bitcoin into their operations, the cryptocurrency is expected to gain greater legitimacy and mainstream acceptance. Bitcoin’s current phase of low social sentiment and price correction may be a turning point for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. While short-term volatility could persist, historical patterns and emerging fractal trends point to a potential recovery above the $100,000 mark before year’s end. Looking ahead, the macroeconomic environment and institutional adoption are set to play pivotal roles in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory, with analysts predicting an optimistic outlook for 2025 and beyond. For now, Bitcoin’s resilience amid bearish sentiment underscores its enduring appeal as a digital asset in an evolving financial landscape.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-23 10:00:00

Miran, a seasoned economist and a known advocate for digital assets, previously served as a Treasury official during Trump’s first term and is currently with Hudson Bay Capital Management. I am beyond honored that President Trump has chosen me to lead his Council of Economic Advisers. I look forward to working to help implement the President's policy agenda to create a booming, noninflationary economy that brings prosperity to all Americans! pic.twitter.com/CROmzuk61v — Stephen Miran (@SteveMiran) December 22, 2024 This move is considered Trump’s masterstroke to pump the shallowed faith of crypto investors after the Fed’s hawkish stance on Bitcoin dropping Bitcoin to its lowest. Will these moves help crypto recover from the dent? Let’s understand. A Crypto-Friendly Leader Miran’s appointment is part of a series of moves by the new administration to support cryptocurrency. He has always been a strong supporter of changing U.S. crypto rules to encourage new ideas and growth in the blockchain industry. In a recent podcast , Miran stressed the importance of clear regulations, believing they are crucial for the U.S. to stay competitive in the digital economy. Miran has shown independent thinking, especially in his criticism of the Federal Reserve’s policies. In 2020, he disagreed with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s call for more stimulus, arguing it was both politically and economically flawed. As the new head of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), Miran is expected to bring a fresh outlook on economic strategies, including those related to digital assets like cryptocurrency. Trump’s Crypto Agenda Miran’s appointment fits perfectly with Trump’s goal to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Trump has proposed bold ideas like creating a strategic bitcoin reserve and has consistently pushed to integrate digital assets into the country’s economy. Trump also appointed Bo Hines as Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. While Hines doesn’t have a crypto background, he will work closely with David Sacks, the administration’s “Crypto Czar,” to push forward the White House’s digital asset plans. Impact on Crypto Assets The series of pro-crypto appointments have already triggered bullish sentiment in the digital asset market. Bitcoin and Ethereum saw modest gains following the news. Analysts predict that Miran’s leadership, coupled with Trump’s crypto-forward policies, could pave the way for a surge in mainstream adoption. Even though BTC is technically on the verge of a breakout, analysts are waiting for some major crypto policy changes to see a green zone once again. On a cautious note, Ali Martinez, A Known Crypto Analyst shared that Bitcoin’s key support zone is currently between $97,041 and $93,806. If this area fails to hold, there could be a sharp drop to $70,085, as there is minimal support below this level.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 10:00:03

This potential retest signals a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency as market conditions turn unfavorable. Recent price action with negative signals from key technical indicators has intensified concerns about further downside risks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other metrics suggest growing selling pressure, making ADA’s ability to hold above this key level a matter of significance. A breach below $0.8119 could pave the way for more losses, potentially pulling ADA into uncharted bearish territory. However, defending this support level might provide the foundation for a stabilization or recovery. As the market sentiment shifts, can Cardano regain its footing or succumb to deeper declines? This critical juncture highlights the importance of monitoring technical and market-driven factors in the token’s ongoing journey. Technical Indicators Signal Further Downside For ADA Historically, the $0.8119 level has served as a crucial threshold for price action, acting as both a support and resistance point in previous market cycles. Its proximity now highlights the mounting challenges Cardano faces as bearish momentum continues to dominate the market. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Recovery Toward $2 As Million-Dollar Whale Transactions Explode On The Network The negative sentiment around the token is largely fueled by weakening technical indicators and a waning market mood. ADA remains below key moving averages, such as the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which underscores a prolonged downtrend. This alignment of the price below pivotal technical levels signals a lack of upward strength and an increased likelihood of more downside pressure. Adding to the bearish narrative is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has been trending lower, signaling intensified selling pressure. Currently hovering near oversold levels, the RSI reflects waning buyer interest and heightened dominance by sellers. Should the trend continue, it could pave the way for the altcoin to break below the $0.8119 mark, possibly triggering a new wave of selling. Potential Scenarios: Break Below $0.8119 Or Rebound? If ADA fails to hold above $0.8119, it may signal a continuation of downbeat momentum, potentially triggering a deeper decline. In this case, sellers might push the price toward lower support zones such as $0.6822 or even $0.5229 areas that have previously acted as stabilizing levels during market downturns. A break below $0.8119 would likely confirm seller dominance, further eroding market confidence and leading to heightened volatility. Related Reading: Cardano Could Be Heading For A 20% Correction – Technical Data Signals Bearish Price Structure On the other hand, a successful defense of the $0.8119 level could lay the groundwork for a rebound. Buyers may seize the opportunity to regain control, leveraging the support level as a springboard for recovery. This could result in ADA attempting to revisit resistance levels near $1.2630 or higher, reversing the bearish trend and reigniting optimism in the market.

Binance Pool Introduces Merged Mining for Junkcoin and Pepecoin This new feature allows miners to mine Litecoin (LTC) while also earning rewards in multiple cryptocurrencies, including LTC, Dogecoin (DOGE), Bellscoin (BELLS), Luckycoin (LKY), Junkcoin (JKC), and Pepecoin (PEP). Merged mining, also known as auxiliary proof of work (AuxPoW), allows miners to process transactions for multiple blockchains with a single computational effort. This increases efficiency and provides the opportunity to maximize earnings by mining additional coins alongside primary coins like Litecoin. By adding Junkcoin and Pepecoin to its merged mining program, Binance Pool continues to diversify its offerings by appealing to miners looking for alternative coins and higher potential rewards. The addition of JKC and PEP reflects Binance Pool’s efforts to support emerging cryptocurrencies and encourage participation in the mining ecosystem. This move is expected to support the growth of smaller blockchain networks while attracting miners looking to leverage their resources for greater profitability. Miners can join Binance Pool to take advantage of this new feature by configuring their mining setup to enable merged mining. Additional details and configuration instructions are available on the Binance Pool platform. As merged mining continues to gain traction, Binance Pool’s inclusion of Junkcoin and Pepecoin positions it as a versatile platform for both established and emerging cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

In late February, it touched an yearly peak of 19.28%. In mid-May, it plummeted to a low of 15.42%. Just before the launch of Ethereum spot ETFs, it rebounded to a peak of 18.8% in mid-June. However, since the launch, the ETH dominance has steadily dropped by around 5.42%. The big question now is: Can the year 2025 bring a turnaround? Bitcoin Dominance Overshadows Ethereum and Altcoins Since the start of this year, the Bitcoin market has climbed by over 115.76%. At the beginning of this year, the dominance of Bitcoin was around 51.58%. Right now, it stands at 58.71%, though between November 20 and December 7, the BTC dominance declined from a yearly peak of 61.19% to a low of 55.11%. Although between November 21 and December 6, the Ethereum dominance jumped sharply from 12.11% to 13.5%, since December 7, it has steeply slipped by at least 1.09%. Notably, the YTD growth of the Altcoin market currently stands at 65.18%, particularly Ethereum at 40.96%. This indicates that BTC has outperformed both Altcoins and Ethereum this year. Decline in Ethereum’s Dominance Despite ETF Inflows Reports indicate that Ethereum’s dominance continues to drop since the launch of Ethereum ETFs in mid-2024. Reports add that though billions of dollars flowed into the ETFs, it made very little impact on the price of Ethereum. No Current Catalyst to Support Ethereum Reports suggest that traders have largely lost confidence in the potential of Ethereum to make great upward moves.

Experts drop hints on next moves,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/no-dogecoin-etf-yet-experts-drop-hints/,"The year 2024, which began with the banging launch of the US Bitcoin spot exchange rraded funds (ETFs), is ending with the hopes that more crypto-linked investment products will soon enter the market. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas even agreed with the ETF Store’s president on the surprising absence of filings for a Dogecoin ETF. The crypto industry has registered rapid gains since the historic launch of BTC ETFs in January 2024. Bitcoin recorded a surge of over 125% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis and has knocked off the much anticipated $100K barrier. However, it is expected that the introduction of popular altcoins linked ETFs will push the cumulative crypto market cap to thrash the $4 trillion mark. Experts seek DOGE ETF soon Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, in a post stated that it is a shock that no ETF issuer has filed for a Dogecoin ETF yet. He asked what could be the downside and mentioned that the worst case would be its marketing expense. Meanwhile, he wonders which issuer is sitting on the ‘DOGE’ ticker. Senior ETF Analyst Balchunas agreed with Geraci and suggested that he was initially expecting them before Christmas. He now believes they might come after Paul Atkins becomes SEC chair under the Trump administration. He even speculates on potential ETF issuers: “If I’m Vegas, my favorite on the reserve of $DOGE ticker is Venuto. That said, Tuttle is my favorite to file.” Despite being the biggest meme coin in the crypto space and massive support from Elon Musk, no such investment fund manager has filed for a spot DOGE ETF with the commission. Balchunas now predicts filings after the new administration takes office. Agree. Thought by Xmas we’d see someone file. Maybe waiting til Atkins/Trump officially in charge. If I’m Vegas my favorite on reserver of $DOGE ticker is Venuto. That said Tuttle is my fav to file for the ETF. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 23, 2024 With spot altcoin ETFs for Solana (SOL), Ripple’s XRP, and Litecoin (LTC) already in the works, it feels like DOGE’s turn is just a matter of time. The pro-crypto stance of incoming leadership is also a signal for a better environment around crypto ETFs. Dogecoin price action saw a minor downturn recently. DOGE is down by 21% in the last 7 days but it is still up by a huge 253% on YTD. The biggest meme crypto is trading at an average price of $0.316, at press time. It is trading down by 56% from its all time high of $0.737, recorded on May 08, 2021. Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E reforms The industry knows that Dogecoin is the favorite meme crypto of the richest person on Earth “Elon Musk.” He is now leading the charge for government reform as part of President-elect Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). This move has boosted DOGE’s price eventually. Musk is aiming for a $2 trillion budget cut and sweeping agency reforms. He is proposing a return-to-office mandate for federal workers, banking on mass resignations. He even advocated for cuts to entire agencies and targeted agency leaders like FTC Chair Lina Khan for dismissal. These moves echo his X (formerly Twitter) acquisition playbook. Musk has openly criticized federal employees and agencies. He singled out Alexis Pelosi, a senior climate adviser, suggesting her dismissal and even took aim at the SEC, labeling the government as “more broken than you could possibly imagine.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Dogecoin|BTC|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-23 10:08:52

Their analysis, posted under the Negentropic account, indicates that Bitcoin (BTC) is likely to lead the market as its dominance continues to increase, while altcoins are facing significant challenges, particularly as they lose crucial support levels . Bitcoin’s Dominance Strengthens According to the Glassnode co-founders, Bitcoin’s dominance in the market has been on the rise, especially after a brief dip below the $100,000 mark . The increased dominance of Bitcoin suggests that institutional and retail investors are gravitating more toward the top cryptocurrency as it gains more attention as a safe haven asset and a store of value . This is a significant shift as Bitcoin’s dominance typically rises when altcoins lose momentum or fail to maintain upward price movements, signaling a return of focus to Bitcoin . BTC’s dominance in the market is currently strengthening, likely due to Bitcoin’s stability compared to altcoins , many of which are struggling with support loss . Altcoins Losing Crucial Support While Bitcoin is gaining dominance, altcoins are experiencing a period of weakness, with many coins losing support levels that were previously considered crucial for maintaining price momentum. The Glassnode co-founders noted that altcoins are currently in accumulation zones , meaning they are likely being bought up at relatively low prices in anticipation of future growth, but the lack of support may prevent them from seeing significant upward price action in the short term. In their report, Happel and Allemann highlighted the increasing volatility among altcoins , where market sentiment seems to be shifting away from altcoins toward Bitcoin . This sentiment is likely exacerbated by the uncertainty surrounding altcoin adoption and regulatory issues that continue to plague the broader crypto market . The weakness in altcoins could be attributed to Bitcoin’s dominance and the growing preference for BTC among institutional investors . As Bitcoin stabilizes, it may continue to see increased investments while altcoins experience periods of stagnation. Bitcoin Stabilization Above $100,000 Could Spark Altcoin Surge Despite the current weakness of altcoins , the Glassnode co-founders suggested that altcoins could see a resurgence once Bitcoin stabilizes above the $100,000 mark. This stabilization would likely trigger a wave of interest and investment into altcoins , particularly those currently in accumulation zones . Bitcoin’s stabilization above $100,000 could indicate a period of market maturity , where Bitcoin’s price consolidates at a new higher level, potentially giving room for altcoins to recover. As Bitcoin stabilizes , investors may look to diversify into altcoins , fueling another potential phase of growth for these cryptocurrencies. Happel and Allemann also noted that as Bitcoin’s dominance increases , it creates a more favorable environment for altcoins to thrive. However, this only happens once Bitcoin reaches a point of stability at higher price levels. Until then, altcoins may continue to lag behind. A Strengthening Environment for Bitcoin The analysis by Glassnode suggests a strengthening environment for Bitcoin , with its increasing dominance and the growing number of investors flocking to it. In contrast, altcoins may continue to face challenges, especially if they cannot maintain support levels and show signs of sustained growth. As Bitcoin strengthens its position as a leading asset in the cryptocurrency market , it sets the tone for the broader market environment . Bitcoin’s dominance serves as an indicator that investors are becoming more cautious about altcoins and prefer to stay in Bitcoin until the market stabilizes further. Conclusion: Bitcoin Leads the Market as Altcoins Struggle for Support As Bitcoin dominance increases and altcoins struggle to maintain crucial support levels , the market appears poised for a continued focus on Bitcoin . The Glassnode co-founders’ insights suggest that Bitcoin is likely to remain the dominant force in the crypto space until it stabilizes above $100,000 , at which point altcoins may see a resurgence. For now, Bitcoin is leading the market, while altcoins find themselves in a challenging period , largely due to a lack of support and market volatility . However, as the market stabilizes, there is potential for altcoins to bounce back once Bitcoin reaches a new higher price level. Investors should stay alert for potential opportunities in both Bitcoin and altcoins as the market evolves.

The data highlights significant developments within the Bitcoin ETF market , with a notable influx of capital into Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as institutional and retail investors continue to seek exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Among these Bitcoin ETFs , BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led the way, recording a substantial net inflow of $1.452 billion . In contrast, when excluding IBIT , the remaining U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows totaling $989 million . This stark contrast between IBIT’s inflows and the outflows from other ETFs suggests a growing preference for BlackRock’s ETF in the current market environment. Key Highlights: U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Combined net inflows of $463 million for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs last week. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF saw an impressive net inflow of $1.452 billion . Other U.S. Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows of $989 million . The trading volume for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs for the same period reached $26 billion . Since the start of the fourth quarter , these ETFs have accumulated a cumulative net inflow of $17.5 billion . BlackRock’s IBIT ETF Dominates with Record Inflows The strong performance of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF stands out in the latest data, as it alone accounted for a net inflow of over $1.45 billion . This surge in capital into IBIT underscores the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated financial products . BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF space has been met with enthusiasm from investors looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of directly holding the cryptocurrency. The IBIT ETF’s performance reflects the broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies , especially as major financial institutions like BlackRock continue to develop Bitcoin-related products . This marks an important milestone for Bitcoin ETFs , signaling that institutional interest in digital assets is gaining momentum and could continue to drive Bitcoin’s price and market legitimacy . Other Bitcoin ETFs Struggle with Outflows Despite the success of IBIT , other U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced challenges, with net outflows totaling $989 million . This disparity between IBIT’s performance and that of other Bitcoin ETFs may be due to several factors, including investor preference for larger, well-established funds like BlackRock’s IBIT , which benefits from its strong brand reputation and institutional backing . Moreover, the ongoing market volatility and the complex regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies may have led to a more cautious stance from investors, particularly in the Bitcoin ETF sector . Smaller ETFs may be struggling to maintain investor confidence as a result, while larger funds like IBIT continue to see strong inflows. Cumulative Net Inflows of $17.5 Billion in Q4 Looking at the broader picture, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a cumulative net inflow of $17.5 billion since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2024 . This reflects an overall positive trend for Bitcoin ETFs , despite the mixed results among individual funds. The overall growth in inflows indicates that investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin ETFs as a way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market while mitigating some of the risks associated with direct cryptocurrency trading. Trading Volume and Investor Sentiment The total trading volume for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs for the week was reported at $26 billion . This significant volume suggests that there is robust market activity and interest in Bitcoin-related financial products , particularly in the run-up to year-end . As Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the crypto market , Bitcoin ETFs are likely to continue to play a key role in providing access to digital assets for both retail and institutional investors . Conclusion: Growing Institutional Interest in Bitcoin ETFs The $463 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, driven largely by the BlackRock IBIT ETF , is a strong indicator of the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies . The disparity between IBIT’s inflows and the outflows from other ETFs highlights the preference for larger, more established Bitcoin-backed financial products. With a cumulative net inflow of $17.5 billion for Bitcoin ETFs in the fourth quarter of 2024 , the momentum for institutional Bitcoin adoption is expected to continue into the new year. As more investors turn to Bitcoin ETFs for exposure to the crypto market , these funds will likely play a critical role in the continued growth and maturation of the Bitcoin market .

Just recently, Hayes dumped over $10 million of the Ethena ( ENA ) cryptocurrency, a project he has funded and supports. According to data Finbold retrieved from Arkham Intelligence , the famous investor received 9 million ENA from an Ethena smart contract on December 22 and deposited this amount to two centralized exchange addresses. First, Hayes sent 7 million ENA, worth $8.47 million, to Binance after receiving $10.91 million from the contract. Then, the executive sent 2 million ENA, worth $2.42 million, to an address Lookonchain identified as belonging to Bybit. It is possible that this amount comes from unstaking 9 million sENA from Ethena’s liquid staking protocol. This is because Hayes’s address has an sENA activity from one week ago worth $8.88 million at that time. Arthur Hayes crypto transfers. Source: Arkham Intelligence / Finbold Arthur Hayes supports Ethena (ENA) Notably, Arthur Hayes is also a known Ethena supporter in many fronts. For example, he inspired USDe’s creation through a paper describing a stablecoin that would work similarly to what Ethena designed. However, Hayes’s drafts suggested using Bitcoin ( BTC ) automated trades instead of the Staked Ethereum ( sETH ) used by Ethena’s stablecoin USDe. The millionaire investor has supported the project since its launch, not only by inspiring it with his paper but also with funding and advisory. As CoinDesk reported , the Maelstrom Fund was one of Ethena’s investors in a $6 million funding round led by Dragonfly. As of this writing, Arthur Hayes holds $36.44 million in his known addresses, according to Arkham Intelligence . Out of that, sENA makes the third largest position, currently with 7.919 million sENA, worth $8.35 million. Hayes also has 18,580 ENA, worth $19,680. Arthur Hayes holdings. Source: Arkham Intelligence Therefore, the investor’s recent Ethena dump accounted for more than half of his entire ENA and sENA known position. This represents a significant activity that raised warning in the market, given Hayes’s support for the project. Previously, Finbold reported how the investor dumped millions of dollars of Pendle (PENDLE) right after publicly promoting the token on X. As things develop, the market will closely watch Arthur Hayes’s addresses to understand if this represents just opportunistic swing trading or something bigger, like a long-term repositioning or even potential insider trading.

(Ripple Price Analysis),https://cryptopotato.com/why-is-the-xrp-price-down-today-ripple-price-analysis/,"Ripple is navigating a pivotal range between $1.8 and $3, with recent price action highlighting the likelihood of a consolidation phase. A breakout from this range will likely determine its next significant trend. XRP Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart XRP recently faced rejection at the critical $3 resistance, triggering increased volatility and initiating a sideways consolidation phase. After that, the price found support at the $1.8 level, a key zone filled with demand and buying pressure. This support region can limit further downward movement and maintain the cryptocurrency within the $1.8-$3 range. As the price consolidates, a bullish or bearish breakout will determine Ripple’s upcoming trajectory. While this could lead to a sustained uptrend, an unexpected bearish breakdown might trigger a significant liquidation event, causing the price to plummet toward lower levels. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart During the 4-hour timeframe, XRP consolidates within a descending wedge pattern, which often signals a potential bullish breakout if breached upward. Currently, the price is testing the wedge’s lower boundary near the $1.8 support level, where increased buying activity is expected. In the mid-term, Ripple seems likely to continue fluctuating within this pattern, with a bullish breakout aiming to reclaim higher levels near $3. Conversely, a bearish breakdown below the wedge’s lower boundary could initiate a decline, potentially driving the price toward the $1.5 threshold, a crucial support level.

38003152,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113368,1734954245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Archive Debunks UAE’s Alleged $40B Bitcoin Purchase as Fake News,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-archive-debunks-uaes-alleged/,"Bitcoin Archive Debunks UAE’s Alleged $40B Bitcoin Purchase as Fake News Bitcoin Archive , a prominent X account that specializes in Bitcoin (BTC) news and analysis, has recently refuted claims that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) purchased $40 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) . According to a post from Bitcoin Archive , the claim, which has been circulating widely across crypto news outlets and even shared by Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) on X , is a false rumor without credible sources or supporting evidence. Bitcoin Archive pointed out that the supposed $40 billion Bitcoin acquisition by the UAE appears to be a baseless claim, one that originated from an anonymous source and has now been mistakenly accepted as fact. The lack of verifiable links , supporting documentation, or search results further invalidates the claim, leading Bitcoin Archive to label it as fake news . The Rumor’s Spread Across Crypto Platforms The rumor about the UAE’s massive Bitcoin purchase gained traction quickly after it was initially shared on X , the platform previously known as Twitter. It was further amplified when Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , the CEO of Binance , posted about the alleged $40 billion Bitcoin acquisition . This connection between the claim and a high-profile figure in the crypto space may have contributed to the rapid spread of the rumor, with many in the crypto community believing it to be true. However, Bitcoin Archive emphasized that while Binance’s CZ shared the information, the claim lacked any official documentation , public announcements , or reliable sources to back it up. The absence of such credible evidence, according to Bitcoin Archive, makes it clear that the story should be regarded with skepticism. Lack of Sources and Supporting Evidence One of the key reasons Bitcoin Archive dismissed the UAE’s alleged $40 billion Bitcoin purchase as fake news was the absence of supporting sources . In the world of cryptocurrency , where market-moving events are often meticulously documented and reported by credible news outlets, the absence of any authoritative references makes it extremely unlikely that such a massive purchase would go unnoticed. The UAE government or any related official entities would likely have made a public announcement or issued a formal press release if such a monumental investment in Bitcoin were indeed taking place. The lack of verifiable information and transparency surrounding this claim makes it clear that the rumor has no solid foundation. The Impact of Misinformation in the Crypto Space The spread of misleading or false information within the crypto community can have significant consequences, especially when it comes to market sentiment and investor behavior . False claims about major players in the cryptocurrency space , such as sovereign states like the UAE , can lead to false price movements , increased volatility , and misinformed trading decisions . For example, had the $40 billion Bitcoin purchase claim been true, it could have caused a surge in Bitcoin’s price as investors speculated on the potential long-term implications of such a massive institutional investment. However, since this claim has now been debunked, it serves as a reminder of how easily rumors can influence market behavior , even in a space that is supposed to be driven by transparency and verified data . Bitcoin Archive’s Role in Providing Accurate Information As Bitcoin Archive continues to serve as a trusted source of news and analysis in the crypto space, the account’s commitment to debunking false rumors and misleading claims is vital in maintaining market integrity . By addressing false narratives , Bitcoin Archive helps ensure that investors and traders are equipped with the correct information to make well-informed decisions. In this case, Bitcoin Archive has taken a proactive stance in calling out the $40 billion claim for what it is— a rumor without credible backing . Their ability to quickly respond to misinformation helps mitigate the spread of false narratives and maintains the credibility of cryptocurrency news and market analysis . The Need for Caution in Crypto Market Claims The UAE’s alleged Bitcoin purchase serves as a prime example of how rumors can spread in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrencies . While Bitcoin continues to gain institutional interest , it is essential for investors, media outlets , and industry figures to critically assess the information they share. In the future, the crypto market should place greater emphasis on fact-checking and verifying claims, particularly when it comes to high-profile events that can influence market sentiment. The spread of misinformation can ultimately erode trust in the market and result in unnecessary volatility . Conclusion: A Reminder to Verify Crypto News In conclusion, the claim of the UAE purchasing $40 billion worth of Bitcoin has been debunked by Bitcoin Archive , which pointed out the lack of credible sources , links , and supporting evidence . The spread of this fake news highlights the importance of verifying crypto market information , especially when it comes to rumors that can impact investor sentiment and market dynamics. As the cryptocurrency space continues to mature, it is crucial for industry participants to rely on trusted sources and verifiable data to avoid the consequences of misleading narratives . Bitcoin Archive’s swift debunking of the rumor helps maintain the integrity of the crypto market and ensures that investors are not swayed by unsubstantiated claims.

By 2027, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.449. By 2030, DOGE might touch $0.985 with an average trading price of $0.867. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis.

Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin revealed an increasing trend for the currency. Coin value has stepped up to a $0.316 high over the past 24 hours. However, as the volatility is rising on a rapid scale, there is a high possibility of a reversal soon. The distance between the Bollinger bands determines the market volatility. As this distance is expanding, this marks a rising market volatility. Moving on, the upper end of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.485.

DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price analysis of Dogecoin confirmed an uptrend for the cryptocurrency. DOGE/USD value has recovered up to $0.3164 during the past few hours. A green candlestick on the four-hour price chart indicates relatively upward momentum. The Bollinger bands are widening, leading to a subtle rise in the volatility. This rise indicates a relatively higher market unpredictability during the coming hours. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has now shifted to a $0.346 high, referring to the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.287 low, signifying the availability of support.

Dogecoin price analysis gives out a bullish prediction with regards to the ongoing price movements. The market trends remained in favor of the buyers, resulting in a noticeable recovery today. Coin value has spiked up to $0.3164 following the recent upturn. However, the market sentiment remains highly negative. If observed overall, the cryptocurrency devalued up to 1.45% over the past 24 hours. Technical indicators give out a bearish verdict; however, the price charts continue to support the bulls for the day. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has a strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is considered a highly volatile coin, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification is advised. However, the coin is expected to touch the $0.249 level by 2025. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.3164 over the last 24 hours. Side by side, the presence of strong resistance at the $0.485 mark is yet to be overcome by DOGE. Will DOGE reach $0.250? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by August 2024. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1. Will DOGE reach $5? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. The market speculates that DOGE will reach the $5 level by 2033. Though the time is considerable, it’s worth holding for handsome profits. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.219 on March 28, 2024, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.66 mark by 2030, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin CoinGlass data shows that Dogecoin’s trading volume has surged by more than 76%. The surge is attributed to significant whale activity. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin and expect further upside in the coming days. Dogecoin recorded a 31% gain to lift its price to $0.28 over the weekend, maintaining its bullish momentum. Since November 2021, the token’s current price has been the highest it has ever been. The value of the meme coin has increased by 155%, and it is currently double what it was a month ago. CoinGecko data indicates that Dogecoin has increased by 86% in the past week. The number is still well below the $0.71 mark, which was the peak established in May 2021. Read more about it here .

By 2030, DOGE may reach $1.36. Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001, but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. Dogecoin traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. In 2023, Dogecoin began trading around $0.08, and closed the year at $0.08955. DOGE began 2024 consolidating around the $0.08 region. The market-wide bull run of March 2024 saw DOGE trading above $0.2, reclaiming its November 2021 levels.

According to the Bank of Botswana, the domestic virtual asset market remains small and relatively unsophisticated and, hence, doesn’t pose an immediate threat to the nation’s financial well-being. However, the rapid evolution of global crypto markets and the increasing integration of the crypto sector with traditional financial systems could introduce systemic risks over time. In its latest Financial Stability Report , the central bank warned that these risks, if left unchecked, might cascade into broader economic vulnerabilities. Despite the current limited exposure, the central bank stressed the importance of preemptive action, calling for tailored oversight frameworks that address market misconduct alongside other risks such as money laundering and terrorist financing fuelled by anonymous crypto transactions. It noted: Domestically, risks emanating from crypto assets are minimal, but ongoing misconduct in the segment presents regulatory concerns. Regulators, therefore, need to develop effective oversight frameworks for the sector. Money laundering using digital payment channels was flagged as a major concern for Bostwanan, with the central bank warning that the anonymity offered by certain digital platforms creates fertile ground for illicit financial flows. These channels, the bank noted, enable funds to be moved across borders with “relatively low detection risks,” complicating efforts to trace and intercept suspicious transactions. To mitigate such activities, the central bank urged the creation of clear rules to improve market monitoring and strengthen cooperation between financial regulators and law enforcement agencies. Further, it also wants regulators to ensure that Virtual Asset Service Providers are fully compliant with Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations. Cryptocurrencies and money laundering Cryptocurrencies, due to their pseudonymous nature and decentralised structure, have long been criticised for their role in facilitating money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities. This has led to increased enforcement actions , the introduction of stricter regulatory measures , and the updating of existing laws to better address the evolving risks posed by digital assets. While the Central Bank of Botswana acknowledged these risks, its assessment was notably more measured compared to the urgent warnings and stricter stances often seen across other jurisdictions. For instance, in September, law enforcement in Sweden labelled some cryptocurrency exchanges as “professional money launderers” for allowing illicit transactions after initiating an investigation into unlicensed platforms. The country’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority had previously sounded the alarm on the rising misuse of digital assets, particularly stablecoins, in fueling cyberattacks, illegal dark web transactions, and sanctions evasion tied to geopolitical conflicts. Last month, the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering issued a similar warning, highlighting that bad actors were increasingly taking the crypto path to obscure financial trails and launder illicit funds using fake identities and multi-layered transactions across several platforms.

The company shared this development through a post on X (formerly Twitter), further solidifying its position as a significant player in the Bitcoin investment space. Metaplanet’s Growing Bitcoin Holdings This latest purchase by Metaplanet is a continuation of the company’s ongoing investment strategy in Bitcoin , which has been a core part of its portfolio diversification efforts. By acquiring 619.7 BTC , Metaplanet increases its total Bitcoin holdings, reflecting the company’s confidence in the long-term potential of Bitcoin as an asset. Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and Metaplanet’s decision to expand its holdings further highlights the growing trend of institutional adoption of digital assets .

38003291,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=113372,1734954492,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Michael Saylor to Jeff Bezos: “$600M Would Buy a Lot of Bitcoin”,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/michael-saylor-to-jeff-bezos/,"Michael Saylor to Jeff Bezos: “$600M Would Buy a Lot of Bitcoin” In a light-hearted yet pointed response on X (formerly Twitter), Michael Saylor , the co-founder of MicroStrategy , suggested to Jeff Bezos that the $600 million rumored to be spent on his wedding could be better utilized in purchasing Bitcoin . Saylor’s comment came shortly after Bezos publicly denied rumors that he intended to spend $600 million on his wedding to fiancée Lauren Sanchez in Aspen, Colorado . The Context Behind the Remark The comment from Saylor emerged as a playful exchange in the wake of a widespread rumor about Bezos’ wedding expenses . Reports had surfaced claiming that Bezos, the Amazon founder , was planning to spend $600 million on his upcoming wedding, a claim he swiftly denied. In response, Michael Saylor , who has long been an advocate for Bitcoin , made a remark suggesting that instead of spending such a significant sum on a wedding, Bezos could potentially use the funds to acquire Bitcoin , an asset that Saylor has consistently championed as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Saylor’s response not only highlights his unwavering belief in Bitcoin as a superior investment but also reflects his ongoing efforts to promote Bitcoin adoption among the world’s most prominent business leaders and investors. The Power of $600 Million in Bitcoin Saylor’s suggestion that $600 million could “ buy a lot of Bitcoin ” emphasizes the current price of Bitcoin and how much value could be accumulated through a significant investment in the cryptocurrency. At Bitcoin’s current price (as of December 2024), $600 million would indeed allow for the purchase of a substantial amount of Bitcoin , further bolstering Saylor’s argument that Bitcoin is a smart long-term investment. Given that Bitcoin has steadily gained recognition as a store of value akin to gold , many investors have seen it as a way to preserve and grow wealth, especially in a world of increasing fiat currency printing and economic instability . Michael Saylor’s Advocacy for Bitcoin Michael Saylor has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin for years. As the CEO of MicroStrategy , a business intelligence firm, Saylor has made his company one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin . MicroStrategy currently holds over 124,000 BTC , worth billions of dollars, making Saylor one of the most prominent figures in the crypto space advocating for the integration of Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets. Saylor has frequently argued that Bitcoin offers unparalleled potential as an inflation hedge and an asset that can outperform traditional forms of currency and bonds . His personal and professional investments in Bitcoin serve as a strong endorsement of the asset, and his comment to Bezos reflects his ongoing campaign to persuade other influential figures and companies to consider Bitcoin as a core component of their investment strategy. Jeff Bezos and Bitcoin: A Potential Future? While Jeff Bezos has not publicly commented on Saylor’s suggestion , his response to the wedding rumors makes clear that the $600 million figure is not intended for lavish expenses. However, the conversation has opened the door to speculation about Bezos’ potential involvement in Bitcoin . Bezos, as one of the world’s wealthiest individuals and a pioneer of the e-commerce and tech industries , has the means and the platform to make a significant impact on the cryptocurrency space . While there is no indication that Bezos is currently invested in Bitcoin , the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies among institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals suggests that he may, at some point, consider incorporating Bitcoin into his financial portfolio. Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset for High-Profile Investors Michael Saylor’s comments underscore a larger trend where prominent business leaders, investors, and institutional players are increasingly looking to Bitcoin as a strategic asset. As traditional investment avenues like stocks and bonds face pressures from inflation and monetary policy changes , Bitcoin offers a potential alternative that is more resistant to inflationary pressures and currency devaluation . The idea that $600 million could buy a significant amount of Bitcoin is part of the ongoing conversation about institutional adoption and the growing importance of digital assets in global finance. The question now is how many other business leaders and billionaires will follow Saylor’s lead and begin considering Bitcoin as a cornerstone of their investment strategies . Conclusion: A Playful Yet Powerful Bitcoin Suggestion Michael Saylor’s comment to Jeff Bezos that $600 million could buy a lot of Bitcoin serves as both a playful remark and a reminder of the growing influence of Bitcoin in the financial world. While Bezos may not be planning to invest in Bitcoin anytime soon, Saylor’s advocacy for Bitcoin remains steadfast, and his suggestion to Bezos further highlights the cryptocurrency’s potential as an investment vehicle. As Bitcoin continues to gain recognition as a long-term asset and inflation hedge , it is likely that more business leaders and investors will consider incorporating Bitcoin into their financial portfolios, just as MicroStrategy has done.

38003463,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632216,1734954497,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38003463.jpeg,OpenAI to advance o1 and o3 AI models with new safety training paradigm,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openai-to-advance-o1-and-o3-ai-models-safety/,"On Friday, OpenAI announced the release of a new family of AI models, dubbed o3. The company claims the new products are more advanced than its previous models, including o1. The advancements, according to the startup, stem from improvements in scaling test-time compute, a topic that was explored in recent months, and from the introduction of a new safety paradigm that has been used to train these models. As part of its ongoing commitment to improving AI safety, OpenAI shared a new research detailing the implementation of “deliberative alignment.” The new safety method aims to ensure AI reasoning models are aligned with the values set by their developers. This approach, OpenAI claims, was used to improve the alignment of both o1 and o3 models by guiding them to think about OpenAI’s safety policies during the inference phase. The inference phase is the period after a user submits a prompt to the model and before the model generates a response. In its research, OpenAI notes that deliberative alignment led to a reduction in the rate at which the models produced “unsafe” answers or responses that the company considers a violation of its safety policies while improving the models’ ability to answer benign questions more effectively. How deliberative alignment works At its core, the process works by having the models re-prompt themselves during the chain-of-thought phase. After a user submits a question to ChatGPT, for example, the AI reasoning models take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to break down the problem into smaller steps. The models then generate an answer based on their thought process. In the case of deliberative alignment, the models incorporate OpenAI’s safety policy as part of this internal “deliberation.” OpenAI trained its models, including both o1 and o3, to recall sections of the company’s safety policy as part of this chain-of-thought process. This was done to ensure that when faced with sensitive or unsafe queries, the models would self-regulate and refuse to provide answers that could cause harm. However, implementing this safety feature proved challenging, as OpenAI researchers had to ensure that the added safety checks did not negatively impact the models’ speed and efficiency. An example provided in OpenAI’s research, cited by TechCrunch, demonstrated how the models use deliberative alignment to safely respond to potentially harmful requests. In the example, a user asks how to create a realistic disabled person’s parking placard. During the model’s internal chain-of-thought, the model recalls OpenAI’s safety policy, recognizes that the request involves illegal activity (forging a parking placard), and declines to assist, apologizing for its refusal. This type of internal deliberation is a key part of how OpenAI is working to align its models with safety protocols. Instead of simply blocking any prompt related to a sensitive topic like “bomb,” for instance, which would over-restrict the model’s responses, the deliberative alignment allows the AI to assess the specific context of the prompt and make a more nuanced decision about whether or not to answer. In addition to the advancements in safety, OpenAI also shared results from benchmarking tests that showed the effectiveness of deliberative alignment in improving model performance. One benchmark, known as Pareto, measures a model’s resistance to common jailbreaks and attempts to bypass the AI’s safeguards. In these tests, OpenAI’s o1-preview model outperformed other popular models such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in terms of avoiding unsafe outputs. Italy’s data protection authority fines OpenAI for privacy violations In a separate but related development, OpenAI was fined 15 million euros ($15.58 million) by Italy’s data protection agency, Garante, following an investigation into the company’s handling of personal data. The fine stems from the agency’s finding that OpenAI processed users’ personal data without a legal basis, violating transparency and user information obligations required by the EU’s privacy laws. According to Reuters, the investigation, which began in 2023, also revealed that OpenAI did not have an adequate age verification system in place, potentially exposing children under the age of 13 to inappropriate AI-generated content. Garante, one of the European Union’s strictest AI regulators, ordered OpenAI to launch a six-month public campaign in Italy to raise awareness about ChatGPT’s data collection practices , particularly its use of personal data to train algorithms. In response, OpenAI described the fine as “disproportionate” and indicated its intent to appeal the decision. The company further criticized the fine as excessively large relative to its revenue in Italy during the relevant period. Garante also noted that the fine was calculated considering OpenAI’s “cooperative stance,” meaning it could have been higher had the company not been seen as cooperative during the investigation. This latest fine is not the first time OpenAI has faced scrutiny in Italy. Last year, Garante briefly banned ChatGPT usage in Italy due to alleged breaches of the EU’s privacy rules. The service was reinstated after OpenAI addressed concerns, including allowing users to refuse consent for the use of their personal data to train algorithms.

Japanese firm Metaplanet capitalized on the dip with a record $60 million Bitcoin purchase, while social sentiment hit a 2024 low. Long-term Bitcoin prospects are also still quite positive, bolstered by strategic proposals like a U.S. Bitcoin reserve that could cut national debt. Bitcoin Retreats from All-Time Highs Bitcoin experienced its first big weekly decline since Donald Trump’s November presidential election win started a rally that propelled the cryptocurrency past six figures. Over the week ending Dec. 22, Bitcoin dropped by 10%, closing at $94,645 after starting the week at close to $105,185. This decline erased approximately $10,500 from its price. Bitcoin price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The downturn coincided with the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee decision to reduce the number of projected interest rate cuts for the coming year, trimming expectations from five to just two. The federal funds rate is now expected to peak at 3.9% in 2025, compared to the previously forecasted 3.4%, creating a less favorable environment for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Before this decline, Bitcoin showed consistent strength by rising in six of the past seven weekly closes since Trump’s election. The only exception was a minor 0.78% retracement during the week ending Nov. 24. Bitcoin weekly price history (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite this recent pullback, optimism for Bitcoin’s long-term prospects is still strong. Asset management firms like Bitwise and VanEck predict the cryptocurrency could surge to the $180,000 to $200,000 range by 2025, driven by a potential U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and increased institutional and corporate adoption. Trump’s administration is also expected to create a much more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Some of Trump’s key appointments include hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Secretary of Treasury and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as Commerce Department head. Crypto advocate Paul Atkins is also set to replace Gary Gensler as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 20. Atkins is a former SEC commissioner, and is anticipated to bring a more pro-crypto stance to the agency. At press time, Bitcoin was trading hands at $95,303.85 after its price dropped by 1.35% over the past 24 hours. This is a dramatic increase from its position on Christmas Day last year when it was valued at approximately $43,600. Metaplanet Makes Record Bitcoin Purchase Japanese investment firm Metaplanet certainly took advantage of Bitcoin’s price dip by making its largest-ever Bitcoin purchase. The firm bought 619.7 BTC for nearly $60 million. The purchase was announced on Dec. 23, and was made at an approximate price of $96,000 per Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s previous record buy was 159.7 BTC in October. This latest acquisition brought Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,762 BTC, which is valued at around $168 million, with an average purchase price of $75,600 per Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s latest purchase also makes its Bitcoin holdings the 12th-largest among public companies, trailing behind medical technology firm Semler Scientific. The company also reported some very impressive returns on its Bitcoin strategy, with a BTC Yield of 310% between October and December. This exceeded the 41.7% yield achieved in the previous quarter by far. Metaplanet uses BTC Yield as a metric to evaluate the success of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which it claims adds value for shareholders. In an investor disclosure, Metaplanet revealed plans to formalize Bitcoin acquisition and management as a core business line. This initiative will include leveraging financial instruments like loans, equity, and convertible bonds to accumulate and manage Bitcoin holdings. The firm also announced its plan to raise more than $62 million through a stock acquisition program to expand its Bitcoin treasury even more. On Dec. 18, Metaplanet projected its first operating profit since 2017. The announcement triggered a 5% surge in the company’s stock price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, although shares are still down almost 13% over the past week. Despite its recent fluctuations, Metaplanet’s stock skyrocketed by more than 2,100% this year, driven by its embrace of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Sentiment Hits 2024 Low Social sentiment around Bitcoin also recently plummeted to its lowest level in 2024, which raised some speculation about a potential recovery above the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin’s correction has been accompanied by a sharp decline in retail sentiment, with a ratio of four to five positive versus negative Bitcoin-related comments on social media. Despite the negative sentiment, some market analysts see this as an indicator of an incoming Bitcoin breakout. Market intelligence platform Santiment pointed out that fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among vocal traders could signal a market move contrary to retail expectations. Other analysts agree with this sentiment, and suggested that the end of Bitcoin’s current correction phase under $100,000 is near. Emerging fractal patterns on Bitcoin’s daily chart point to the possibility of an imminent recovery above $100,000. Analyst Elja Boom noticed the similarities to previous patterns, and suggested a short-term reversal could be in play. However, historical data indicates that Bitcoin’s correction might continue for another week. Analyst Rekt Capital referenced prior market cycles where corrective phases extended through multiple weeks. Looking further ahead, Bitcoin’s outlook for 2025 still appears more optimistic. Matrixport , a crypto services provider, predicts that improving macroeconomic conditions and easing global monetary policies could propel Bitcoin’s price above $160,000 by the end of next year. U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Could Cut National Debt Meanwhile, the United States could greatly reduce its national debt by creating a Bitcoin reserve, according to a report by asset management firm VanEck. The analysis suggests that holding 1 million Bitcoin could offset approximately 35% of the national debt by 2049, assuming Bitcoin’s price grows at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%. Under this scenario, Bitcoin’s value would reach $42.3 million per coin by 2049, while the national debt is projected to rise from $37 trillion in 2025 to $119.3 trillion at a 5% CAGR over the same period. VanEck’s projection started with Bitcoin at $200,000 in 2025, more than double its current trading price of $95,360. The firm expects that Bitcoin’s value could expand to represent 18% of global financial assets by 2049, which is a big increase from its current 0.22% share of the $900 trillion market. (Source: VanEck ) This proposal aligns with a bill that was introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, which advocates for the U.S. to establish a Bitcoin reserve. While Donald Trump’s incoming administration has shared its interest in using Bitcoin as a reserve asset, Lummis’ bill still has to be reviewed by Congress. Strike CEO Jack Mallers even speculated that Trump might issue an executive order on his first day in office to designate Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Under the Lummis plan, the U.S. could take advantage of the 198,100 Bitcoin that it currently holds from asset seizures and acquire the remaining 801,900 Bitcoin through Emergency Support Functions, selling a portion of its $455 billion gold reserves, or a combination of both. This strategy would not involve money printing or taxpayer funds, according to VanEck. VanEck also mentioned how Bitcoin’s adoption at the state, institutional, and corporate levels could accelerate its growth even more. The firm’s analysts, Matthew Sigel and Nathan Frankovitz, suggested that Bitcoin’s potential role as a settlement currency in global trade could drive its adoption, especially among BRICS nations looking to bypass U.S. sanctions. In this context, Bitcoin’s broader use as a global settlement currency could reshape its role in international finance completely and contribute to its projected growth trajectory.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-23 11:50:06

A Comprehensive Guide to the World of Forex Trading,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/what-is-forex/,"What is Forex? A Comprehensive Guide to the World of Forex Trading If you’ve ever wondered about the term “ Forex ” or “ foreign exchange ,” you’re not alone. Forex refers to the world’s largest financial market, where currencies are traded against one another. The forex market plays a crucial role in international trade and investments, with trillions of dollars being exchanged daily. Whether you are an aspiring trader, a business owner, or just someone looking to understand this dynamic market, this guide will provide you with a deep understanding of what Forex is , how it works, and how people can trade currencies for profit. In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about Forex trading , including key concepts, how to get started, and tips for success. Let’s dive in! What is Forex? Forex , also known as foreign exchange or FX , is the global marketplace for buying and selling currencies . Unlike other markets such as stocks or commodities , the Forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, allowing traders worldwide to exchange currencies at any given time. The Forex market is decentralized, meaning it doesn’t have a central exchange like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) . Instead, it operates through a network of banks , financial institutions , brokers , and individual traders who exchange currencies electronically over-the-counter (OTC). The main goal of Forex trading is to speculate on the price movements of one currency relative to another. This is done by buying one currency while simultaneously selling another. The aim is to profit from the difference in exchange rates between the two currencies. How Does Forex Work? To understand how Forex works, let’s break down the key elements that make up the Forex market. Currency Pairs Forex trading involves trading currency pairs . A currency pair consists of two currencies: the base currency and the quote currency . For example, in the currency pair EUR/USD , the Euro (EUR) is the base currency, and the U.S. Dollar (USD) is the quote currency. When you buy this pair, you are buying Euros while selling U.S. Dollars . Conversely, when you sell the pair, you are selling Euros and buying U.S. Dollars . The price of a currency pair indicates how much of the quote currency is needed to buy one unit of the base currency . Exchange Rates Exchange rates are the value at which one currency can be exchanged for another. They fluctuate constantly based on various factors, including interest rates , economic data , geopolitical events , and market sentiment . For instance, if the EUR/USD exchange rate is 1.2000, this means 1 Euro is worth 1.20 U.S. Dollars . If this rate changes to 1.2500, the Euro has appreciated relative to the Dollar , and the exchange rate has increased. Leverage Leverage in Forex trading allows traders to control a large position in the market with a relatively small initial investment (called margin). For example, with 50:1 leverage , a trader can control a position worth $50,000 with just $1,000 of their own capital. While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases the risk, as traders can incur substantial losses if the market moves against them. Market Participants The Forex market is made up of several key participants, including: Central Banks : These institutions control a country’s monetary policy and influence currency values through interest rate changes and foreign exchange interventions. Commercial Banks : Large banks provide liquidity and facilitate currency transactions for their clients. Retail Traders : Individual traders who engage in Forex trading for personal profit. Hedge Funds and Investment Firms : These entities also trade currencies to manage risk or seek profit. Market Sessions The Forex market operates 24 hours a day, with trading sessions opening and closing in different parts of the world. These include the Sydney , Tokyo , London , and New York sessions. The overlap between these sessions creates periods of higher liquidity and volatility. The Asian session is typically less volatile, while the London and New York sessions experience the highest trading volume and price movements. Types of Forex Markets There are three primary types of Forex markets where trading takes place: Spot Market The spot market is where currencies are bought and sold for immediate delivery, typically within two business days. This is the most common market for retail traders . Forward Market The forward market involves contracts to buy or sell currencies at a specific future date and price. These contracts are customizable and traded over-the-counter (OTC), typically by businesses looking to hedge currency risk. Futures Market In the futures market , currency contracts are standardized and traded on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) . These contracts are similar to forward contracts , but they are more regulated and can be bought or sold before their expiration date. Why is Forex So Popular? Liquidity The Forex market is the most liquid market in the world, with daily trading volumes surpassing $6 trillion . This means that orders can be filled quickly, and there is always a buyer or seller available. Accessibility Forex trading is open to anyone with an internet connection and access to a broker. Unlike stock trading , which requires buying shares in a company, Forex trading allows you to speculate on the movement of currencies without owning the underlying asset. Leverage Leverage is one of the most attractive aspects of Forex trading. It enables traders to control larger positions in the market with a smaller amount of capital, increasing their potential for profit (and loss). Diverse Trading Opportunities Forex provides opportunities to trade a wide range of currencies, including major , minor , and exotic pairs . This allows traders to take advantage of fluctuations in a wide variety of markets and time zones. 24-Hour Trading The ability to trade 24 hours a day across different time zones gives Forex traders flexibility and the ability to react quickly to market events and news. How to Get Started with Forex Trading Choose a Reliable Forex Broker The first step in Forex trading is to choose a regulated Forex broker that offers low spreads , high leverage , and a user-friendly platform . Make sure the broker is licensed by a reputable financial authority, such as CySEC , ASIC , or the FCA . Open a Trading Account Once you have chosen your broker, you can open a trading account . Most brokers offer different types of accounts (such as micro or standard accounts), so you can choose one that suits your trading style and budget. Start with a Demo Account Before risking real money, it’s advisable to start with a demo account . This will allow you to practice trading with virtual funds and get familiar with the trading platform. Develop a Trading Strategy Successful Forex trading requires a solid trading strategy . Whether you prefer technical analysis , fundamental analysis , or a combination of both, having a well-thought-out plan is key to managing risk and maximizing profits. Monitor the Market Stay informed about economic indicators , global events , and market sentiment that can affect currency values. Using news feeds , charts , and technical indicators will help you make more informed decisions. Risks of Forex Trading Forex trading can be highly profitable, but it also comes with significant risks . The use of leverage can amplify both profits and losses. It’s essential to use risk management tools , such as stop-loss orders , to protect your capital. Additionally, it’s crucial to stay disciplined and avoid emotional trading decisions. Conclusion Forex trading is a dynamic and highly liquid market that offers numerous opportunities for traders around the world. Whether you’re a beginner looking to explore the market or an experienced trader looking for new opportunities, understanding the fundamentals of Forex trading is crucial. By choosing the right broker, developing a solid strategy, and continuously educating yourself, you can succeed in the Forex market . If you’re ready to dive into the world of Forex trading , make sure to do thorough research and practice responsible trading. Forex may seem complex, but with the right knowledge and approach, you can make the most of this exciting market.

The latest dip, however, extended its weekly losses to almost 22%. This prompted many whales to accumulate the token. LINK Whales’ Conviction There has been a noticeable uptick in the holdings of wallets containing between 10 million and 100 million LINK coins, rising from approximately 475.79 million to 479.78 million within a short period. According to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this translates to a purchase of over $44 million worth of LINK, which reflects bullish behavior among large holders during the price retracement. The accumulation trend suggests growing confidence in LINK’s long-term potential. Lookonchain’s recent tweet further validated the strong conviction among whales. The blockchain analytics platform identified nine fresh wallets withdrawing a total of 362,380 LINK tokens, which is worth around $8.19 million, from Binance within the last 48 hours. Before the recent market turmoil, the LINK token saw a significant price increase and a boost in market activity, attributed to World Liberty Financial (WLFI) – a project backed by Donald Trump’s family – strategically increasing its holdings. This wave of renewed interest has led to a sharp rise in market activity. As such, CoinCodex has predicted that Chainlink’s price will increase by more than 53%, potentially reaching $35.56 by January 22, 2025. The market sentiment remains Neutral, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 70 (Greed). In the past 30 days, Chainlink had 16 green days out of 30, with a volatility of 17.48%. Chainlink Leads Real-World Assets (RWA) Sector Earlier this month, market intelligence platform Santiment reported that Chainlink is at the forefront of the real-world assets (RWA) sector in terms of development activity. Its analysis highlighted that the decentralized oracle network is leading the sector, followed by Synthetix (SNX), a synthetic asset platform based on Ethereum, and Dusk Foundation (DUSK), which focuses on privacy and tokenization. According to the data, Chainlink recorded nearly 394 significant GitHub events in the last 30 days, while Synthetix and Dusk Foundation had 176.6 and 34.7, respectively. Besides, Chainlink has partnered with leading companies such as Coinbase, SWIFT, UBS, and Emirates NBD for the RWA tokenization industry.

In its latest Financial Stability Report , the Bank of Botswana acknowledged the increasing interconnectedness between the crypto market and traditional financial systems globally, warning of potential systemic risks. Systemic risks refer to the cascading failures that can occur within the financial system, potentially triggering broader economic instability. Botswana Calls for Crypto Regulations The central bank of Botswana said regulators “need to develop effective oversight frameworks for the sector.” “Domestically, risks emanating from crypto assets are minimal but ongoing misconduct in the segment presents regulatory concerns.” While the bank noted that Botswana’s virtual asset market is still in its infancy and relatively unsophisticated, posing limited threats to financial stability, it also identified broader concerns tied to financial technology innovations. As tech adoption grows, these risks are expected to increase, requiring proactive measures. A key concern raised by the bank is the use of digital payment instruments, including cryptocurrencies, for money laundering and terrorist financing. It identified the anonymity provided by digital platforms as a significant factor enabling illicit activities and flagged this issue as one of the top five national security risks emanating from the financial sector. “The evolution of digital platforms and digital payment instruments that promote anonymity of transactions present an opportunity for money laundering in the financial sector,” the bank stated, adding that advanced financial technologies make it easier to transmit illicit funds. To address these challenges, the Bank of Botswana called for regulatory oversight to ensure that virtual asset service providers, such as crypto exchanges, comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations. Why #Crypto needs regulation #memecoin #hawktuah pic.twitter.com/Xvos4guTKj — Evan Kirstel #B2B #TechFluencer (@EvanKirstel) December 22, 2024 The bank also recommended enhanced market surveillance and collaboration with law enforcement as strategies to detect and prevent illegal activities. More Countries Push for Crypto Regulations Botswana’s call for crypto regulations comes as more countries are announcing new rules for crypto companies. Just recently, Taiwan announced that it is set to implement its new AML regulations for crypto businesses following fines issued to two exchanges for compliance breaches. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced in November that the deadline for mandatory AML registration for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) has been moved up to November 30, 2024, from the previous January 1, 2025, timeline. Likewise, the United Kingdom plans to introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector early next year. During a London conference last month, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Tulip Siddiq said that the proposed framework will consolidate regulations for stablecoins and staking services under one unified regime. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift.

Lunex Network is rapidly emerging as a prominent topic within the crypto sphere, overshadowing major cryptocurrencies with its robust profit prospects. While established altcoins struggle to maintain momentum, Lunex Network is experiencing a remarkable surge, offering substantial returns to investors in its ongoing presale. Enjoy DeFi’s Best Features With Lunex Network Lunex Network is positioning itself as the top crypto that delivers both real functionality and consistent profits for investors who are constantly on the hunt for features. Despite being a new altcoin, Lunex Network is already dominating the market with its DEX protocol designed to improve trading by addressing major challenges in the DeFi space. This protocol uses a unique aggregation technology to pull liquidity from multiple exchanges. This also ensures that trades can be split for the best prices. Additionally, Lunex Network possesses an advanced smart contract system that continuously verifies transactions, providing real-time information and enhancing the platform’s efficiency and security. Users who hold Lunex Network ‘s native token, LNEX, can enjoy the platform’s best utility and premium features. With LNEX, these holders get amazing staking rewards, and governance voting rights that lets them make decisions regarding the growth of the platform. NEAR Dips Following Current Market State The past month has been highly volatile for NEAR as it has fallen below its previous support zone of $6. After briefly rising from $5.5 to a little over $8 between November end and the first week of December, NEAR is now struggling to maintain a price above $5.5. NEAR trading at around that mark shows a 5.14% decline in the past month and a huge 22.72% decline in a smaller time frame. While many analysts have attributed this fall to the current state of the market, NEAR investors are hopeful that this price trend doesn’t last for too long. Could Recent Fall Cause RNDR to Lose Investor Attention? Like NEAR, RNDR has also been on a downtrend lately. According to Render price charts, RNDR fell drastically from an impressive $9.33 to around $7.30, where it has been trading recently. This represents a decline of over 21%, raising concerns among RNDR investors about the token’s price trajectory leading into 2025. Some investors suspect that RNDR’s token name rebrand to RENDER (and move to Solana from Ethereum) could be a contributing factor to this fall. Despite their worries, there is still a bit of optimism among RNDR investors who are banking on the bullish sentiment around the upcoming United States Presidential swearing-in to boost the official Render price. Conclusion While old-timer cryptos like NEAR and RNDR are fading, the new Lunex Network is steadily making its way to the top of the crypto market. Its live presale, where LNEX tokens are valued at $0.0048 , is the main boost to this growth trend. Having already raised over $5.4 million through the presale, there is no doubt that Lunex Network will become a market giant in no time.

Investors are shocked due to the quickness of the recent crash that wiped out more than $1 billion worth of positions. But these three reasons suggest that BTC crash could be coming to an end. Let’s explore what comes next for the largest cryptocurrency in the world and the rest of the crypto markets. Three Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Crash Could Ends Soon With such a steep crash the question that matters is, “When will the crash end?” The reason why BTC could ends its drop soon can be split into three reasons: BTC techncials suggest that a key support level could absorbe the selling pressure and retire the bears. According to Santiment, short-term BTC holders are in loss and are less likely to sell now and realize losses. Whales that sold Bitcoin before the drop have accumulated 10,o00 BTC between December 19 and 22. Bitcoin Technicals Hint Strong Support The November 11 to December 11 consolidation shows that a 68% of the trading volume occurred between $90.9k and $100k. Although BTC price escaped the aforementioned range and set up an ATH at $108,421, the Fed’s hawkish comments triggered a 15% crash in Bitcoin price. The drop has set a local bottom at $92,230 on December 20, but the selloff might continue until BTC finds a stable support. Such a strong support is the value area low of $90.9k is a support level. This area is the lower limit of where 68% of the volume was traded between November 11 & December 11 and typically serves as an area of strong demand. Hence, there is a high chance of absorbing the selling pressure and ending the ongoing Bitcoin crash. In such a case, Bitcoin price prediciton hints that value area high at $100k is the next key hurdle. Clearing this will put the $102.7k to $105.3k daily imbalance as the next resistance zone. Only after clearing these two barriers will propel BTC to new highs. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart BTC Holders Unlikely to Sell At Loss According to on-chain data provider, Santiment, the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator suggests that a further strong correction is unlikely. The MVRV hovers around -4.17%, which shows that the investors that purchased BTC in the past month are sitting at an average loss of 4.17%. Typically, a -10% to -20% is the opportunity zone, where capitulation from the short-term holders occurs and the transfer of BTC happens to long-term holders. Hence, a minor drop might occur, but a steep drop is highly unlikely considering BTC is already down 18%. This outlook is inline with the aforementioned technical outlook. BTC 30-day MVRV Whales Accumulate BTC On Dips Bitcoin whales have accumulated 10,000 BTC in just under four days, between December 19 and 22, according to data from Santiment. This outlook is in line with the technicals and short-term holder scenario, both of which suggest that the ongoing crash could end soon. BTC Supply Distirbution What’s Next For BTC? All in all, the outlook for Bitcoin could improve soon despite being drastically bearish in the past week. The $90.9k or the $90k psychological support level will be key in deciding where BTC could head next. Therefore, investors must pay close attention to the aforementioned levels as it could kickstart a recovery rally or a consolidation phase.

Solana ($SOL), Binance Coin ($BNB), and Theta Network ($THETA) are three likely candidates for breakouts. Total 3 chart (altcoins) analysis Source: TradingView Total 3 tracks the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies except $BTC and $ETH. The 2-week chart shows that the combined market cap is still on target to achieve the measured move out of its cup and handle pattern (drawn in yellow). This suggests that altcoins have quite some way to go in order to attain this target of $1.29 trillion. It could also be borne in mind that a possible even bigger cup and handle pattern could be playing out, with the handle being formed right now. On the downside, the RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing that this current red 2-week candle has resulted in the indicator line being rejected from the descending trendline. This indicator line will definitely need to turn back up and break the descending trendline in order to reverse the downward trend. $SOL could be the first of the major altcoins to recover Source: TradingView Solana’s descent over these last few weeks has surprised many. A beautiful cup and handle pattern had broken to the upside, and all seemed very bright for the $SOL price going forward. However, the major support at $202 gave way and the price continued on down to finally be held up by good support at $176. This also coincides with the upward trendline. $SOL is currently up 2.3% on Monday so far, and has come up against the first horizontal resistance at $184. $SOL bulls will need to break this and then repeat this feat if the price can get back to the pivotal $202 major resistance. The Stochastic RSI (momentum indicator) on the weekly chart is fast returning to the bottom and a potential reset. Compared with $BTC and major altcoins, this indicator for $SOL is a lot more advanced, meaning that $SOL could start its main recovery before most. $BNB breakout or break of trend Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BNB is very similar to that of $SOL, given that the upward trend is still in force. However, $BNB is at its breakout level right now. A band of very strong resistance stretches from $660 to $675, and the price is up against the upper of these resistances currently. $BNB will either now break out again, or the upward trend will be broken to the downside. The Stochastic RSI is on the way down, but not being as advanced as that of $SOL, the downward momentum could keep the price suppressed a while longer. $THETA bulls still have it all to do Source: TradingView Unlike $SOL and $BNB, the $THETA price is still a long, long way from its all-time high. With the bull market potentially in its last stage, this does not bode well for $THETA in the longer term. That said, the price is up 4.4% so far on Monday, bringing it to the major horizontal resistance at $2.25. Bulls need to push the price through this level and above the last local high at $3.80 in order for any kind of recovery to take place. Nevertheless, with the Stochastic RSI indicators on their way back down from the top, the likelihood of rejection is probably quite high. If this does take place, a lower low below $0.90 must be avoided. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The higher price range is less volatile, translating into much smaller expected crashes. Bitcoin had the smallest drawdowns as a fraction of its price during the 2024 bull run . As the year closes, the most dramatic slide for BTC happened when the leading coin erased 32% of its value. Cycle drawdowns usually require months of recovery, while smaller price fluctuations allow for the rallies to resume faster. Bitcoin (BTC) had the smallest drawdowns during the 2022-2024 bull cycle, but the past 12 months arrived with even lower volatility. | Source: Glassnode The August 5 drawdown was the record loss for the year, and in hindsight, the prime opportunity to buy the dip. Since then, BTC drawdowns and volatility have decreased further, with losses limited to 25%. BTC traded at $96,071.21 as of December 23, after a recent dip under $94,000. The leading coin retains a dominance of 57.3%, still retaining its lead over Ethereum (ETH). At the higher price range, drawdowns become even smaller, as most traders are avoiding panic-selling. The recent behavior is also due to the previous experience of seeing whales buying during every dip, absorbing more of the previous retail investments. The 2024 bull cycle outperformed while sustaining lower volatility The 2024 bull cycle started from a low of $16,000 and extended to a peak of $108,000. Later, BTC corrected under $95,000, but with no signs of a bigger drawdown. Traders were much more cautious in 2024, though leveraged positions were still liquidated periodically. The 2022-2024 bull cycle followed the previous 2019-2021 price range, which was one of the most dramatic in the history of Bitcoin. From 2019 onward, BTC attempted new all-time highs, but the rally was cut short by the uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic. The previous cycle started with lows of $4,000 and peaked above $61,000. Drawdowns during that cycle reached 61.8% during the days of the biggest market panic. After the post-pandemic period and the crash of FTX, Bitcoin trading became more mature, finding other sources of liquidity. The leading coin still managed to become the main narrative for the year, extending its dominance to over 70% of the crypto market capitalization. During the most recent bull cycle, BTC also found support from corporate buying, especially the involvement of MicroStrategy (MSTR) and other mining companies building up treasuries. The biggest factor sustaining a relatively low volatility for this bull cycle was also the inflow of stablecoins during periods of weakened price action. This time, Tether, Inc. did not allow bigger drawdowns, and whales also bought the dip. BTC also did not go for a freefall as ETF buyers joined the game, buying more coins on behalf of their investors. BlackRock built one of the biggest Bitcoin reserves, after constant inflows into its ETF. At the highest price range, some whales managed to realize profits, but the overall conviction is to hold BTC as a reserve coin for a jump to an even higher price range. Will BTC still have a big correction? The relatively low volatility raises questions on whether Bitcoin can return to a bear market and post a bigger drawdown. One long-term prediction is that BTC may slide as low as $85,000 from the $100,000 level before re-launching its 2025 bull market. BTC achieved 2% volatility on average, still allowing for dramatic price moves in the short term. The current BTC price based on the Rainbow chart is still in the accumulation range, with no indications of a market peak. This time around, traders are much more careful when allocating leveraged liquidity, which keeps the BTC price within a range. The biggest accumulation of liquidity is at around $93,660, potentially driving the price downward to liquidate those positions. The Bitcoin fear and greed index returned above 70 points, once again indicating greed. In 2024, the price moves near the BTC peak are more often caused by whale traders instead of a mix of FOMO and panic-selling. After even a small dip, greedy trading behavior returns, suggesting a short-term bullish outlook.

Next Big Crypto?",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/lunex-network-leads-defi-at-the-forefront-in-presale/,"The post Whales Fuel BONK Surge, Monero Rallies Strong! Next Big Crypto? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Out of ashes, a Phoenix shall rise. That’s probably the befitting quote that highlights Monero and BONK’s recent surge. BONK price is gaining traction again – a major listing and surging whale activities have pushed it to a new ATH. Monero, often under regulatory fire, has also shown signs of life with a 5.8% rally despite recent adversities. It’s even better for the new DeFi powerhouse, Lunex Network. Its ongoing presale surged powerfully by 300% after $5.4 million has been raised, thanks to its redefining DeFi revolution. Are these the next big crypto? Lunex Network leads DeFi At The Forefront In Presale. The Next Big Crypto? In a landscape where established crypto are making waves, the DeFi all-rounder and the next big crypto crown is taken away by Lunex Network. This hybrid exchange is not just entering the market—it’s rewriting the rules of trading by addressing the flaws that have long plagued both centralized and decentralized platforms. This alone supersedes BONK’s speculative fad and Monero’s regulatory battles. Lunex Network bridges the divide between CEXs and DEXs with a revolutionary hybrid model, delivering the best of both worlds. The tech is one of a kind, too. It offers unbeatable security from its Enclave-backed noncustodial asset management solution, institutional-grade liquidity, an enterprise-grade e-commerce solution for businesses, and up-to-date trading tools for traders. Nothing comes close, and it’s easy to see why analysts think it’s the next big crypto. Whale’s Big Buys And Major Listing Fuel BONK Surge BONK’s price has been surging on the tailwind of meme coins’ resurgence. Whale activity and a listing that put BONK’s price in the Asian market spotlight have propelled this Solana star to a new ATH. In a bold move, a high-profile whale poured $3.4 million USDC into acquiring a staggering 65.4 billion BONK tokens. The hefty snap-up that showcases investors’ confidence has boosted sentiment for the BONK price. Beyond this, BONK’s recent securing of a listing on South Korea’s Upbit exchange has also heightened trading activity. Open interest is up in the sky, too. BONK’s OI went from under $10 million to $60 million, and the sharp rise improved market participation. Monero Shows Signs Of Strength Despite Adversities. Dominance in adversity—that’s rare, but Monero is pulling that off. Its privacy-focused solution, which has been getting on regulatory and exchanges’ nerves, has defied bearish pressure. Despite regulatory hurdles and exchange delistings, Monero’s price blew up 5% to $160, marking an astonishing 15% rebound from its monthly lows. Privacy coins like Monero have long been targets of regulatory scrutiny. Kraken recently delisted the coin in compliance with MiCA. Yet, Monero’s advocates remain resilient. Technically, Monero shows promising signs of recovery. Conclusion As BONK price and Monero rally amid market optimism, Lunex Network is emerging as the true game-changer in the crypto world. Lunex Network is rewriting the DeFi playbook with its hybrid exchange model that bridges the best features of both CEXs and DEXs. This is paying off already! $5.4 million was raised in liquidity, and analysts are saying its 300% growth is just the beginning.

In a December 21 post on X, Saylor outlined a strategic plan to establish a Bitcoin reserve , promote digital asset innovation, and solidify the U.S. as a global leader in the digital economy. Saylor’s framework identifies six key categories within the digital asset space: digital commodities like Bitcoin, digital securities, digital currencies, digital tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and asset-backed tokens. These categories aim to define clear roles for issuers, exchanges, and owners, ensuring transparent and accountable participation across the industry. Economic Impact of the Proposed Framework The proposed Bitcoin reserve lies at the heart of Saylor’s plan, with projections indicating it could create between $16 trillion and $81 trillion in wealth. By reducing issuance costs from millions to mere thousands of dollars and expanding market access from 4,000 public companies to 40 million businesses, the framework envisions a 21st-century capital markets renaissance. Saylor also highlights the potential for the U.S. dollar to emerge as the global reserve digital currency, propelling the expansion of global digital capital markets from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with U.S. investors capturing the lion’s share. A notable aspect of the framework is its focus on efficiency and innovation, advocating for industry-led compliance mechanisms. The plan suggests capping compliance costs at 1% of assets for token issuance and 0.1% annually for maintenance, aiming to reduce friction and bureaucracy. Mixed Reactions While Saylor’s proposal has garnered attention for its ambitious scope, it has also faced criticism. Serial Bitcoin detractor Peter Schiff dismissed the idea as “complete bullshit,” arguing that it would weaken the dollar, increase national debt, and harm America’s credibility. Nevertheless, MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with over 439,000 BTC valued at more than $41 billion, remains a testament to Saylor’s unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. With an aggregate portfolio profit of 54%, according to SaylorTracker, the company showcases Bitcoin’s transformative financial power .

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

The XLM price has formed a falling wedge pattern and found support at the 50-day moving average, indicating an eventual comeback as investors buy the dip. Stellar Price Technical Analysis: Falling Wedge Forms The Stellar Lumens coin fell sharply and formed a few lower lows and lower highs as Bitcoin and most altcoins crashed. This decline has seen it form a falling wedge chart pattern, which is made up of two falling trendlines. The upper trendline connects the highest level on December 2 and 17, while the lower lines link the lower lows since November 26. A falling wedge is a highly popular reversal sign. In most cases, this reversal happens when the two lines are nearing their confluence levels, which is about to happen. Another bullish case is that the XLM price has found support at the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. This retracement links the lowest and highest levels in 2024. Further, the Stellar price seems to have completed its mean reversion, which explains why it crashed in the past few days. Mean reversion is when a cryptocurrency or a stock return to its average price. In this case, it has found substantial support at the 50-day moving average, where it has failed to drop below in the past two consecutive days. XLM price has also found support near the lower side of Andrew’s pitchfork tool. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the coming days. If this happens, it may rally and retest the psychological point at $0.50, which coincides with the 23.6% retracement level. Stellar Price Chart Stellar Lumens price’s bullish view will become invalid if the coin slips below last week’s low at $0.3125. Such a drop will see it drop to the psychological level at $0.30. XLM Price Has Bullish Fundamentals Stellar Price has some bullish fundamentals that could push its price higher in the next few weeks. The first big thing is that Stellar and Ripple are often seen as ‘cousins’ since they target the payment industry. Also, Stellar’s founder, Jed McCaleb, is one of Ripple’s founder. Stellar and Ripple are “cousins” Therefore, Ripple’s performance could benefit the XLM price as it has previously done. As we wrote earlier, analysts are optimistic that the XRP price will skyrocket by 60% if the SEC approves a spot XRP fund. Another analyst expects the Ripple price to surge to $4 as Binance transactions rise. Further, Stellar’s network is doing relatively well as the DeFi total value locked stages a slow recovery. DeFi Llama data shows that the Stellar Network had a TVL of over 135 million XLM, higher than last week’s low of 112 XLM. Therefore, a combination of strong fundamentals and technicals may help the Stellar price rebound in the near term.

Bad actors have seemingly found a new way to exploit crypto users by sharing seed phrases, tricking victims into attempting to steal funds from a multi-signature wallet, only to fall victim to the scam themselves. In a blog post on Dec. 23, Russia’s sanctioned cybersecurity firm Kaspersky revealed a scam after a comment appeared under a finance YouTube video. The user shared their seed phrase and asked for help transferring funds from their wallet, which experts quickly flagged as suspicious. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao stated in an X post that receiving crypto through a private key or hardware wallet is a “bad idea,” citing “several instances” where this has occurred.

Or better, just ask the giver to send it to… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 22, 2024 A seed phrase is a unique sequence of words needed to access a cryptocurrency wallet, and sharing it openly can lead to theft. Kaspersky notes that the comment appeared to be from a beginner, with other similar comments following, all from “from newly created accounts.” These messages contained seed phrases and requests for assistance with fund transfers. In the scam, a thief accessing the wallet would find it filled with Tether’s ( USDT ). However, to withdraw the funds, the thief would need TRON ( TRX ). “Unfortunately, the wallet doesn’t have enough TRX, so the thief tries to transfer TRX from their own personal wallet — only to discover that the tokens they transferred immediately ended up in a completely different, third wallet.” Kaspersky You might also like: Kaspersky warns of new MacOS malware aiming at crypto wallets The trick lies in the wallet’s multi-signature setup, the analysts say, adding that this type of wallets requires approval from multiple parties to authorize transactions. As a result, even if the scammer paid the necessary fees, they would not be able to steal the funds. Kaspersky warned that this scam is an example of how scammers can manipulate thieves, encouraging users to avoid sharing seed phrases and to stay cautious of similar schemes. In June, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on 12 senior leaders at Kaspersky Lab, citing cybersecurity risks, a day after announcing plans to ban the sale of the Russian company’s antivirus software.

Tether’s $775 million investment in Rumble shows its commitment to fostering financial freedom and technological independence, while Securitize’s proposal to use the BlackRock-backed BUIDL fund as collateral for the Frax USD stablecoin signals a shift towards more secure and yield-generating stablecoin reserves. Tether Invests $775M in Rumble to Challenge YouTube’s Market Dominance Tether , the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, announced a $775 million investment in Rumble, an alternative video-sharing platform known for its open-content policies. The investment is part of Tether’s broader mission of fostering independence and resilience through strategic collaborations. Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardonio took to X on Dec. 20 to share his thoughts on the landmark investment. ”Tether deeply believes in the fundamental values of freedom of speech and financial freedom,” Ardonio stated, adding that the company’s decision to back Rumble aligns with these principles. Ardonio emphasized that Rumble’s ethos of promoting independence and resilience resonated with Tether's vision. “Our strategic investment in Rumble greatly underscores Tether’s focus on supporting technology and companies that empower humans, delivering independence and resilience to our society,” he explained. The collaboration will extend beyond mere financial backing. According to Ardonio, Tether and Rumble are planning to work together on innovative solutions in advertising, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency payments. Rumble’s alternative platform has gained popularity among users and content creators who prioritize free speech and minimal content restrictions. The infusion of $775 million from Tether provides the company with significant resources to expand its global reach and technological capabilities. The announcement had an immediate impact on Rumble’s market performance. The company’s share price (RUM) surged 51.60% during after-hours trading, reaching $10.90, according to Google Finance data . This dramatic increase suggests investor optimism about Rumble’s growth prospects and its potential to challenge established players like YouTube. The partnership with Tether follows Rumble’s growing interest in cryptocurrency. On Nov. 25, Rumble confirmed plans to add Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet, allocating up to $20 million from its excess cash reserves. The move came after Pavlovski conducted a poll on X, asking his followers if Rumble should invest in Bitcoin. Out of nearly 44,000 responses, an overwhelming 93.9% voted in favor. Implications for the Tech and Crypto Industries Tether’s investment marks a significant milestone for both the cryptocurrency and tech sectors. For Tether, the partnership reflects its strategy of extending its influence beyond the stablecoin market into broader technological ecosystems. By backing Rumble, Tether is not only championing free speech but also paving the way for greater crypto adoption in the digital media industry. For Rumble, the $775 million infusion provides the means to scale its operations, enhance platform features, and attract a larger user base. The collaboration with Tether could lead to groundbreaking advancements in crypto payment solutions, potentially revolutionizing how creators and advertisers transact on the platform. As Rumble gears up to challenge YouTube’s dominance, the stakes are high. YouTube, backed by Google, has long held a monopolistic position in the video-sharing market. However, Rumble’s unique positioning as a platform that prioritizes content freedom and financial independence could attract creators and users seeking alternatives. The partnership with Tether may also enable Rumble to leverage blockchain technology in innovative ways, such as integrating crypto payments for content creators or employing decentralized cloud solutions to enhance platform scalability and security. Securitize Proposes BlackRock-Backed BUIDL Fund as Collateral for Frax USD Stablecoin In related news, Securitize, the brokerage firm behind the tokenized BlackRock US Dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has submitted a Frax improvement proposal (FIP) to integrate BUIDL as a backing collateral for the Frax USD stablecoin. The proposal, if approved, could mark a significant shift in how stablecoins are collateralized, leveraging tokenized real-world assets ( RWAs ) backed by one of the world’s most trusted financial institutions. The proposal highlights the unique advantages of using BUIDL as a reserve asset for Frax USD: Yield Opportunities: BUIDL invests in United States government securities, offering a stable and secure yield for collateral reserves. Enhanced Liquidity and Transferability: The tokenized structure of BUIDL enables seamless transactions and broader liquidity options for users and platforms. Reduced Counterparty Risk: Backed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, BUIDL introduces a level of trust and transparency uncommon in traditional stablecoin collateral assets. According to the proposal, these benefits would provide a more robust and scalable foundation for Frax USD, enhancing its stability and utility in the growing stablecoin market. Despite its potential, the integration of BUIDL as collateral for Frax USD is not a done deal. The Frax community will need to vote on the improvement proposal, a standard process in decentralized governance. If approved, BUIDL would join the reserve assets backing Frax USD, bringing a blend of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to the forefront of stablecoin innovation. The move comes amidst growing adoption of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as collateral in the stablecoin ecosystem. RWAs like BUIDL offer cost efficiencies, rapid transaction finality, and the potential for high-yield opportunities, making them an attractive alternative to traditional stablecoin reserve assets. BlackRock’s involvement in the crypto space through BUIDL has further legitimized RWAs as a viable option for collateralization. By backing the tokenized fund with short-term US government securities, BUIDL provides unparalleled transparency and security, aligning with the strict requirements of both regulators and DeFi communities. Securitize’s proposal follows closely on the heels of other milestones for BUIDL. Ethena Labs, the developer behind the USDe synthetic dollar, launched a separate BUIDL-backed stablecoin called USDtb in December 2024. Unlike USDe, which relies on a complex delta-neutral trading strategy, USDtb is overcollateralized 1:1 by cash and short-term US government securities in the BUIDL fund. USDtb’s launch was met with significant enthusiasm, accruing $65 million in total value locked (TVL) on its first trading day. This success reflects growing confidence in tokenized assets and their potential to reshape stablecoin markets. BUIDL as a Game-Changer in Collateral Markets BlackRock’s ambitions for BUIDL extend beyond stablecoins. In October 2024, the asset manager began pushing for BUIDL to be used as collateral on major crypto derivatives exchanges. Talks with platforms like Binance, OKX, and Deribit signaled BlackRock’s intent to challenge the dominance of incumbent stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle in the collateral space. The integration of BUIDL as collateral for derivatives trading could introduce new competition and innovation, providing traders with a stable and secure alternative to existing collateral options. The use of BUIDL as collateral is not limited to Ethena’s USDtb or potential Frax USD applications. As of November 2024, the Elixir Protocol enabled the minting of its deUSD yield-bearing stablecoin on the Curve decentralized exchange, using BUIDL as backing collateral. This integration allows users to exchange deUSD with other stablecoin assets in Curve’s liquidity pools, further expanding the utility and adoption of BUIDL in DeFi ecosystems. If the Frax improvement proposal gains community approval, it could set a new benchmark for stablecoin collateralization by integrating tokenized real-world assets from globally trusted financial institutions. By leveraging BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, Frax USD could offer unparalleled stability, transparency, and liquidity, making it a formidable competitor in the stablecoin market. The proposal also brings attention to a broader trend: the increasing convergence of TradFi and DeFi. As major asset managers like BlackRock continue to explore tokenized assets, the lines between traditional and decentralized finance are blurring, opening new doors for innovation and collaboration.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-23 13:30:00

Over the past week, Sun offloaded 39,999 ETH worth $143 million, coinciding with Ethereum’s price plummeting by 17% after being rejected at the $4,000 resistance level. Analysts suggest the market could face further downward pressure, with Ethereum potentially dipping below $3,000 before any signs of recovery emerge. Justin Sun’s Aggressive Ethereum Sell-Off Sun has been on a selling spree , unloading Ethereum during key price rallies since the U.S. election results. Blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain revealed that the Tron founder redeemed the latest batch of 39,999 ETH from liquid staking platforms Lido Finance and EtherFi, transferring the full amount to HTX. Since mid-November, Sun has sold a total of 108,919 ETH, valued at approximately $400 million, at an average price of $3,674. Interestingly, these deposits frequently occurred during local price peaks, potentially exacerbating Ethereum’s recent price slump. Adding to the market jitters, Sun has another 42,904 ETH worth $139 million currently unstaking from Lido Finance. Market watchers believe these funds could also be funneled into HTX, amplifying selling pressure. Bearish Dip or Bullish Reversal? Ethereum’s price has breached critical support at $3,500 , turning market sentiment bearish. Popular crypto analyst IncomeSharks noted last weekend’s low trading volume, suggesting that immediate sell-offs may not be ideal given the current volatility. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator shows steady buying and selling activity, with recent buyers still in profit. However, this support might not hold, as technical charts indicate room for Ethereum to test the $3,000 mark. Not all outlooks are bearish, though. Prominent analyst “I am Crypto Wolf” pointed to a developing inverse head-and-shoulders (iHS) pattern, which could trigger a bullish breakout by late January. If the pattern holds, Ethereum could target $10,000 by May 2025, though a retest of $3,000 seems likely in the short term.

Pre-fabricated press releases about DB Wealth Institute manufactured its legitimacy, even to the extent that it was syndicated to major platforms like Yahoo Finance and Forbes, while in fact this was just an attempt to make it appear credible to prospective victims. A Three-Step Strategy Pape explained that most of these schemes follow a three-step strategy: building confidence, fueling greed, and instilling fear. Victims are enticed with small, quick profits early on, creating a false sense of security. Once trust is established, scammers pressure them into larger investments , often suggesting loans to capitalize on so-called “exclusive opportunities”. Pape described how fraudsters put pressure on him to invest up to $20,000 following the first successful trade. That, he said, was the climax of the scam because the fraudsters disappear once they get good money. Raising Awareness and Taking Action Rather than waiting for the social media sites to do something, Pape took it upon himself, publishing these scams right out front. He shared his experience in view of educating other users on how to spot such scams and not fall prey. As crypto-related scams continue to rise, including the $2.2 billion lost globally in 2024 alone, according to Chainalysis, the actions of Pape serve to remind people of vigilance and informed decision-making. His call for action couldn’t be louder: don’t let greed cloud your judgment and always verify the legitimacy of financial opportunities. In the process, Pape reinforces his mission of protecting ordinary investors against financial pitfalls and cements his position as a voice to be trusted in personal finance.",Blockchain|Australia|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-23 13:32:45

Meanwhile, Central and South Asia and Oceania, which includes Kazakhstan, ranked third globally, accounting for 16.6% of the total market value.

For Consumers: Seamless access to spot trading. Today, WhiteBIT operates from 7 offices worldwide, serving over 5.5 million users. Additionally, the WhiteBIT Group holding, which includes the crypto exchange, supports a global user base exceeding 30 million. Committed to compliance, WhiteBIT adheres to the laws of the countries where it has a presence and consistently aims to be among the first to secure licenses in new jurisdictions. This proactive approach ensures reliability and fosters trust among users worldwide. This year, WhiteBIT also became one of the first cryptocurrency exchanges to apply for a license in Turkey and secure inclusion in the official registry. This milestone underscores the company's commitment to meeting local regulatory requirements. “Securing VASP licenses in Croatia, Italy, and In-Principle Approval from the Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA) in Kazakhstan marks a significant achievement in our mission to make digital assets accessible to everyone and integrate innovation into the financial system. Our goal is to drive the global adoption of cryptocurrencies by creating a reliable, transparent, and innovative ecosystem for users. These licenses allow us to deliver high-quality products and services in these regions while fostering strong partnerships with regulators who support transparency and compliance,” said Volodymyr Nosov, founder and CEO of WhiteBIT. WhiteBIT is committed to expanding its global presence, with a particular focus on Asia. As the cryptocurrency industry evolves, the company aims to deliver localized services in emerging markets. This approach will solidify WhiteBIT's position as a leading industry player and cater to the growing demand for cryptocurrency products across diverse regions.

Matador Plans To Buy $4.5M BTC In December In a recent announcement, Matador Technologies said that it has received approval from its Board to add Bitcoin and USD-denominated assets into its corporate strategy.

Solana is also continuing its downward trend after the increased pressure on financial markets due to a pessimistic statement made by the chair of the US Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Rollblock is attracting massive capital inflows with 30,000+ daily active users on its DeFi iGambling platform. Can Rollblock outshine XRP and SOL in early 2025? Rollblock: Players turn into investors with DeFi iGambling platform Rollblock’s viral iGambling platform has already delivered returns of 330% to early investors, making analysts even more bullish on the token until the end of this cycle. Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem is rooted in a unique idea to bring decentralized governance to online gambling platforms. With Ethereum-backed security and a blockchain-powered ecosystem, Rollblock is ready to disrupt the $500 billion per annum global gambling market in 2025. During its explosive presale phase, Rollblock has gained the trust of more than 30,000 daily active users. This bullish momentum is all thanks to Rollblock’s dual appeal as a gaming platform and investment opportunity. Traders can purchase RBLK for a low price of $0.043 and gain exclusive access to Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem which has 7,000+ AI-powered games. Every financial transaction made on Rollblock is executed via a smart contract that has already passed a comprehensive SolidProof audit.

If traders add RBLK to their staking pool, they can earn weekly staking rewards. The platform also shares up to 30% of its weekly revenue with long-term token holders through rewards, giving RBLK investors the chance to earn a passive income. Rollblock investors benefit from both gameplay and staking rewards, creating a new league of player-investors who are expected to reap a total of 880% gains before the end of RBLK’s presale.

If the SEC fails to meet the January 15 deadline in its longstanding case against Ripple, XRP could experience a second significant rally. If the SEC case concludes, XRP will likely rally toward the short-term resistance at $2.62. XRP whales are also showing interest in the token as they recently purchased $250 million worth of XRP from decentralized exchanges. However, some market experts believe XRP’s short holders could liquidate up to $20.50 million worth of tokens at the next price target.

Solana: Bearish trend continues after 30% decline in value James Powell, chairman of the US Fed, has announced that there will be no more interest rate cuts before 2025. After this announcement, Solana’s price suffered a massive crash below the critical $200 support. Solana’s price has already declined 30% from its November high but analysts believe it could record a steeper decline before the end of this cycle. Solana is currently trading for $183.67 after an intraday decrease of 3.70%. According to the SOL/USDT 4-hour chart, Solana is in bearish territory as the token trades below all of its Exponential Moving Averages.

Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $38 level by 2027 and above $100 by 2030. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bearish spell today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are losing money, so is UNI. The cryptocurrency has lost more than 1.66 percent of its value over the last 24 hours, moreover, its price has decreased down to $13.832. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading near the $8 range, down from $15.3, which it achieved in March this year. The current resistance levels are $10 and $12; a break above them can lead to $15. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by 2026. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Will UNI reach $100? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, UNI is expected to reach $100 by the second quarter of 2030. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting as the coin’s value will increase more than tenfold in this scenario. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Cryptopolitan expects UNI’s price to reach $109 by the end of 2030, substantially higher than its current price.

However, his legal team is constantly working on reducing the sentence, which is why the upcoming bankruptcy proceedings in January 2025 are crucial. However, rumors are circulating about Sam getting Joe Biden’s presidential pardon, and here is why. Sam Bankman Fried Might Get Presidential Pardon In January Sam Bankman Fried founded FTX around five years ago and pushed it to the biggest and most popular crypto exchange position. However, he also became the reason behind its collapse around 3 years ago, when he and his associates used the investor’s money for personal gains, emptying the holding and pushing the exchange to bankruptcy. With that, he created an unforgettable series of events for investors. However, he is going to spend 25 years imprisoned unless he receives the Presidential pardon, which might be in process as recent findings reveal political connections. Meanwhile, his associates, like Caroline Ellison, had just started their imprisonment . These rumors began with a Polymarket discussion, which started in April 2024, as to whether President Biden would use his Presidential pardon to save Bankman-Fried. A few percent of people agreed, and the remaining were clueless as the presidential election was underway. However, now Trump has won the election, and the inauguration is due on January 20, 2025. With that, the question remerged as ‘Will Sam Bankman Fried get Biden’s pardon?’ especially as Sam was among the biggest contributors to Biden’s campaign in the 2020 presidential race. At that time, the former CEO and founder donated $5.2M to Biden’s campaign. Further findings also indicate that Sam spent more than $40M on Democrats, in which The Protect Our Future PAC got $27M, the House Majority PAC got $6 million, and much more. With that the rumors of political favors began, as Sam could get Biden’s pardon to settle the support debt. With that, the recent Polymarket betting on Joe Biden pardoning Sam Bankman Fried has reached 16%, currently 9%. More importantly, Elon Musk fueled the fire with his recent comments on these Biden pardon rumors. Elon Musk Will Be Shocked If This Didn’t Happen Wall Street Mav, an X page with 1.5M followers, posted on X today, saying, “Guess who might get an early pardon from President Biden.” Along with the question, he shared the Sam and Biden pics, further revealing that Sam was the second-largest donor to Democrats. Interestingly, the post received 800K plus views and comments from Tesla owner Elon Musk, further boosting the claims. He said, “I will be shocked if this doesn’t happen.” Although this escalated the situation, Biden has not shown signs of this. However, the netizen’s concerns are persistent, as just a few weeks ago, Joe gave the presidential pardon to his son, Hunter Biden, despite previous promises not to do so. Interestingly, a crypto investor made $331k , betting Joe Biden would pardon his son. Final Thoughts Bankman’s upcoming hearing is near Donald Trump taking the position as the 47th president. Interestingly, rumors have begun circulating, stating that Joe Biden would use the Presidential Pardon to give some slack to FTX founder Sam Bankman Fried due to their political ties. This conclusion is with findings that Sam was the second biggest donor to democrats during the 2022 election, in which Joe Biden won. However, there is no clear evidence around this, but Biden’s pardon of his son has increased the possibility of this happening.

Charles Hoskinson also noted that Cardano could have more partnership opportunities than ever in 2025. Hoskinson particularly highlighted the network’s recent partnership with Bitcoin smart contract and interoperability solution provider BitcoinOS.

With advanced AI models, AURA evaluates blockchain activities, such as transaction patterns and app usage, and uses them to deliver custom-tailored actions. For example, the tool can recognize and recommend relevant services to frequent decentralized exchange ( DEX ) traders or guide the bridging funds to new blockchains, fostering a seamless user experience. An AI agent for digital advertising AURA operates unlike traditional targeting models. As an AI agent, it aligns the user’s and ecosystem’s interests to reward value-driven suggestions and promote a fair attention economy. In the spirit of seamless experience, AURA embeds personalized recommendations directly into Web3 platforms like wallets, dApps, and blockchain explorers. For example, AURA can dynamically organize app catalogs for crypto wallets, leverage transaction history for context-aware suggestions on swap and bridge pages, and analyze transaction patterns to recommend the next steps for blockchain explorers. The new approach aims to boost audience engagement while upholding trust and transparency. AURA’s ecosystem runs on the native ADX token, which marketers and developers can stake to enhance recommendation placement or streamline placement approvals. The native token’s synergy with AURA is designed to contribute to the platform’s overall trust and transparency. The goal of AURA Ivo Georgiev, the CEO of AdEx, shared his vision of the project: “AdEx AURA represents a significant step forward for Web3 engagement. It’s not just about analyzing on-chain activity—it’s about delivering smarter, more personalized interactions that benefit everyone in the ecosystem.” Finally, AURA represents the first of several new projects of the company, and AdEx has invited crypto platforms to explore and benefit from the tool.

Despite the sharp pullback, Solana demonstrates resilience, offering investors a promising long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Bought $1 Billion ETH In The Past 96 Hours – Details Renowned crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared his insights on X, highlighting a compelling technical setup for SOL. According to Runefelt, Solana has successfully retested a massive triangle pattern on the weekly timeframe. This critical retest suggests that Solana’s price action remains intact and could serve as a launching pad for a significant rally shortly. While broader market corrections have weighed down short-term sentiment, Solana’s ability to maintain its structural integrity amidst the downturn provides a glimmer of hope for bulls. If SOL can sustain its current levels and build momentum, it may soon recover lost ground and chart a path toward new highs. Analysts closely watch how Solana responds to this crucial technical signal, as it could define the altcoin’s trajectory in the coming weeks. Solana Holding A Bullish Structure Despite a 30% retrace from its all-time high, Solana (SOL) maintains a bullish structure on higher timeframes, signaling long-term strength. This resilience has analysts and investors optimistic about Solana’s potential to outperform once the market regains momentum. Known for its strong fundamentals and rapid adoption, SOL remains a favorite among traders who are anticipating the next altcoin rally. Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting an encouraging pattern for Solana. Runefelt revealed that SOL has successfully retested a massive triangle formation on the weekly timeframe, a critical milestone for its bullish trajectory.

This projection aligns with expectations that Solana will be a frontrunner in the next market-wide rally.

Bitcoin, the market leader, has struggled to reclaim the $100K level, and negative sentiment continues to weigh on traders’ confidence. This lingering doubt poses challenges for altcoins like Solana, which often depend on a strong Bitcoin performance to sustain rallies. Testing Crucial Demand Solana is currently trading at $185, showing resilience after successfully holding the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $175. This key level is often regarded as a strong indicator of long-term market strength, and SOL’s ability to defend it underscores the asset’s bullish potential. On a weekly timeframe, Solana continues to make higher lows, signaling a positive trend despite recent market volatility. This price action suggests that buyers remain confident in SOL’s long-term prospects, stepping in to defend critical support levels. If the $175 mark continues to act as a strong foundation, Solana is well-positioned for a quick recovery in the days ahead.

That’s the question many investors are asking right now. In August, XRP’s case was nearing resolution after a pivotal ruling against the SEC. However, Trump’s pro-crypto win has fueled speculations that Ripple’s four-year ordeal will end soon. The result was a 450% surge, but that’s not all. XRP is getting massive institutional interest. In fact, whales poured in over $250m in December amid the increasing likelihood of an XRP ETF. But the appeal has now extended to its recent RLUSD stablecoin launch, potentially marking 2025 as the year of XRP’s dominance. SUI: Ecosystem growth, strategic partnerships and a bright future SUI’s layer one blockchain network has created another compelling narrative for the best crypto to buy. More than a year after its launch, SUI is thriving due to its strategic partnerships and key integrations. Recently, SUI unveiled a partnership with Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to enable seamless USDC transfers across multiple blockchains. Sui’s collaboration with Arkham to improve on-chain data analysis has further bolstered sentiment. As a result, analysts are increasingly bullish on its price trajectory. In fact, renowned analyst Joshua Orhue predicted a long-term surge to $1 by Q1 2025 and optimistic targets reaching $25 by next year’s end. Conclusion The bull run is gaining momentum, and Rollblock has emerged as the standout contender alongside XRP and SUI. The established duo is thriving on their ecosystem strides and institutional growth. Rollblock, too, has excelled with its GambleFi solution attracting whales. Right now, investors seeking high-growth opportunities are finding Rollblock a promising contender. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials.

Digital asset investment products recorded $308 million in inflows last week, but the week ended with $1 billion in outflows over the final two days, including $576 million on Dec. 19 alone, according to data collected by CoinShares. In a Monday blog post , the Jersey-headquartered firm said the sharp outflows came after market reactions to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance. Total assets under management for digital asset exchange-traded products fell by $17.7 billion, representing a 0.37% decline in assets under management, marking the 13th largest single-day outflow on record, said CoinShares head of research James Butterfill.

However, selective interest in altcoins persisted, with XRP ($8.8 million), Horizen ($4.8 million), and Polkadot ($1.9 million) showing positive inflows.

Major cryptos down as investors appear to be taking profits,https://crypto.news/christmas-lull-major-cryptos-down-as-investors-appear-to-be-taking-profits/,"Despite being just a day away from Christmas Eve, the crypto market shows no signs of recovery, as Bitcoin, the flagship crypto asset, has failed to stay above $100,000. Crypto prices continue to show a lackluster response from investors despite approaching Christmas Eve—a period that has historically seen most crypto assets rally, reaching new all-time highs and contributing to the festive mood. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which reached a new all-time high of over $108,000 just six days ago, has struggled to reclaim the $100K mark for the past three days. The flagship cryptocurrency has been down 8.3% over the past week, trading at $95,904 per coin. Other high-cap coins were also observed in a similarly subdued state. Ethereum ( ETH ) has fallen by 15.6% over the past 7 days, currently trading at $3,339. Meanwhile, XRP , linked to Ripple, has also experienced a notable 7.8% decline during the same period, now trading at $2.2. Meanwhile, the leading meme coin by market cap, Dogecoin ( DOGE ), has plummeted by over 21% in the past week, with its price currently hovering around $0.316. Additionally, Solana ( SOL ) has fallen below the $200 mark, tanking by 16% to a current price of $184. The weekly crypto charts of other leading crypto assets are also awash in red, with the broader market still down 14% from its all-time high of $3.9 trillion, currently standing at $3.41 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Looking at these charts, it seems investors have chosen to take early profits from their investments ahead of Christmas Eve. You might also like: Bitcoin price is still undervalued, MVRV indicator shows Despite a significant sell-off over the past week, the crypto market might not be done surprising investors just yet. Historically, a post-Christmas rally, often dubbed the ‘Santa Claus rally,’ has brought festive cheer to traders. According to a CoinGecko report , this rally, which typically unfolds between Dec. 27 and Jan. 2, has occurred 8 out of 10 times over the past decade, from 2014 to 2023. During these periods, the overall crypto market cap recorded gains ranging from 0.69% to 11.87%—offering a glimmer of hope amid the recent market downturn. However, this time around, the chances of a post-Christmas rally hinge largely on Bitcoin, which is currently dictating the market’s direction. The downturn over the past week was driven primarily by BTC’s drop below the $100,000 mark , and as such, if the flagship crypto manages to reclaim that level this week, it could reignite investor confidence and set the stage for a broader market rebound. As previously reported by crypto.news, Bitcoin remains undervalued according to the MVRV-Z score, which currently sits below historical thresholds associated with overvaluation. This leaves room for recovery in the coming weeks. Market pundits have repeatedly pointed out that corrections are normal during prolonged Bitcoin rallies. Meanwhile, experts from VanEck speculate that Bitcoin will re-enter its price discovery phase following the recent correction and expect BTC to hit as high as $180,000 by Q1 2025. At press time, Bitcoin was down 1.1% in the past 24 hours, exchanging hands at $95,870 per coin.

However, there is no reason to worry. The cryptocurrency market is crowded with low-cost coins that possess significant growth opportunities. In this piece, we explore four affordable cryptos to buy that may enable you to transform a $200 investment into $200,000 down the line. Let’s investigate why these coins are strong candidates for substantial returns. 4 Cryptos to Buy Priced Below $1 That Could Turn $200 into $200,000 Let’s explore four potential cryptocurrencies to invest in-Rexas Finance (RXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Stellar (XLM), and Bonk (BONK)-and their ability to yield massive gains. 1. Rexas Finance (RXS): First, Tokenization of Real-World Assets Rexas Finance actively engages in issuance tokenization and allows individuals to diversify and invest in otherwise inaccessible markets such as luxury real estate, valuable artworks, or precious metals. RXS is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and provides a range of innovative and affordable options for any investor. RXS has a clear tokenomics highlighting a total of 1 billion tokens: 42.5% for presale, 22.5% for staking, 15% for liquidity, with remaining allocated for treasury, marketing, partnerships, and giveaways. Such a balanced structure will stabilize the platform’s development and operation in the long run. The RXS presale has demonstrated impressive strength, raising funds of approximately $31 million and facilitating the exchange of over 352 million tokens. Currently in its tenth stage, each RXS token is priced at $0.15. Looking ahead, Rexas has announced plans to list the token at $0.20 later in 2025. Crypto Pablo , a cryptocurrency analyst, informed his nearly 158,000 YouTube followers that the price of Rexas Finance could surge to $7 following its launch. Furthermore, whales have been observed buying the RWA token, indicating growing interest from substantial investors. This presents it as a potential crypto to buy for new investors. Crypto Whales Purchased RXS Token Rexas Finance has also made community participation an important factor in furthering the project’s reach. For instance, the project has launched a giveaway program with a total pool of $1 million, where users can win as much as $50,000 in RXS tokens. Such strategies can be seen whereby participants can take up social media tasks or invite friends to buy into the presale, giving users a say in project development. Not only does this strategy reward early users, but also strengthens the community around the platform. RXS has already completed the listing on the incredibly coveted CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko websites. At the pace the project is moving, the very real possibility of its massive increase in value over time is very appealing to a class of investors looking for lucrative investments. 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Cryptos to buy With Ambition Not only has Shiba Inu survived the test of time, but has eventually turned out to be a ferocious giant. For a price of $0.00002783 SHIB is one of the most popular cryptos to buy, which are in demand in the markets. Shiba Inu has dominated the market as the second largest meme coin by market capitalization, having incorporated ShibaSwap, a DEX, and seeks a metaverse platform as well. These developments increase the applicability of SHIB and lay a solid foundation for its growth in the years to come. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has a robust community behind it with a clear road map, making it an attractive asset for investors looking for low-priced, high-potential assets. 3. Stellar (XLM): A Global Payment Network At the very core of blockchain technology sits Stellar, a platform that seeks to bridge the gap for international payment. It is able to achieve this through a native currency, XLM, priced at $0.3577, with a market capitalization of $12.94 billion. Aiming at integrating traditional banking methods with blockchain technology, Stellar is bound to be an important player in the transfer of funds globally. Stellar (XML) price chart A major factor in the network’s potential is its relations with big funds and the scaling up of its operations to make it more efficient. As globalization and international trade grow, the need for faster cross-border payment increases, bringing the use of XLM along with it and raising its prices. 4. Bonk (BONK): A Meme Coin with Escalating Functions Bonk has set itself apart as one of the best meme coins to buy with notable community growth and considerable optimistic future outlook. Currently priced at $0.00003105 for each coin with a market cap of $2.79 billion, Bonk attracts attention due to its vibrant community and viral possibilities. BONK price The developers are concentrating on building applications and use cases for the cryptocurrency, which will support its development beyond the meme coin stage. As the market evolves, Bonk presents a high-risk, high-reward investment chance for individuals ready to gamble on its potential success. Final Thoughts Although Bitcoin continues to be the leading player in the cryptocurrency market, it may not be the ideal choice for smaller investors looking for substantial returns. Investors can discover high-potential prospects by examining affordable altcoins such as Rexas Finance (RXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Stellar (XLM), and Bonk (BONK), which may transform a small investment into substantial profits. Every one of these cryptos to buy presents distinct advantages, ranging from the tokenization of real-world assets to creative use cases, placing them in a favorable position for possible expansion as the crypto market transforms. Through thorough research and wise investment, these inexpensive cryptocurrencies could yield significant returns in the future.Cr The post Forget Bitcoin: 4 Cryptos to Buy Under $1 That Could Turn $200 Into $200,000 appeared first on CoinGape .",Price Analysis|BONK|cryptos to buy|Rexas Finance price|Shiba In,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|BONK,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-23 14:04:56

Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, is calling for its end and urging the incoming Donald Trump administration to conclude this legal battle. Alderoty’s Request to End the “Lawless Lawsuit” The Ripple lawsuit, which began over accusations of raising $1.3 billion by selling XRP as unregistered securities, marks its fourth anniversary. Meanwhile, Alderoty took to X to demand an end to what he described as a “lawless lawsuit.” On this 4th anniversary of the SEC’s lawless lawsuit against Ripple, Brad, & Chris, we urge the incoming administration to cleanse the lingering stain of Hinman from the agency. There’s much more to do to repair the damage, but let’s start by restoring trust. — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) December 22, 2024 In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP did not violate securities laws, and other judges in the case criticized the SEC for acting “arbitrarily and capriciously,” further damaging its reputation. Alderoty urged the incoming administration to address the confusion caused by former SEC official William “Bill” Hinman, whose statements on crypto regulations have created conflict in the industry. He even believes that with a crypto-friendly SEC chair like Paul Atkins, there’s a chance to rebuild confidence and bring the clarity the industry desperately needs. Progress in Ripple’s Legal Battles Despite the ongoing challenges, Ripple has made significant strides in its legal battles. The SEC is set to file its opening brief by January 15, just before Gary Gensler steps down as SEC Chair. The agency is appealing a previous ruling that favored Ripple, particularly regarding XRP’s distribution and sales. Separately, a class action lawsuit against Ripple, its subsidiary XRP II, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse is nearing resolution. A district court recently ruled in Ripple’s favor, and both parties have agreed to expedite the final judgment. Impact On XRP Price Overall the lawsuit has impacted the XRP price strongly as it plunged from its ATH of $3.38 to $0.15. Amid so many challenges, XRP price has made an almost 500% jump in the past month and now currently sitting at $2.18 . Meanwhile, some analysts suggest that if XRP stays above the 26 EMA, it could attract more buyers, pushing the price to $2.40. Increased transaction volume may confirm a recovery, with the potential for a rise to $2.60 and $3.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 14:06:38

As the holiday period approaches, BTC struggles are within the mid-$90,000 zone, with a bearish momentum dominating the current price action. The largest crypto by market cap has witnessed what many would call a woeful week after hitting an all-time high on December 17. However, analysts are hoping the festive week will change the coin’s outlook for the end of 2024, even though bears seem to hold crucial positions in the current market trading phase. Bitcoin intraday trading charts: Ascending consolidation and recent pullback In recent weeks, Bitcoin exhibited an ascending consolidation pattern around the $108,000 resistance region. This phase was disrupted by heightened selling pressure and distribution activity from large market participants, leading to a sharp 15% decline. The price found support at approximately $90,000, coinciding with the middle boundary of a long-standing bullish price channel. This zone represents a critical line of defense against deeper corrections. Bitcoin price chart | TradingView Technical analysis highlights that a rebound from the current support levels could pave the way for a renewed attempt to reclaim the $108,000 mark. Conversely, failure to maintain support may result in a more significant correction, with the channel’s lower boundary near $75,000 emerging as the next key support level. As seen on BTC’s daily chart , temporary support has emerged near the lower trendline at $94,164, aligning with key moving averages. Indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce; however, the overall sentiment remains more bearish than not. Bearish indicators weigh on price action Recent data from TradingView reflects Bitcoin’s ongoing struggle, with BTC/USD still down $13,000 from last week’s all-time highs. According to trader and analyst Rekt Capital, BTC has made a Bearish Engulfing candlestick formation on the weekly chart. This development, coupled with the loss of critical weekly support levels, signals the end of a five-week uptrend. #BTC The Weekly support has been lost (blue) The 5-week technical uptrend is over (orange) Bitcoin is showing increasing signs of transitioning into a multi-week correction Any relief rally, if at all needed, into these old supports could turn them into new resistance to… https://t.co/ZpfhWCtdt6 pic.twitter.com/U7d2zGOnpf — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) December 23, 2024 Rekt Capital further warned of Bitcoin’s potential transition into a multi-week correction phase. Any relief rally may face resistance at previously lost support levels, reinforcing the likelihood of additional downside continuation. Indicators such as the RSI (14), currently at 42, show mild recovery but remain in bearish territory. Similarly, the Stochastic RSI’s bullish cross in the oversold region suggests short-term upward momentum, though the MACD’s bearish crossover persists, indicating weakening momentum. Bitcoin price movements: Source – TradingView Holiday trading periods often introduce heightened volatility due to reduced liquidity in the market. As liquidity profiles thin during these out-of-hours trading sessions, price movements can become exaggerated. Market commentator Mark Cullen identified two critical liquidity zones into 2025: $115,000 and sub-$80,000. He questioned which level would be tested first and suggested the potential for significant price swings to target both. A drop to $80,000 would align with historical bull market corrections. Glassnode’s data indicates that prior Bitcoin cycles experienced dips of 20% or more on the path to new all-time highs. Interestingly, the severity of #Bitcoin drawdowns during bull market uptrends has declined as the market grows. The deepest drawdown this cycle was -32% (Aug 5, 2024), with most corrections only -25% below local highs, reflecting spot ETF demand & rising institutional interest. pic.twitter.com/wpanco629S — glassnode (@glassnode) December 21, 2024 Despite the current cycle’s relative stability, the deepest drawdown of -32% in August 2024 echoes the crypto’s inherent volatility. Spot ETF demand and rising institutional interest have also tempered with price fluctuations, as the market seems to be sensitive to macroeconomic shifts. On-chain metrics: Network activity is less than previous highs Bitcoin’s active addresses, a key on-chain metric, reveal a divergence between price action and network activity. While the 100-day moving average of active addresses has rebounded, it has yet to reach its all-time high. This discrepancy suggests that a prolonged correction could occur if network activity declines further. Bitcoin Active Addresses – Source: TradingView Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut of 0.25% dampened risk-asset sentiment. Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, experienced renewed pressure as the prospect of additional rate cuts diminished. According to analysis from The Kobeissi Letter, BTC’s price is exhibiting a notable correlation with the global money supply (Global M2). Historically, Bitcoin prices have followed Global M2 with a lag of approximately 10 weeks. Over the past two months, Global M2 has dropped by $4.1 trillion, from a record $108.5 trillion in October to $104.4 trillion in December, the lowest level since August. This decline signals potential downward pressure on Bitcoin prices if the trend persists. The Kobeissi Letter highlighted the significance of this relationship, saying: “ As global money supply hit a new record of $108.5 trillion in October, Bitcoin prices reached an all-time high of $108,000. Over the last two months, however, money supply has dropped by $4.1 trillion. If the relationship still holds, this suggests that Bitcoin prices could fall as much as $20,000 over the next few weeks .” Despite macroeconomic headwinds, BTC’s growing illiquid supply offers a counterbalance. André Dragosch of Bitwise highlighted this trend, noting that a higher illiquid supply indicates increased scarcity, which could support Bitcoin’s price. While macro factors continue to exert downward pressure, on-chain tailwinds from Bitcoin’s supply deficit may mitigate the impact. Bitcoin vs Illiquidity Supply | BitMart Dragosch expects BTC to remain volatile in early 2025 but believes the scarcity dynamics driven by its illiquid supply could provide attractive buying opportunities for long-term investors.

According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, Hayes sent over $8.47 million worth of Ethena ( ENA ) to Binance, presumably to sell on the open market. “ Arthur Hayes previously accumulated 16.79 million ENA ($11.21 million) at $0.67 between Nov 26th and Nov 28th, making a profit of $7.7 million at the current price.” Source: Lookonchain/X According to blockchain “de-anonymizing” service Arkham, Hayes also sent an additional $2.42 million worth of ENA to another wallet containing over $11 million worth of crypto. Arkham notes that the receiving wallet may be owned by Hayes as well but the firm is not 100% certain. In a recent essay, Hayes said that the crypto markets could be at risk of witnessing a “harrowing” correction following the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. “The people are impatient because they are desperate. Trump is an astute politician and knows his base. To me, that means he must go big early, which is why my money is on a massive dollar vs. gold devaluation early into his first 100 days in office. It is an easy way to make production costs globally competitive in America quickly. It will lead to an immediate re-shoring of productive capacity, leading to an increase in hiring today and not five years from now. Before we get to the crack-up-boom phase in this crypto bull market, I believe the crypto markets will experience a harrowing dump around Trump’s January 20th, 2025 inauguration day. Maelstrom will be lightening up on certain positions in advance, hoping to rebuy some core positions at lower prices sometime in 1H25.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Sonic SVM, the team behind SonicX, the TikTok App Layer and the hit tap-to-earn game , has announced that they will airdrop their $SONIC token to all users onboarded through TikTok. This initiative comes after Sonic has seen success onboarding over 2 million users through the TikTok applayer they have developed, and the latest initiative continues the effort to bring 1 billion TikTok users onto Web3. The TikTok onboarding success is attributed to two major factors: seamless onboarding and distribution. By utilizing account abstraction, TikTok users are not required to create and connect a web3 wallet – rather, they can log in with their TikTok account, and the wallet is automatically created. Transactions conducted within the app are gasless, allowing users to perform blockchain actions without signing transactions – providing a seamless Web2 app experience. Combined with account abstraction, the distribution strategy of Sonic has played a major role in the user conversion as well. Multiple members of Sonic, including CEO and co-founder Chris Zhu, has previous experience working at Bytedance – the parent company of TikTok – and utilizing their in-depth knowledge of the social media platform, as well as existing connections with the TikTok team and distribution partners has allowed them to fully tap into the full distribution potential for SonicX. SonicX deploys premium TikTok ads and partners with TikTok creators to have the platform’s algorithm recommend the campaign to users in target regions. Users can directly access Sonic X or Sonic’s TikTok via ad and video links. Sonic also utilizes the official Sonic SVM account for branded challenges, live streams and interactive games – building their TikTok corporate account as a central hub for gaming and blockchain education, providing users with simplified guides and tutorials. The airdrop snapshot has not been announced yet, and additional TikTok users are still able to visit official Sonic SVM account to access SonicX, qualifying for the upcoming airdrop. This initiative is parallel in comparison to the $TON ecosystem initiated by Telegram, a pioneer of the mini-game movement boasting 950 million monthly active users – with its native token $TON reaching a market cap of over $15 billion. In comparison, TikTok, with 1 billion monthly active users and a projected user base of 2.35 billion by 2029, represents a massive, largely untapped market for Web3 gaming, according to Shopify . Capitalizing on TikTok’s potential, SonicX surpassed 1 million players within a month of its debut, as reported by Decrypt’s GG . Sonic SVM aims to build a TikTok Chain through its App Layer, enabling seamless integration for other projects. Sonic recently announced its first game, Mahjong 123 , set to launch on SonicX.app , kicking off the expansion of its TikTok Chain ecosystem. The current campaign is the latest announcement signaling the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) where eligible users will receive token rewards through the airdrop. About Sonic SVM Sonic is the first SVM chain to launch on Solana, for games and applications. It is powered by Sonic HyperGrid, a framework for orchestrating optimistic Solana rollups. Sonic is the home of SonicX , industry’s first Web3 TikTok App Layer – designed to onboard the next billion users.

38010052,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666467,1734967816,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Expert Reveals Top 15 Crypto Predictions For 2025 You Need To Know,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/top-15-crypto-predictions-for-2025/,"In a thread on X, Hitesh Malviya, co-founder of DYOR—a free on-chain analytics platform—unveiled his set of crypto predictions for the year 2025. Malviya outlines pivotal trends and shifts expected to shape the crypto landscape. Below are the top 15 predictions that stakeholders and enthusiasts should closely monitor. Top 15 Crypto Predictions For 2025 #1 US Regulation Of the Crypto Market In 2025 Malviya anticipates the formalization of the United States’ regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies by 2025. “The US crypto regulation framework has been under discussion for the past two years, but we’re yet to see any approval on it,” he states. He further predicts that during the Trump presidency, favorable regulations will emerge, significantly bolstering sectors with robust cash flows, particularly decentralized finance (DeFi). #2 Sustained Memecoin Popularity Despite anticipated regulatory interventions, Malviya expects the memecoin sector to regain its momentum. “Most of the memes will eventually have a short term hit when the regulation framework is introduced in the USA, as I don’t see them becoming part of it,” he explains. He further forecasts that regulation will “eventually create a clear divide between hyperspeculative trading assets and assets with some sort of fundamental value associated with them.” Nonetheless, like in 2024, the “majority of people will choose memes over fundamentally backed assets, even if they are not recognized by the government,” Malviya predicts, adding, “meme mania will only grow—more participants will join in the hope of changing their lives. The casino will only get bigger with time.” #3 Expansion Of Hyperspeculative Markets Beyond memecoins, Malviya foresees significant growth in hyperspeculative markets, particularly within prediction markets for events, news, affairs and almost everything. “Memes are not the most hyper-speculative market that crypto offers—prediction markets are the bigger fish in the pond. Prediction market platforms like Polymarket will eventually capture the largest audience in 2025,” he notes. #4 DeFi Renaissance A resurgence in DeFi is a cornerstone of Malviya’s predictions. He projects that DeFi will become a focal point for mature investors, with total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols surpassing $250 billion by the end of 2025. “Money markets like AAVE will eventually attract more TVL,” Malviya asserted, highlighting the role of Donald Trump’s crypto project World Liberty Financial as a key growth catalyst. “Some DeFi coins will also hit $30B-$50B market caps next year,” the expert added.

Top Exec Discusses The Market Crash #5 On-Chain Commodities Trading The integration of commodities into blockchain ecosystems is expected to gain traction. Malviya forecasts, “Different types of commodities will eventually be offered for trading on many DEXs in 2025.” Ostium Labs is identified by the expert as an early mover in this domain, with expectations that numerous projects will launch on-chain commodity trading platforms. #6 Stablecoin Market Cap Reaches $500 Billion The stablecoin sector is poised for substantial growth, with Malviya forecasting a market capitalization of $500 billion. “Many new stablecoins will eventually capture some market share from big players like USDC and USDT,” he remarked. The Reserve Protocol, facilitating asset-backed stablecoins, is singled out as a promising initiative within this expansion. #7 Rise of AI Art NFTs Artificial Intelligence-driven art NFTs are projected to garner significant attention. “Some AI artists, like Refik Anadol, can steal the maximum attention from NFT art collectors next year,” Malviya predicts. He anticipates that AI Art NFT collections may achieve floor prices reaching 100 Ethereum (ETH). Related Reading: Bitwise Exec Reveals His Personal Top 3 Crypto Predictions For 2025 #8 Staking-Driven Airdrop Mechanisms Malviya forecasts that Polygon and EigenLayer are going to have a series of major token launches next year. “I am anticipating that Polygon and EigenLayer staking will probably bring a couple of ecosystem airdrops for holders,” he explained. #9 Peak And Decline Of Initial AI Offerings (IAOs) The initial phase of IAOs is expected to reach its zenith, followed by a contraction. “IAOs are currently going through the first phase,” Malviya noted, cautioning that oversaturation will lead to the decline of many AI agents. “Only a few agents with quality data training and a clear purpose will manage to survive the AI agent winter, which is going to happen at some point next year,” the expert cautions. #10 Perpetual Bull Market Perception Malviya suggests that the bull market will persist in perception but will not be as straightforward as in the past where every altcoin surged at the same time. “That’s the saddest part of this prediction list—most people will remain delusional about a bull market, just like they are now. The market’s nature will remain rotational for a few more months,” he stated. He foresees a major correction resembling a bear cycle, yet expects an unexpected recovery influenced by potential black swan events: “I am expecting a major correction, which might resemble a bear cycle in 2025, but it will surprise people with an unexpected recovery, aligned with some potential black swan events.” #11 Focus On Privacy-Based Projects Post-regulatory clarity under Trump, privacy-centric projects are projected to gain prominence. “Confidential transactions and private computation would become a necessity at some point,” Malviya emphasized. Projects like Nillion are expected to attract substantial attention within the DeFi and DeAI sectors, catering to the growing demand for privacy solutions. #12 SUI Surpassing Solana In Daily Transactions The SUI blockchain, leveraging the SocialFi narrative, is anticipated to eclipse Solana in daily transaction volumes. “SUI is currently cooking the SocialFi narrative. Most of the application activities on SUI come from their SocialFi app, which directly deals with the creator economy. I am expecting that some of the apps from SUI will eventually crack the creator economy code and bring the masses onchain, eventually surpassing Solana in daily transaction metrics.” #13 Intense Competition Among Alternative Virtual Machines (AltVMs) The battle among AltVMs is set to intensify, with Malviya identifying contenders like Monad, MegaETH, Berachain, HyperVM, Sonic, and Sei. “One of them will capture 75% of the market share within 12 months after launch,” he predicts, attributing success to community support and developer relationships. Malviya expresses a particular interest in MegaEth Labs as a potential market leader. #14 Mainstream Adoption Of Web3 Wallets Web3 wallets are expected to achieve mainstream status, facilitated by enhanced user onboarding and intuitive interfaces. “Web3 wallets are going to become super easy for onboarding and usage next year,” Malviya states. The emergence of super apps, alongside Web3 wallets from major exchanges like OKX and Binance, is projected to drive widespread adoption through mobile platforms. #15 DEXs Capturing 30% Of Trading Volume Finally, Malviya foresees decentralized exchanges (DEXs) substantially increasing their share of trading volumes. “DEX/CEX trading volume ratio sits at 15% right now. I am expecting it to double in the next 12 months,” he asserts. The shift towards on-chain trading is attributed to the advantages of self-custody and improved onboarding technologies like account abstraction, leading to an anticipated rise in on-chain user activity. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $96,139.

Ethereum ( ETH ) traded at $3,340 on Monday as cryptocurrencies stabilized. This was slightly up from last week’s low of $3,100. Seasonality data suggests that Ethereum price may rebound sharply in the first quarter of 2025. According to CoinGlass , ETH had positive returns in all but two first quarters since 2017. Its best performance was in 2017, when it jumped by 518%, followed by 202,1 when it rose by 160%. Its average first-quarter returns since 2017 were 92%, making it the best period of the year. The second quarter is its best quarter, followed by Q4. The third quarter is usually the worst period for cryptocurrencies, likely because of the summer season.

Its average returns in the first four months of Donald Trump’s administration was about 90%. Similarly, in 2021, its four-month return after Biden became president was $41.

Spot ETH ETFs are seeing strong accumulations by investors, with their cumulative inflows rising to over $2.33 billion. Ethereum’s network has made over $2.44 billion in fees this year, making it the second-most profitable network after Tether. The network remains dominant in the decentralized finance industry, with a total value of $66 billion, higher than most ten chains combined. The other potential catalyst for Ethereum price is that its futures open interest has dropped to $23 billion from the year-to-date high of $28 billion. The last time its open interest was this low was in November, and the coin bounced back to $4,000. ETH futures open interest | Source: CoinGlass Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that Ether has strong technicals as it has remained above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since May 2022. It has also moved slightly above the 50-week moving average and the first support of Andrew’s pitchfork tool. Therefore, Ethereum price will likely bounce back in the next few months. A complete bullish breakout will be confirmed if the coin rises above the triple-top chart pattern at $4,027 . A move above that level will point to more gains to the all-time high of $4,860, its all-time high.

Here’s what an insider says,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-to-expect-from-the-nintendo-switch-2/,"The Nintendo Switch 2 could be far more powerful than most expect. A developer claimed that the console’s hardware is ‘very capable’ and that many will be “pleasantly surprised.” The Switch 2 has long been the talk of the gaming industry. Some alleged designs of the second edition were also leaked . Nintendo confirmed it was in development some time ago. They even suggested that it would be announced by March 2025. However, a developer has revealed more details for fans who are awaiting the big reveal. It is still to be seen whether these claims are true. On the InstallBase forums , a user known as a “trusted developer,” Matt, posted something very important regarding the successor of Nintendo’s console. A user told him Switch 2 wouldn’t be far off from the PlayStation 4 in terms of performance. In reply, he said that Nintendo’s flagship device “is very capable,” and a lot of people are going to be “pleasantly surprised.” Fans had expected the Switch 2 to be introduced with inferior hardware. Therefore, Matt’s claim suggests that it has more. Switch 2’s large potential user base would be very lucrative for third-party developers. Matt added that Nintendo and third-party developers have fully embraced Switch 2 as a real growth opportunity. This means that in launch season, it can have major AAA games. However, Matt says it won’t have many big titles every year. He also said that, given the current market scenarios, more third-party developers would want to make games for the Switch 2. Given its large potential user base, this would be very lucrative for third-party developers. Earlier hardware information was also leaked, claiming that the Switch 2 could have 12GB of RAM. Matt explained that the comparison to the Xbox Series S was “incredibly misplaced.” This is because both these consoles have differences in design and usage, and Switch 2 can be more portable. This makes the comparison of the two consoles unfair and misleading.

Blockchain developers are key to the crypto industry. They build apps and tools that attract users and create value. More users bring more developers, therefore creating a cycle of growth. Yet, despite crypto’s focus on decentralization, the developer market appears to become more centralized, with experienced developers taking the lead, per Electric Capital’s recent research report . Table of Contents Fewer active developers Established developers gain share Where developers live Developers diversify across chains Use cases expand What this means for space Fewer active developers The total number of active blockchain developers has dropped sharply. In November 2022, there were over 31,000 active developers. By November 2024, the number had dropped to 23,160, a 25% decline in two years. Total monthly active developers | Source: Electric Capital Part-time developers were hit the hardest. Their numbers dropped from 16,600 in November 2022 to 12,386 in November 2024. Newcomer developers also saw a sharp decline: in November 2022, there were 18,547 newcomers when two years later, the number dropped by over half to just 8,986. In contrast, established developers (those with two or more years of experience) are growing. During the same period, there were 6,903 established developers, and this number grew to 11,400 in just two years, a 65% increase. Andrew Morfill, CIO of Zodia Custody, an institution-first digital asset custodian backed by Standard Chartered, says the decline in part-time and new blockchain developers “can likely be attributed to factors such as market volatility and/or increasing complexity due to market maturation.” “This complexity requires a deeper understanding of the technology, which can be daunting to newcomers. At the same time, this trend shows a consolidation of developers already in the market committing and staying. It is also being seen in institutional customers, where those already in the market are doubling down, while new entrants are still at the fringes with the tipping point for the next wave of adoption yet to be fully realized.” Andrew Morfill in the conversation with crypto.news Morfill suggested that developer activity typically lags behind broader market price trends, predicting that the current decline “will likely reverse in the first half of 2025.” He also noted that while fewer new developers might “slow the influx of fresh ideas and diverse perspectives,” the continued presence of experienced developers could foster an environment where “newcomers and part-timers have strong mentors and robust frameworks to build upon.” Meanwhile, Francesco Andreolí, head of the developer community at Consensys, attributed the decline in part-time and new developers to the “increasingly technical demands of blockchain projects,” which Andreolí claims “often require specialized knowledge and sustained commitment.” “To counter this, more education, mentorship, and beginner-friendly tools are needed to attract the next wave of web3 talent and make the maturing industry more accessible. Striking a balance between leveraging experienced developers and fostering fresh talent is crucial.” Francesco Andreolí in the conversation with crypto.news Andreolí also highlighted the importance of ecosystem maturity and accessibility in blockchain development, noting that while the tooling for blockchain development is improving, it often “lacks the polish and simplicity of more mature ecosystems,” which makes it challenging for part-time developers to contribute effectively. To address this, Andreolí pointed out that “we are building pre-built environments like CLIs to make onboarding easier for new developers and recreate optimal web2 developer experiences, thereby lowering barriers to entry.” The head of developer community at Consensys also emphasized the need to combat the perception of exclusivity in blockchain development, which he said can “alienate newcomers, particularly those without a deep technical background.” He advocated for fostering inclusivity and creating tools that “democratize access to blockchain development,” stressing that these steps are vital for nurturing innovation and diversity essential to the industry’s long-term growth. Established developers gain share Electric Capital’s “2024 Developer Report,” which analyzed 902 million code commits across 1.7 million repositories, shows the growing influence of experienced developers. Established developers (those in crypto for 2+ years) are at all-time highs, growing 27% YoY and committing 70% of code commits, the report reads. Active developers by tenure | Source: Electric Capital This means that while the overall developer count is falling, experienced developers are taking a bigger share of the work. The report also found that 39,148 new developers explored crypto in 2024, though this growth among newcomers is not enough to offset the loss of part-time developers and those leaving the industry. Andreolí cautioned that the shift could centralize influence among a small group of contributors, creating risks for the ecosystem. “The fragmentation of ecosystems — with developers needing different skills, such as Rust for some chains and Solidity for others — creates additional barriers to collaboration and broader participation.” Francesco Andreolí Andreolí also expressed concerns about the potential “homogenization of innovation,” noting that an over-reliance on experienced developers might lead to “solutions shaped by established paradigms, potentially stifling the creativity that comes from new entrants and diverse backgrounds.” This, he suggested, could stifle the creativity often brought by newcomers and individuals from diverse backgrounds. To mitigate these challenges, Andreolí underscored the importance of fostering cross-chain collaboration through open-source projects, community-driven governance, and tools that promote permissionless innovation, emphasizing that such efforts “activate developers within communities, enabling them to become an integral part of the developer experience.” At the same time, Morfill believes that the growing dominance of experienced developers is a “natural sign of the industry’s maturation,” adding though that “decentralized development is somewhat of a myth, given the small number of people running some of the entities at the core of the web3 and DeFi ecosystem.” “Projects such as Solana provide an excellent gateway for the next wave of adoption for developers — as well as projects and institutions — with ecosystems built around core entities, projects and protocols being key in 2025. This also means that cross-chain capability and interoperability will feature heavily and become paramount for projects and entities wanting to scale.” Andrew Morfill Where developers live Blockchain development is global. Asia now leads in developer share. North America, once the top region, has fallen to third place. The U.S. remains the top country for blockchain developers, with 18.8% of the global share, though it is a big drop from 38% in 2015. Breakdown by type | Source: Electric Capital India is emerging as a leader. In 2024, the country onboarded the most new developers, accounting for 11.7% of the global share. Other countries with significant developer bases include the U.K. (4.3%), China (4%), and Canada (3.8%). Developers diversify across chains Developers are working on more blockchain ecosystems than ever before. In 2015, fewer than 10% of developers worked on multiple chains. However, by 2024, one in three developers now work across multiple chains.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin ( BTC ) development remains stable, with 42% of developers working on scaling solutions. Use cases expand Different blockchains attract developers based on specific use cases: Ethereum: Leads in total developer activity and remains a hub for decentralized finance.

Coinbase’s Base: Responsible for 42% of the “new code being written in the Ethereum ecosystem” and owns 97% of NFT minting volume. Stablecoins and re-staking are also growing sectors. Stablecoins now have over $195 billion in circulating supply and more than $80 billion in daily transaction volume. The re-staking sector, led by projects like EigenLayer, grew its full-time developer count by 130% in 2024, the report shows. You might also like: Crypto’s next big thing isn’t meme coins, it’s stablecoins What this means for space While the shift toward experienced developers shows that the industry is maturing, it also raises concerns about centralization. As newcomers decline and established developers dominate, the industry could become less diverse. This trend also reflects broader market challenges. The 7% decline in total developers in 2024 indicates that some are leaving due to market uncertainty or fewer opportunities, especially following the significant blow dealt by the FTX collapse . The bankruptcy’s ripple effects continue to impact the industry even today.

However, the interview also faced criticism for including comments from John Reed Stark, a vocal critic of crypto, who dismissed it as a scam with no utility. His views align with those of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, and many felt they were presented without proper counterpoints. Garlinghouse later took to social media and pointed out that 60 Minutes failed to mention a federal judge’s ruling that XRP is not a security. He also said that the program overlooked the SEC’s legal setbacks and meetings between Gensler and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. These omissions sparked concerns about potential bias in the reporting. On the Good Morning Crypto Show, Gary Cardone of Cardone Digital Ventures shared his thoughts on Garlinghouse’s appearance on 60 Minutes, saying he’d rather speak his truth than worry about how it’s edited. He pointed out that Ripple paid for the interview, which likely cost millions, and questioned why Garlinghouse would let it be edited in a way that made him look bad. Cardone argued that if Garlinghouse couldn’t control the interview, it raised doubts about his leadership. He also criticized the marketing strategy, saying it failed as an investment. Cardone admitted that he bought XRP, expecting Garlinghouse to perform better. However, he remains uncertain about holding it long-term. He also mentioned that when he asked Ripple-related questions, he never received answers, particularly about why Ripple doesn’t replicate MicroStrategy’s strategy of buying and holding assets like XRP. However, despite these issues, Garlinghouse considered the appearance a success for Ripple, as it showed the company’s legitimate use of XRP for cross-border transactions and brought to attention the growing recognition of blockchain technology.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 15:59:02

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 15:59:06

This support from the 200 EMA could play a crucial role for SOL and determine whether the altcoin will rally or face a price decline in the future. Source: Trading View Currently, SOL appears to be consolidating within a tight range between $175 and $188 over the past two trading days. Based on recent price action, if SOL holds above the 200 EMA, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach the $240 mark in the near future. Conversely, if SOL fails to maintain this support level and closes a daily candle below the $175 mark, it could drop by 30% to reach the $120 level. $105 Million Outflow from Exchanges Amid this challenging phase, long-term holders have shown strong interest in SOL, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from SOL spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges across the cryptocurrency market have witnessed an outflow of a significant $105.5 million worth of SOL in the past three days. This substantial outflow indicates potential upside momentum and suggests an ideal opportunity to add SOL. Current Price Momentum Currently, SOL is trading near $182.3 and has experienced a modest price increase of over 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

Data from NASDAQ revealed that Palantir PLTR and Axon Enterprise AXON joined the Nasdaq 100 alongside MicroStrategy. They replaced Illumina (ILMN), Super Micro (SMCI), and Moderna (MRNA), with the reconstituted index set to begin trading on Dec. 23. NASDAQ 100 Gains Indirect BTC Exposure Notably, MSTR entered at the 52th position, accounting for about 0.42% of the total market capitalization of all companies in the index. Nasdaq noted that ETFs that track the Nasdaq 100 will automatically include MicroStrategy in their holdings. For instance, the Invesco QQQ ETF QQQ, a popular tech-focused fund with $320 billion in assets, will now acquire shares of MicroStrategy, regardless of investor preference. The inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100 not only reflects the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency but also introduces new volatility to the index. Nasdaq noted that his shift could have extensive implications for both public markets and the broader ETF sector. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart had previously predicted that the inclusion could lead to an influx of around $2.1 billion in buying activity from ETFs that track the Nasdaq-100. Remarkably, the company’s stock has surged around 476% this year, with shares gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin’s price movements. MSTR stock reached a record high of around $473 on November 20, when Bitcoin traded above $92,000. MSTR Buys More BTC Besides, recently, MicroStrategy has increased its holdings for the seventh consecutive week. The company bought 5,262 BTC for a total of $561 million in the week ended Dec. 22 to take its total holdings to 444,262 BTC. The latest acquisitions were funded by share sales under the company’s at-the-market program (ATM). MicroStrategy has $7.08 billion left on the ATM program. This news was announced right after MSTR was added to the Nasdaq 100 index. Originally an enterprise software company, MicroStrategy pivoted in 2020 under its founder, Michael Saylor, who has embraced Bitcoin with firm commitment. The company continues to acquire more Bitcoin, betting its entire business on the cryptocurrency’s future. Bitcoin is up about 120% this year due to rising adoption.

By posting seed phrases accompanying very fake pleas for help, they get individuals to engage multi-signature wallets designed to actually steal their funds. Kaspersky’s latest findings have brought this to the fore and called for vigilance. How the Scam Unfolds The scam starts innocently enough, with the scammers playing the rookie. They leave comments under YouTube videos of finance-related content, claiming not to be able to access their wallets and providing a seed phrase for help. For some, the bait is simply too irresistible: a wallet full of Tether-but nobody can access it without more TRON to pay for transaction fees. Unknowing victims start sending TRX to this wallet, only to realize their tokens are instantly forwarded to some other address. The multi-signature wallet is created so slyly that whatever the victim transfers is retained by the scammer. Community Reactions and Expert Warnings These scams haven’t gone unnoticed in the wider crypto community. Notably, CEO Changpeng Zhao of Binance has issued warnings to users against engaging any wallet that requests private keys or seed phrases, as such cases usually end in theft. His statements align with the findings presented by Kaspersky and are a call for crypto users to be security conscious. Key Takeaways from Kaspersky Analysts at Kaspersky’s cybersecurity have underlined this scam as particularly insidious because of the way it uses the technical difficulty of multi-signature wallets to hoodwink the targets. Their recommendations include: Never share the seed phrases: These are your wallet keys, and it should remain confidential. Look out for suspicious comments requesting help involving a seed phrase. Verify wallet authenticity: A wallet is a configuration that is supposed to be understood in advance of use. Global Impact and Sanctions The report comes as Kaspersky itself is under scrutiny on the global stage. This June, the U.S. imposed sanctions on 12 of its top executives at Kaspersky over cybersecurity concerns. Those moves came after accusations that the company had threatened national security, further complicating its efforts to warn people about scams like these. Protect Yourself Against Crypto Fraud This is one clear evidence that crypto scams will stop at nothing, literally growing in their methods of deception day by day. Indeed, the user must be very cautious, more so when some comment in their posts seems too good to be true. Keep wallet security a priority; remember, no valid entity will ask for your seed phrase. Being up to date and taking necessary precautions, crypto holders can avoid such smart, sophisticated schemes.",Blockchain|Regulation|Russia|Scam|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-23 16:01:00

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 16:52:00

This signal suggests that Bitcoin’s bearish momentum could be waning, making this a potentially critical moment to consider entering the market. Bitcoin Price TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal A TD Sequential is a unique technical indicator that identifies trend exhaustion and price reversals and indicates buy or sell signals. According to an X (formerly Twitter) post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart showcases a green “9” candle, signaling a potential buying opportunity. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Above $10: Historical Data Shows How High DOGE Will Go This Bull Cycle Typically, in a downtrend, the green 9 candle is interpreted as a buy signal, indicating that bearish momentum might be reaching exhaustion and prices could be getting ready for a rebound. Martinez also shows an ”A13” marker on the TD Sequential chart, which represents a countdown phase that tracks 13 additional candles and identifies a stronger trend exhaustion. During a downtrend, the appearance of a TD Sequential A13 often signals a potential decline in a cryptocurrency’s sell-off phase, reinforcing the possibility of a price reversal. Bitcoin’s current buy signal emerged as its price exceeded $94,000. This buy signal suggests an optimal time to enter the market, with the $94,915 price point highlighted as a potential entry for traders aiming to capitalize on a possible Bitcoin price rebound. Although the TD Sequential is an indicator used to identify buy and sell signals, market participants can exercise caution by considering additional factors like volatility, broader market sentiment, and more. If the current buy signal holds, Martinez has predicted that a price rebound can be expected. However, a failure to maintain its current price could lead to further downsides, potentially pushing Bitcoin to its next critical support level. BTC Market Top Set At $168,500 In another more recent X post, Martinez presented a chart of Bitcoin’s price movements, predicting a market top above $168,500 based on the Mayer Multiple. The chart shows Bitcoin price performance based on the Mayer Multiple, which compares BTC to the 200-day Moving Average (MA). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Above $100,000 Again? Why $99,800 Is An Important Resistance To Break The red line, as seen on the chart, indicates the Mayer MultipLe (MM) at 2.4, while the green line showcases MM at 0.8. Additionally, the blue line is the Oscillator, which tracks the Mayer Multiple over time. Historically, the Bitcoin price tops have coincided with the Mayer Multiple reaching the 2.4 level or higher. Currently, Bitcoin’s Multiple Mayer sits at 1.3845 in the chart. However, if its price continues to rise and the MM reaches 2.4 again, Martinez predicts a market top above $168,500 for Bitcoin. As of writing, Bitcoin’s price is $94,692, meaning a surge to $168,500 would require a significant 78% increase from its present market value.

Chainlink & XLM Forecasts Look Promising The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with opportunities that could disappear in a moment! Chainlink (LINK) technical analysis indicates strong upward momentum, with LINK now trading around $29, aiming for $32 and $34 soon. Similarly, Stellar’s (XLM) price prediction is very optimistic, forecasting a potential 360% rise, especially after a robust 342% increase in the last three months. At the heart of this buzz is BlockDAG (BDAG), which is reshaping what we think about blockchain’s scalability and innovation. With over $171.5 million raised and 17.4 billion coins sold, the end of BlockDAG’s presale batch 26 is imminent. With a price of $0.0234, BDAG presents a fleeting chance to buy before prices climb in the next batch. Plus, a remarkable 2,240% rise since its first batch positions BDAG as the top crypto pick for 2025. Chainlink Technical Analysis Shows Strong Upward Trend Recent Chainlink technical analysis points to continued strong upward momentum, with the token near $29 and a 104% rise this month alone. Analysts point to a critical resistance at $29.954, which coincides with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. Breaking above this could push prices to between $32 and $34. Institutional interest in LINK is high, with increased whale activity and more engagement from institutions like Grayscale’s Chainlink Trust. This upbeat Chainlink technical analysis is in line with recent enhancements, including Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) integration, which improves security in decentralized gaming. Overall, this Chainlink analysis suggests growing ecosystem development and a positive outlook for future price movements. Stellar Price Forecast: Can XLM Jump 360%? The latest Stellar (XLM) price prediction shows great promise, with a potential leap to $2.27 forecasted. Stellar Lumens has already soared 342% in just the past 90 days, driven by strong technical patterns. Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO notes similarities between XLM’s current market actions and its 2020 performance, which sparked a 3,100% rally. Short-term goals for Stellar include breaking the $1 barrier, with key resistance at $0.6355 being critical. The technical analysis reveals a bullish pennant pattern, suggesting a possible rise to $0.7960 and potentially higher. The Stellar price prediction highlights a chance for significant growth, though traders should remain cautious of potential pullbacks as XLM approaches key resistance levels. BlockDAG’s Final Moments in Batch 26 Predict Rise in Value BlockDAG’s presale is drawing to a close for Batch 26, having raised over $171.5 million and sold 17.4 billion BDAG coins, fueling continued excitement around its prospects. With a current price of $0.0234, BDAG offers traders a rare chance before an expected price rise in Batch 27. Early supporters have experienced a 2,240% ROI, bolstering the view of BlockDAG’s potential as a top contender for the best crypto of 2025. BlockDAG leverages cutting-edge Layer 1 technology, blending WebAssembly (WASM) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, which attracts both developers and large-scale interests. The recent release of Whitepaper V3 outlines ambitious plans to transform decentralized applications, backed by a clear supply limit of 150 billion coins. In tandem with Whitepaper V3, a new Litepaper was issued, enhancing community involvement by detailing the innovative Proof of Work (PoW) and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technologies that underpin BlockDAG’s expandable network. As the presale moves into Batch 27, the price of BDAG is expected to jump from the present $0.0248 per coin, presenting traders with a fleeting opportunity to buy at a lower price before the increase. This transition is also sparking significant interest from large entities, positioning BlockDAG as a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency market. Catch the Prime Crypto Pick for 2025! As Chainlink’s technical analysis shows a promising climb to $34 and Stellar’s price predictions suggest a potential 360% increase to $2.27, the crypto scene is aligning with high-value opportunities. Nevertheless, BlockDAG stands out as the prime pick, with over $171.5 million raised, 17.4 billion coins sold, and a remarkable 2,240% ROI already benefiting early backers. With Batch 26 soon closing and a price increase on the horizon, traders have a limited window to purchase BDAG at the current rate of $0.0234 per coin. As the momentum of BlockDAG’s crypto presale picks up and interest from large-scale entities grows, BDAG is increasingly recognized as the best crypto for 2025!

A breakdown of ownership indicates that Ripple -controlled addresses account for most of the asset, primarily locked in escrow. Major exchanges also rank among the top holders. The top 10 XRP holders collectively own 35.39% of the total supply, amounting to 27.53 billion tokens. Ripple dominates this list, with its seven accounts holding 24.53 billion XRP, including tokens in escrow, representing 31.57% of the total supply, according to data retrieved by Finbold from XRP Scan on December 23. Additionally, Uphold and Bithumb features are available among the top owners. Uphold holds 1.86 billion XRP (1.86%), and Bithumb accounts for 1.39 billion XRP (1.39%). XRP top ten holders. Source: XRP Scan XRP centralization concerns Although Ripple has implemented a clear XRP management plan, the concentration of assets in a few company-affiliated addresses raises concerns about centralization. Critics argue this goes against the principles of blockchain decentralization and trustlessness. For instance, cryptocurrency researcher Justin Bons challenged Ripple’s decentralization claims earlier in December, highlighting possible flaws in XRP’s design. In an X post on December 3, Bons asserted that XRP relies on a centralized Unique Node List (UNL) and uses Proof of Authority (PoA), allowing the XRP Foundation to control validators and enforce compliance. Bons further criticized XRP’s lack of validator incentives, a 99.8% pre-mine, and reliance on founder-held token sales, which he believes compromise fairness and transparency. He recommended Ripple adopt a Proof of Stake (PoS) model to decentralize validator selection and promote transparency. You are completely focused on a detail that absolutely does not matter in any realistic way. Validators are not compensated. They cannot censor unless node operators configure their code to allow them to. They do resolve the double spend problem, but honest users don't double… — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 3, 2024 Financial educator and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocate Rajat Soni echoed similar concerns, labeling XRP a ‘scam’ capable of enabling price manipulation. Despite these criticisms, it is worth noting that Ripple does not control the XRP Ledger. Changes to the ledger require validator consensus rather than unilateral decisions. Furthermore, the total XRP supply has remained capped at 100 billion since its pre-mining phase. XRP price analysis As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.14, down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours and over 14% on the weekly chart. The bearish sentiment has hindered XRP’s trajectory toward the $3 resistance level. XRP seven-day price chart.

Regarding the next price movement, crypto analyst Dark Defender noted in a December 22 post that XRP is consolidating within a descending triangle and testing a key support line around $1.80.

However, the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) remains below the golden cross threshold, indicating weak bullish momentum. A breakout above resistance could trigger a rally, while a breakdown below support may lead to further declines.

Ted supports crypto-friendly laws, runs mining rigs in West Texas, and opposes strict federal rules. With Texas already growing in crypto, Cruz believes it can lead the digital revolution. Senator Ted Cruz is one of the most passionate senators about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. He wants Texas to be the center of crypto innovation, as he always expressed his vision wherever possible. Cruz views Bitcoin as more than just a currency or an asset he sees it as a symbol of freedom, decentralization, and independence, which Texas has always embraced. Ted Cruz’s vision for Texas as a crypto leader “We are also going to unleash crypto I’m proud to stand with crypto I’m proud to stand with Bitcoin and I am the only member of the United States Senate who is in fact a Bitcoin minor,” Cruz statements at America Fest 2024 by Turning Point USA in Phoenix, Arizona. Cruz’s stands for cryptocurrency just goes beyond words. He has made it clear through his actions, that he is fully invested in the success of Bitcoin, and awaiting the Bitcoin Reserve setup. He operates three Bitcoin mining facilities in West Texas, demonstrating his strong commitment to Bitcoin and his vision of transforming Texas into a crypto hub. “I am a strong advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the U.S. Senate,” Cruz declared, emphasizing his goal to transform Texas into the global leader for Bitcoin. For Cruz, Texas is the perfect place for Bitcoin to flourish. “ Texas has the resources and mindset to be the center of this technology,” Cruz said, that the state is well suited for the digital asset revolution. The Senator also criticized Elizabeth Warren for limiting Bitcoin’s growth, and he is comparing her stance to China’s attempts to ban the cryptocurrency.

This marks an announcement made at a price below the dollar-cost average, signaling a buy at Bitcoin’s local top. Nevertheless, the company is still profitable with its Bitcoin portfolio, and MSTR’s stock steadily sustains a premium against its holdings. According to Michael Saylor ’s announcement , MicroStrategy has acquired 444,262 BTC at an average cost of $62,257. This most recent purchase was of 5,262 BTC for $561 million and MicroStrategy’s lowest disclosed buy since July 2024. On that note, the economist and known Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has commented on X, highlighting a “firepower” loss. Schiff has been commenting against Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy for a while, as Finbold reported in one occasion. “It seems like you are running out of firepower to keep propping up Bitcoin. Plus, not only is this your smallest buy, but the first time your average purchase price has been above the market price on the Monday you disclosed the buy.” – Peter Schiff MicroStrategy’s lowest Bitcoin buy at the top Interestingly, this recent purchase is approximately three times lower than the previous purchase at $100,000, announced on December 16. Moreover, it is nearly four times lower than the one before that, announced on December 9, as Lookonchain analyzed . The purchases were of 5,262, 15,350, and 21,550 BTC, respectively. In November, MicroStrategy made two buys superior to 50,000 BTC , or nearly ten times higher than last week’s acquisition. MicroStrategy Bitcoin acquisitions. Source: Lookonchain Novacula Occami, former Wall Street analyst, also commented on Michael Saylor’s strategy, explaining it relies on two pillars. First, Saylor buys when “numbers go up,” the analyst said, and then on “exciting the less sophisticated herd,” he concluded. Essentially, Occami believes the purchases are always made when Bitcoin shows strong momentum, usually amid a rally. This is supposedly done to attract retail traders with positive sentiment regarding BTC and MSTR. MSTR stock and Bitcoin (BTC) price analysis Indeed, MSTR stock is trading at $344.27, with a market capitalization that is two times higher than its Bitcoin holdings, making it a 100% premium against usual BTC investments for investors who want Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy. Meanwhile, BTC is trading at $93,113, at a 12% discount from Saylor’s most recent average Bitcoin acquisition price. Bitcoin (BTC) price vs. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) stock price.

This validates the two analysts’ criticisms regarding Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy, which now experiences one of the longest recent drawbacks. However, it is notable that the company’s high time frame results are still massively positive, accumulating an unrealized profit of nearly $15 billion. Featured image from Shutterstock.

A major Trump ally, Elon Musk, for one, will be “shocked” if US President Joe Biden does not grant an early pardon to the disgraced former CEO of FTX. Crypto, Politics, and Pardons Bankman-Fried, who was convicted in November 2023 on seven charges, including fraud and embezzlement, is currently serving a 25-year sentence for his role in the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange. However, rumors of a pardon have gained traction, partly due to his significant political connections. As one of the largest donors to the Democratic Party, Bankman-Fried’s ties to key political figures, particularly Biden, have led many to wonder whether his political influence could play a role in securing a pardon. Speculation surrounding the possibility of clemency gained additional attention following comments from Musk, who tweeted that he would be “shocked if this doesn’t happen.” This statement aligns with shifting predictions on platforms like Polymarket, where odds for a potential pardon surged from 4% to 13%, indicating a growing belief that SBF’s ties to political elites might influence his fate. SBF’s trajectory from crypto wunderkind to convicted fraudster has been one of the most dramatic downfalls in recent financial history. At his peak, he was hailed as a leading figure in the industry, having founded FTX in 2019 and quickly built it into one of the world’s largest exchanges. He cultivated a public persona as a tech innovator with a commitment to social causes that earned him widespread recognition beyond the crypto circles. His political contributions were massive, with over $5 million donated to Biden’s 2020 campaign and nearly all his donations directed toward Democrats. However, the collapse of FTX in late 2022 exposed a $8 billion hole in customer funds that sent shockwaves through the financial world. While the legal case against him resulted in a conviction, some continue to speculate that a presidential pardon could allow the Biden administration to move on from the scandal. Ross Ulbricht’s Fate Still Unclear Meanwhile, the odds of Biden pardoning Ross Ulbricht, creator of the Silk Road marketplace, currently stands at 9%. However, Ulbricht could see freedom under Donald Trump’s presidency after the president-elect pledged to pardon him earlier this year. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 on multiple charges, including drug trafficking and money laundering, and sentenced to life in prison. While libertarian and crypto advocates see him as a symbol of free trade and argue his punishment is unjust, critics highlight Silk Road’s links to drug overdoses and allegations that Ulbricht plotted murders to protect his platform.

The founder of the network Justin Sun shared the news of the milestone in a recent X post. AI Agents on Tron and What to Expect This Tron Network-bacled AI agent was launched on Sun Pump, the premier memecoin fair launch of the protocol. It is worth noting that Sun Pump made this move in collaboration with leading cryptocurrency exchange Bitget. To a large extent, the partnership marks a big step in the expansion of TRON’s growing memecoin ecosystem. First AI Agent on #TRON https://t.co/2i4hoZB0QJ — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) December 23, 2024 Amongst many things, it unlocks several opportunities for top projects with a community focus. With the AI agents, users are able to quickly generate token information through simple conversations with an AI bot. In the long run, it may improve the creation efficiency and user experience, while still enhancing the creative freedom of users. Notably, the AI agent may also help in adjusting token parameters in real-time. This will be conducted based on the needs of the users, thereby providing more creative space. Users are guaranteed of consistency of token information and can now avoid the risks of manual errors. Two months ago, Coinbase announced AI agents that users can create in under three minutes on its Ethereum L2 network Base. In the case of Sun Pump, the launchpad assured users it will help avoid difficulty in creating tokens. It also intends to differentiate tokens created using AI Assistant, using a unique identifier it will feature on the details page for easy recognition. Will this drive TRX price recovery? Having the Sun Pump AI agents on the Tron Network may to draw users to the protocol. The move may also fortify TRON’s position as the preferred protocol for Decentralized applications (DApps), USDT settlement, and memecoin innovation. As such, it could accelerate the expansion of TRON-based projects. This will likely have an impact on the price of TRX , the native token of the Tron Network. Following the announcement of the AI agent on Tron, TRX price rallied by 2.59% increase in the past 24 hours. At the time of this writing, it traded at $0.248 from a low of $0.2415. Besides this new development, TRX is considered one of the digital currencies that could see massive price gains next year.

In 2025, it will range between $66.22 and $84.78, with an average price of $69.49. In 2030, it will range between $416.79 and $530.07, with an average price of $512.69. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked this year. It later reversed, shedding all profits made earlier in the year. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, AVAX has particularly left investors questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2024 to 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Ticker AVAX Current price $37.29 Market cap $15.28B Trading volume $637.11M Circulating supply 409.83M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $37.87 24-hour low $35.60 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 10.11% 50-day SMA $40.19 200-day SMA $29.79 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) Avalanche price analysis As of December 23, AVAX’s price had dropped by 2.95% in 24 hours and 12.91% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 19.73% in 24 hours. Avalanche’s total value locked (TVL) is gradually rising and now stands at $1.31 billion. TVL is the amount of funds locked up by an ecosystem’s decentralized applications. The protocol’s stablecoin market cap rose to $2.35 billion at press time over the same period. The statistics point to growing user interest in the protocol’s stablecoin market, which provides stability in a highly volatile market. Open interest and active positions in the derivative market also rose alongside the price. When both rise, they signal that traders with long positions are entering the market.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish and currently gearing up for a closer move to $36. Moreover, the William Alligator trendlines, which measure volatility, are feeding, indicating rising volatility. Is AVAX a good investment? AVAX’s impressive performance in the first quarter of 2024 reversed in the second quarter; and bullish in the last. Explore Cryptopolitan’s price prediction to learn about the coin’s trajectory from 2024 to 2030. Why is AVAX up? AVAX is recovering from its lowest this year; the crypto market capitalization is also rising. The rise in Avax value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2024 as Bitcoin broke above $100,000. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2026, with a maximum price of $121.27 for the year. Will AVAX reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2030. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

Image source: Coinstats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, whistleblower ‘crypto leaks’ published a report accusing Ava labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and $27 in September and October. It turned bullish in November rising from as low as $23 to the current level at $52 this December.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-23 17:27:01

Based on its methodology, ImmuneFi gives a conservative estimate of $1.49B in crypto losses for the year to date. ImmuneFi measures a total of $1.49B in crypto losses from major attacks and exploits. The metric coincides with the Cyvers estimate of around $1.4B , of which North Korean hackers may have taken in up to $1.34B . December was the slowest month in terms of exploits, with $3.9M to date. Q4 had the slowest losses for the year. | Source: ImmuneFi Orbit Bridge with more than $81.8M in losses was the biggest single attack this year. While smaller than previous bridge exploits, it shows that bridges are still potentially unsafe and are often the target of attacks. The numbers may be encouraging, as hacks slowed down in the second half of the year. However, attacks are becoming more sophisticated, even for relatively small sums. ImmuneFi believes the threat remains, both from North Korean hackers and other exploiters. For the past year, the losses from DMM Bitcoin and WazirX were among the largest, reaching 540M or up to 38% of all losses. Most of the big exploits happened in Q2, during the first rally of the bull market. During that quarter, $572M was lost across 72 incidents. The last three months of 2024, despite the bull market, only led to $150M in nominal losses. Centralized exchanges faced 11 major incidents, making up more than 48% of all hacks this year. The trend is shifting back to CEX, aiming to exploit any remaining weaknesses. Centralized exchanges suffered more than 726M in attacks for 2024, compared to only 408.9M in 2023. The interest in centralized markets coincides with a new inflow of users and higher liquidity during the 2024 bull market. With the rise of Web3, hacks and exploits switched to DeFi and DEX, making up 51.4% of losses. The year is heading to its close with a total of 232 incidents against entities and protocols, not counting individual wallet exploits. In 2023, a total of 320 incidents wrapped up the whole year, despite the bear market. Hackers targeted top chains with potential vulnerabilities Ethereum remained the biggest arena for hacks and exploits, due to the numerous projects and smart contracts. The easy availability of swapping, mixers, or DeFi protocols to hide the origins of funds was also a key point for hackers to pick the chain. Some of the exploits also affected BNB Chain, which carried 39% of the attacks. BNB Chain projects are relatively older and more liquid, hence the attempt to drain liquidity or perform other exploits. Arbitrum was the third-largest chain, with the remaining 6.8% of the exploits. As projects increased their security and found more sophisticated methods, the nature of attacks changed. Projects were exploited through the loss or exposure of private keys, some acquired through malicious links or social engineering. Radiant Capital lost $50M, becoming the biggest exploit in Q4, which hinged on stolen private keys. Some of the projects targeted the protocol’s reserves, while others were user-facing, with faked sites or features capable of draining wallets. Hacks still exceed fraud losses Hacks are still the more harmful attack, despite the ubiquitous frauds and scams in Web3 space. According to ImmuneFi, 98.1% of attacks were some form of hack, while scams only accounted for a smaller share of losses. Despite this, scams and frauds managed to take away more than $28M based on distinct incidents. This does not include sandwich attacks, MEV bot exploits, flash loan exploits, or token rug pulls. Despite the growth of DeFi in 2024, frauds are down by 99.8% for Q4, compared to the same quarter of 2023. With more sophisticated users and smart wallets, fraud is slowing down. For Q4, hacks were 68% down compared to Q4, 2023. The year saw hacks winding down, with most of the losses caused by a few incidents. Most trackers also take into account the immediate loss of funds, though, for projects, a hack often leads to loss of market value and reputational damage.

Lightchain AI- aiming for $10 and 30,000x growth potential Comparative analysis: Dogecoin vs. Lightchain AI in 2024 Why Lightchain AI might outshine Dogecoin in long-term gains Here’s the chance Dogecoin targets $2, but Lightchain AI eyes $10 with 30,000x return potential Dogecoin (DOGE) is making waves as it sets its sights on the $2 mark, fueled by a loyal community and increasing adoption. However, the spotlight may soon shift to Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a unique blockchain project integrating artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. With its captivating roadmap and real-world applications, LCAI has the potential to reach $10, delivering a staggering 30,000x return for early investors. As excitement builds around these two projects, Lightchain AI is emerging as a game-changer in the crypto space, promising unparalleled growth and unique features. Dogecoin’s path to $2- meme coin mania or real value? Dogecoin, first made as a fun thing in 2013, has changed into an important part of the cryptocurrency scene. Its path to the $2 point is pushed by mix of group excitement, famous people saying good things, and guess trading. Elon Musk’s help has clearly shaped its worth; his tweets many times make prices go up Helpers such as Kaleo guess that Dogecoin might hit $2 by the start of 2025, pointing to past trends and the ongoing memecoin boom. But, problems still exist. Dogecoin’s big amount in use and its link to social media fads add to its ups and downs. Doubters say that with no ͏real value or special tech perks, its lasting strength is still unclear. To sum up, although Dogecoin’s way to $2 is likely, it is greatly shaped by market feeling and guesswork. Investors must be careful, knowing the risks linked with these kinds of assets. You might also like: DOGE & SHIB holders embrace Lightchain AI for its growth and unique sports-crypto vision Lightchain AI- aiming for $10 and 30,000x growth potential Lightchain AI is an emerging cryptocurrency that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its native token, LCAI, is currently in presale at $0.003 per token. Analysts project that LCAI could reach $10 by 2025, representing a 333x return on investment. Key innovations driving this potential include the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for AI computations, and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), optimized for AI workloads. These technologies position Lightchain AI to capture significant market share as the AI and blockchain sectors expand. However, investors should conduct thorough research and consider market volatility before investing. Comparative analysis: Dogecoin vs. Lightchain AI in 2024 As we approach 2025, both Dogecoin and Lightchain AI have the potential to reach significant milestones. However, a comparative analysis suggests that Lightchain AI holds more promise for long-term growth and value. While Dogecoin’s community and media attention contribute to its current momentum, it is subject to market fluctuations and lacks technological differentiators. In contrast, Lightchain AI’s innovative roadmap and partnerships with notable players like Microsoft Azure position it as a leader in the emerging AI blockchain space. Furthermore, with LCAI currently available at $0.003 per token (during presale), early investors could see a 30,000x return if LCAI reaches its projected value of $10. In contrast, Dogecoin’s potential at $2 represents a 666x return. Its scalability and potential for real-world adoption also make Lightchain AI a more attractive investment opportunity. While both projects offer exciting prospects, Lightchain AI appears to have more robust foundations for sustainable growth and value in the long run. Why Lightchain AI might outshine Dogecoin in long-term gains Lightchain AI presents several advantages that could lead to superior long-term gains compared to Dogecoin. Data Privacy Innovations Lightchain AI employs advanced encryption techniques to facilitate secure data sharing, ensuring compliance with global privacy regulations. This focus on data privacy makes it a compelling choice for enterprises requiring stringent data protection measures. Cross-Chain Interoperability Unlike platforms such as Solana , which have experienced congestion issues, Lightchain AI supports seamless interactions across multiple blockchains. This interoperability offers developers unparalleled flexibility, enabling the creation of versatile decentralized applications (dApps) that can operate across various blockchain ecosystems. Deflationary Tokenomics Lightchain AI incorporates a burn mechanism that reduces the token supply over time, promoting scarcity and potential value appreciation for LCAI holders. This deflationary model contrasts with Dogecoin’s inflationary supply, positioning LCAI as a more attractive option for long-term investors seeking value growth. Lightchain AI’s emphasis on data privacy, cross-chain interoperability, and deflationary tokenomics provides a robust foundation for sustained growth, potentially outpacing Dogecoin in delivering long-term returns. Here’s the chance Cryptocurrency, in its relatively nascent stage, presents investors with an opportunity for exponential growth. As we have seen with Dogecoin and Lightchain AI, even small investments can lead to significant returns if the project delivers on its promises. While the crypto space can be volatile, with careful research and a long-term perspective, investors can identify projects like Lightchain AI that offer an attractive balance of unique features and potential value growth. Invest today in Lightchain AI presale and get a chance to be part of the exciting journey towards $10 and beyond. Join us for more information on how to become a part of this amazing project.

This holiday gesture, which rewards early supporters of the Moca Network, has fueled investor optimism. This has led to a surge in the token’s value, pushing it to new heights and drawing renewed attention to Animoca’s decentralized Web3 ecosystem. Animoca Brands and And Growing MOCA Value Yat Siu’s MOCA tokens distribution is in two stages. The first stage focuses on rewarding early post-engagers from July’s initial announcement. The second stage invites the broader Moca community to contribute creative engagement ideas. Sui’s announcement pushed the MOCA’s price by 15%. This marked a significant uptick as the token continued its impressive monthly growth. This came on the heels of a massive 350% rise in the token’s value last week. Following its listings on major exchanges like Binance, Upbit, and Bithumb. Currently trading at $0.288, MOCA boasts a market cap of $459 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $620 million. This surge in price signals strong investor confidence and a growing belief in the token’s role in the evolving Web3 space. In July, the Web3 platform aimed for 2,000 retweets on his X post, but the goal was unmet. Sui emphasized that the giveaway is not just a festive gesture. It is a move to solidify the project’s community-driven spirit further. Mocaverse and Web3 Synergy: Bridging Digital Realms The excitement around the giveaway highlights the Moca Network’s potential and its flagship product, Mocaverse. This product enables users to manage and control their identities, monetize data, and interact across Web2 and Web3 environments. This initiative aims to reshape how digital identities are handled in Web3. The recent announcement also comes alongside the rollout of Moca 3.0, the network’s latest upgrade. Moca 3.0 improves the functionality of the entire network, making it more seamless and user-centric. Mocaverse remains the platform where users engage with these features. What’s Next for MOCA and the Moca Network? December 27 will see the unlocking of 692K MOCA tokens. While this represents a relatively small percentage of the total supply, token unlocks tend to catch the market’s attention and could influence short-term sentiment. As the network continues to build its decentralized infrastructure , MOCA is emerging as a key driver of the ecosystem’s success. Remarkably, its potential to bridge Web2 and Web3 is becoming increasingly clear.

The analyst has remarked that the current reversal not only concerns just Bitcoin, but gold and other risk assets as well. However, due to its elevated volatility, Bitcoin has been hit the hardest. Mc Glone noted that the current major Bitcoin drawdown, aside from the volatility was “Just a bit of normal reversion.” Bitcoin is currently trading at $93,260, down over 2% in the past day. In the last week, it shed approximately 14% as it collapsed from the $108,300 level. Market Crash Ahead? The Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki in a latest X post has hinted that the global crash of economies and financial markets has started. He shared that another depression might be on the horizon and advised his followers to be ‘smarter with their money’ and hold on to their jobs and sources of income. He remarked that regardless of which way the economy goes, ‘gold, silver, and Bitcoin hold their value.’ He also shared that for most people, crashes are the best times to get rich. “I plan on getting richer. I want you to get richer and smarter too,” he shared. BTC Crash Concerns Besides, A recent report from The Kobeissi Letter hints at a potential BTC crash by $20,000 in the coming few weeks. The report noted Bitcoin’s relation with the global monetary supply, saying that if the crypto continues to move in tandem, it could see a massive dip ahead. Notably, this prediction comes amid heightened market volatility, with BTC recently dropping below the psychological $100K mark. Is Bitcoin overdue for a correction? In the past, #Bitcoin prices have followed global money supply with ~10 week lag.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 17:51:00

This represents an increase from the 366,000 daily active addresses recorded in 2023. The growing activity showcases Litecoin’s resilience and continued relevance in the cryptocurrency space. Litecoin Daily Activity Grows 10% in 2024 as Active Addresses Reach 401,000 According to recent IntoTheBlock data , Litecoin recorded a 10% year-over-year increase in daily active addresses in 2024. This reflects sustained user engagement and adoption of the network for transactions and other blockchain activities. The report also highlighted that the coin achieved a new peak in activity earlier this year. On a single day in January 2024, 1.37 million active addresses were recorded, surpassing daily activity levels observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum for the same period. The surge in network activity in early January marked an important milestone. The record 1.37 million active addresses on that day highlighted the token increasing adoption. This surge reflected its use for peer-to-peer transactions and various other utilities across the network. This spike coincided with increased market volatility, suggesting that traders and investors may have turned to Litecoin as a reliable medium of transfer. More so, the network’s lower transaction fees and faster settlement times compared to competitors contributed to this surge. Miners’ Stabilized Selling and Its Influence on LTC Price The rise in Litecoin network activity was complemented by miners’ decision to stabilize their reserve holdings in late December. This followed a period of significant sell-offs during a market downturn, which saw miners offload 210,000 LTC in just five days. As miners halted their sales, price rebounded from a monthly low of $87 to retake the $100 resistance level. Reduced selling pressure, coupled with a steady increase in active addresses, created a favorable environment for a potential bullish trend. Additionally, Grayscale Investments has been actively accumulating Litecoin during the recent market downturn. Most recently, the company purchased 2,230 LTC on Thursday, bringing its total 30-day accumulation to over 41,100 coins. This positions Grayscale as one of the largest institutional holders of the token, with assets valued at over $220 million. At press time, Litecoin is trading at $102.27, reflecting a 41.29% gain over the past year. Its market cap stands at $7.7 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $746.82 million. According to recent LTC price predictions , the token is showing strong bullish momentum, signaling a potential breakout soon. Analysts point to key technical indicators that suggest further upward movement. If the bullish trend persists, Litecoin price could reach a target range of $140 to $150, with the possibility of surging to $200 in an extended rally.

The firm’s analysis is based on two key on-chain metrics that point to increased activity among this group of investors, which Alphractal analysts argue points to a potentially major sell-off. Reserve Risk Indicators VOCDD & MVOCDD: These metrics analyze the rate of coin destruction and compare the current price of Bitcoin with the average purchase cost of LTH, giving an idea about the sustainability of the market. Reserve Risk: This indicator offers clues about market sentiment by assessing whether Bitcoin is overbought or oversold. MVOCDD Signal: A tool used to identify market tops and indicate when Bitcoin may be nearing its peak. Fixed Terminal Destroyed Coin Days (CDD Terminal Fixed) This refined metric adjusts traditional Coin Days Destroyed calculations to account for Bitcoin’s circulating supply, highlighting significant movements or periods of inactivity to provide a clearer perspective on LTH’s activity. Related News: Watch Out: 25 Altcoins to Experience Massive Token Unlocking in Calm Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Historically, LTH has benefited from Bitcoin price rallies by selling, especially when average purchase costs are significantly lower than current market prices, according to the analyst firm. This profit-taking behavior often creates local resistance levels that can suppress Bitcoin’s upward momentum for weeks or even months. According to the analytics firm, even if BTC continues to rise in the near future, data suggests that LTH no longer has much interest in holding its assets, which could shape market dynamics in 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Toncoin (TON): Cryptocurrency of the decentralized open network Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized, open-source layer-1 blockchain supported by the TON Foundation and community contributors. Initially developed by Telegram as Telegram Open Network with the ‘Gram’ token, the project was discontinued in May 2020 following an SEC court order. Renamed and continued by the community, Toncoin operates on a proof-of-stake consensus model, enhancing scalability and reliability. It aims to provide fast, secure payment services with minimal fees and develop an ecosystem including decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Toncoin shows potential for growth, suggesting attractiveness in the current market cycle. Aptos: A scalable blockchain focusing on safety and flexibility Aptos (APT) is a new blockchain designed to address high transaction fees and network congestion found in systems like Ethereum before its Proof-of-Stake transition. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by key contributors from Meta’s Diem project, it employs a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Aptos uses the Move programming language for smart contracts, highlighting safety, scalability, and flexibility. It supports a wide range of web3 applications. With its strong development team and focus on solving existing blockchain issues, Aptos has significant potential. In the current market cycle, its innovative approach to scalability and security may make it an attractive option for users and developers. UNI Token: Governance power in Uniswap’s decentralized exchange Uniswap’s UNI token, launched in September 2020, is a governance token that enables holders to vote on developments within the Uniswap platform, such as fee structures and token distribution. The token was introduced to foster user loyalty in response to competition from platforms like SushiSwap, with 150 million UNI tokens distributed to past users, each receiving 400 tokens. Uniswap is a leading decentralized exchange on Ethereum , providing an automated liquidity protocol that allows trading without an order book and full user control over funds. As one of the largest DeFi platforms with significant assets, UNI’s integration in a growing decentralized ecosystem suggests potential attractiveness in the current market cycle. Jupiter: Leading DeFi platform on Solana with expanding features Jupiter (JUP) is a prominent platform in Decentralised Finance on the Solana blockchain. It is the most popular DEX aggregator globally, pooling resources to enable efficient token swaps, futures trading, and decentralised stablecoin management. Originally focused on liquidity aggregation for token swaps, Jupiter has expanded to include perpetual futures similar to GMX. It is also launching its own decentralised stablecoin to reduce custodial and regulatory risks. Jupiter’s growth and innovations suggest strong potential in the DeFi space. In the current market cycle, its expanding services and position on Solana may make it an attractive option for users interested in decentralised finance. Conclusion While coins like TON, APT, UNI, and JUP may have limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out by appealing to those who seek luxury and success. Expected to grow significantly by the end of its presale, DOGEN follows the path of successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, aiming to build a community of leaders and offer real benefits to early supporters.

38013929,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632415,1734976383,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38013929.jpeg,AI hype drives Apple toward $4 trillion market cap,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-drives-apple-toward-4-trillion-market-cap/,"Apple is on fire. The company is closing in on a historic $4 trillion valuation, riding a wave of investor excitement over its long-overdue artificial intelligence (AI) upgrades. A 16% stock surge since early November has added $500 billion to its market cap, putting Apple leagues ahead of competitors Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to hit this insane milestone. At $3.85 trillion, Apple’s worth is so massive it overshadows the combined value of Germany and Switzerland’s entire stock markets. This rally is powered by what analysts are calling an “iPhone supercycle,” driven by AI integrations that promise to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales. Investors are betting big that these upgrades will spark a new wave of consumer demand. “Artificial intelligence is the magic word here,” said Tom Forte of Maxim Group. But Apple’s slow approach to AI has left many wondering if the company is playing catch-up. Apple’s AI strategy finally takes shape For years, Apple has been accused of sleeping on AI while its rivals ran ahead. Nvidia, for instance, has seen its stock explode by over 800% in just two years, while Apple’s shares merely doubled. But the tide may be turning. In December, Apple finally rolled out OpenAI’s ChatGPT integration into its devices, following its June announcement to infuse generative AI across its ecosystem. This comes after a lot of pressure to prove that Apple is more than just iPhones and AirPods. The company’s AI push is seen as critical to its future, and the timing couldn’t be better. Analysts believe these upgrades could start a massive handset replacement cycle, with Morgan Stanley pointing to 2026 as the year AI could drive double-digit services growth and expand gross margins. The analysts call Apple their “top pick” for 2025, citing improving iPhone demand as AI features and availability grow. And with services revenue growing faster than products, Apple’s gross margins are expected to expand by 50 basis points annually over the next three years. Stock momentum, trade risks, and Trump’s tariffs Apple’s meteoric rise has pushed its price-to-earnings ratio to a three-year high of 33.5. That’s higher than Nvidia’s 31.7 and Microsoft’s 31.3. But this valuation isn’t sitting well with everyone. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which holds Apple as its largest investment, has sold shares this year, citing concerns over stretched valuations. Adding to the drama, there’s a wildcard in the form of Donald Trump. The President-elect has promised to slap a 10% tariff on goods from China. Given Apple’s reliance on Chinese manufacturing, this could be a problem. Analysts, though, think Apple might dodge the worst of it. “We believe exclusions are likely for products like iPhones and Macs, just like in 2018,” said Morgan Stanley. Still, Apple’s shares took a hit last Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced a slower pace of rate cuts for next year. Tech stocks wobbled, but analysts believe easing monetary policy in the long run will keep the market propped up. Morgan Stanley has set a $273 per share price target, implying another 10% upside from current levels. The bank predicts Apple could drive over $8.50 in earnings per share by fiscal year 2026. And investors seem willing to bet on Apple’s ability to deliver. The company has advanced 29% in 2024, outpacing the S&P 500’s 27% gain. And despite concerns over high valuations, 35 out of 49 analysts covering Apple rate it a buy or strong buy.

The U.S. Court of Appeals has set deadlines for the case. Ripple must submit a mediation questionnaire by December 23, 2024, and an opening brief by March 6, 2025. Ripple must respond to the brief by April 7, 2025. However, a potential U.S. government shutdown could cause delays in the case. Ripple is still hopeful the case might be dropped, but some critics, like former SEC official John Reed Stark, believe the Ripple ruling creates confusion. He thinks it doesn’t protect retail investors enough and could affect how cryptocurrency companies argue their tokens aren’t securities. However, XRP enthusiasts are confused and eager about how long the case might continue. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel wrote on social media, “The appeal will continue for now, and that process takes about a year. But there is the possibility that a new administration decides to move to dismiss the appeal. That’s not something I recall happening before, but it’s possible and maybe likely.” Stark also warns of a major clash between Trump’s administration and Gary Gensler’s SEC picks. Stark describes Gensler’s recent promotions as part of a “deep state crusade” to secure influence before leaving office. Stark predicts that Atkins’ team will move quickly to dismantle crypto investigations. SEC Prepares For A Shutdown? On December 13, 2024, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance to help companies prepare for a possible shutdown.A government shutdown could make the legal case more complicated, causing delays in decisions and adding pressure on everyone involved.

In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enterprise software company MicroStrategy says the number of its board members has increased to nine. “On December 20, 2024, the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) of MicroStrategy Incorporated (the ‘Company’), upon recommendation from the Nominating Committee of the Board, expanded the size of the Board from six to nine members.” The firm says the board elected Meridian Capital Group CEO and former Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks, Brown University chief investment officer Jane Dietze and Fanatics Holdings chief legal officer Gregg Winiarski as new members. Brooks, Dietze and Winiarksi will be eligible to receive equity awards under the MicroStrategy Incorporated 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. They are also entitled to compensation and other personal benefits for non-employee directors. MicroStrategy expanded the size of its board as it continues to stockpile Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the company bought an additional 15,350 BTC. The acquisition brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC valued at around $41 billion based on the flagship cryptocurrency’s current price of $94,451.

To read full editions, subscribe . “You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” — Harvey Dent For Hyperliquid, it took all of 25 days since its highly acclaimed airdrop to run into a bout of controversy. It started when Taylor Monahan ( @tayvano ), a security researcher at MetaMask, sounded the alarm on a series of Hyperliquid transactions made from North Korea-tagged wallets. Based on Monahan’s data, the wallets have accrued a $701k loss from ETH perps positions. It’s a meager amount for a state-sponsored hacker group. But what got people in an uproar was the revelation that North Korea hackers were actively familiarizing themselves with the Hyperliquid platform, presumably to launch an impending hack. Hyperliquid chain’s highly centralized validator set of four made it extra vulnerable to a potential hack, Monahan claims. There are no more than 4 validators and all run the same code, possibly collocated as well. Centralized infra, build systems, etc. maintained and accessed by unknown number of founders, c-levels, and engjneers who use the same devices to access said systems as they do to talk to… — Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) December 23, 2024 Hyperliquid’s liquidity is locked in a lock-and-mint style bridge from Arbitrum, where Hyperliquid used to exist as a perps DEX application. When Hyperliquid migrated to its own Tendermint -consensus PoS L1 chain in March 2024, the team retained the lock-and-mint style bridge from Arbitrum, which remains the only way to onboard onto Hyperliquid today. Based on Dune, the deposit bridge has seen a record high net outflow of $114.7m in USDC liquidity in the past day, though that is still a fraction of the remaining $2.22b in TVL. Source: Dune Talks of a Hyperliquid hack are merely speculative at this time, but if one happened, here’s a rough sketch of how it would play out. Everyone wanted Hyperliquid to respond to the allegations of an impending hack, so here it is. TDLR: there is no exploit, all funds are safu. If a vulnerability is found, the team is always willing to listen as they have a bug bounty program. pic.twitter.com/VHYeUogvxs — steven.hl (@stevenyuntcap) December 23, 2024 To successfully attack Hyperliquid’s bridge contract would require three out of its four validators to be compromised, as per a two-thirds quorum. Should that happen, the natively minted USDC on Arbitrum could theoretically be frozen by Circle before the hackers were able to swap the stolen funds into an uncensorable asset like ETH. That, however, requires Circle to act on issued court orders, a tedious and slow legal process that may offer the time sophisticated hackers need to execute an exit. The hacker may instead choose to try and swap to USDC.e (Ethereum-native USDC tokens that were bridged to Arbitrum) onto the Ethereum L1. “The only plausible path that would enable the Arbitrum security council as a line of defense would be if the hackers attempted to withdraw the funds through the canonical bridge, likely after swapping to ETH,” Matt Fiebach at Entropy Advisors told Blockworks. “In this scenario, the elected Arbitrum Security would need to make the decision of whether effectively blocking this transfer was within their scope of ‘addressing critical risks associated with the Arbitrum protocol and its ecosystem’.” Finally, it’s also worth noting that a hacker would have trouble finding the necessary liquidity venues to swap out of the stolen funds. $2 billion of liquidity would have to be spread across a variety of third-party bridges, which would cause massive slippages.

Crypto Giants Swap Meme Coins for Web3Bay & Ethena,https://nulltx.com/are-utility-tokens-the-new-kings-crypto-giants-swap-meme-coins-for-web3bay-ethena/,"The Rise of Utility Coins: Ethena & Web3Bay Take the Lead as Crypto Whales Divest from GOAT With a staggering 85% of major retailers now accepting cryptocurrencies, there’s a seismic shift happening. Trump’s recent victory is poised to accelerate crypto adoption further, with savvy investors moving their focus to utility tokens, sidelining meme coins like GOAT. Web3Bay is at the forefront, revolutionizing decentralized e-commerce by empowering users with control over their data and transactions through cutting-edge blockchain technology. Its 3BAY token isn’t just for purchases—it also grants governance rights, giving the community significant sway over the platform’s direction. By supporting both cryptocurrency and mainstream options like PayPal, Web3Bay is bridging the old and new financial worlds, attracting a wide user base. Starting with a presale price of just $0.003 per token, Web3Bay teases a thrilling 6000% ROI as it progresses through 28 pricing stages. Volatility Strikes Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) The AI-enhanced meme coin, Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), is riding a rollercoaster of market fluctuations. After hitting a high of $0.88 post-Binance listing, it has tumbled roughly 32% from that peak. A 48% drop in trading volume in just two days hints at upcoming price adjustments—a common trend in the volatile crypto market. Current technical metrics show the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing 70, exiting the overbought zone, signaling possible sell-offs and a forthcoming price dip. Despite these tremors, GOAT holds a market cap near $448 million with almost 1 billion coins circulating. Ethena’s (ENA) Robust Market Performance Ethena is making waves with a 6.19% rise in the last 24 hours and a whopping 44.18% increase over the week, pushing its price to $0.916. This growth spurt has boosted its market cap to an impressive $1.47 billion, with 2.8 billion ENA tokens in circulation. This bullish run is partly fueled by the announcement of a new stablecoin project, UStb (USTB), a collaboration between Ethena Labs, BlackRock, and Securitize, aiming to launch a stablecoin backed by a tokenized BlackRock fund. This adds substantial credibility and allure, enticing more investors. Technical patterns suggest ENA might be on the cusp of breaking out from a bearish downtrend. Why Web3Bay is Set to Revolutionize E-commerce with Over 6000% ROI Potential Web3Bay is on track to revolutionize the online shopping world, potentially outpacing giants like Amazon as it harnesses the explosive growth of cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike the usual e-commerce platforms, Web3Bay operates on a completely decentralized blockchain platform, ensuring that every user has total control over their data, privacy, and money. This revolutionary model is transforming online shopping for those who value tight security and clear transparency in their buying experiences. At the heart of Web3Bay is the dynamic 3BAY token, which does a lot more than just handle payments. It unlocks access to exclusive discounts, enticing rewards, and crucial governance rights, putting the community in charge of the platform’s future. Web3Bay also cleverly merges traditional payment methods like PayPal with cryptocurrency, catering to a broad spectrum of shoppers. Web3Bay’s presale is now live, offering the 3BAY token for just $0.003, with an expected price surge of 15% at each of the 28 stages. Projected to soar to $0.1959 by the final stage, early investors could see a staggering ROI of over 6000%. As cryptocurrencies become mainstream, Web3Bay is setting itself up as the definitive future of shopping, combining an unbeatable mix of incentives, security features, and user-driven innovation. Wrapping Up As the tide turns towards tokens with genuine utility, Web3Bay is capturing the spotlight with its revolutionary approach to e-commerce. While GOAT wrestles with market instability and Ethena secures powerful partnerships, Web3Bay stands out for its commitment to user empowerment, security, and seamless integration of crypto and traditional payment systems. Built on a foundation of decentralization, Web3Bay offers governance rights, exclusive perks, and a transparent, privacy-focused shopping experience. Its presale, aimed at cultivating a dedicated base of early supporters, promises a potential 6000% ROI, setting the stage for a transformative impact on digital commerce.

The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $0.2032. Breaking through this could see it rise to the second resistance at $0.2693, representing potential gains over 60% from current levels. The RSI and Stochastic indicators are neutral, suggesting room for upward movement. With the altcoin season on the horizon, BRETT could capitalize on the bullish momentum. The MACD is close to flipping positive, and the price nearing the 10-day and 100-day moving averages indicates a possible trend reversal. Keep an eye on BRETT as it could be ready to surge. FLOKI eyes key resistance levels as altcoin season nears FLOKI is trading between $0.0001277 and $0.0002243, showing potential for an upward move. The RSI is around 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. If the price breaks above the resistance at $0.0002813, it could rally toward $0.0003779, offering significant gains. The recent declines over the past week and month might lead to a strong bounce back. With the altcoin season approaching, FLOKI could see increased interest. The MACD hints at a possible trend reversal, and moving above the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages may confirm a bullish breakout. Conclusion While BRETT and FLOKI may offer potential gains, Catzilla stands apart as a disruptive force in the meme coin arena. With its ambitious presale targeting a 700% ROI, a triple-utility ecosystem, and a mission to change the crypto space, Catzilla is more than just a token — it’s a movement.

With this Solana ETF approval looking imminent, there are tokens that are ready to enjoy a 5x price increase once this happens. 5 Tokens That Could 20x After A Solana ETF Bloomberg analysts recently suggested that a Solana ETF could launch at some point next year, although the exact timing remains uncertain due to some complex legal issues. Ahead of this potential launch, these are 5 tokens that could witness a significant price increase after the SEC approves a Solana ETF. Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter (JUP) is one of the tokens that is ready for a 20x price increase after a Solana ETF approval. The JUP price is in a good position to benefit from such bullish development, considering its status as one of the top Solana coins . As such, the DeFi token will likely witness a parabolic surge on the back of an ETF approval. Crypto analyst Altcoin Scholar predicted that JUP could rally to $10 or higher in this bull run. NebulaStride Token (NST) NebulaStride Token (NST) is in a good position to witness a significant price increase after a Solana ETF approval. This ETF approval provides a bullish outlook for the crypto and NST, as a newer token, could enjoy one of the most gains. As a newer token, NST could even record more than a 20x price increase since it has more room to run to the upside than these older coins. the token’s fundamentals also provides a bullish outlook for its as NebulaStride is revolutionizing the finance space. Render (RENDER) Render (RENDER) is another top Solana coin that is ready for a 20x price increase after a SOL ETF approval. The token already boasts a bullish outlook based on its ties to the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative. Meanwhile, from a technical analysis perspective, crypto analysts have suggested that RENDER is well primed for a parabolic surge. In an X post , crypto analyst Exotrader predicted that the AI coin couuld rally to as high as $24 as long as it holds the $6.9 support level on the weekly close. Bonk (BONK) Bonk (BONK) has become more than just a meme coin in the Solana ecosystem. The top meme coin has gained several use cases and even boasts an exchange-traded product (ETP). Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning the upcoming BONK token burn with 1 trillions coins set to be burnt. With this 1 trillion token burn on the horizon, the meme coin eyes a $0.11 price target. XRP XRP looks like an obvious play if the SEC were to approve a Solana ETF, especially if this approval comes before the one for an XRP ETF. In a scanario where a SOL ETF gets approved an XRP ETF, XRP will likely witness a 20x price increase as traders anticipate the XRP ETF next. Moreover, crypto analysts have already provided a bullish outlook for the XRP price. One of these analysts is Dark Defender who predicted that XRP could rally to as high as $18 in this market cycle. Conclusion A Solana ETF approval is undoubtedly bullish for JUP, NST, RENDER, BONK, and XRP. These coins, most especially NST, are ready to enjoy a 20x price increase once these SEC approves the SOL ETF.

Per a message published on the project’s Discord server, “no vulnerabilities have been shared by any party,” and white hats are welcome to submit bug reports as part of a “generous bug bounty program.

Industry officials say they want him to use executive orders to make cryptocurrencies more mainstream. According to Reuters , Trump plans to sign many executive orders and directives on his first day in office, covering topics like immigration and energy. During his campaign, Trump attracted crypto supporters by promising to be a “crypto president.” The industry expects him to fulfill that promise with executive orders to build a bitcoin reserve, provide crypto businesses access to banking, and establish a crypto council. Two sources report that they have been calling for these executive orders within Trump’s first 100 days and are hopeful that at least one will be signed on 2oth January 2025. Rebecca Rettig, Polygon Labs’ chief legal and policy officer, said executive orders must clearly outline the main priorities from day one and offer a roadmap. Concerned about crime and instability, Biden’s regulators have tightened rules on crypto companies. Trump has promised to change this. His crypto policy team is forming, including the crypto-friendly SEC chair Paul Atkins and White House crypto czar David Sacks , announced this month. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, said Washington’s bureaucracy has tried to hinder innovation, “but President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto.” Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, reached new highs of over $107,000 this month after Trump repeated his plan from a July speech to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. It has since dropped below $100,000. Experts disagree on whether Trump can use executive powers, possibly through the Treasury Department, to create the reserve or if Congress needs to pass a law. Treasury Secretary to spend $21 billion in a year to build a national bitcoin reserve The Bitcoin Policy Institute, an industry group, has drafted a possible executive order that Trump could use to set up the Bitcoin Reserve. According to the draft seen by Reuters, it would label bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset and direct the Treasury Secretary to spend $21 billion in a year to build a national bitcoin reserve. Zack Shapiro, head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, said the US should lead its geopolitical rivals in using Bitcoin instead of letting the price rise without the US having reserves. He did not say if the group shared the draft with Trump’s team. In July, Trump said he would not allow banks to “choke” crypto firms out of the traditional financial system. Some executives think he will address this with an executive order. Crypto companies have often complained that banks avoid working with them because of regulations. Even though regulators say, banks can lend to crypto firms that comply with the law. Federal bank regulators are independent from Trump’s executive orders Some executives warned that even if Trump signs an executive order telling bank regulators to be lenient on crypto, it would mostly signal intentions and offer political support. It probably wouldn’t have legal power because federal bank regulators are independent. According to Jonah Krane, a partner at Klaros Group, they won’t change policies immediately, but they will indicate the administration’s desired direction.” Trump also plans to form a crypto industry council, and his team is figuring out its structure and staffing. Executives said that past administrations have created special councils through executive orders. Trump might address crypto’s concerns that current regulations don’t suit the industry by issuing an executive order outlining key principles for crypto regulation. This would be like an order he signed in 2017 that asked regulators to reassess banking rules. Krane added, “I wouldn’t be surprised if you get something like an executive order early on that directs the agencies to re-examine their rules in this space” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",Regulation|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MATIC|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-23 19:00:23

The report said this triggered a net inflow of $308 million last week for global digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs). This positive development happened despite witnessing intra-week outflows and increased market volatility. ETPs Outflows and Volatility Challenges Based on individual asset performance, Bitcoin (BTC) registered $375 million in net inflows, while Ethereum (ETH) added $51 million for the week. However, Solana differed in performance, recording $8.7 million in outflows. The net inflows suggest that institutional players remain confident and interested in digital assets. According to James Butterfill, Coinshares Head of Research, this is significant as the ETPs overcame macroeconomic conditions. Butterfill emphasized that multi-asset investment products recorded significant outflows despite these positive highlights. The cumulative outflows by these products amounted to $121 million. According to Butterfill, varied inflows came in for XRP at $8.8 million, Polkadot at $1.9 million, and Horizen at $4.8 million. This suggests that investors in these altcoins have adopted a strategic selective approach to their portfolio. The Federal Reserve’s Role in Market Dynamics Meanwhile, last week, the largest single day of outflows were registered. Notably, on December 19, a total of $576 million was recorded, and the outflow of December 20 pushed the cumulative total to $1 billion. Butterfill highlights this development as significant and a pointer to the volatility experienced last week. However, the Federal Reserve’s news briefing after its meeting on December 18 played a huge role in influencing market dynamics. Besides the rate cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks of a hawkish economic outlook triggered risk sentiments across the financial space. Hence, many, including MARA , a Bitcoin mining company, looked to digital assets as a way out. Investors’ Approach to the Crypto Investment Product Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has revised its 2025 core personal consumption expenditure inflation projection figures from 2.2% to 2.5%. Stakeholders had anticipated a four-rate cut, but only two were implemented for 2025. In November, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut significantly impacted digital assets. Analysts note that the market is in a state where derivatives traders are protecting their positions and betting on price drops for assets. Additionally, the market appears poised for downside volatility. All these could influence asset prices in the coming days.

At the tail end of the weekend, well-known blockchain security expert Taylor Monahan who works for crypto wallet MetaMask reported that several addresses linked to the DPRK were trading on Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetuals exchange with its own chain. Monahan said the North Koreans were likely testing out the network before considering it as a target for their next attack. In its Discord channel, Hyperliquid disagreed with Monahan’s analysis and said that there was no threat from the DPRK. “We are aware of reports circulating regarding activity by supposed DPRK addresses. There has been no DPRK exploit – or any exploit for that matter – of Hyperliquid. All user funds are accounted for. Hyperliquid Labs takes opsec seriously. No vulnerabilities have been shared by any party.” However, HYPE , Hyperliquid’s native token, dropped nearly 20% while the exchange suffered nearly $113 million in stablecoin outflows, according to blockchain analytics platform Dune. HYPE has since stabilized and is currently trading at $26.75 with a market cap of $9.1 billion, and it’s correction is more or less in line with the rest of the crypto markets. Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said it was dismantling North Korea’s digital asset money laundering network by sanctioning Chinese nationals Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian who used a front company in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to launder illicit money and convert crypto funds for the DPRK. Says Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith, “As the DPRK continues to use complex criminal schemes to fund its WMD and ballistic missile programs—including through the exploitation of digital assets—Treasury remains focused on disrupting the networks that facilitate this flow of funds to the regime.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Qubetics Could Be Your Next Big Break in Crypto,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-out-on-aaves-early-success-qubetics-could-be-your-next-big-break-in-crypto/,"The crypto market is buzzing with both seasoned investors and curious newcomers looking for the next big opportunity. Decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms like Aave (AAVE) have transformed the landscape, offering ways to lend and borrow digital assets with ease. Aave’s early investors saw their portfolios soar as the token rose to prominence, cementing its place as a DeFi leader. But if you didn’t get in early, it can feel like you missed the boat. Now, there’s a new contender shaking up the crypto world: Qubetics ($TICS). Positioned as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics aims to solve the issues traditional blockchain platforms have struggled with—complexity, inefficiency, and lack of accessibility. By blending innovation with practical solutions, Qubetics is gearing up to be a game-changer. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Crypto for Everyone If Aave showed the potential of DeFi, Qubetics takes it a step further by focusing on accessibility and integration. Its standout feature? The Multi-Chain Wallet. This isn’t just another crypto wallet; it’s a powerhouse that simplifies how users manage digital assets and perform transactions across multiple blockchains. Imagine a business owner who wants to accept payments in crypto but is deterred by the volatility and complexity of managing multiple wallets. With Qubetics, they can accept payments in any cryptocurrency, which is automatically converted to fiat at the point of sale. This eliminates the risk of market fluctuations and ensures a seamless experience for both the business and its customers. For individuals, the wallet’s integration with platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay makes crypto transactions as simple as swiping a card. Whether you’re booking a flight, paying for dinner, or shopping online, Qubetics allows you to use your digital assets without breaking a sweat. Travellers, gig workers, and even small businesses can benefit from the wallet’s features, which make managing and spending crypto easier than ever before. Currently in its 14th stage, the Qubetics presale is creating a buzz. Over 372 million tokens have been sold to more than 11,500 holders, raising $7.5 million so far. Tokens are priced at $0.0377, but that won’t last long. A 10% price increase is expected in the 15th stage, which kicks off this weekend. If you’re looking for the best crypto presale to buy this week, $TICS is an opportunity you can’t afford to ignore. With its innovative technology and real-world applications, Qubetics is setting itself up to be a key player in the blockchain space. Aave (AAVE): A DeFi Pioneer Aave has been a trailblazer in the world of decentralised finance. As one of the first platforms to offer DeFi lending and borrowing, Aave redefined what was possible in crypto. By using smart contracts, Aave enables users to lend assets and earn interest or borrow against their holdings—all without the need for a central authority. Aave has continued to evolve, recently launching its decentralised stablecoin, GHO. This move aims to diversify its offerings and solidify its position as a leader in DeFi. Analysts predict that Aave will maintain steady growth as DeFi adoption increases globally. Its price performance has been impressive, with projections pointing to a potential 20% increase in Q1 2025 as the platform expands its ecosystem. However, Aave’s high price point might be a barrier for new investors. For those looking to replicate the gains early Aave investors enjoyed, exploring newer opportunities like Qubetics could be a smarter move. Conclusion If you missed Aave’s early days, don’t sweat it. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and Qubetics presents a unique opportunity to invest in something groundbreaking from the start. Its Multi-Chain Wallet and Web3 aggregator model promise to revolutionise how people interact with digital assets. Paired with Aave’s continued growth as a DeFi leader, these two projects highlight the endless possibilities in the crypto space. But if you’re looking for the best crypto presale to buy this week, Qubetics might just be the second chance you’ve been waiting for. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS) and Aave (AAVE) as the top crypto investments to consider this week .

The collaboration between the two countries involves initiatives to track stolen digital assets and curb malicious activities that have resulted in over a billion dollars worth of cryptocurrency lost to the gang. This comes as the value of stolen cryptocurrencies rose by 21% to $2.2 billion this year while the number of recorded hacks reached an all-time high of 303. Leading institutions in South Korea back the efforts to tackle crimes The collaboration is aimed at developing tools that counter crypto-related crimes, especially those linked to the North Korean hackers. According to reports , the North Korean hackers have stolen up to $1.6 billion worth of digital assets this year alone. One of the most daring crypto thefts attributed to the North Korean gang involved 4,500 bitcoins worth $305 million from a Japanese crypto exchange DMM in May. In August, Microsoft’s cybersecurity researchers learned of the hackers’ misdemeanors, their report revealed, adding that they took advantage of a previously unknown bug in Chrome to target organizations and steal their cryptocurrency. The report further states that the gang was affiliated with Citrine Sleet, which is known for targeting the crypto industry and financial service providers in general. Now, the initiatives between the UU and South Korea also signal the intensifying crackdown on illicit crypto activities that are becoming a threat to economic stability and national security. South Korea’s science ministry has thrown its weight behind the program through to 2026. This collaboration also involves other organizations such as Korea University, US-based RAND Corporation, and other government bodies as they seek to tackle the escalating threat. According to Invezz , the two countries have signed an agreement to come up with strategies to prevent and track thefts linked to North Korea. This collaboration, though the finer details of the agreement remained sketchy, it represents a major step towards the fight against the growing influence of North Korea-linked crypto hackers. However, the experts who are coming together in this collaboration will focus on tracking stolen funds and identifying the laundering methods, as well as preventing more attacks. The initiatives will dismantle enablers for the hackers They will also make use of advanced technologies in their efforts to identify how illicit funds are converted into digital assets using methods like ransomware and distributed across global networks. Blockchain analysis firm, Chainalysis has also emphasized the need to have such measures to tackle this threat, in which the North Korean hackers account for a significant share of the stolen crypto worldwide. The collaboration is therefore intended to dismantle the infrastructure enabling such cybercrimes, addressing the technical complexities of tracking digital transactions across decentralized networks. Putting together resources by the two countries, they aim to come up with a blue print that can be adopted by other countries who are facing similar threats. The initiative will continue through 2026, while it is expected to pave way for more international partnerships to the challenges posed by the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to Invezz, the combined efforts by the two countries might weaken the networks that enable the North Korea-linked crypto crimes. However, this calls for sustained innovations to stay ahead of the cybercriminals due to the decentralized and anonymous nature of most blockchain platforms. Meanwhile, the US is trying to curb the North Korean crypto criminal activities by using regulatory measures. Recently, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on two individuals and a United Arab Emirates-based company for their alleged roles in laundering funds obtained through North Korean cybercrimes. The two individuals used the company to convert stolen crypto assets and send the money through to North Korea. By targeting enablers in dominions with weak regulatory frameworks, the US aims to disturb the flow of illicit funds supporting North Korea’s broader activities such as the development of nuclear weapons. According to TechCrunch , due to tight international sanctions, the regime in North Korea has turned to stealing crypto to fund its nuclear weapons. A UN panel of experts monitoring the implementation of international sanctions has also revealed that North Korea uses funds raised through cyber crimes to support its illicit ballistic missile and nuclear programs.

IRS Rules Crypto Staking Triggers Tax Liability Immediately This ruling comes amidst an ongoing lawsuit from Joshua and Jessica Jarrett, a Tennessee couple staking on the Tezos network, who filed a lawsuit against the government regarding the tax clarification for crypto staking and how the IRS views it. Notably, in a Dec. 20 court filing, the IRS rejected the Jarretts’ claim that staking generates “new property” that should only be taxed when sold. The government noted that “staking a cryptocurrency should induce a tax liability as soon as it is done.” It denied the idea that staking tokens fall under the same category as crops, books, or manufactured goods. Significant Implications On Taxation Of PoS Rewards The legal battle was filed in October of this year and could have massive consequences. The case is being closely watched by the crypto industry, as it could have significant implications for how staking rewards across all proof-of-stake blockchains are taxed in the United States. The Jarretts’ legal battle with the IRS began back in 2021 when they sued for a refund of $3,293 in taxes paid on 8,876 Tezos tokens earned through staking in 2019, before the tokens were sold or exchanged. They argued that the tokens were “new property” that were created through their staking efforts and should only be taxed when sold, similar to a farmer’s crop or an author’s manuscript. In 2022, the IRS tried to dismiss the case by offering the Jarretts a $4,000 tax refund for income taxes paid on their Tezos rewards. However, the Jarretts refused the refund and chose to continue the lawsuit to set a legal precedent for all staking participants across proof-of-stake networks. “A year and a half into this process, the government didn’t want to defend the position that the tokens I created through staking were taxable income. I need a better answer. So I refused the government’s offer to pay me a refund,” Jarrett stated. According to IRS guidelines released in 2023, block rewards from staking or mining are considered taxable income as soon as they are created, with tax liabilities determined by their market value at the time of creation.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 19:35:36

In a new blog post, Uniswap Labs says that, after the successful public testnet phase of the Unichain launch, the launch of a public mainnet is the next step. The firm says Unichain will begin its transition to mainnet on January 6, 2025. “The next major milestone focuses on decentralization, which is core to Unichain. Mainnet will go live with Permissionless Fault Proofs on day one, allowing anyone to verify the chain’s activity. This process will begin on January 6, 2025, when Unichain Sepolia will undergo planned maintenance to enable Permissionless Fault Proofs. Once the new system’s safety and stability are validated, mainnet will be open for everyone! Users will be able to bridge funds directly to the network, and applications supporting Unichain will go live. Rollup-Boost will go live on mainnet shortly after launch, leveraging Flashbots’ TEE-based block builder to enable revert protection and verifiable priority ordering for transactions.” Source: Unichain.org According to Uniswap Labs, the launch of an “experimental testnet” will follow the conclusion of the public mainnet phase. “The first feature on public experimental testnet will be Flashblocks, which will bring effective block times down to 250 milliseconds, making transactions feel instant. The Unichain Validation Network will also launch on experimental testnet, and the community will be invited to run test validation nodes.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

By 2027, the price is projected to reach $35.7 By 2030, FIL may reach $58.8. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity’s most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services that require secure, decentralized data storage solutions, which significantly advance decentralized internet infrastructure.

Tether has agreed to acquire 103,333,333 Rumble Class A shares at $7.50. Meanwhile, Rumble chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski will retain his controlling stake in the company. Says Pavlovski, “I truly believe Tether is the perfect partner that can put a rocket pack on the back of Rumble as we prepare for our next phase of growth.” On top of Rumble’s prioritization of free speech and decentralization, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says that the company also intends to look into a crypto payment solution for the YouTube rival. “Tether’s investment in Rumble reflects our shared values of decentralization, independence, transparency, and the fundamental right to free expression. In today’s world, legacy media has increasingly eroded trust, creating an opportunity for platforms like Rumble to offer a credible, uncensored alternative. This collaboration aligns with our long-standing commitment to empowering technologies that promote freedom and challenge centralized systems, as demonstrated through our recent collaborations and initiatives.

The report, published today, predicts that investment advisors will control more than 50% of the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETF markets, signaling a shift in the makeup of ETF holders. Since the launch of 11 spot BTC ETFs in the U.S. on Jan. 11, investors have put more than $36 billion into these funds, providing an easy way for individuals to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to hold or store the asset directly. Hedge fund managers lead the way with 45.3% of the ETFs, while investment advisors who manage capital for individuals and high-net-worth individuals own 28%. CF Benchmarks, a UK-regulated index provider behind several major digital asset benchmarks, predicts that investment advisors will lead the $88 trillion US wealth management industry in embracing Bitcoin and ETH ETFs in 2025. This trend is expected to be driven by increased demand from clients, a better understanding of digital assets, and the maturation of crypto products. The firm also predicts that combined net flows into BTC and ETH ETFs will exceed $40 billion, a year-on-year record. Related News: Silent Bull in Ethereum? Analytics Firm Reveals Bullish Signs “Investment advisor allocations will rise above 50% for both assets, reshaping the ownership mix of these ETFs,” CF Benchmarks said in its annual report. “As these products become staples in model portfolios, they will likely reshape the market for digital assets.” In addition to Bitcoin, investment advisors are already the dominant force in the ETH ETF market and are expected to further strengthen their position in 2025. The growth in asset tokenization is expected to continue, with tokenized real-world assets (RWA) expected to exceed $30 billion, further supporting the demand for digital asset investment vehicles. CF Benchmarks also notes that new stablecoins like Ripple’s RLUSD and Paxos’ USDG are expected to challenge the dominance of Tether’s USDT, whose market share has increased from 50% to 70%. Going forward, the report predicts that the scalability of the blockchain will be tested and that active user adoption will require increasing on-chain capacity beyond 1,600 transactions per second (TPS) due to regulatory clarity under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. *This is not investment advice.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 19:52:31

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin stalls at resistance; Ethereum bulls rush to $0.02 AI coin WallitIQ, eyeing 45,000% gains in 2 weeks. Table of Contents Dogecoin price faces familiar barrier, but WallitIQ promises 45,000% gains in 2 weeks WallitIQ’s AI features making headlines in the crypto market Conclusion The Dogecoin price is once again at a significant turning point, unable to overcome its persistent multi-year resistance. Meanwhile, Ethereum bulls are swiftly flocking to a promising AI altcoin priced at $0.0243, which has shown a mind-blowing potential for 45,000% gains over just 14 days. The implications are clear: while the Dogecoin price fights the last, this unique token is carving a path to the future. Perceptive investors should follow the Ethereum bulls’ path in buying the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale AI coin before it’s too late. You might also like: Bank of America manager says ADA not done, WallitIQ set for 77,000% breakout Dogecoin price faces familiar barrier, but WallitIQ promises 45,000% gains in 2 weeks Despite multiple attempts, the Dogecoin price still struggles to break through its long-standing resistance at $0.42. According to Binance, the Dogecoin price has spiked by 2% in the past 24 hours, following a 4% increase in Bitcoin (BTC) . Ethereum bulls, however, remain skeptical, believing that the Dogecoin price persistence to break its long-standing resistance is akin to climbing a greased pole. As the Dogecoin price continues its uphill battle, many Ethereum bulls are losing confidence and are instead looking toward a new AI coin: WallitIQ. Unlike the Dogecoin price, which primarily relies largely on Elon Musk and the influence of social media, WallitIQ is backed by solid utility and intrinsic value. With the WallitIQ token, investors can access premium features within the WallitIQ ecosystem. Additionally, this AI coin covers transaction and gas fees, easing the investment process. Knowing that WallitIQ has already seen a 42% price increase from its last presale to the current one, Ethereum bulls are eager to capitalize on the anticipated 71% rally as this presale stage nears its end. With only 20% of tokens remaining from this phase, thousands of investors are rushing to secure their shares of WallitIQ. With no price ceiling, WallitIQ offers a unique opportunity to turn modest investments of just $0.0243 into large fortunes for investors who act promptly. The Ethereum bulls are particularly interested in WallitIQ’s 20% tokenomics allocation aimed at rewarding early presale participants. By buying the AI coin, staking it in WallitIQ’s liquidity farm for a 180% APY, and actively trading the token, these Ethereum bulls, and every other investor who does the same, could potentially share in this exciting opportunity. For this reason, proactive investors are choosing to buy WallitIQ AI coin now before it sells out. WallitIQ’s AI features making headlines in the crypto market Many market watchers believe that WallitIQ’s unique AI features are crucial for its strong footing among AI coins.For instance, WallitIQ users can complete transactions by scanning a receiver’s QR code. This Scan & Pay QR feature simplifies the payment process while adding an extra layer of security. In addition, WallitIQ’s focus on a simplified DeFi solution, which is evident in its provision of access to AI-driven guides covering opportunities like staking, liquidity provision, and yield farming. This makes it possible for investors to remain profitable, regardless of their chosen investment path. Additionally, WallitIQ has addressed all concerns about security by successfully completing a smart contract audit conducted by the reputable firm SolidProof , solidifying the project’s credibility. Conclusion The crypto market is unforgiving to latecomers. As the Dogecoin price tests its limits yet again, Ethereum bulls are already reaping massive rewards from the WallitIQ $0.0243 AI coin. Its 45,000% predicted surge isn’t a fluke; rather, it’s a signal. If the shifting market momentum isn’t a clear sign, these Ethereum bulls’ conspicuous move to WallitIQ underscores this trend. Every investor must now compete with many others as urgency increases. Hence, decisive and profit-hungry investors must consider buying the WallitIQ at $0.0243 before time runs out.

According to the report, the market experienced inflows totaling $308 million, marking a continuation of positive trends. However, there was also a series of outflows that amounted to roughly $1 billion. Deciphering The Fund Flows The data shared by CoinShares highlighted substantial outflows, with December 19 witnessing a single-day outflow of $576 million. The final two days of the week contributed an additional $1 billion in total outflows, raising concerns among market participants about sustained investor sentiment . James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, explained that these outflows “coincided with a price correction” and “followed the hawkish outlook” presented by the Federal Reserve during its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. According to Butterfill, the market reacted to the revised “dot plot,” which suggested potential future interest rate hikes. Despite these notable outflows, the cumulative impact on total assets under management (AuM) was relatively minor, equating to just 0.37% of total AuM. Butterfill further noted that this event ranks as the 13th largest single-day outflow recorded, with the most significant outflow occurring in mid-2022 after a similar FOMC announcement. While the headline numbers suggest market caution, Bitcoin (BTC) showed resilience, managing net inflows of $375 million despite intra-week volatility. Notably, short Bitcoin products saw minimal activity, indicating continued investor confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential . Altcoins and Multi-Asset Investment Trends The report further revealed the contrasting performances between various altcoins and multi-asset investment products. Particularly, outflows from multi-asset funds were quite significant hitting $121 million, as investors took a more selective, asset-specific approach. Such behavior indicates investors are becoming pickier and targeting assets with firmer fundamentals and the potential to grow. Ethereum (ETH) remained a prominent performer, securing $51 million in inflows over the week. These inflows reaffirm Ethereum’s position as a key player in the digital asset space, driven by sustained institutional interest and optimism surrounding its technological upgrades. However, not all major altcoins shared this positive momentum. Butterfill reveals that Solana (SOL) experienced $8.7 million in outflows, contrasting sharply with Ethereum’s positive movement. It is worth noting that the discrepancy suggests a divergence in investor sentiment between these two major assets, potentially influenced by ongoing ecosystem developments and perceived risks. In contrast, following ETH, XRP emerged as one of the standout altcoin performers, recording $8.8 million in inflows. Similarly, Horizen (ZEN) and Polkadot (DOT) reported inflows of $4.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, highlighting a preference for specific altcoins despite broader market volatility. These inflows suggest continued investor confidence in the long-term potential of select blockchain ecosystems, even amid short-term corrections .

Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Could Reveal Location Of Next Price Top In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed where the BTC top could lie based on the Mayer Multiple. The “Mayer Multiple” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin price and its 200-day moving average (MA). The 200-day MA has historically proven to be a significant level for BTC, often serving as the boundary between bearish and bullish trends. As such, the distance of the price from this MA, which is what the Mayer Multiple measures, can be useful to watch. Related Reading: XRP Could Be The Altcoin To Recover Quickly, CryptoQuant Analyst Explains Why When the Mayer Multiple has a high value, it means the asset is trading significantly above the 200-day MA, which could imply potential overbought conditions. On the other hand, the metric being low could suggest a bullish reversal may be due for BTC. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple represented as an oscillator over the history of the cryptocurrency: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple is currently around halfway to the level that has usually signaled overheated conditions for the coin’s price. The level in question is situated at the 2.4 mark. When the metric assumes this value, the price of the asset becomes 2.4 times the 200-day MA. In the same chart, a price line corresponding to this level is also shown. It’s apparent that Bitcoin formed some of its major historical tops when it broke through the line. So far in the current cycle, Bitcoin hasn’t been able to retest the level yet. And it may not be able to do so for a while, either since the Mayer Multiple would only equal 2.4 when the cryptocurrency’s price rises to around the $168,500 level. Related Reading: XRP, Solana Among Altcoins Witnessing TD Buy Signal, Analyst Reveals An important level relevant to the Mayer Multiple that BTC did retest during this cycle was the 0.8 line. Just like the 2.4 level serves as a signal for potential overheated conditions, this line can imply the coin may be reaching a bottom. Bitcoin successfully found a rebound at the line earlier in the year, confirming that a transition towards a bear market hadn’t taken place yet. It now remains to be seen whether the asset would go on to retest the top level next or if another plunge to this bottom level will happen first. BTC Price Bitcoin slipped toward the $92,000 level on Friday, but it seems the asset has made some recovery since then, as it sits at $96,000 to kick off the new week.

The company has assured its users that no vulnerabilities have been found and all funds remain secure, following widespread concerns about suspicious trading activity. Reports of DPRK-Linked Wallets Spark Security Concerns Concerns emerged after Taylor Monahan, a security expert, claimed that wallets flagged as being associated with North Korean hackers had engaged in trading on Hyperliquid’s platform. These wallets reportedly conducted transactions involving Ethereum (ETH) , leading to liquidations totaling over $700,000. Monahan, in a statement on social media, suggested the activity could have been an attempt to probe the platform’s defenses. The activity triggered fears among users, leading to significant withdrawals of USDC from the platform. According to data from Hashed’s Dune Analytics dashboard, over $194 million in USDC was withdrawn on Monday alone. Hyperliquid Refutes Exploit Claims After the allegations, Hyperliquid Labs has come forward to address the issue via its Discord channel, claiming that there was no hack or exploit. ‘Hyperliquid Labs has noted the rumors circulating with regard to activity on behalf of DPRK addresses.’ To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been no DPRK exploit – or any exploit for that matter – of Hyperliquid. All customer funds are accounted for,” the company said. The team also emphasized the operational security that it uphold by using strong bug bounty program and compliance with industry standard in blockchain analysis. According to Hyperliquid Labs, there has been no disclosure of any vulnerability by any security researcher or third party. HYPE Token Volatility Stabilizes The accusations and the subsequent market concerns resulted in the drop of Hyperliquid’s native currency, HYPE. The token fell by more than 25% from $34 on Sunday to $25 on Monday. Nevertheless, as Hyperliquid Labs provided guarantees that user funds are safe, the price of HYPE stabilized, and at the time of writing, it was $27, as seen on DexScreener. Despite being one of the leading providers of on-chain perpetual futures trading where it holds more than 55% of the market, Hyperliquid remains a dominant force in the DeFi space. However, regardless of the recent fluctuation in the platform’s market standing, the market position seems to have been able to win back investors. Security Risks of Validator Infrastructure Despite Hyperliquid dismissing the claim that there is an exploit , the platform is said to be at risk because it has only a few validators. Several crypto security experts pointed out that Hyperliquid has only four validators, which could be a problem if three of them were compromised. A crypto developer, Cygaar, explained that Hyperliquid’s bridge on Arbitrum One currently holds $2.3 billion in USDC. Since the platform operates on a two-thirds quorum requirement, compromising three validators could allow malicious actors to access the entire amount. To address such scenarios, experts have suggested that Circle, the issuer of USDC, could blacklist hacker-linked addresses to prevent the stolen funds from being moved or converted. Additionally, the Arbitrum multi-signature security council could roll back malicious transactions in the event of an attack. However, this option remains controversial due to concerns about centralization.

Adding to the intrigue, Solana’s descent from $260 to $180 has seen it surpassed by $XRP in market capitalization, a development that has shocked the entire crypto community. Solana ($SOL): Struggling to Maintain $180 Solana has emerged as a primary force of the blockchain ecosystem, having been nicknamed “Ethereum killer” owing to its rapid transactions and low fees. Nonetheless, recent behavior of the market shows that $SOL is struggling to maintain its price levels. • Price Crash: From $260 to $180 — a drastic drop for Solana.• SURPRISING OUTCOME: This decline led to Ripple ($XRP) overtaking Solana per market cap.• Technical Challenges: Solana has experienced network outages and performance problems, resulting in a loss of investor confidence. Despite the attention on falling prices and TVL, Solana has a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and projects that continue to drive growth. While investors are keeping an eye out for a comeback driven by network upgrades and developer activity. Ripple ($XRP): Battling Volatility Around $2 Ripple’s $XRP has been the talk of the town in recent weeks in light of a string of positive and negative news. After news broke of Gary Gensler’s exit from the SEC, seeing $XRP rally to $2.9; however, the asset has struggled to keep the buy side momentum. • Bearish pattern: $XRP has not been able to maintain the $2.1 area for the last 7 days and has formed a bearish M (Double Top) pattern.• Target price: This pattern gives a more bearish target of $1.5, which might concern traders.• Regulatory Overhang: Although the SEC-related positive news gave breathing space to $XRP in the short run, which could result in overhang for future upward price movement. Ripple’s utility through partnerships with financial institutions around the world continues to be visible, but there is scant evidence that price action is being driven by fundamentals as the market is still under the influence of short-term direction and technical signals. Altura ($ALU): Poised for a Bullish Breakout In contrast to $SOL and $XRP, Altura ($ALU) is capturing attention as it prepares for a significant bullish breakout. Altura is a blockchain project focused on powering gaming and NFTs through smart NFTs—dynamic, upgradeable NFTs that can change properties based on predefined conditions. Key factors driving Altura’s bullish outlook include: • AI Toolkit Announcement: Altura recently announced a new AI toolkit, which has generated excitement and renewed investor interest.• Bullish Chart Pattern: On the 4-hour chart, $ALU is forming a falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish indicator that suggests an imminent breakout. • Price Targets: Analysts predict that $ALU could reach new local highs of $0.2 in the short term. Long-term projections suggest even greater potential, with a market capitalization that could soar to $1 billion. Conclusion While Solana ($SOL) and Ripple ($XRP) navigate their respective challenges, Altura($ALU) is emerging as a promising investment opportunity. With its focus on gaming, NFTs, and AI innovation, Altura is positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based entertainment solutions. For investors, this divergence in performance highlights the importance of diversification and staying informed about emerging trends in the cryptocurrency space. Whether you’re holding $SOL, $XRP, or exploring $ALU, understanding the underlying factors driving these assets is crucial for making informed decisions in the volatile world of crypto trading.

Announced Sunday, Hines will be onboard as the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. Trump’s Crypto Council The 29-year-old acknowledged the appointment in a December 23 post on X, writing: “Thank you, Mr. President! It will be the honor of a lifetime to serve in your next administration. Thank you for everything you have done and continue to do for our country.” Hines further expressed his excitement about collaborating with the council’s chair, David Sacks. He also stated his commitment to ensuring that the digital asset industry thrives and remains central to the United States’ technological leadership. According to a Truth Social post by Trump, the crypto council is a newly created advisory body composed of key figures in the virtual currency space. Chaired by Sacks, the group will work to foster innovation and growth in the sector while providing industry leaders with the resources they need to succeed. “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can flourish and remain a cornerstone of our nation’s technological advancement,” said the statement. Hines, an alumnus of Yale University and Wake Forest University Law School, played for both North Carolina State and Yale. In 2022, he took a stab at elective politics, running as the Republican candidate for North Carolina’s 13th congressional district, where he narrowly lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel. He has long supported cryptocurrency, describing the assets as the “epitome of individual empowerment in finance” in a January 16 post on X. Further, he decried the “burdensome regulations” the Biden administration had placed on the industry, stating it needed “freedom to grow organically.” Pro-Crypto Appointments Since winning the U.S. presidential election, Trump has made several pro-crypto appointments in line with his campaign promise to make America the crypto capital of the world. On December 5, he chose David Sacks to oversee the AI and cryptocurrency sectors. At the time, he explained that his responsibilities would include positioning the U.S. as a world leader in these fields by protecting free speech online and countering Big Tech bias and censorship. The crypto czar was also tasked with creating a legal framework to address the sector’s demand for regulatory clarity, enabling its growth and success within the country. Under Trump’s administration, Sacks, in collaboration with the chairs of the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will lead efforts to reform digital currency policies backed by the new crypto council. Additionally, the president-elect has selected Paul Atkins to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, signaling his determination to reverse what he has described as the Biden administration’s “war on crypto,” primarily driven by the regulator under Gensler’s leadership. Congressman French Hill was also named the incoming chair of the House Financial Services Committee, effective in 2025. He is expected to play a crucial role in shaping legislative measures for the crypto sector in the year ahead.

Over the past few days, the overall cryptocurrency market has faced downside momentum. XRP Current Outlook Despite this, XRP has held its crucial support level at the $2.15 mark for the last five trading days. Meanwhile, major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), have experienced a notable price decline during the same period. The potential reason behind XRP’s ability to maintain its support level is the continuous support and confidence from investors and traders, as reported by on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . $407 Million Worth XRP Outflow Data from XRP spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges across the cryptocurrency landscape had witnessed an outflow of a significant $407 million worth of XRP in the past six days. During this period, exchanges didn’t face any inflow or token deposits from wallet addresses, which hints at a bullish sign. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency landscape, “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, which also represents accumulation. However, this significant outflow indicates potential upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity. There is a high possibility it could create buying pressure if this trend continues. Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP is at a crucial support level of $2.15 and appears to be losing its grip on that support. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if the altcoin closes a daily candle below the $2.15 level, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 15% to reach the next support level at the $1.95 mark. Conversely, if XRP holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25% to reach the $2.75 mark in the future. Current Price Momentum At present, XRP is trading near $2.20 and has experienced a price decline of over 1.05% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 5%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors amid market uncertainty.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-23 20:11:27

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD losing 1.2% on the day, extending its downtrend. Over the weekend, Bitcoin briefly spiked to $99,500 before being pushed down by sellers, bringing its drawdown from last week’s all-time highs to 15%. Short-term price performance has raised concerns among analysts. The popular X analytics account Bitcoindata21 highlighted bearish signals, noting, “Underside retests and rejections of VWAPs are NOT what you want to see for bullish price action.” Their analysis pointed to a likely retest of $92,000, with a more significant buying opportunity at $85,000–$86,000, described as the “back up the truck” zone for bulls. Similarly, the trader CrypNuevo predicted further price drops before a market rebound, targeting levels near $90,000. “Now, I still think that we could revisit the lows,” CrypNuevo shared in a thread on X, discussing low-timeframe market patterns. “It’s hard to imagine that we’re going to get a V shape recovery from here. I’m leaning more towards either a W formation or a 100% of the wick fill. Ideally, the 100% wick-fill, since $90k is a strong psychological level.” Bitcoin’s recent volatility has left market participants questioning the strength of the asset’s support levels, as bearish momentum continues to dominate short-term trends.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 20:11:51
