Cardano (ADA) , renowned for its scalability and eco-friendly blockchain, is set to leverage upcoming upgrades to fuel a breakout surge. Adding to the excitement, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a game-changer in the decentralized AI and blockchain space, thanks to its advance ecosystem. With its presale at $0.003, LCAI is gaining momentum as a disruptive force, attracting investors seeking exponential growth in a rapidly evolving market.

Recent checks show that XRP has good backing near the $2.42 mark, hin͏ting at a strong base for its present price points! Also, the launch of Ripple’s new RLUSD coin has made good mood in the market, helping to boost XRP’s rise. Market pros think that XRP might hit $5 by Christmas, showing more hope among buyers. These news along with XRP’s known spot in the money market, back up the guess that it will hold on to the $2 point soon. Cardano’s bullish momentum- what’s fueling the anticipated surge? Cardano (ADA) has recently exhibited significant bullish momentum, with its price surging by approximately 52% over the past month. This upward trajectory can be attributed to several key factors. Increased Whale Activity-There has been a notable rise in large transactions, indicating heightened interest from major investors. Technical Breakout- ADA has surpassed critical resistance levels, suggesting the potential for continued upward movement. Enhanced Network Activity- Metrics such as daily active addresses have shown significant growth, reflecting increased user engagement and confidence in the platform. These developments collectively contribute to the optimistic outlook for Cardano, positioning it for potential further gains in the cryptocurrency market. Lightchain AI- the emerging contender poised for a breakout in the crypto market Lightchain AI is a decentralized platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, aiming to address challenges in both fields by creating a transparent, efficient, and privacy-preserving ecosystem for AI computations. Tokenomics The platform utilizes the Lightchain Token (LCAI) as its native cryptocurrency, serving multiple functions within the ecosystem. LCAI’s tokenomics are designed for sustainability and equitable distribution, with a total supply capped at 10 billion tokens. Utility LCAI tokens are used for payments for AI tasks, staking for governance participation, and accessing premium features of the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Distribution The token distribution is designed to incentivize early adoption and long-term participation, with allocations for early developers, validators, an ecosystem growth fund, and community rewards. Economic Design The economic model includes mechanisms for inflation control, token burning, dynamic pricing, and a sustainability fund to ensure ecosystem balance and value retention. Roadmap Lightchain AI has outlined a comprehensive roadmap to guide its development. Phase 1- Prototype Development Focuses on creating and testing core components like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the AIVM in a controlled environment. Phase 2- Testnet Rollout Involves deploying the testnet to allow developers and node operators to validate functionalities and provide feedback for optimization. Phase 3- Mainnet Launch Marks the full deployment of the platform, enabling all core features, including decentralized AI computations and tokenized transactions. Phase 4-Ecosystem Growth Aims to expand the platform’s reach by onboarding developers, enterprises, and establishing cross-chain integrations to foster a thriving ecosystem. These strategic phases are designed to ensure the platform’s robustness, scalability, and widespread adoption in the evolving crypto market. Strategic insights: Comparing XRP, Cardano, and Lightchain AI’s market potential As evident from the discussions above, XRP, Cardano, and Lightchain AI each possess unique features that make them attractive investments. While XRP remains a top choice for investors seeking stability and regulatory clarity, Cardano’s upcoming upgrades and growing network activity position it as an emerging contender for exponential growth. On the other hand, Lightchain AI presents a promising opportunity with its unique approach to bridging AI and blockchain technology- two rapidly evolving industries. Its early-stage development makes LCAI a high-risk but potentially high-reward option for investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge technologies. Why Lightchain AI could outperform all Lightchain AI’s potential for success lies in its ability to address critical challenges in the fields of blockchain and AI, ultimately creating a sustainable and efficient ecosystem for decentralized AI computations. Lightchain AI’s plan includes several key milestones. In 2024, it will launch its testnet and begin bringing developers onboard. By March 2025, the mainnet will go live, unlocking complete functionality for both PoI and AIVM. From 2025 onward, the focus will shift to building cross-chain compatibility and forging partnerships with enterprise-level AI applications. This forward-looking approach positions Lightchain AI as more than just a blockchain — it’s an AI-powered platform with the promise to transform decentralized technology.

A $0.0013 cryptocurrency is gaining investor buzz, poised to surpass Cardano and Shiba Inu with its market potential. Table of Contents DOGEN soars through stage 9 presale, positioned for explosive growth on Solana Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Shiba Inu: The Ethereum-based meme coin driving innovation Conclusion A new cryptocurrency valued at only $0.0013 is drawing remarkable attention from investors. This low-cost token is generating buzz for its potential to surpass well-known players like Cardano and Shiba Inu. The excitement surrounding its rapid rise is fueling speculation about its future impact on the market. DOGEN soars through stage 9 presale, positioned for explosive growth on Solana DOGEN continues to make waves, advancing to Stage 9 of its presale with tokens now priced at $0.0013. For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, DOGEN’s projected 500% pre-launch surge highlights its strong potential for substantial returns.

A vision beyond meme coins DOGEN’s roadmap signals a shift from meme status to a functional asset, with the upcoming DogeTap app exemplifying this movement. Prioritizing transparency and regular audits, DOGEN differentiates itself in the volatile crypto market, establishing itself as a credible and resilient option within the Solana ecosystem. With its strong growth trajectory, innovative features, and mounting investor interest, DOGEN is poised to capitalize on the momentum of both the meme coin market and Solana’s robust framework. Early investors have a unique opportunity to ride this promising wave. Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts, enabling decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano stands out for its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, Ouroboros, which is more sustainable than traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to a million transactions per second. With its focus on scalability and sustainability, ADA shows strong potential. In the current market cycle, the coin appears attractive due to its innovative technology. Shiba Inu: The Ethereum-based meme coin driving innovation Launched in August 2020 by the pseudonymous developer Ryoshi, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has quickly grown into a standout meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB leverages Ethereum’s ecosystem for enhanced functionality and scalability. With an initial supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half were famously sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the supply, significantly reducing its circulation. Unlike its predecessor Dogecoin, SHIB is building a robust utility-focused ecosystem. Key developments include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and governance framework, highlighting its ambition to go beyond meme status. SHIB’s Ethereum integration positions it as a versatile asset with potential applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based innovations. Conclusion With the bull run of 2024 underway, DOGEN stands out as a token designed for those seeking luxury and success. While ADA and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN aims for significant growth, following in the footsteps of successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. It builds a community of market leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

Kiyosaki tells his 2.6 million followers on the social media platform X that the United States has a history of devaluing its currency at the expense of Americans saving their wealth in the dollar. The best-selling author refers to the dollar as “fake money,” highlighting that the government can always print more out of thin air. “I stopped trusting my government in 1965 when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of cooper. In 1971, President Nixon continued the theft of our wealth via our money, when Tricky Dicky Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard… If you do not [like] being ‘bent over’ and your wealth stolen via your fake money…. Keep being ignorant, working hard for fake money, and continue listening to financial planners who will tell you what to do with your fake money.” Kiyosaki calls on investors to instead store their wealth in scarce assets like gold, silver and Bitcoin ( BTC ). He notes that investing in these three commodities can save people in the event of a severe financial crisis. “THANK YOU gold, silver and Bitcoin HODLERS… Today the best assets for your money are real gold, silver, and Bitcoin. The world is about to crash financially. Please take care.” Last month, Kiyosaki said he plans to accumulate about 100 BTC regardless of price. He notes that he’s comfortable trading his dollars for “real money” like BTC despite Bitcoin’s rising prices. “Today I own 73 whole Bitcoins. A year from now, I intend to own 100 Bitcoin, regardless of price.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $97,222.

The billionaire blockchain visionary plans to meet Democratic Senators, including Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, to probably push a bipartisan agenda for the crypto industry. Charles’s strategy is to bridge the gap between political parties and get lawmakers to stop fighting long enough to see what crypto can actually do. Fetterman recently went viral for his comments on Trump’s 2024 win, calling out Kamala Harris for labeling Trump a fascist. “A lot of Democrats, especially in my state, that I know and I happen to love, people that [voted] for Trump, and they are not fascists,” Fetterman said. “I think people are going to decide who protects and projects their version of the American way of life. And that’s what happened.” Charles sees opportunity in Fetterman Charles wasted no time reacting. “When people ask how we make crypto a bipartisan issue, these are the Democrats we need to talk to next year,” he said . For Charles, Fetterman represents a type of leadership that crypto needs—Democrats willing to challenge party lines and think differently. Crypto has been caught in political crossfire, with the Biden administration and Senator Elizabeth Warren taking a hard stance against the industry. Charles has been vocal about this. He slammed what he called Biden and Warren’s anti-crypto “deal,” claiming it stifles innovation and locks legitimate businesses out of the system. But his plan doesn’t stop with a few meetings. He’s already proposed a “Bill of Rights” for crypto users, focusing on consumer protection, fair taxation, and clear asset classification. In November, he launched “Operation Baseline,” a campaign for identifying inefficiencies in the U.S. crypto market and pushing for legislation to fix them. Charles even floated the idea of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong becoming a “White House Crypto Czar” under a potential Trump administration. Armstrong, he argued, could unify the fragmented industry and offer a strong voice in Washington. The president has since chosen someone else. A polarizing figure with big ideas Charles isn’t your typical suit-and-tie tech founder. Critics call Cardano a “zombie chain,” accusing it of lacking activity compared to Ethereum and Solana. Charles doesn’t flinch. He fires back with the same energy, saying, “People see what they want to see.” His outspoken personality is both his strength and his Achilles’ heel. He likes to drag critics, calling them the “paint chip brigade” and taking aim at journalists and competitors alike. It’s a style that alienates some but resonates with others who admire his no-nonsense approach. Though earlier this year, he ran a Twitter poll asking, “Am I cancer for Cardano?” Over 50,000 people voted, and 51.6% said yes. Instead of sulking, he turned the results into another talking point. While Charles’s critics stay busy, so does he. With a net worth of $1.2 billion, he’s funding projects that sound straight out of a sci-fi novel—glow-in-the-dark plants, research to detect extraterrestrial life, and more. He has met with Argentine President Javier Milei more than once to discuss using blockchain in government systems. He’s also urged U.S. lawmakers to align crypto regulations with global standards, pointing to countries like Switzerland and Singapore as examples. He has more than one friend in Trump’s cabinet. “Crypto isn’t a Republican issue. It’s an American and global issue. Only by bringing everyone together can we get to the next level,” Charles said.

Analyst Highlights Bollinger Band Retest Mirroring Jan. 2024 Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-178k-target-in-sight-analyst-highlights-bollinger-band-retest-mirroring-jan-2024-rally/,"Bitcoin has been on a correction path since it reached a new all-time high of $108,135 on December 17. Notably, this correction has seen the leading cryptocurrency decline by about 10% up until the time of writing and even breaking below $93,000 very quickly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Above $10: Historical Data Shows How High DOGE Will Go This Bull Cycle This notable decline has seen Bitcoin retesting the Bollinger Bands, and technical analysis suggests a bounce from here to reach a price target around $178,000. Bitcoin Retests Monthly Upper Bollinger Band Bitcoin’s recent price correction has caught the eye of crypto analyst Tony Severino, who highlighted a critical retest of the monthly upper Bollinger Band. Sharing his insights on social media platform X, Severino emphasized the significance of this technical indicator, which measures market volatility and potential reversal points. According to him, this development mirrors a similar pattern observed in January 2024, which eventually led to a substantial rally after a similar retest. According to the daily candlestick chart shared by Tony Severino, the upper Bollinger Band is currently situated just above $96,000, which is around Bitcoin’s current price. This Bollinger Band retest suggests that Bitcoin might be entering a new phase of upward momentum after the recent corrections. Historical Echoes: January 2024’s 86% Rally Offers A Blueprint Severino’s analysis draws parallels between the current price movement and Bitcoin’s behavior earlier in 2024. He noted that in January 2024, a similar retest of the monthly upper Bollinger Band preceded an 86% rally in Bitcoin’s price. At that time, Bitcoin was trading near $46,000, following a strong price rally that was brought forward from late 2023. However, January saw a brief correction, with Bitcoin’s price dropping to $40,000 to test the upper Bollinger Band. This test acted as a launchpad for not only a continued rally but also pushed Bitcoin to break its then all-time high and surpass $70,000 in March for the first time in its history. If Bitcoin were to replicate this 86% rally at this point, it could soar to approximately $178,000, which Severino noted is aligning with the upper range of his target zone. In another analysis, the analyst predicted that Bitcoin could reach its market top as early as January 20, 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading $96,402, still hovering around the upper Bollinger Band. Interestingly, the leading cryptocurrency is currently down by 2.11% and 5.4% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. This pullback has led to the realization of over $5.72 billion in Bitcoin profits, which has added to the short-term selling pressure. The impact of this correction is evident in Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has fallen sharply from 69 on December 17 to its current reading of 45.

This is because the RSI level of 43 has acted as a significant support zone for Bitcoin since September. If this support holds, it could provide the foundation for Bitcoin’s move towards $178,000.

Table of Contents Move over XRP: XYZ targets 7,400% gains to steal the spotlight XRP Conclusion XRP has been making headlines with ambitious price targets, capturing the interest of crypto enthusiasts. Yet, an emerging altcoin boasting an astounding potential return of 7,400% is poised to steal the limelight. Could this under-the-radar cryptocurrency become the next major player, overshadowing XRP’s goals and seizing the market’s attention? You might also like: Cardano, Dogecoin, XRP, and XYZVerse: Bold 2025 bull run price predictions inside Move over XRP: XYZ targets 7,400% gains to steal the spotlight In a crypto market rife with contenders, XYZ stands apart. Its presale has already demonstrated its potential, with the token’s price leaping from $0.0001 at launch to $0.001 in just a few months — a staggering 1,000% surge. Now priced at $0.001333 in its current presale stage, XYZ is set to rise again to $0.002 in the next stage, climbing toward a projected $0.1 at launch. This trajectory marks a remarkable 7,400% potential increase, making XYZ a serious contender for the top spot in this altcoin season. Why XYZ could overshadow XRP More than just another token, XYZ embodies the spirit of sportsmanship and competition. As part of the XYZVerse ecosystem, it combines meme coin hype with the booming demand for sports-themed dApps, prediction markets, and sports betting. Its robust roadmap and high utility position it as a long-term player, not a flash-in-the-pan trend. While XRP garners attention with price speculation, XYZ delivers tangible progress: Presale Momentum: With rapid stage progress, XYZ has already shown its ability to attract a loyal following. First-Mover Advantage: As the first all-sports meme coin, it taps into a massive, underserved market. Rock-Solid Foundations: Audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for major CEX/DEX listings ensure a secure and credible investment. XRP’s $5 and $10 targets may turn heads, but XYZ offers something truly extraordinary — a chance to secure exponential returns while riding the wave of an altcoin movement. With its presale stages flying by and the final target of $0.1 in sight, XYZ is a rare opportunity for those who act fast. Don’t wait for XRP’s next move; seize the chance to invest in a token with real growth potential and a unique edge. XYZ is more than a meme coin; it’s a movement set to reshape the altcoin landscape. XRP Over the past six months, XRP has shown significant growth, with its price increasing by over 360%. In the last month, the price surged by approximately 105%, indicating strong upward momentum. However, the past week saw a slight dip of about 3%. Currently trading between $2.03 and $2.73, XRP is approaching its resistance level at $3.02. A break above this could propel it toward the next resistance at $3.73, representing a significant gain. On the downside, support levels at $1.61 and $0.9041 provide a safety net against declines. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.28, just below the 100-day SMA of $2.44, suggesting short-term bearishness. The Relative Strength Index is around 43, indicating the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0252, hinting at potential consolidation. Overall, XRP’s robust performance suggests potential for further growth, especially if it can surpass key resistance levels. Conclusion While XRP’s ambitious goals are impressive, XYZVerse’s 20,000% growth potential and unique sports-meme blend might steal the spotlight in the 2024 bull run.

As investors navigate this challenging landscape, it’s essential to examine the factors contributing to these declines and to identify any potential opportunities amidst the chaos. Biggest Losers in the Last 7 Days The biggest losers among altcoins over the past week were: • $WIF: With a loss of 34%, it thus becomes a prime example of why we should always be careful with altcoins in general.• $OP: Down by 32%, its continued decline — is the optimistically-themed Optimism in name only now? • $PEPE: Down 28% for the week, the meme coin that has been taking us all by storm — Pepe ($PEPE) — seems to have suffered a time-out together with all those other manias. • $RENDER: The render token Render ($RENDER) saw its value go down by 25%. This is another example of how even utility-driven coins can face setbacks. • $SOL: After rising to great heights, Solana ($SOL) is now 20% less than it was a week ago. Even the top-tier altcoins are struggling. These declines highlight the many problems that exist in the altcoin market — some contribute to it, others reflect wider economic trends. Half a dominion others believe the downturn began in part due to an exodus from stocks on profit-taking hopes. Will Altcoin Season Even Happen? Historically, Q4 — and December in particular — has always been a bountiful harvest time for those in cryptocurrency markets. But this year defies all the rules: altcoin markets seem to have lost momentum as they struggle for a footing. Therefore, when a seasonal rally fails to appear, worries quickly arise. People who have long awaited such time are now anxious to know, indeed wonder if ever there will be an altcoin season. However, there is cause for hope. Coins like Altura ($ALU) Project all carry the prospectus of a renaissance in Q1 of 2025 or thereafter. By using remarkable technology and carving out a unique place in the market, these coins may lead an about-face to current trends and open up opportunity for next-stage growth. They may yet be a beacon of optimism. Altura ($ALU): A Beacon of Stability Amidst the turbulence, Altura ($ALU) has emerged as one of the most stable and promising AI-integrated cryptocurrencies. Unlike many of its counterparts, Altura has managed to maintain relative stability, drawing the attention of savvy investors. What Makes Altura Stand Out? 1. Machine Learning: The Altura ecosystem makes extensive use of artificial intelligence, especially for its smart NFTs. Altura has already given use cases to their AI-infused NFTs that update based on user interaction and real-world data.2. Humongous Market Cap Potential: As a relatively small market cap that pales in comparison to the other AI and NFT-themed projects we cover, it is a great source of potential. This makes it a prime candidate for upside potential.3. Community and Developer Support: Altura's active developer community and loyal user base have enabled it to withstand market fluctuations, demonstrating its resilience. Bullish Outlook for Q1 2025 Now, if we take a glance at the future, Scripts are super optimistic over Altura ($ALU) for Q1 2025. If you take into account the fact that Altura's market cap is now under $100 million, this is a unique opportunity for a dramatic increase. If it matches its lofty vision, then it can realistically reach a 500M+, 1B+ market cap and 10x+ returns for early-stage investors. • Increasing Demand for AI-Powered NFTs: Altura’s novel application of AI to drive smart NFTs places it in position to capitalize on an emerging trend. The paradigm is shifting from static assets to dynamic, AI-driven tools, and Altura is right there at the forefront.• Strategic Partnerships and Ecosystem Expansion: Altura is actively pursuing strategic partnerships that contribute to its utility and promote ecosystem development. These partnerships will lead to more adoption and would further cement it as a leader within the AI and NFT sectors. Market Recovery Potential: As the broader cryptocurrency market recovers, Altura's unique value proposition and relatively low market cap can make it an enticing investment for those seeking high-growth opportunities. Analysts are already predicting that we could see the start of an early-phase bull run for Altura in Q1 of 2025, with increasing interest in AI teleportation in the broader blockchain arena. With innovative technology, community involvement, and scalability, Altura remains a top-tier project within the space. A low entry point with high potential growth makes it one of the hottest opportunities for 2025. Conclusion: Altura ($ALU) – A Stable Choice in Uncertain Times While the altcoin market struggles to regain its footing, Altura ($ALU) stands out as a beacon of stability and potential. Its innovative approach to AI and NFTs, combined with a supportive community and strategic vision, makes it a compelling investment for those looking ahead to Q1 2025 and beyond. Investors seeking opportunities in the crypto market should keep a close eye on Altura, as it continues to defy the broader market trends and position itself for an “insane rise” in the coming months.

Adam Back is among the names claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Quantum computers could theoretically break the cryptographic security that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, prompting concerns that BTC wallets could one day become vulnerable to hacking. Adam Back explained that Bitcoin is already “quantum-ready” thanks to Taproot, a technology implemented in Bitcoin in 2021. Taproot uses “leaf nodes” in its design that can hold placeholders for future advanced cryptographic technologies, including quantum-resistant (post-quantum or PQ) signatures. In simpler terms, Bitcoin’s current system is like a house built with extra empty rooms that can later be equipped with advanced security doors if needed. For now, these rooms are unused but ready for upgrades. Related News: El Salvador Announces New Bitcoin Step Despite IMF Warning Back cautioned that there should be no rush to enable quantum-resistant signature technology: The Threat is Decades Away: Quantum computing powerful enough to break Bitcoin's cryptography is still decades away from becoming a reality. Future Innovations: Cryptographic research is constantly advancing. When quantum computers become a real threat, more compact, efficient, and well-studied solutions for quantum-resistant signatures will likely become available. Bitcoin users can prepare for this without immediately enabling quantum-resistant cryptography. This includes: Future-proofing Wallets: Wallets can use new cryptographic formats compatible with future technologies while continuing to use the existing signature system (Schnorr signatures). Seamless Transition: If quantum computing becomes a real threat, Bitcoin can migrate to these quantum-resistant systems without major disruptions. These preparations should ease fears about quantum computing, Back says. In the possible scenario where quantum computing advances faster than expected, Bitcoin has a system in place to adapt. But that likely won’t happen for several decades, allowing researchers to develop and improve compact, efficient solutions in the meantime. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum’s price drops to below $3,400 amid scalability concerns Ethereum ‘s price has remained sluggish in responding to the bull market even though its recent uptick past $4,000. After surging to a striking distance of $5,000 in 2021, Ethereum’s price plummeted to lows of $1,000 but has recovered amid critical resistance at the $4,000 mark. Now, Ethereum’s price has been rejected above the $4,000 mark three times, and market watchers are less optimistic that the leading DeFi ecosystem could surge further to $5,000 – $6,00 during this bull run. Some of the obstacles that have hindered a rally on Ethereum’s price include Ethereum’s bloated network, which has registered skyrocketing network fees at peak congestion. With the advent of scalability solutions such as Cardano’s ADA, Ethereum’s price could experience further sluggish growth. What’s more, mass adoption by institutions will require a lot more liquidity to move Ethereum’s price.

Is it the technological innovation, its market resilience, or the return potential for investors? As blockchain technology evolves, projects like Qubetics ($TICS) , Polkadot ($DOT), and Near Protocol ($NEAR) have emerged as top contenders for delivering transformative value to both their ecosystems and their investors. But among them, which project offers the best coins for massive return potential in 2024? Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Convenience with Multichain Wallet Qubetics has quickly gained traction as a revolutionary blockchain project. Now in the 13th stage of its presale, Qubetics has sold over 367 million $TICS tokens, raising more than $7.5 million from 11,300+ holders. With its current price of $0.0342 per token , analysts predict extraordinary returns of up to 43,711.73% ROI if $TICS reaches $15 post-mainnet launch. An investment of $50,000 at this stage could potentially grow into over $21.8 million. A standout feature of Qubetics is its multichain wallet, a tool that exemplifies its commitment to solving real-world blockchain challenges. This wallet provides users with seamless access to multiple blockchain networks within a single interface, eliminating the complexity of managing assets across fragmented ecosystems. Consider a scenario where a business operates on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Traditionally, managing these assets would require separate wallets, creating inefficiency and security risks. With Qubetics’ multichain wallet, users can consolidate these operations into one platform, streamlining workflows and enhancing security. With such practical applications and a clear vision for the future, Qubetics positions itself as one of the best coins for massive return potential in 2024. Its unique features and exceptional growth prospects make it an unmissable opportunity for investors looking to capitalise on the blockchain revolution. Polkadot ($DOT): The Interoperability Powerhouse Polkadot is widely recognised as one of the most innovative blockchain projects, designed to address the need for interoperability across networks. Its unique architecture enables multiple blockchains, or “parachains,” to operate seamlessly while sharing security and governance features. This makes Polkadot a cornerstone for decentralised applications and cross-chain communication. Since its launch, Polkadot has established itself as a leader in the blockchain industry. $DOT, its native token, plays a critical role in governance, staking, and bonding for parachains. With an ever-expanding ecosystem, Polkadot has become the go-to choice for developers aiming to create scalable, interoperable applications. For investors, Polkadot represents a blend of stability and growth potential. Its ability to unify disparate blockchain networks positions it as a key player in the future of decentralised technology.

This Viral New Meme Coin Presale Is the Next Big Move,https://thecoinrise.com/couldnt-buy-neiro-this-viral-new-meme-coin-presale-is-the-next-big-move/,"The world of meme coins has been a wild ride, hasn’t it? From Dogecoin’s humble beginnings to Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise, these quirky tokens have captured the imagination of millions. What started as internet humour has grown into a massive financial movement, proving the power of community and creativity. A new contender has entered the scene, poised to shake things up: BTFD Coin . With its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, referral program, and juicy staking rewards offering up to 90% APY, BTFD is rewriting the meme coin playbook. Meme coins aren’t just about the laughs anymore—they’re serious business. Over the years, these coins have evolved from mere jokes into powerful tools for community-driven wealth creation. Think about it: Dogecoin paved the way, Shiba Inu raised the stakes, and BTFD is pushing the envelope even further. With over $4.3 million raised in its presale and features that make it more than just another meme coin, BTFD is making waves. Its P2E game went live in beta during Stage 10, giving the community a sneak peek into what’s coming. Meanwhile, the staking and referral programs ensure that holding $BTFD is as rewarding as it is exciting. If you’re still sitting on the sidelines, wondering if this viral new meme coin presale is worth your time, let’s dive in and see how BTFD stacks up against Neiro, another standout in the meme coin universe. BTFD Coin: Turning Chaos Into Opportunity BTFD Coin isn’t just another name in the meme coin lineup; it’s a movement. With a rallying cry of “ buy the dip ’,” this coin invites investors to turn market downturns into wealth-building opportunities. Remember the economic crash of 1973? Inflation was through the roof, stocks tanked, and the financial world seemed freefall. However, smart investors like Warren Buffett saw the chaos as a chance to scoop up undervalued assets, and they came out on top. BTFD channels that same energy, encouraging its community to seize the moment and build their fortunes. The BTFD presale has been nothing short of phenomenal. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 12, priced at $0.00013. Early investors have already seen impressive returns, but the real excitement lies ahead. Analysts predict $BTFD will hit $0.0006 upon listing, a staggering 837.5% ROI for those who got in at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. Let’s break it down: if you had invested $25,000 at the Stage 7 price, you’d have secured 390,625,000 $BTFD coins. When the coin reaches $0.0006, your investment will balloon to $234,375. Not bad for riding the dip, right? BTFD’s P2E game, which launched its beta version in Stage 10, has already captured the community’s imagination. While rewards aren’t live yet, the gameplay hints at an engaging ecosystem that keeps users returning. Add in a referral program that lets you earn extra tokens by bringing in friends, plus staking rewards of up to 90% APY , and you’ve got a meme coin that delivers on every front. The Bulls Squad, a dedicated community of BTFD supporters, adds excitement, driving engagement and ensuring this coin’s momentum doesn’t slow down. Neiro: The Meme Coin With a Legacy Neiro has been making waves as one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year. Born out of the iconic Doge meme, it’s backed by the Own the Doge DAO, which acquired official IP rights from Atsuko Sato, the original owner of Kabosu (the Doge meme dog). This connection to the meme’s origin story has given Neiro a strong cultural foundation, and its value has skyrocketed. Neiro’s Ethereum-based token boasts a market cap of $663 million, while its Solana-based counterpart is valued at $5 million. These numbers reflect a growing community and solid market interest. However, it’s not all smooth sailing. Neiro faces legal challenges, including a dispute over trademark rights, which has caused some hesitation among potential investors. Still, its innovative approach to blending humour with blockchain technology makes it a compelling option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Neiro’s community-driven model is its strongest asset. Through voting and active participation, token holders have a say in the coin’s direction. This decentralised approach has helped build a loyal following, making it one of the standout meme coins of the year. While it doesn’t offer the same utility-packed features as BTFD, its cultural significance and established market presence make it a worthy contender in the meme coin space.

The charges stemmed from his actions between October 2019 and October 2022, during which he raised funds to assist female ISIS members in Syria. Guilty of Financing ISIS Operations In an official press release, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed that Chhipa’s efforts included financing the escape of women from prison camps and supporting ISIS fighters. He also collected funds through various online social media accounts, receiving electronic transfers, and physically gathering money by traveling long distances. The authorities revealed that Chhipa then converted the money into cryptocurrency, which was sent to Turkey and smuggled into Syria for use by ISIS. Chhipa’s primary accomplice was a British-born ISIS member in Syria who played a key role in the fund-raising efforts, including for terrorist activities. Over the course of the scheme, Chhipa sent over $185,000 in cryptocurrency to support ISIS operations. The jury convicted him on one charge of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group and four counts of providing such support. Chhipa now faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count. A sentencing hearing is set for May 5, 2025, where a federal district court judge will determine the sentence based on US Sentencing Guidelines and other legal considerations. Crypto’s Role in Terrorist Fundraising Many experts have flagged that ISIS has been using crypto for fundraising. TRM Labs’ report from last August revealed that pro-ISIS networks in countries such as Tajikistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have raised significant funds using crypto assets like Tether (USDT) on the Tron network. One such campaign, which operated for over a year, raised nearly $2 million in USDT for ISIS affiliates in Afghanistan. TRM Labs also traced over $517,000 in 2022 sent from an Indonesia-based platform to pro-ISIS accounts. However, it is also important to note that industry experts such as Chainalysis have previously clarified misconceptions regarding the use of cryptocurrency in terrorism financing. While entities like Hamas and Hezbollah use crypto for fundraising, these transactions represent a minor fraction of illicit crypto activities. Chainalysis stresses that terrorism financing remains a small part of overall illicit crypto transactions, with traditional methods such as financial institutions and shell companies being the primary sources of funding. The firm also pointed out that blockchain transparency makes it difficult for terrorists to hide transactions, as seen when Hamas ceased accepting Bitcoin donations.

Hines, a former college football player and 2022 Republican candidate for North Carolina’s 13th congressional district, steps into the role with the support he received from pro-crypto political action committees (PACs) during his campaign for Congress. While his political candidacy was unsuccessful, his new role signals Trump’s intent to advance crypto-related innovation and regulation. “In his new role, Bo will work with David Sacks to drive innovation and growth in the digital asset space while ensuring industry leaders have the resources they need to succeed,” Trump said. “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can thrive and continue to be a cornerstone of our Nation’s technological advancement.” Related News: Alleged Satoshi Nakamoto Candidate Responds to Claims that Quantum Computers Will Crack Bitcoin's Password! David Sacks, who Trump previously appointed to oversee crypto and artificial intelligence (AI) issues at the White House, will work with Hines in shaping the administration's vision for digital assets. Trump’s focus on digital assets comes amid a broad range of economic appointments. Earlier today, he appointed former Treasury Department official Stephen Miran as chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers. Miran, who has drawn attention for his stance on financial regulation, recently voiced his concerns on The Bitcoin Layer podcast, saying: “I think financial regulation is overly burdensome and prevents banks from lending as much as they want to into the economy. And I think sometimes that can really stifle innovation in areas like [the crypto economy].” *This is not investment advice.

The crypto community, including prominent crypto commentator Bitcoin Archive, has questioned the legitimacy of these reports. Meanwhile, some sources tout this claim as a sign of the UAE’s growing crypto influence. The $40 Billion Bitcoin Claim: Fact or Fiction? The claim that the UAE holds $40 billion in Bitcoin has raised eyebrows, especially as no credible sources have confirmed this. The Bitcoin Archive has expressed skepticism about the report, questioning the lack of supporting evidence. According to the Bitcoin Archive, a move of this magnitude would have made global headlines, given the UAE’s influence in the crypto space. He revealed that the original report by Bitcoinist lacked trustworthy sources. Upon further investigation, the Bitcoin Archive found no verification of such a purchase. He cast doubt on the authenticity of the $40 billion figure. UAE’s Crypto-Friendly Environment In recent years, the UAE has established itself as a global leader in the crypto space. Through strategic initiatives like the crypto center in Dubai, the country has created a thriving ecosystem for blockchain startups. These initiatives have made t he UAE a prime destination for crypto entrepreneurs and investors worldwide. The government’s forward-thinking approach to digital assets has helped attract billions of dollars in crypto investments, including a significant portion in Bitcoin. If accurate, the surge in Bitcoin holdings is aligned with the broader global bull market, which has seen many nations increase their crypto reserves. UAE’s Expanding Crypto Market While the $40 billion Bitcoin claim remains unproven, the UAE’s growing involvement in the crypto space is undeniable . Between 2023 and mid-2024, the country saw a massive influx of $34 billion into the crypto market. This marked a 42% increase from the previous year. This surge highlights the country’s growing role in the global crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin remains a major player in the UAE’s crypto landscape, holding 19% of the market share. However, stablecoins like Tether’s USDT dominate 51% of the market. Tether has plans to launch a dirham-backed token . This further shows the UAE’s commitment to digital assets and its vision of becoming a central hub for crypto innovation. By 2025, the number of crypto users in the UAE will reach 3.78 million. Additionally, a recent report revealed that 72% of UAE residents had already invested in Bitcoin by early 2024. Institutional investors and big funds play a significant role in this growth. These statistics show that the UAE is rapidly becoming a leader in crypto adoption.

As the market faces a bearish phase, certain meme coins are defying the odds, proving they’re more than just internet jokes. Among these, BTFD Coin (BTFD) has skyrocketed in popularity, with its presale exceeding $4.3 million in just over a month. Meanwhile, Memecoin (MEMECOIN) and Ponke (PONKE) are holding their ground, rallying their communities to weather the storm and come out stronger. Meme coins have evolved dramatically over the years. What started with Dogecoin as a playful experiment has transformed into a booming sector of the crypto world. These tokens now offer ecosystems with real utility, staking rewards, and innovative use cases. BTFD Coin is leading this charge with its P2E game, referral programme, staking opportunities, and the irresistible BIG50 bonus code, which allows investors to get in at an earlier presale price. If history has taught us anything, it’s that moments of economic uncertainty can create incredible opportunities. During the 1973 financial crash, savvy investors seized the chance to buy undervalued assets. Today, meme coins like BTFD Coin, Memecoin, and Ponke are providing that same chance for bold investors looking to secure significant returns . BTFD Coin: The Star of the Meme Coin Revival BTFD Coin is making waves for all the right reasons. Its presale performance has been nothing short of phenomenal, raising over $4.3 million and selling 57 billion coins to more than 6,300 holders. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, the coin is priced at $0.000064, but with the BIG50 bonus code, you can snag it at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064—a move that sets you up for an 837.5% ROI when the coin lists at $0.0006. BTFD isn’t just about hype; it’s built on a solid foundation of utility and community engagement. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game is a massive draw, attracting gamers and investors alike. Add in the referral programme and staking rewards, and you’ve got a meme coin that’s redefining what these tokens can do. Let’s put this into perspective. Say you invest $75,000 at the discounted Stage 7 price using the BIG50 bonus code. At $0.000064 per coin, you’d bag approximately 1.17 billion BTFD coins . When the presale ends and the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment would balloon to $702,000 . That’s the kind of return that turns heads. Getting in is simple. Visit the BTFD Presale Page , connect your wallet, enter the BIG50 bonus code , and lock in your discounted price. This isn’t just another presale; it’s your chance to be part of a project that’s shaking up the meme coin world. Memecoin: The Heart of the Meme Coin Culture Memecoin, often dubbed the “OG” of internet-inspired tokens, continues to prove its mettle in a volatile market. MEMECOIN is built on a philosophy of humour, community, and simplicity, making it a staple for investors who value grassroots initiatives. One of Memecoin’s biggest strengths is its community. Active social channels, meme contests, and charity initiatives have created a sense of belonging among holders. But MEMECOIN isn’t just about laughs. Its team has been quietly building features like staking pools and NFT integrations, giving the token real-world use cases that appeal to a broader audience. Despite the bearish market, Memecoin’s resilience is impressive. Analysts predict that its strong community backing will help it weather the storm and position it for significant growth when market sentiment turns bullish. For those who want to invest in a token that embodies the spirit of meme culture while offering potential returns, MEMECOIN remains a compelling choice. Imagine being part of a movement that started as a joke but grew into a legitimate asset class. That’s what MEMECOIN represents, and it’s why it continues to attract both new and seasoned investors. Ponke: Where Community Meets Purpose Ponke might not have the high-profile hype of its peers, but it more than makes up for it with a passionate community and a focus on meaningful impact. This meme coin is all about giving back, with fundraising events and charity drives at its core. If you’re looking for a token that balances fun with purpose, Ponke is the one to watch. What sets Ponke apart is its decentralised governance model. Every holder has a voice, ensuring that the project evolves in a way that reflects its community’s values. This approach has fostered a loyal following that’s willing to stick with the token through thick and thin. Ponke’s roadmap includes plans for NFT collaborations, staking options, and even a marketplace for meme-inspired goods. While it’s still early days, the token’s focus on combining humour with utility is winning over investors who want more than just another pump-and-dump coin. In a bearish market, Ponke’s grassroots approach is a breath of fresh air. It’s a reminder that meme coins can be about more than just making money; they can also create a sense of community and shared purpose. And for investors, that kind of authenticity can be a game-changer. How to Buy BTFD Coin with the BIG50 Discount If you’re ready to jump on the BTFD bandwagon, here’s how to get started.

Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain with Innovation and Accessibility Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in the cryptocurrency space. In its 13th presale stage, the project has already raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and gained a growing community of 11,300+ holders. Priced at $0.0342 per token in the 13th stage, Qubetics offers a lucrative opportunity for those looking to get in early. This phase will soon see a price increase of 10%, and analysts predict the $TICS token could reach as high as $1 after the presale ends, offering a 2820% return on investment. One of the core features that make Qubetics an exciting option among the best cryptos to invest in for long term growth is its focus on blockchain accessibility and interoperability. The platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. By utilising the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Qubetics ensures that developers can easily build decentralized applications (dApps) and integrate tokens across various platforms without a hitch. This interoperability is a game-changer, as it removes the silos that currently exist in the blockchain ecosystem and allows for greater scalability, security, and efficiency. But it’s not just the technology that makes Qubetics stand out. The platform is also fully cross-platform compatible , available on iOS, Android, and desktop, ensuring accessibility no matter where you are or what device you’re using. Plus, it’s compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making transactions smoother and more convenient . This will have a massive impact on businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Imagine being able to execute blockchain transactions on the go, without worrying about whether your device or wallet supports the transaction. For businesses, this means greater flexibility when paying or receiving payments in $TICS tokens, enabling them to reach a broader audience. Qubetics isn’t just about technology—it’s about making blockchain accessible to everyone. It’s bringing forward Web3 integration to create an all-in-one platform that bridges the gap between multiple ecosystems and drives greater adoption of blockchain technology. Qubetics’ network architecture further enhances this potential by building a Web3-aggregated chain, which unifies disparate networks into a single, interoperable platform. This is a crucial step in ensuring the seamless transfer of assets, data, and cross-chain transactions. The result? A platform that facilitates collaboration across ecosystems and enhances the scalability of decentralized technologies. With so much potential, Qubetics is certainly one of the best cryptos to invest in for long term growth. Avalanche: Dominating the Blockchain Landscape Avalanche has long been considered one of the best cryptos to invest in for the long term, and for good reason. The blockchain platform has made waves with its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. Avalanche introduced a revolutionary consensus mechanism that allows it to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), something Bitcoin and Ethereum can only dream of. This scalability has made it a favourite among DeFi (Decentralised Finance) developers and institutions looking for efficient and secure blockchain solutions. In recent years, Avalanche has also gained traction as a go-to alternative investment. It’s no surprise that institutional investors have shown a keen interest in this blockchain, as it offers both security and scalability—two critical factors for any financial institution looking to tap into the crypto market. With its unique architecture and focus on creating subnets (custom blockchains), Avalanche is poised to continue expanding its ecosystem and establishing itself as a key player in the global crypto market. Avalanche’s market position is further cemented by its continuous growth in total value locked (TVL) across decentralised applications. This metric shows how much capital is being deployed on Avalanche’s network, and it’s been steadily increasing, indicating that more and more users are seeing the value in Avalanche’s offerings. Analysts predict that Avalanche’s TVL could reach new heights, further strengthening its position as a top-tier blockchain. For those looking to diversify their crypto investments, Avalanche represents an excellent alternative to traditional stocks and bonds. With its high scalability and low transaction costs, it’s well-positioned to serve the growing demand for decentralized applications. Whether you’re a DeFi enthusiast, an investor looking for long-term growth, or a developer wanting to build on a highly efficient blockchain, Avalanche is one to watch. Aptos: The New Kid on the Blockchain Block Aptos has been making waves since its mainnet launch in 2023, positioning itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in for the long term. With its advanced, high-performance blockchain, Aptos aims to provide a scalable and secure platform for decentralized applications. The project was created by former Meta (Facebook) employees, which gives it a unique edge. Aptos combines years of experience in building scalable infrastructure with cutting-edge technology, making it one of the most promising blockchains in the space. Aptos’ most notable feature is its Move programming language, which is designed to make smart contract development more secure and efficient. Move allows for better execution of transactions and improves the overall performance of decentralized applications. Developers who are looking for an alternative to Ethereum’s Solidity will find Aptos’ Move language particularly attractive due to its focus on safety and flexibility. The Aptos blockchain has already gained traction in the DeFi sector, where its scalability and low fees have attracted both developers and investors. Its fast finality and ability to process thousands of transactions per second have made it a favourite for projects that require high throughput. As the demand for blockchain solutions continues to grow, Aptos is well-positioned to take advantage of the increasing appetite for decentralized finance, gaming, and other blockchain applications. Looking at its market performance, Aptos is a strong contender in the race for long-term investment opportunities. Its unique value proposition, coupled with the backing of industry veterans, makes it one of the most exciting projects to keep an eye on. As more users adopt Aptos and its ecosystem continues to grow, the token’s value is expected to rise, making it a smart choice for investors looking for alternative assets in the crypto space. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto Investment So, which of these projects should you invest in for the long term? While Avalanche and Aptos offer proven track records and established market positions, Qubetics is the one to watch in the coming years. With its focus on interoperability, cross-platform compatibility, and a robust Web3 ecosystem, Qubetics has the potential to revolutionise how blockchain networks communicate with one another. The presale is a golden opportunity for early investors, and with analysts predicting astronomical returns, it’s hard to ignore the growth potential of $TICS. If you’re serious about diversifying your portfolio and gaining exposure to the future of blockchain technology, investing in Qubetics presale could be your ticket to massive returns. Avalanche and Aptos are solid picks, but Qubetics represents a new frontier in blockchain development. Whether you’re looking for immediate gains or long-term growth, now’s the time to act. So, what are you waiting for? Get in on the action and invest in the best cryptos to invest in for the long term today!

The preference of the 18 to 24-year-old age group has evolved as they appreciate the convenience of digital tools but value the trust and personalization that comes with in-person banking. Their drive to in-person banking is the advice they get from the bank and a sense of engagement. The approach has made the bank branches a centre for advice rather than transaction spots. The blend of physical and digital , “Phygital” approach might bring back life to bank branches in 2025. The World Economic Forum advises on how to cement the new order: To build lasting relationships with Gen Zers, however, banks need to combine their physical presence with a competitive, exciting digital offering. Banks must also provide services that satisfy Gen Z’s demand for convenience, choice, value, sustainability, and hyper-personalization. ~ World Economic Forum Modern Banks are customizing services to fit clients’ needs Modern branches customize services extensively. Most are transforming into financial experience hubs. They drive tech-enabled consultations like video conferencing while also offering physical education workshops. These steps ensure that both demands are met, with room for the human element to guide one in making difficult financial decisions like a mortgage or wealth management. Gen Zers appreciate the digital world but also recognize that physical spaces are integral in fostering trust. The deeper customer relations emanating from brick-and-mortar banking are a great motivation for the young generation. Banks also take commendable steps to ensure they provide relevant services to Gen Zers. With the pattern, it is not easy to wish away physical banking any time soon. Is Gen Zer’s physical banking desire a threat to crypto? Gen Zers are drawn to physical banking for various reasons, but the convenience of accessing safety boxes is a unique one. Besides, it’s easier to process documents while present physically, which saves time. They also get a lot of free advice there. The desire for physical banking does not negate their drive for cryptocurrency, which is digital money. A survey done in the US supports the claim that Gen Zers embrace crypto more than any other group. Although the report says more than 50% of America’s population recognizes that cash is king, different demographics have different trends. Digital wallets and contactless payments are the hallmarks associated with young generations, including the Gen Zers.

He will serve as the council’s Executive Director, working alongside Trump’s ‘Crypto Czar,’ David Sacks. The goal is to cement America’s dominance in blockchain and digital assets while driving innovation in a sector that Trump says will be a “cornerstone of our nation’s technological advancement.” “I am pleased to announce the brilliant team that will be working in conjunction with our White House A.I. & Crypto Czar, David O. Sacks,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “Together, we will unleash scientific breakthroughs, ensure America’s technological dominance, and usher in a Golden Age of American Innovation!” Bo Hines: Trump’s choice to lead the Crypto Council Bo’ appointment has raised eyebrows, but Trump seems confident in his decision. Bo, who played football at Yale before earning his law degree from Wake Forest, brings a unique background to the role. In 2022, he ran as a Republican for North Carolina’s 13th congressional district but lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel. While Bo’ crypto credentials aren’t public, Trump has made it clear that his trust in Bo stems from his potential to deliver results in this high-stakes role. Meanwhile, Sacks has stood proud in his love for crypto. He first invested in Bitcoin literally two years after it was invented. “Bo will work with David to foster innovation and growth in the digital assets space,” Trump said. “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can flourish.” The council’s work will also align with Trump’s broader tech ambitions, which include advancements in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies. A star-studded tech lineup Michael J.K. Kratsios has been tapped as the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and will serve as an Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. She’s gonna be part of the Council too. Kratsios is a Princeton graduate and Stanford Fellow, and he is no stranger to Washington. During Trump’s first term, he served as the United States Chief Technology Officer, a position unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Later, he took on the role of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, where he earned the Department of Defense’s Distinguished Public Service Medal. Another member is Dr. Lynne Parker, who will join the administration as Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology (PCAST) and Counselor to the OSTP Director. Parker previously led the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from MIT and has been instrumental in shaping U.S. AI policy. Trump emphasized the importance of PCAST, saying it will bring together “America’s most distinguished minds in science and technology.” David Sacks will also chair PCAST, doubling his responsibilities as a central figure in Trump’s tech agenda. Next is Sriram Krishnan, a former Microsoft engineer and founding member of Windows Azure, will serve as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence. Working closely with Sacks and Parker, Krishnan will help coordinate AI policy across the government. The crypto market’s mixed reaction The announcement comes during a turbulent time for the crypto market. Bitcoin is on track for its first weekly decline since Trump won the election victory. It has dropped over 7% this week, sitting around $95,000 as of press time, down from its record high of $108,000 on December 17. Ether and Dogecoin have seen steeper declines, with a wider crypto market gauge falling by 10%. Analysts point to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone and also its dismissal of Bitcoin as a major factor. Despite this, Trump’s genuine pro-crypto stance has kept the market incredibly optimistic in the long-term. Another one of the president’s key priorities is extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is set to expire in 2025. “We must act to ensure that the tax cuts I implemented continue to benefit American families and businesses,” Trump said today. He’s also proposed eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, introducing tax deductions for car loans on American-made vehicles, and reducing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for U.S. manufacturers. Trump is also targeting clean energy tax incentives established under the Biden administration, which he argues have led to higher costs for consumers. “We cannot allow these subsidies to distort our energy market,” he said. He has proposed eliminating “double taxation” for Americans living abroad, simplifying their tax obligations and ensuring they aren’t penalized for their global ties.

The comments came from the country’s Deputy Minister of Energy Denis Moroz. The Deputy Minister said that Minsk is now “meeting with” crypto mining “investors.” Per BelTA , Moroz said that the government is holding “consultation” sessions with unnamed parties. Mining firms are also “analyzing” possible sites for new “farms” in Belarus. Belarus Courting Crypto Miners? Government officials have noted that crypto miners are already consuming 120 MW of electricity. Moroz said: “Crypto mining is a promising sector, and it has been given a new lease of life in Belarus.” Denis Moroz, Belarus’ Deputy Minister of Energy. (Source: Oblgas/YouTube) Moroz added that the Ministry of Energy only wants to work with players who are “interested in working long-term” in “the Belarusian energy system.” The Deputy Minister also insisted that incoming crypto miners should also help “create the necessary infrastructure” to help Minsk foster the size of its crypto mining capacity. “We see very big prospects. We have received many requests. I think that we will see new projects launch in the near future.” Denis Moroz, Belarus’ Deputy Minister of Energy Nuclear Power Bonus Moroz added that “until recently,” it has been impossible to understand which power sources miners using were to power their grids. While Belarus has sizeable renewable power generation operations, most of its energy mix has traditionally come from imported gas. However, the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as the Astravets Nuclear Power Plant)’s first unit came online in June 2021. The Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant. (Source: DBatura) Minsk got a fresh inflow of power when a second unit entered commercial operation in November 2023. And, Moroz, said, this had now “created conditions” whereby Belarusian officials can now offer “incentive tariffs” to attract “crypto miners to the country.” The new power plant is fitted with two VVER-1200 reactors, both built using the Russian AES-2006 design. Its total capacity is 2400 MW, officials claim.

The Deputy Minister added that these “new tariffs for crypto miners” are “linked to consumption volumes.” Moroz said that “the more electricity miners consumed, the lower the rates they would have to pay.” Potential customers could include a number of bigger Russian players, who are already looking beyond traditional hotspots like Siberia.

He's worrying about the wrong threat, says @mihirssharma https://t.co/C4ZefV0ky4 via @opinion — Bloomberg (@business) December 16, 2024 Siberian power providers have complained that crypto mining puts an unacceptable strain on their power grids in the winter months. Russian authorities have responded by issuing temporary bans on crypto mining in the winter months in many Siberian regions until 2031. In recent months, BitRiver, the biggest Russian crypto mining firm of all, has unveiled plans to team up with the Russian government in a bid to build crypto mining centers in BRICS states . Belarus announced in mid-November that it has officially been granted BRICS “partner country” status. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko this year said he wants to go a step further. The veteran leader says he hopes to secure full BRICS membership in the near future.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 23:41:10

Dogecoin kicked things off, and Shiba Inu followed with its explosive rise, proving that meme coins can deliver jaw-dropping returns. Today, a new crop of meme coins is making waves. Among them, BTFD Coin is stealing the spotlight thanks to its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, generous staking rewards, and a referral program that’s making early investors smile. If you’re wondering about the best new meme coins to buy this month , we’ve got you covered with a deep dive into BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Notcoin. With the BIG50 bonus code, you can lock in the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000064 and maximise your gains. It’s a deal that’s too good to pass up—especially when you see the explosive potential of BTFD Coin’s presale. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Raising the Bar Let’s cut to the chase— BTFD Coin isn’t your average meme token. It’s a bold, feature-packed project built for those who want more than laughs from their investments. If you’ve ever heard the saying “buy the dip,” that’s exactly what BTFD Coin encourages—seizing opportunity during market chaos. And let’s not forget, the coin’s presale is nothing short of legendary. The presale kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin and has now surged to $0.00013 in Stage 12—that’s an 837.5% ROI. Over $4.3M has been raised, with more than 57 billion coins sold to over 6,300 holders. The best part? Investors who use the BIG50 bonus code can still lock in the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000064. This bonus alone is a game-changer, letting savvy buyers maximise their potential gains. Now, here’s where BTFD Coin really shines. Its beta P2E game went live in Stage 10 of the presale. While rewards aren’t available during the beta phase, players are raving about the experience. The full launch is expected to offer lucrative incentives, making it a win-win for gamers and investors alike. What about staking? BTFD offers a jaw-dropping 90% APY. Staking went live on December 2, allowing holders to earn passive income while holding their tokens. Add to that the Bulls Squad—an exclusive community of top investors—and the referral program that rewards users for bringing in new buyers, and you’ve got a coin that’s built for success. Imagine this: You invest $40,000 at the Stage 12 price of $0.00013 per coin. That nets you over 307 million tokens. When BTFD hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006, your investment will skyrocket to $184,200. That’s the kind of return that turns heads and changes lives. BTFD’s success story is even more remarkable when you think about the global economy. Back in 1973, the world experienced a major financial crash, but those who bought the dips emerged victorious. BTFD Coin is a modern-day opportunity to capitalise on chaos. Head over to the BTFD presale page, connect your wallet, and don’t forget to enter the BIG50 code for a sweet discount. Neiro: The AI-Powered Meme Coin Next up, we’ve got Neiro, a meme coin with an AI twist. Unlike traditional meme tokens that rely solely on community hype, Neiro uses artificial intelligence to add real value. Its standout feature is an AI-powered trading bot that helps users optimize their investments. This isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a legitimate tool gaining popularity among both crypto enthusiasts and casual investors. Neiro’s presale performance has been strong, with significant funds raised so far. The coin is priced at $0.00009, and analysts predict it could reach $0.0005 after launch. While its return on investment potential might not be as dramatic as some other coins, Neiro’s steady growth and innovative features make it an attractive option for those looking for something different in the meme coin market. The community behind Neiro is another key strength. Its Telegram group is active, offering regular updates, AMA sessions, and giveaways. Neiro’s developers have also hinted at potential partnerships with major crypto platforms, which could further elevate its visibility and value. However, Neiro does come with some risks. The integration of AI adds complexity to the project. While it offers additional utility, it might not appeal to those who prefer a simpler, more straightforward investment. But for those open to exploring the intersection of AI and crypto, Neiro presents an intriguing option. Notcoin: The Meme Coin for Minimalists Finally, let’s talk about Notcoin. Its slogan, “It’s not a coin, it’s a movement,” perfectly captures its essence. Notcoin is a satirical take on meme coins, designed to highlight the absurdity of crypto while still offering real value. Its simple, stripped-down approach resonates with minimalists who appreciate its no-frills, no-nonsense vibe. What sets Notcoin apart is its anti-hype strategy. Unlike other coins that rely on flashy marketing and bold promises, Notcoin stays grounded. Its presale performance reflects a steady and modest start, appealing to those who see it as a long-term hold. A standout feature of Notcoin is its “Burn the Hype” initiative. With every transaction, a small percentage of tokens are burned, reducing supply and gradually increasing scarcity. This deflationary model has proven effective in enhancing token value over time. However, Notcoin’s minimalist and ironic approach might not be for everyone. Those seeking excitement, flashy features, or high-stakes drama may find it underwhelming. But for investors who value subtlety, irony, and a slow-and-steady strategy, Notcoin is a unique choice among the latest meme coins to consider this month. How to Buy BTFD Coin with the BIG50 Discount Buying BTFD Coin is simple, and using the BIG50 discount code makes it even better. Start by visiting the official BTFD presale page. Once there, click on “Connect Wallet” and choose your preferred wallet, such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or any other supported option. After connecting your wallet, look for the bonus code field and enter BIG50 to unlock the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000064 per coin. Next, decide how many BTFD coins you want to buy, input the amount, and review the final price. When everything looks good, click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction through your wallet. By using the BIG50 code, you’re not just saving money—you’re also taking advantage of a potentially lucrative opportunity . With the presale already raising over $4.3 million, now is the perfect time to make your move! Bottom Lines Whether you’re into the high-octane world of BTFD Coin, the AI-driven innovation of Neiro, or the minimalist charm of Notcoin, there’s no shortage of exciting opportunities in the meme coin space. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, catering to different investor preferences. But let’s be real—BTFD Coin stands out as the clear frontrunner. Its P2E game, 90% APY staking rewards, and explosive presale performance make it a must-have for anyone looking to turn a profit in 2024. Don’t miss your chance to join the BTFD Coin presale now at a discounted price by using the BIG50 code. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin presale. Connect your wallet, secure your tokens, and watch your investment grow. The clock’s ticking—don’t wait too long to dive in.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 00:44:00

Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 63,400 followers that “altcoin season,” which they say began in late November, could come to an abrupt end after alts witnessed deep pullbacks over the last seven days. According to the Glassnode co-founders, traders and investors will likely have a risk-off approach on altcoins unless Bitcoin recovers a key psychological price point. “Is This the End of Altcoin Season? Bitcoin dominance is surging after dipping below $100,000, while altcoins are losing critical supports. Dominance has risen and resumed its upward trend, signaling a stronger BTC environment. If BTC stabilizes above $100,00, we might see a pump in altcoins now in accumulation zones. Until then, Bitcoin appears poised to lead, leaving altcoins lagging behind.” Source: Negentropic/X The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart tracks how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC. In the current state of the market, a surging BTC.D suggests that altcoins are losing value faster than Bitcoin. At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 59%. Looking at Bitcoin itself, the Glassnode executives say long-term Bitcoin holders are massively unloading their holdings as other investor cohorts pick up the slack. “The Board Keeps Shifting. As BTC continues flowing out of exchanges during this dip, long-term holders are exiting forcefully, while short-term holders step in without hesitation. Whales quietly accumulate, miners remain neutral, and selling pressure has merely reshuffled the board. New hands are absorbing the sales.” Source: Negentropic/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $97,246.

Shiba Inu Whale Activity Rises & Polkadot Price Outlook Looks Positive,https://nulltx.com/final-2-days-of-blockdags-1m-giveaway-shiba-inu-whale-activity-rises-polkadot-price-outlook-looks-positive/,"People generally respond quickly to shifts in the crypto market, either by capitalizing on lower prices or by keeping up with new trends. This quick reaction is shown in the recent increase in Shiba Inu whale activity, with a significant movement of 2.79 trillion SHIB tokens valued at $76.48 million. Similarly, the Polkadot price outlook appears positive, with predictions of an increase to $30 following a breakout from a long-term downtrend. In this context, BlockDAG’s nearly concluded $1 million giveaway is gaining traction, providing an attractive chance for BlockDAG (BDAG) holders. By possessing $100 worth of BDAG, 50 fortunate individuals will win $20,000 each. This event is contributing to the success of BlockDAG’s $170.5 million presale, positioning it among the key crypto coins to watch currently. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Escalates with 2.79T SHIB Transferred Recent figures show a spike in Shiba Inu whale activity, with 2.79 trillion SHIB tokens moved, totaling $76.48 million. This represents a 41.39% rise in substantial transactions, suggesting a heightened interest from significant holders. Despite this increase, the price of SHIB is still struggling, decreasing by 3.49% to $0.00002736 over the last day. The trading volume has also seen a reduction of 18.25%, indicating a drop in overall market participation. Moreover, the token faces hurdles in surpassing a critical resistance level at $0.00003, crucial for any potential price recovery. Without a consistent positive outlook or broader market support, SHIB may face continued challenges. For now, it remains a crypto coin to watch, as its recovery hinges on overcoming these obstacles. Polkadot Price Outlook: Analysts Forecast $30 Polkadot is showing signs of recovery, with forecasts suggesting a possible rise to $30 after emerging from a prolonged bearish phase. This optimistic view follows a 150% surge from a price range of $4–$5, fueled by robust accumulation through its downturn. Yet, challenges remain. The current price is encountering resistance near the $9 mark, and failing to break through this barrier could restrict further advances. Market volatility also poses a risk to maintaining recent gains, casting uncertainty on continued growth. Despite these concerns, the Polkadot price outlook is still tentatively hopeful, with signs of stability as it tests its breakout zone. Final Days to Win Big with BlockDAG’s $1M Event BlockDAG is turning heads in the cryptocurrency market with its $1 million giveaway , where 50 lucky people could each win $20,000. To be eligible, one needs to own at least $100 worth of BDAG. The stakes are higher as participants can increase their chances by engaging in activities like referring friends and promoting the event on social media. With only three days remaining, time is quickly running out to take part in this opportunity. The event has also sparked a lot of interest in BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, which has already gathered a formidable $170.5 million, making it a hot topic in the crypto community. The price of BDAG has skyrocketed by 2240%, starting at $0.001 and reaching $0.0234 in the latest release, batch 26. This sharp increase has drawn significant attention, further enhancing the presale’s success. As the giveaway nears its end, more people are getting involved, seeing the potential for substantial rewards and the rising value of BDAG. With the presale moving swiftly and the $1 million prize drawing attention, BlockDAG’s presence in the market continues to grow. For those interested in joining and possibly winning part of this grand prize, now is the ideal time, especially with BDAG still being quite affordable. However, this opportunity might not last as the current batch is almost sold out, and the next batch will likely see a price hike. Key Crypto Coins to Keep an Eye On With Shiba Inu whale activity intensifying, marked by 2.79 trillion tokens being moved, and the Polkadot price outlook possibly climbing to $30, the crypto market is showing interesting shifts. Yet, BlockDAG stands out with its $1 million giveaway and rapid price increase. This giveaway is a chance for 50 individuals to win $20,000 each by simply holding $100 in BDAG, contributing to both the growth of its presale and increased market interest. With over $170.5 million raised and a remarkable 2240% increase in price, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the top crypto coins to watch now.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 01:40:00

As new technologies and utilities redefine the blockchain landscape, projects like Qubetics, AAVE, and SUI are making waves. Qubetics is rewriting the rules of blockchain innovation, particularly with its $7.5 million presale and groundbreaking features. Meanwhile, AAVE is strengthening its position as a DeFi powerhouse with its recent price surge and ecosystem developments. At the same time, SUI is capturing attention by integrating Bitcoin functionality into its network, enhancing its appeal to developers and investors alike. With each project bringing something unique to the table, let’s explore why they’re the best altcoins to invest in now. Qubetics: Driving Innovation in Blockchain Technology Qubetics is a blockchain ecosystem designed to simplify and expand blockchain adoption. By tackling critical challenges like scalability, interoperability, and asset tokenisation, Qubetics is creating a comprehensive platform for businesses, developers, and everyday users. The $7M Presale Success The numbers speak for themselves. Currently in its 13th stage, the Qubetics presale has raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and on boarded over 11,300 holders. At $0.0342 per token, there’s a limited window to invest before the next 10% price hike this weekend. Analysts are optimistic about $TICS’ trajectory, predicting a price of $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 630% ROI. Post-presale, the token is expected to hit $1, representing a 2,820% ROI, with projections of $15 after the mainnet launch—a jaw-dropping 43,711% ROI. For a $7,000 investment, this means potential returns of $50,732 at $0.25, $204,800 at $1, and a life-changing $3,072,000 at $15. The Power of QubeQode IDE The QubeQode IDE is a standout feature that simplifies blockchain development. Traditionally, creating smart contracts or decentralised applications required extensive programming skills. With QubeQode, developers of all levels can easily create, deploy, and manage their blockchain projects. Imagine a fintech startup automating cross-border payments or an artist tokenising their digital art collection—both without hiring a team of blockchain developers. QubeQode IDE is removing barriers and enabling more industries to embrace blockchain technology. Multi-Chain Wallet: Simplifying Digital Asset Management Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet is another game-changer. This feature allows users to manage multiple cryptocurrencies across different blockchains seamlessly. For businesses, this eliminates the inefficiencies of juggling various wallets and platforms. A freelancer working with global clients could invoice Ethereum, Bitcoin, or stablecoins, all while maintaining one central wallet. This innovation not only makes digital asset management simpler but also more secure and user-friendly, appealing to both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and new users. Real World Asset Tokenisation Tokenising real-world assets is at the heart of Qubetics’ vision. By converting tangible assets like real estate, intellectual property, or commodities into digital tokens, Qubetics is opening up new investment opportunities and improving liquidity. Consider a real estate developer looking to raise funds by tokenising a luxury apartment complex. Investors from around the world can now own fractional shares, enabling small-scale investors to participate in markets traditionally reserved for the wealthy. Qubetics is not just making investment more inclusive; it’s revolutionising asset ownership. AAVE: The DeFi Giant Nears $400 AAVE has long been a cornerstone of decentralised finance (DeFi), offering users a platform to lend, borrow, and earn interest on digital assets. Its adaptability and continuous innovation make it a mainstay in the crypto ecosystem. Recently, AAVE’s price has surged to nearly $400, representing a 420% increase from its April low. This bullish trend is supported by a rise in active addresses and strong on-chain metrics, reflecting heightened interest in the protocol. Beyond its price performance, AAVE’s utility in DeFi is unparalleled. Developers are leveraging AAVE’s flash loans for complex financial transactions, while users benefit from its flexible lending and borrowing options. As AAVE continues to evolve, it remains one of the best altcoins to invest in now. SUI: Bridging Bitcoin and DeFi SUI is quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with in the crypto world. Its recent integration of SatLayer brings Bitcoin functionality to the SUI network, allowing developers to secure decentralised applications with Bitcoin. The SUI ecosystem is thriving, with decentralised exchange volume exceeding $466 million in a single day. While a recent network outage temporarily affected its performance, SUI’s market cap has climbed to $2.73 billion, making it the 55th-largest cryptocurrency. By bridging the gap between Bitcoin and modern blockchain applications, SUI is positioning itself as one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Its focus on innovation and user engagement ensures its long-term relevance in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Take Away AAVE and SUI are undoubtedly impressive, each excelling in their respective niches. AAVE’s dominance in DeFi and SUI’s bold integration of Bitcoin functionality make them essential components of a diversified crypto portfolio. However, Qubetics is the project redefining what blockchain technology can achieve. With its $7 million presale success, innovative features like the Multi-Chain Wallet, and groundbreaking focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation, Qubetics is setting a new standard for the industry. The opportunity is now. Visit Qubetics’ presale page to secure your $TICS tokens before the price hike. As one of the best altcoins to invest in now, Qubetics isn’t just a cryptocurrency—it’s the future of blockchain innovation.

While seasoned investors are locking in gains, newcomers are looking for projects with explosive potential. The market is teeming with opportunities, and three projects stand out for their innovation, utility, and investment potential: Qubetics, Algorand, and SEI. Qubetics, a rising star in the blockchain world, is rewriting the rules of crypto presales with its $7 million success. Meanwhile, Algorand is scaling new heights with its robust blockchain architecture, and SEI is turning heads with its meteoric rise in market value. Each project offers a unique value proposition, making them some of the best altcoins to invest in December 2024. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is not just a blockchain platform; it’s an innovation powerhouse aimed at simplifying blockchain adoption for developers and businesses. With its user-friendly tools like the QubeQode IDE, Qubetics is removing the complexity of blockchain development and making it accessible to everyone. Qubetics is a ground-breaking Layer 1, Web3 aggregated blockchain. The Qubetics presale , now in its 13th stage, has already raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and attracted over 11,300 token holders. At $0.0342 per token, investors have limited time before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. Analysts are optimistic, predicting $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 630% ROI. Post-presale, forecasts suggest the token could hit $1 for a 2,820% ROI, with the potential to soar to $15 after the mainnet launch—a staggering 43,711% ROI. If you invested $6,000 today, your returns could grow to $43,841 at $0.25, $175,365 at $1, and an incredible $2,630,475 at $15. The QubeQode IDE is one of Qubetics’ standout features . This integrated development environment allows businesses and developers to create smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) without extensive coding expertise. Imagine a small business automating supply chain payments or a legal firm developing tamper-proof contracts—all without hiring expensive blockchain developers. The QubeQode IDE is democratising blockchain technology, making it one of the best altcoins to invest in December 2024. Algorand: A Blockchain for the Future Algorand has solidified its position as one of the most scalable and secure Layer-1 blockchains. Known for its innovative Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, Algorand offers unparalleled speed, security, and decentralisation. Its ecosystem supports everything from DeFi platforms to tokenised assets, making it a versatile player in the crypto space. Recently, Algorand has experienced a significant price surge, reaching levels not seen in over two years. This growth is underpinned by robust on-chain metrics, including increased Open Interest (OI) and Total Value Locked (TVL), reflecting strong investor confidence. Algorand’s focus on providing enterprise-grade solutions has attracted partnerships and use cases across various industries, from finance to supply chain management. Imagine a financial institution using Algorand to settle cross-border payments in seconds or a healthcare provider ensuring patient data security with blockchain-backed systems. Algorand’s versatility and reliability make it a go-to option for businesses and developers, earning it a spot as one of the best altcoins to invest in December 2024. SEI: The New Contender on the Block SEI is making waves as one of the fastest-growing altcoins in the market. With its focus on providing a decentralised and scalable ecosystem, SEI is quickly climbing the ranks of notable cryptocurrencies. Its recent performance, including a doubling of value in November, showcases its potential to deliver massive returns. SEI’s market capitalisation has reached approximately $2.73 billion, making it the 55th-largest cryptocurrency. Analysts believe SEI could hit the $1 mark in 2024, especially as the altcoin market continues to rise. Its growth trajectory is bolstered by increasing adoption and a supportive community, making it an attractive investment option. SEI’s use cases range from decentralised trading platforms to scalable dApps, catering to both retail and institutional users. For example, a decentralised exchange built on SEI could offer lightning-fast transaction speeds and reduced fees, appealing to traders worldwide. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Algorand and SEI are undoubtedly strong contenders in the cryptocurrency market, each excelling in their respective niches. Algorand’s focus on scalability and enterprise solutions makes it a cornerstone for blockchain innovation, while SEI’s rapid ascent showcases its potential to disrupt the market. However, Qubetics is the project that truly stands out. Its $7 million presale, combined with tools like the QubeQode IDE and groundbreaking Real World Asset Tokenisation, positions it as a leader in blockchain innovation. Whether you’re a developer, a business owner, or an investor, Qubetics offers something for everyone. The time to act is now.

Why Qubetics Is December 2024’s Most Promising Crypto Investment,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-thetas-early-days-why-qubetics-is-december-2024s-most-promising-crypto-investment/,"Ever kick yourself for not jumping on Theta’s bandwagon back in the day?

Qubetics is stepping up to tackle these issues head-on. With its multi-chain wallet and real-world payment integrations, it’s aiming to make crypto as easy to use as your everyday cash. Imagine paying for your morning coffee with crypto without breaking a sweat. That’s the kind of real-world problem Qubetics is looking to solve.

Theta’s Journey from ICO to Today Theta’s story is one for the books. Back in January 2018, it launched its ICO with tokens priced at a mere $0.15. Fast forward to its peak on April 16, 2021, and Theta hit an all-time high of $15.72. That’s a jaw-dropping increase, turning a modest investment into a small fortune. citeturn0search8 Today, Theta is trading at around $2.28, which, despite being below its peak, still represents a significant gain from its ICO days. Early investors who held onto their tokens have seen substantial returns, showcasing the potential rewards of getting in on the ground floor of a promising project. Theta’s success wasn’t just about luck; it tapped into the booming demand for decentralized video streaming, offering a solution that resonated with both users and investors. Its journey from a $0.15 ICO to a multi-dollar valuation underscores the impact that innovative blockchain projects can have in the market.

Enter aelf , an AI-enhanced layer 1 blockchain with a knack for solving complex problems with simplicity. Their latest development, aevatar Intelligence , aims to turn AI development on its head. aevatar Intelligence Imagine creating intelligent AI agents—capable of functioning across platforms and blockchains—without writing a single line of code. That’s the promise of aevatar intelligence, a cloud-native AI agent framework built for everyone, from beginners to seasoned developers. And here’s the kicker: it will be open-source. The Vision Behind aevatar Intelligence At the heart of aevatar intelligence lies aelf’s commitment to breaking down barriers. AI and blockchain technology are often seen as two separate realms, each with its own steep learning curve. But aelf believes the magic happens when you bring the two together—and make it accessible to everyone. “aevatar intelligence represents a turning point in the integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies for aelf,” said Brian Liang, COO of aelf. “In developing this framework, we set out a mission to eliminate complexity, unite ecosystems, and make AI accessible to everyone. Launching aevatar intelligence will transform how AI agents work and interact with each other, and unlock new opportunities on the Web3 frontier.” And it’s not just talk. The framework is powered by multiple large-language models (LLMs), giving users access to both general-purpose AI and niche models tailored to specific industries. Whether you’re in asset management, gaming, or decentralized trading, aevatar intelligence has you covered. Building AI Agents with No Limits (and No Code) So how does it work? aevatar intelligence lets users create and deploy AI agents without needing to dive into complicated code.

The Frax improvement proposal is undergoing a governance process; should it pass, BUIDL will be part of Frax. Securitize is the brokerage firm for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund and its BUIDL token. The firm developed the Frax Finance governance proposal. Part of the proposal mentions. “In addition to providing Frax USD utility, relative safety, and convenience, Frax USD can significantly reduce counterparty risk for its reserves by working with BlackRock.” Although the proposal must undergo a community vote, the prospects are good for BUIDL. The proposal has received public support, with one response from alexd3366 reading: I wholeheartedly support this proposal! As a proud investor and big believer in the project’s potential, I’ve witnessed the dedication and expertise that’s gone into shaping this initiative. ~ alexd336 6 BlackRock’s BUIDL is making a niche in the collateral market The Frax stablecoin proposal is not the first for BUIDL. If it goes through, it will join other stablecoins, including Ethena’s USDtb, which works with BUIDL token as a collateral asset. BUIDL has over $530 million worth of assets under management, most in short-term US treasury bills. Securize made the strategic move as Frax’s team is exploring rebranding its core stablecoin to Frax USD (frxUSD). The plans for rebranding are described in another governance proposal , which also talks of introducing Staked Frax USD (sfrxUSD) as a yield-bearing counterpart. The proposal clarifies that the frxUSD token will facilitate direct conversions into fiat currency while working with Paxos. New mint-redeem system, motivation for approval Frax Finance has put in place a new mint-redeem system, known as enshrined custodians, to accompany the stablecoin launch. Through the mint-redeem system, users will have mint-redeem rights to frxUSD if governance allows their assets to back the frxUSD. If BlacRock’s proposal wins, any authentic user can mint 1 BUIDL and send it to the on-chain custodian to receive a frxUSD. While BlackRock’s proposal receives a fair share of public support, it isn’t the only one that can authorize a proposal. Superstate, a competing tokenized fund platform, submitted two governance proposals . If their proposal is passed, frxUSD will adopt its USTB Treasury bills and USCC crypto-carry fund to support the stablecoin. Superstate’s proposals call on Frax to allocate up to $20 million to its USCC fund and up to $100 million to its USTB fund.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

Early awareness of key developments, such as technical updates, strategic partnerships, and ecosystem expansions, can lead to significant returns. One exciting opportunity to keep on your radar is the Lightchain AI Presale , a promising project combining AI integration and blockchain technology. Instead of reacting to price surges after the news breaks, savvy investors focus on projects with strong roadmaps and impactful milestones. From advanced privacy features to enhanced cross-chain functionality, these innovations have the potential to bring undervalued tokens into the spotlight. Below, we explore a few emerging cryptos that could see substantial price growth in the near future, helping you capitalize on these opportunities. Manta Network (MANTA) Privacy Upgrades Fueling DeFi Innovation As secrecy gets more and more key for both big groups and small buyers in crypto, Manta Network shines as a chief in the area. Its privacy-centered DeFi tools, driven by zero-knowledge proof, make sure that user data and plans stay secret. Manta is growing its system by joining with different DeFi platforms, decentralized ex͏change (DEX), and lending rules. These partnerships aim to widen the network’s scope enabling private and safe deals across many platforms. Also, Manta is improving its secrecy traits with the creation of Universal Circuits 2.0 which will give builders a library of ready-made zero-knowledge circuits making it easier to add privacy traits into current apps. With rules checks growing, secrecy answers like Manta are becoming more key. These updates could bring in funds looking for safe DeFi choices possibly raising MANTA’s token cost. Injective (INJ) Cross-Chain Growth and Beyond Injective is making waves with its focus on cross-chain interoperability, enabling seamless asset transfers and trading. By providing traders with access to multiple blockchains without the need to navigate separate platforms, Injective saves time and reduces complexity. The network is integrating Layer 2 solutions to improve transaction speeds and lower costs, with a notable collaboration with Arbitrum to build interoperable EVM infrastructure for cross-chain compatibility. Injective’s ecosystem is also growing with the addition of new decentralized applications (dApps), such as Helix, which offers Trading Bots and Pre-Launch Futures, and Neptune Finance with its peer-to-peer lending testnet. These developments enhance the utility of the INJ token and drive ecosystem growth. Interoperability remains a top priority for developers and traders alike, and advancements in this area significantly boost INJ’s market appeal. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Merging AI with Blockchain for Real-World Impact Lightchain AI (LCAI) combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, creating a platform designed to support AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism allow developers to build solutions that address real-world challenges in industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. The roadmap for LCAI includes a Testnet Rollout in December 2024 and a Mainnet Launch in January 2025, critical milestones for validating the platform’s technology and driving interest from developers and investors. Strategic partnerships with AI developers , enterprises, and other blockchain platforms aim to drive adoption and integrate AI across various sectors. With a presale price of just $0.003 and significant near-term milestones, LCAI’s technological advancements position it for rapid growth. Casper (CSPR) Enterprise-Grade Improvements and Upgrades Casper is designed for enterprise-grade scalability, adaptability, and upgradability, making it particularly attractive to businesses seeking reliable blockchain solutions. With a focus on predictable performance, Casper is well-suited for professional environments hesitant to adopt less proven blockchains. The network is refining its protocol efficiency and actively engaging with corporate clients, with each successful integration potentially increasing demand for the CSPR token. Additionally, Casper is introducing developer-friendly tools to streamline building on its platform, encouraging ecosystem growth and long-term token appreciation. As the corporate world gradually embraces blockchain technology, Casper’s advancements strengthen its reputation as a reliable solution for professional-grade applications, paving the way for steady token price improvements. Why Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale Stands Out as an Opportunity The Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale is generating significant buzz in the crypto community, positioning itself as a standout opportunity for early investors. Leveraging cutting-edge AI-powered blockchain solutions, LCAI aims to redefine efficiency and scalability in decentralized ecosystems. Priced at an accessible $0.003, the presale offers investors an entry point into a project that combines innovative technology with practical use cases across industries. What sets LCAI apart is its focus on ultra-fast transaction speeds and energy-efficient operations, appealing to both developers and eco-conscious investors. The ongoing presale provides a chance to capitalize on a promising project before potential market surges. For those seeking a blend of technological innovation and financial potential, the LCAI presale at Lightchain.ai offers a unique opportunity to secure a foothold in the future of blockchain technology.

In today’s market, savvy investors are no longer asking if crypto is worth the leap but rather, which coins are worth their money this week ? If you’re on the hunt for the best coins to invest in this week, the crypto scene has three standouts: Qubetics (TICS ), Polygon, and Algorand. These projects have earned their stripes in different ways, and they’re reshaping what financial independence and decentralised tech really mean. The crypto world is buzzing right now, and one name that keeps popping up in conversations is Qubetics (TICS). From its innovative Decentralized VPN technology to an insane presale run with record-breaking numbers, Qubetics is emerging as the next big thing. And while Polygon and Algorand have their own claim to fame, Qubetics seems to be taking centre stage, especially for those looking for high-growth potential in their crypto portfolios. But what makes these projects shine? Why are analysts and crypto enthusiasts dubbing them the best coins to invest in this week? Let’s dive in. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Kid with a Decentralised VPN Revolution If you’ve been tracking crypto presales, you’ve already heard about Qubetics. It’s smashing milestones faster than a meme coin goes viral, and the numbers don’t lie. Currently in its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 367 million $TICS tokens to more than 11,300 holders, raising a whopping $7.5 million so far. At $0.0342 per token, it’s still affordable, but here’s the kicker: the price is set to jump by 10% this weekend. Now, the big question: Why all the hype around Qubetics?The excitement surrounding Qubetics stems from its innovative approach to online privacy through its decentralized VPN technology. Unlike traditional VPNs that depend on centralized servers, which can be unreliable and untrustworthy, Qubetics leverages blockchain to enhance security, privacy, and efficiency. This decentralized model distributes the workload across thousands of nodes, making it nearly impossible for hackers or governments to monitor users’ online activities. For businesses, this means secure exchanges of sensitive data within remote teams, ensuring that company secrets remain confidential. Professionals, particularly digital nomads, can access geo-restricted content and use public Wi-Fi without worrying about security breaches. Individuals benefit from enhanced privacy while shopping or streaming, knowing their data is protected. Additionally, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN is more cost-effective than many leading VPN services. Analysts are optimistic about Qubetics, forecasting significant returns for investors. Predictions suggest that by the end of the presale, the price of $TICS could reach $0.25, offering a 630% return on investment (ROI). Following the presale, projections rise to $1, translating to a staggering 2,820% ROI. Long-term estimates post-mainnet launch indicate a price range of $5 to $15, with potential ROIs soaring to an astonishing 43,711%.If you invested $20,000 at today’s presale price of $0.0342, you’d snag roughly 584,795 tokens . By the time $TICS reaches $15, your $20k would balloon to $8.77 million . Unreal, right? Polygon: The Layer-2 Darling with Real-World Utility Polygon has cemented itself as a household name in the crypto world. Known for its scalability solutions, it acts as a Layer-2 protocol for Ethereum, reducing transaction fees and increasing processing speeds. If Ethereum is the highway, Polygon is the express lane that keeps traffic flowing smoothly. What makes Polygon one of the best coins to invest in this week is its real-world application. Major brands like Reddit and Starbucks have integrated Polygon into their ecosystems, showing the crypto world that scalability is key to mass adoption. Polygon is beloved by developers and investors alike because it bridges the gap between Ethereum’s decentralised power and user-friendly performance. With big players like Disney joining its Web3 accelerator programme, Polygon’s reputation continues to skyrocket. Let’s not forget its NFT and gaming roots. From powering decentralised marketplaces to enabling metaverse platforms, Polygon is setting the stage for the future of crypto-based economies. While it’s not riding the presale wave like Qubetics, Polygon’s steady growth makes it a safe bet for those who prefer a less volatile investment. Its native token, MATIC, is still a favourite among long-term investors, offering both stability and potential upside. Algorand: The Green Blockchain If crypto were a high school, Algorand would be the eco-friendly, straight-A student. Known for its carbon-neutral blockchain, Algorand has been championing sustainability long before it was cool. Algorand isn’t just green; it’s wicked fast and incredibly secure. Its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) mechanism eliminates the energy-guzzling processes of traditional blockchains. That makes it a darling for ESG-conscious investors. It’s also carving out a niche in decentralised finance (DeFi). With partnerships ranging from central banks to cutting-edge startups, Algorand is proving that you can be sustainable and scalable at the same time. Absolutely. While its gains might not be as explosive as Qubetics’ presale predictions, Algorand offers a reliable option for those looking to balance risk and reward. Why These Three Coins Dominate the Week Whether it’s Qubetics with its game-changing decentralised VPN tech, Polygon’s scalability solutions, or Algorand’s green innovations, these projects represent the best of what crypto has to offer right now. Looking to make a move? Don’t sleep on Qubetics. With its presale heating up and token prices poised to rise soon, this is your chance to get in before the wave.

The price is trading below $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,420 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

While Dogecoin continues to hold its ground as a classic in the meme coin universe, BTFD Coin has stolen the spotlight with a jaw-dropping presale performance. In its first month, it raised over $4.3 million and captured the attention of over 6,300 holders. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin is carving its niche by combining gaming with blockchain technology, taking meme coin innovation to uncharted territories. Meme coins have always been about more than laughs—they’re a cultural phenomenon. Ever since Dogecoin’s meteoric rise, they’ve turned casual investors into millionaires and transformed internet humour into hard cash. Over time, these quirky tokens have evolved into powerful financial assets. Leading the pack now is BTFD Coin, a project that combines entertainment, utility, and massive return potential with its play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and referral program. With a thriving community rallying behind it, BTFD is shaping up to be the next big thing in the meme coin universe. Buy The Dip Now There’s never been a better time to invest in innovative projects like these. History has shown that economic downturns can create incredible opportunities for those who take bold steps. During the global crash of 1973, savvy investors turned financial chaos into life-changing wealth. Today, BTFD—short for “Buy The F***ing Dip”—is urging investors to do just that. With its presale in Stage 12 at $0.000064 per coin, BTFD is an unmissable opportunity to get in early on a project with analysts predicting exponential growth. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin with Real Utility BTFD Coin has been making waves for all the right reasons. Its presale success is staggering, with over $4.3 million raised and 57 billion coins sold to more than 6,300 holders. Currently priced at $0.000064 in Stage 12, BTFD offers an 837.5% ROI opportunity when it lists at $0.0006 after the presale. What makes it stand out isn’t just its financial promise—it’s the ecosystem behind it. Unlike other meme coins, $BTFD is more than hype. It brings a robust platform that combines fun and functionality. The P2E game isn’t just a gimmick; it’s an immersive experience where players can earn rewards while enjoying the gameplay. Staking rewards add a layer of incentive for long-term holders, while the referral program strengthens community ties by rewarding participants for spreading the word. The numbers speak volumes. Imagine investing $50,000 at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. That would bag you 781,250,000 BTFD Coins. By the time the coin lists at $0.0006, that investment would skyrocket to $468,750. With only a few stages left in the 16-stage presale, the window to secure such returns is closing fast. Dogecoin: The OG of Meme Coins Dogecoin has always been the king of meme coins, and for good reason. Born as a joke in 2013, it grew into a cultural icon that turned “Doge” the Shiba Inu into a global sensation. While its journey has had ups and downs, Dogecoin remains a reliable name in the crypto world, backed by an active community and widespread recognition. Dogecoin’s strength lies in its simplicity and popularity. It’s the coin that introduced millions to cryptocurrency, proving that investing can be fun and accessible. Over the years, it has gained endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, which have kept its momentum alive. But Dogecoin’s appeal isn’t just about nostalgia—it’s about consistency. It continues to serve as a gateway for new investors and a favourite among seasoned traders. However, compared to newer projects like BTFD Coin, Dogecoin lacks the cutting-edge features that today’s investors crave. It doesn’t have a P2E game, staking rewards, or referral programs, which are becoming the norm in the meme coin ecosystem. While Dogecoin remains a solid choice for stability, those looking for massive return potential may find newer coins more appealing. Pepe Coin: Where Gaming Meets Blockchain Pepe Coin is redefining what a meme coin can be by bridging the gap between gaming and blockchain technology. Inspired by the internet’s beloved Pepe the Frog, this project taps into nostalgia while offering something fresh—a gaming platform that allows players to earn rewards in crypto. It’s like combining your favourite pastime with an investment opportunity, and who wouldn’t want that? What makes Pepe Coin unique is its focus on community-driven gameplay. Players can compete, earn, and trade assets, all while being part of a vibrant and passionate community. The integration of blockchain ensures transparency and fairness, giving players confidence in their rewards. It’s a bold move that positions Pepe Coin as a serious contender in the meme coin space. While Pepe Coin is still finding its footing, its innovative approach to gaming has captured the imagination of investors and gamers alike. It’s a riskier bet compared to established names like Dogecoin or promising projects like BTFD Coin, but the potential upside is huge. If you’re someone who loves gaming and crypto, Pepe Coin might just hit the sweet spot.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-23 03:50:00

Following this acquisition, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings have now reached 1,761.98 BTC. The average purchase price for the latest transaction was 15,330,073 yen per Bitcoin. With this move, Metaplanet’s total investment in Bitcoin now amounts to 20.872 billion yen, with an average purchase price of 11,846,002 yen per Bitcoin. This move further strengthens Metaplanet’s position as a major player in the cryptocurrency space. Metaplanet said that the Company has strategically grown its total Bitcoin holdings through capital market activities and purchases funded by operating revenues. Metaplanet took to its official X handle and shared a statement regarding the recent purchase. They also addressed recent speculations regarding its Bitcoin Treasury business. The company clarified that it has not issued convertible bonds in connection with its Bitcoin holdings. However, Metaplanet added that, as outlined in its “Notice Regarding the Launch of the Bitcoin Treasury Business” dated December 18, 2024, the firm may consider using bonds convertible into common stock as part of its fundraising strategy in the future. メタプラネットが追加で619.70ビットコインを購入。 pic.twitter.com/xgatgn6YzJ — Metaplanet Inc.

The company believes that using BTC Yield as a KPI will provide investors with greater transparency regarding its decision to finance Bitcoin purchases through issuing additional common stock or convertible instruments. “We intend to measure the performance of our strategy to acquire Bitcoin in a manner that we believe will benefit our shareholders,” the statement read. Metaplanet has been compared to MicroStrategy due to its frequent Bitcoin purchases.

Major world powers and politicians may be investing and holding BTC, but bitcoin cash is aiming to expand and follow through on Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision: money for anyone, able to scale and work for low fees. While Blackrock bros continue to toot their Trump-ets about a compromised, NGU coin, and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor unbelievably posts vids that say there’s “no guarantee” bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap won’t be changed (destroying the currency’s soundness), development on BCH pushes forward in determined, relative silence — but not without enthusiasm. After all, permissionless money for the world is just as exciting as when Satoshi Nakamoto initially floated the radical idea back in 2008. And let’s make no mistake: it’s always been about payments , whether one likes it or not. And that fact has, of course, resulted in a historical schism in the Bitcoin community, and created a hard fork. On one side, the Saylor/Blackrock camp saying Bitcoin is not a currency but just a kind of digital property, and on the other, those that understand the whitepaper. A tweet from X user Unstoppable Cash citing the Bitcoin whitepaper. Still, even for those on board with the purely peer-to-peer (P2P) version of electronic cash that doesn’t require any financial institution, 2nd layer network, or deep pockets for heavenly fees , keeping up with bitcoin cash upgrades that have preserved the pseudonymous Nakamoto’s vision can be tough, especially in an online sea of grift-y, Kiyosaki fear-mongering posts and internet trolls trying to mock anyone who still wants to actually buy something with the stuff. Not everyone is in the market for a Lambo, by the way, or is transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars overseas. Some folks can barely afford shoes, and Bitcoin was supposed to be about helping them as well. Some folks want to buy a coffee, a beer, or a new winter jacket with crypto. Minisatoshi’s Upgrade History and Fork Map Luckily, BCH community member minisatoshi has an excellent resource at the ready for anyone who wants to follow the history of bitcoin cash upgrades. And that’s not all — there’s also an epic and fairly exhaustive BTC fork chart for crypto historians comparing BTC to BCH. Minisatoshi’s timeline starts with Bitcoin’s Genesis Block and goes from there, right up to the present era. So whether one is a fan of BCH, an absolute hater, or anything in between, minisatoshi’s resources provide a unique glimpse into the trajectory of the most groundbreaking economic concept to emerge in modern history. The Bitcoin Cash upgrade timeline was released relatively recently and comes ahead of the approaching May 2025 upgrade for the network, which will bring the “VM Limits” and “BigInts” changes that aim to streamline and enhance BCH’s relatively new UTXO (unspent transaction output) smart contract capabilities.

ATH Push Heats Up While Uniswap Faces Fresh Rivalry,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bnb-to-close-2024-strong/,"BNB to Close 2024 Strong? ATH Push Heats Up While Uniswap Faces Fresh Rivalry BNB and Uniswap have turned in scintillating gains in December—but both have cooled off in a big way as December comes to an end. Nevertheless, their respective December runs have been nothing short of a success after a new BNB ATH was minted at $793 and Uniswap price action resulted in a solid 32% gain in the past month. However, the smart money is already on to the next big crypto—and they’re buying in big to the best presale left on the board this year with the launch of cross-chain DeFi protocol Lunex Network . Here’s why. Cross-chain DeFi protocol Lunex offering big-time gains in 2025 The future of crypto is multi-chain. And one new presale investment opportunity offers way better upside than BNB and Uniswap—even with new BNB ATH and strong Uniswap price action. Low caps, after all, offer significantly greater potential to skyrocket in value than big caps—and that’s exactly what newcomer cross-chain DeFi protocol Lunex Network brings to the table with its presale. Lunex enables users to seamlessly bridge, sell, and swap over 50,000 trading pairs across 40 blockchains, simplifying the user experience across the board with its hybrid model. Through its Lunex Wallet, users can conduct complex trades while maintaining complete control of their digital assets without having to connect to third-party apps that expose their digital assets to fraud. Lunex users will be able to leverage its self-custodial wallet for the most economical cross-chain swaps through its liquidity aggregator partners, while its native token $LNEX can be staked directly through the self-custodial wallet for passive income. Given its ability to onboard new users into the DeFi fold, $LNEX could be in for a major pump. That makes its presale launch one of the best investment opportunities as the year draws to an end. New BNB ATH and robust Uniswap price action hints at strong finish Not too long ago, BNB holders were ecstatic after a new BNB ATH of $793 was hit at the beginning of December. But the BNB ATH train hasn’t stopped yet. Even as prices have come back down to earth at the $680 range, the Binance-adjacent L1 protocol is still up 4% on the month. It was all just a matter of time before traders cashed in on the BNB ATH. On-chain volume suggests another strong finish for BNB to close out the year. Nothing ever goes up in a straight line forever, but a BNB ATH retest is most definitely well within the cards in 2025. Uniswap price has followed the same trajectory. Uniswap notably pumped hard throughout November and December, with Uniswap prices following Ethereum’s rise to $4000. As Ethereum pulled back to $3300, so has Uniswap. Uniswap is down 32.5% in the third week of December, trading at the $11 range. If Ethereum pumps and retests its ATH in 2025, holders can expect Uniswap to pump along with it. Conclusion BNB and Uniswap have pumped in 2024, and traders have already taken profit. While a strong finish could still be in the cards, the risk to reward ratio isn’t worth it. The smart money is favoring new crypto projects that haven’t mooned yet—making Lunex an infinitely superior investment prospect for investors looking for real gains in 2025.

The price is consolidating and might struggle to start a fresh increase above the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP price struggled to clear the $2.40 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.25 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it stays below the $2.30 resistance. XRP Price Faces Resistance At $2.40 XRP price started a fresh increase from the $2.00 support level, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . However, the bears were active near the $2.38 and $2.40 levels. A high was formed at $2.38 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $2.30 and $2.25 levels. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.955 swing low to the $2.383 high. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.25 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.25 level. The next resistance is $2.30. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance or even $2.550 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.620. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $2.25 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.12 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.955 swing low to the $2.383 high. The next major support is near the $2.050 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.050 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.00 support. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.
