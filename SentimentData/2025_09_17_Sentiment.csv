The $4 trillion digital asset space has grown little over the last few months, although the original crypto Bitcoin did hit a record peak of $124,128 last month. Beyond Bitcoin, major capital inflows are finding their way into both blue-chip altcoins and the best meme coins . Numerous projects have marked fresh all-time highs over the past year, showing the growing enthusiasm surrounding the sector. Adding momentum to this sentiment are two pivotal moves from Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, America’s inaugural comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins. Second, the SEC announced Project Crypto, a program aimed at updating and clarifying the application of securities laws to the digital asset industry. With confidence in the market climbing, let’s take a closer look at how the best altcoins like XRP, Cardano, and Shiba Inu could be positioning themselves for further gains. Ripple ($XRP): The Cross-Border Payments Leader and Best Performer among Altcoins in 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) hit a new peak of $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act became law, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40. It has since pulled back to about $3.05, down roughly 16% from that high. The appeal of XRP lies in its speed and affordability for cross-border transfers, often bypassing legacy payment systems like SWIFT. Its legitimacy is bolstered by endorsements from global bodies such as the UN Capital Development Fund and even acknowledgment from the White House. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also took part in a high-level presidential roundtable on crypto earlier this year. XRP gained renewed momentum in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled its retail sales were not securities violations, effectively ending a prolonged clash with the SEC. Over the past year, XRP has surged 429%, leaving Bitcoin’s 96% gains trailing behind. A mid-July breakout has kept the token around the psychologically significant $3 support level. While prices have dipped here and there, XRP has remained relatively stable throughout adverse market movements. With a relative strength index (RSI) around 54, the token is showing neutral momentum, suggesting traders are cautiously reentering following a temporary scare from softer U.S. inflation numbers. In mid-November, the US SEC will deliver verdicts on whether spot XRP ETFs will be approved for trading. If the verdicts are possible, we may see new momentum that could carry XRP to $4 or higher that same month. Cardano ($ADA): Eco-Friendly Ethereum Rival Prepping for 2026 Run-Up Cardano ($ADA) has ranked as one of the best altcoins for many years, and 2025 is no different. In the past 365 days, ADA climbed 159%, outpacing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Created in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is a smart contract platform that emphasizes sustainability through its Proof-of-Stake model and an academic, peer-reviewed development process, both of which later influenced Ethereum’s own direction. Currently valued at over $39.1 billion, ADA would need to triple its market cap to match Solana and begin challenging Ethereum for the number-two spot. ADA is trading at about $0.8701, reflecting a 1.1% rise over the last day, falling just short of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which rose 2.2% and 3.6% respectively. However, positive political and macroeconomic catalysts could push ADA toward $1.50 by autumn and potentially set the stage to retest its all-time high of $3.09 by year-end, a 255% increase from current levels. From a technical standpoint, ADA formed a bullish flag between December and March, hinting at more upside. Its RSI is downtrending from 52, which indicates its price is consolidating around current levels, with plenty of headroom for further growth in the near term. For now, resistance is near $1.15, while support remains firm around $0.85–$0.90. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Dogecoin Challenger with Real-World Utility and Huge Upside Potential Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in August 2020, has solidified its role as the second-largest meme coin, boasting a market cap of over $7.7 billion. In the past 24 hours, SHIB remains virtually unchanged despite a 4% drop on average across crypto’s $86.2 billion meme coin sector. Considering the fact that the collective $4.11 trillion crypto market actually grew 0.5% overnight, this is a strong signal that Shiba Inu is behaving more like a regular cryptocurrency. HIB currently trades around $0.00001311. Chart analysis points to possible further gains. In the past year, SHIB has shown two bullish formations: a descending wedge pattern from November through March and a flag formation emerging since mid-May. If SHIB breaks its primary resistance at $0.000022, a strong market rally could put it somewhere around $0.00003 before October ends. In a bull market, forecasts suggest a move between $0.00006 and $0.00009 by year’s end. Unlike most meme coins, SHIB offers tangible use cases through enhanced privacy features and Shibarium, its Ethereum-based Layer-2 scaling solution that lowers transaction fees and improves speed. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): First Bitcoin Layer 2 and One of 2025’s Hottest Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one of this year’s most talked-about presales, aiming to become the first Bitcoin Layer 2 that blends viral meme culture with scalability and community-driven development. The project’s goal is to enhance Bitcoin with faster transactions, smart contract capability, and community governance. So far, the presale has raised more than $16.2 million, with experts predicting potential post-launch gains exceeding 10×. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER supports ultra-fast smart contracts while keeping costs minimal. Its standout feature, the Canonical Bridge, enables near-instant BTC transfers while supporting dApps, meme tokens, and low-fee payments. A Coinsult audit confirmed the platform is free of vulnerabilities, further boosting confidence. The $HYPER token powers staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early presale participants can earn staking rewards of up to 70% APY, along with voting rights on future ecosystem updates.

51843473,https://cryptonews.com/?p=423782,1758061800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51843473.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 16 September – XRP, Solana, Pepe",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-16-september-xrp-solana-pepe/,"Major tokens have mounted a modest recovery today, with the crypto price prediction for XRP, Solana, and Pepe improving as we get closer to the FOMC’s much-anticipated meeting this week . The crypto market as a whole has seen its total cap rise by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, reaching $4.11 trillion as investors become more bullish in anticipation of a likely rate cut from the Fed. It’s in this context that we take a closer look at XRP, Solana and Pepe, which are now in a position where they could surge in the event of a rate cut tomorrow. We examine their fundamentals and technicals, and we offer predictions as to where they could be in the near and more distant future. Crypto Price Prediction Today 16 September XRP ($XRP): Incoming ETF Approval Could Push Alt to New ATH by October XRP has risen to $3.03 today, marking a 1.5% gain in 24 hours and a decent 8% increase in a fortnight. What’s also bullish is that the altcoin is still down by 3% in a month, implying that it still has plenty of space to rally further this week before entering an overbought position. There are numerous reasons to be optimistic about XRP right now, with the most immediate being the fact that we could see upwards of ten XRP ETFs gain SEC approval in the coming months. In fact, Bloomberg analysts have suggested that one XRP ETF – the REX-Osprey XRP ETF – could begin trading as early as this week, which could be massive for the coin’s price. This coincides with XRP reaching a very opportune position in its chart, which is showing a steady increase in momentum, just in time for bullish news (from the Fed and/or SEC). Source: TradingView XRP’s RSI (yellow) has climbed above 50 in recent days and looks ready to climb further, while its MACD (orange, blue) has also recently turned positive. When you combine these technicals with Ripple’s recent growth and expansion as a cross-border transfer business , they point to a rising XRP price. It could reach $3.50 by the end of the month, while a bull rally could see it top $5 in December. Solana ($SOL): Treasury Firms Can Push Token to New Highs Within Weeks Trading at the $235 level, Solana has risen by 7.5% in a week and by 22% in a month. This gives the altcoin plenty of momentum as we enter a key period for the crypto market, with Solana having benefited from lots of positive news recently. On the one hand, more institutions and/or public companies have announced SOL treasury strategies, including the Galaxy Digital-backed Forward Industries and Helius Medical . On the other hand, Solana continues to grow as a layer-one platform, as evidenced by Pump.fun’s ongoing growth in revenue , for example. This arguably makes SOL the most bullish alt in the market right now, with its chart today showing that it’s getting closer to a peak. Source: TradingView As such, we could see the Solana price rise strongly towards the end of the week, following the FOMC’s rate decision, before correcting a little over the weekend. Longer term, the prospect of SOL ETFs means that the crypto price prediction for Solana is very bullish, with the coin set to reach new all-time highs in Q4. It could potentially pass $300 by November, before crossing $400 by the New Year. Pepe ($PEPE): Whale Buys Indicate Incoming Pump for Meme Token As with several other coins, Pepe has moved sideways today, with its current price of $0.00001076 representing a very slight drop in 24 hours. However, PEPE remains up by 11% in a fortnight, and while it is down by 4% in a month, this presents an opportunity for further gains in the very near future. Its chart supports the view that the meme token remains in an oversold position and that a rebound is on its way. As we can see below, its indicators have only recently turned positive, having spent pretty much all of August in negative territory. Source: TradingView And it seems that whales have been stocking up on PEPE in recent days , in expectation of big rises in the weeks and/or months to come. This is an encouraging development as far as the crypto price prediction for PEPE goes, and it testifies to the meme token’s enduring popularity. We could therefore see the PEPE price reach $0.0000160 in the next few weeks, before climbing to $0.000030 by Xmas. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-to-Earn Token Raises $1.1 Million in Viral Presale The tokens above all have a good chance of rallying strongly as and when the crypto market enters a bull rally, yet traders may also wish to diversify into newer tokens. That’s because new and recently launched tokens can often outperform market averages, particularly when they gain exchange listings for the first time. This is something that happens to presale coins, which can generate lots of momentum during their sales, and they rally upon launch. The world’s first Mine-to-Earn meme coin is here. Yep you read that right. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/3j6C8mqmjW — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 16, 2025 One of the more interesting presale tokens around right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 coin that is offering a novel take on staking. PEPENODE has already raised $1.17 million in its presale, which it opened last month, and it’s quickly attracting new supporters. What’s exciting about PEPENODE is that it’s launching with a ‘mine-to-earn’ staking system, in which holders can build their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to buy more virtual nodes, users can earn bigger staking yields. This dynamic is likely to incentivize greater PEPENODE accumulation, which in turn could see the coin’s price rising steadily over time. Investors can join its presale and but it early by visiting the PEPENODE website , where the coin currently costs $0.0010617.

With its hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin was designed to be resistant to inflation and independent of central bank policy. Yet even after fifteen years, its claim to “digital gold” status remains unproven. Recent market action highlights the contrast: while traditional safe-haven assets climb steadily during uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to behave like a risk asset, rising and falling with liquidity cycles rather than shielding portfolios in times of stress. At the same time, the conversation about where true value lies in crypto is being reframed. While Bitcoin struggles to live up to its nickname, new projects are capturing attention in other ways. MAGACOIN FINANCE , a presale smashing fundraising records, is demonstrating that scarcity, cultural energy, and legitimacy can create value every bit as compelling as the “digital gold” narrative once promised. Institutional adoption, but lingering volatility The arrival of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 marked a milestone, drawing billions in institutional inflows. Pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers finally had an accessible vehicle for exposure. But with inflows came a reality check: volatility hasn’t disappeared. Instead of behaving like a hedge in times of economic stress, Bitcoin’s price action still mirrors risk assets such as high-growth tech stocks. This unresolved identity keeps Bitcoin from fully stepping into the “digital gold” role. Institutions may recognize its scarcity and network security, but many still hesitate to treat it as a true safe-haven asset. Until Bitcoin can consistently offer stability through crises, its crown remains aspirational rather than proven. A new definition of value Bitcoin’s volatility raises an important question: what defines value in the crypto world? If scarcity and institutional inflows aren’t enough, what else matters? Increasingly, analysts point to cultural relevance, community engagement, and the ability to capture imagination. These are elements gold doesn’t have and Bitcoin hasn’t mastered, but they are at the heart of new breakout projects. This is where the story shifts. Instead of chasing “digital gold” status, some tokens are redefining value entirely. They thrive not by replicating traditional assets but by offering something uniquely digital, built around scarcity, branding, and cultural firepower. The clearest current example is MAGACOIN FINANCE. In just weeks, the project has already raised more than $14 million , with presale rounds selling out at unprecedented speed. Thousands of investors are joining Telegram groups, stacking allocations, and amplifying buzz across social platforms. Whale inflows are complementing grassroots enthusiasm, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of momentum. What makes this story different is legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE has completed major audits , giving it structural credibility rarely seen in early presales. Combined with scarcity-driven tokenomics and bold cultural branding, the project has broken records not simply by hype, but by delivering the ingredients investors increasingly demand. According to many analysts MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a staggering 9,300% ROI, positioning it alongside the fastest-growing meme-driven altcoins of the last decade. Why the timing matters The timing of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise is no accident. With Bitcoin still searching for its identity as digital gold, traders are eager for assets that can combine scarcity with excitement. Presales thrive in this environment, offering both early access and the potential for asymmetric returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the embodiment of that trend: a project not weighed down by debates about hedging or institutional status, but celebrated for its real-time traction. By breaking fundraising records, it shows that crypto’s next stars may not come from mimicking gold, but from building entirely new definitions of value. The broader message for crypto markets Crypto’s evolution has always depended on dual narratives. On one side, Bitcoin pushes toward institutional legitimacy, battling to prove itself as a safe-haven asset. On the other, cultural projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE rise rapidly, powered by community energy and scarcity. This dynamic balance keeps the sector vibrant, attracting both cautious institutions and passionate retail investors. For the market, this coexistence is critical. Bitcoin’s quest for legitimacy provides the anchor regulators can engage with, while projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE keep the industry fresh, relevant, and fast-moving. Together, they ensure crypto remains one of the most dynamic asset classes in global finance. Conclusion Bitcoin has not yet earned its crown as “digital gold.” Despite ETFs and institutional inflows, its volatility keeps it tethered to risk-on assets rather than serving as a true hedge. But crypto doesn’t need to replicate gold to thrive. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving that value can also be defined by scarcity, community, and legitimacy. With more than $14 million raised , audits completed, and social momentum accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking records and rewriting what investors expect from presales. Where Bitcoin still seeks proof of concept, this project is already demonstrating traction. Together, they show that the future of crypto won’t be defined by a single narrative, but by multiple paths to value.

A truly remarkable event just unfolded, as a long-dormant Bitcoin whale , inactive for over a decade, suddenly sprang to life. This mysterious entity, holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin, executed a significant transfer that has caught the attention of market watchers globally. What could this sudden movement signify? Unveiling the Mysterious Bitcoin Whale’s Significant Transfer According to data from Whale Alert, a service tracking large cryptocurrency transactions, a Bitcoin whale that had been dormant for a remarkable 12 years recently moved 98.99 BTC. This transfer occurred just an hour ago, sending the funds to an anonymous address. For context, this whale originally held 1,000 BTC, making this latest move a substantial portion of its long-held stash. Such a lengthy period of inactivity for a wallet of this size is highly unusual. The sudden awakening of this particular Bitcoin whale naturally sparks numerous questions about its owner’s intentions and the potential ripple effects on the broader crypto market. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Whale and Why Do They Matter? In the world of cryptocurrency, a Bitcoin whale refers to an individual or entity that holds an exceptionally large amount of Bitcoin. While there isn’t an official threshold, holdings typically ranging from hundreds to thousands of BTC are often considered ‘whale’ status. These large holders play a crucial role in the market for several reasons: Market Influence: Their large transactions can significantly impact Bitcoin’s price and market sentiment. Liquidity: Whales often provide or withdraw significant liquidity from exchanges. Early Adopters: Many dormant whales are early adopters of Bitcoin, holding coins from its nascent days. Tracking the movements of these powerful players provides valuable insights into potential market shifts and trends. Their actions can often precede significant price movements, making their activity a key indicator for many investors. Why Did This Dormant Bitcoin Whale Finally Stir? The reasons behind this particular Bitcoin whale ‘s sudden activity after 12 years are purely speculative, given the anonymity of blockchain transactions. However, several common theories emerge when such dormant wallets awaken: Profit-Taking: The whale might be looking to realize substantial gains from their long-term investment, given Bitcoin’s incredible price appreciation over the past decade. Portfolio Rebalancing: The owner could be moving funds to diversify their holdings, perhaps into other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets. Security Upgrade: Transferring funds to a newer, more secure wallet or a different cold storage solution. Exchange Deposit: The funds might be moving to an exchange, potentially signaling an intent to sell. Lost Keys Found: In rare cases, owners who had lost access to their private keys might have finally recovered them. Without more information, the exact motivation remains a captivating mystery. However, the sheer duration of dormancy makes this event particularly intriguing. The Broader Implications for the Bitcoin Market The movement of nearly 99 BTC by a long-dormant Bitcoin whale can have several implications for the wider market. While 99 BTC might not be enough to crash the market, it’s the symbolism and potential for further action that creates interest. If the funds were moved to an exchange, it could signal an impending sell-off, potentially adding selling pressure. Conversely, if moved to a new cold storage address, it could indicate a long-term holding strategy, which is often seen as a bullish sign. On-chain analytics tools allow experts to trace these movements, providing a degree of transparency even with anonymous addresses. The crypto community will be closely watching for any subsequent transactions from this address or the remaining 901 BTC held by the original whale. What Can We Learn from This Bitcoin Whale’s Awakening? This event offers several valuable lessons for both seasoned and new crypto investors. Firstly, it underscores the incredible long-term holding power of some early Bitcoin adopters. Holding through multiple market cycles, including significant bear markets, demonstrates immense conviction. Secondly, it highlights the importance of staying informed about significant on-chain movements. While not always predictive, large transfers can act as indicators of shifts in sentiment or supply dynamics. For investors, understanding the behavior of a Bitcoin whale can offer a unique perspective on market trends and potential future price action. It encourages a deeper dive into market analytics beyond just price charts. In conclusion, the awakening of this 12-year dormant Bitcoin whale and its subsequent transfer of 99 BTC is a fascinating development. It serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic, often unpredictable, and always intriguing nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. While the ultimate intentions of this mysterious whale remain unknown, its actions provide valuable data points for those seeking to understand the complex forces shaping the future of Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically hundreds or thousands of BTC, whose transactions can significantly influence market prices and sentiment. Why do Bitcoin whale transfers matter? Their transfers matter because they can signal potential buying or selling pressure, affect market liquidity, and provide insights into the confidence or intentions of major holders, impacting overall market psychology. What does ‘dormant’ mean in the context of a crypto wallet? A dormant crypto wallet refers to a wallet address that has shown no outgoing transactions for a very long period, often several years, indicating that the funds have been untouched by their owner. Can these large Bitcoin transfers affect Bitcoin’s price? Yes, significant transfers, especially if moved to exchanges, can lead to increased selling pressure and potentially cause short-term price volatility. Conversely, movements to cold storage might be interpreted as a bullish long-term hold signal. How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track Bitcoin whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms and services like Whale Alert, which provide real-time notifications of large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. What are the typical reasons for a dormant Bitcoin whale to become active? Common reasons include profit-taking, rebalancing portfolios, moving funds to more secure wallets, preparing to sell on an exchange, or, in some cases, regaining access to lost private keys.

Lawmakers are actively considering a proposal to integrate the Anti-CBDC act into a broader, comprehensive digital asset market structure bill. This move could have profound implications for the future of digital currencies in America. This development, initially reported by Cointelegraph, signals a critical juncture for cryptocurrency regulation. If this measure passes, the combined legislation would then advance to the Senate for further deliberation. What is the Anti-CBDC Act and Why is it Crucial? At its core, the Anti-CBDC act aims to prevent the U.S. government from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is essentially a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Proponents of the Anti-CBDC act express significant concerns. They often highlight issues related to privacy, potential government surveillance, and the risk of increased financial control over citizens. The act seeks to safeguard individual financial freedom and limit government overreach in digital transactions. Many believe that a government-issued digital currency could pave the way for a ‘surveillance state,’ where every transaction is monitored. This perspective drives the urgent push for this protective legislation. A Pivotal Moment for Crypto Market Structure The proposed inclusion of the Anti-CBDC act is not happening in isolation. It is being considered as part of a larger digital asset market structure bill. This overarching legislation aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Establishing clear rules is vital for the growth and stability of the crypto market. Without proper guidelines, businesses and investors face uncertainty, which can hinder innovation and adoption. The market structure bill intends to address these regulatory gaps. Integrating the Anti-CBDC act into this bill means that the debate over central bank digital currencies is now firmly linked to the broader conversation about how digital assets will be regulated in the U.S. This connection elevates the importance of both legislative efforts. Past Battles and Future Prospects for the Anti-CBDC Act This isn’t the first time Republican lawmakers have attempted to ban the issuance of a central bank digital currency. Previously, they sought to include an anti-CBDC measure during a vote on the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill. While that specific attempt did not succeed within the stablecoin bill, the commitment to the cause remained strong. Subsequently, the Anti-CBDC act successfully passed the House as a standalone bill. This earlier success demonstrates significant support for the measure. Now, by attempting to attach it to a broader digital asset bill, lawmakers are looking for a more direct path to enactment. This strategy could increase its chances of becoming law, as it would be part of a larger package deemed essential for the crypto industry. What are the Core Concerns Surrounding CBDCs? The opposition to CBDCs stems from several key concerns: Privacy: Critics fear that a CBDC could eliminate financial privacy, allowing governments to track every transaction. Surveillance: There’s a worry that a CBDC could enable a ‘surveillance state,’ giving authorities unprecedented insight into citizens’ spending habits. Control: Some argue that a CBDC could give governments the power to freeze funds, implement negative interest rates, or even program spending, limiting individual economic freedom. Disintermediation: There are concerns that CBDCs could bypass commercial banks, fundamentally altering the financial system. These points form the bedrock of the arguments in favor of the Anti-CBDC act , emphasizing the need for safeguards against potential governmental overreach. The Road Ahead: From House to Senate If the U.S. House of Representatives successfully incorporates the Anti-CBDC act into the digital asset market structure bill, the journey is far from over. The comprehensive legislation would then be sent to the Senate for its own round of deliberations, debates, and votes. The Senate process can be complex and time-consuming, with potential amendments and further negotiations. The outcome in the Senate is not guaranteed, and strong advocacy from both sides of the CBDC debate is expected. Ultimately, for the Anti-CBDC act to become law as part of this broader bill, it must pass both chambers of Congress and receive presidential assent. This legislative path highlights the critical nature of the current discussions in the House. The ongoing debate in the U.S. House over the inclusion of the Anti-CBDC act in the digital asset market structure bill marks a truly pivotal moment for the future of finance and individual liberties. This legislative effort underscores a growing concern among lawmakers about the potential implications of central bank digital currencies. The outcome of these discussions will not only shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies but also determine the extent of government involvement in digital money. It’s a debate that touches upon fundamental questions of privacy, control, and the very nature of money in the digital age. Keeping an eye on these developments is essential for anyone interested in the evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)? A1: A CBDC is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are decentralized, a CBDC is centralized and controlled by the government. Q2: What is the primary goal of the Anti-CBDC act? A2: The primary goal of the Anti-CBDC act is to prevent the U.S. government from issuing a central bank digital currency, citing concerns about privacy, surveillance, and potential government control over individual finances. Q3: How does the Anti-CBDC act relate to the broader crypto market structure bill? A3: The Anti-CBDC act is being considered for inclusion in a larger bill designed to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. This means the debate over CBDCs is now tied to the overall regulation of the crypto industry. Q4: What are the main concerns opponents have about CBDCs? A4: Opponents primarily worry about the erosion of financial privacy, the potential for government surveillance of transactions, and the risk of governments gaining excessive control over citizens’ spending and financial activities. Q5: What happens if the Anti-CBDC act is included in the market structure bill and passes the House? A5: If included and passed by the House, the combined legislation, including the Anti-CBDC act , would then proceed to the Senate for further deliberation, debate, and a vote before potentially becoming law. Q6: Has the Anti-CBDC act been debated before? A6: Yes, Republican lawmakers previously attempted to include an anti-CBDC measure in a stablecoin regulation bill. The Anti-CBDC act also passed the House as a standalone bill prior to this current consideration.

Resistance at around $0.29 is being watched closely, and a breakout here could trigger further upside. Meanwhile, Remittix(RTX) is rising fast as the best crypto presale pick in 2025. Its team is now verified by CertiK, and its wallet beta is live with community testers. Compare Doge’s speculative momentum with Remittix’s foundational upgrades and the presale path looks increasingly attractive. Dogecoin’s Path To $0.50 Looks Possible Dogecoin is trading at around $0.26, with a resistance zone between $0.27 and $0.29. If DOGE holds support around $0.23 and volume picks up, this breakout could materialize perhaps by late Q4. Market volatility and weak macro signals might dampen momentum. Also, meme coin saturation and lack of new utility could limit upside. Still, many believe the risk-reward looks favorable if DOGE can clear the resistance and maintain bullish indicators. Why Remittix has Become the Best Crypto Presale Right Now Dogecoin’s possible rally is powered by sentiment and technicals, but Remittix is offering structural utility, verified security and strong community incentives. The project is fully verified by CertiK and is officially ranked #1 on CertiK for Pre-Launch tokens, which raises confidence among security-conscious investors. The wallet beta is live, and community users are actively testing, helping to uncover usability feedback and speed up product readiness. These updates give Remittix something more than charts; they give it substance. Demand metrics for Remittix underline its growing strength. It has sold over 664 million tokens. It is priced at $0.1080 per token. It has raised over $25,8 million. Those numbers show strong momentum, early adoption and that investors are backing the presale in size. Add the 15% USDT referral rewards and $250,000 giveaway and Remittix offers more utility-oriented upside for those seeking a presale opportunity. Here are features that boost Remittix’s case: Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries Global payout rails are integrated already and expanding The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency Early believers are already calling it “XRP 2.0” It is built for adoption, not speculation These factors contrast sharply with DOGE’s reliance on community sentiment and potential, but less on product rollout. With BitMart listing secured once over $20 million was raised, LBANK listing secured upon passing $22 million and a third CEX listing in view, Remittix is building real market access. Remittix Is Standing Out While Dogecoin Eyes Technical Upside Dogecoin has a path to $0.50 if it breaks well above $0.29 and holds support near $0.23. Technicals and sentiment favor the possibility. Yet Remittix is delivering verified security with CertiK, a live wallet beta under community test, strong metrics and incentive programs working now. For those asking, “What is the best crypto presale?” Remittix is looking like the strongest pick, offering both structural strength and upside that many DOGE bulls are hoping for but may not have in hand yet.

51844537,582600,1758063629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51844537.jpeg,American Express Turns Travel Memories Into NFT Passport Stamps,https://bitcoinist.com/american-express-turns-travel-memories-into-nft-passport-stamps/,"American Express has rolled out a new way for cardholders to collect travel memories: blockchain-backed passport stamps that live on a public ledger. The stamps are meant to be keepsakes, not investments, and they are tied to in-person spending while traveling. American Express Launches Passport Stamps According to company information and reports, the feature — called Amex Passport — issues NFT-style stamps as ERC-721 tokens on Base, an Ethereum layer-two network. Eligible cardholders must be US consumer cardholders with their cards linked to their online Amex account. Stamps are earned when a linked card is used in person in any of 130+ qualifying countries and regions, and past trips can be stamped retroactively for up to two years based on purchase records. What The Stamps Show Reports have disclosed that each stamp records simple details: the country or region visited, a date, and a short note such as a favorite meal or a memorable sight. The stamps can be viewed in the Amex Travel app’s Passport section and can be shared to social media or saved to a camera roll. They are non-transferable, which means users cannot sell or move them to other wallets; they are intended strictly as personal mementos. How Travelers Can Earn Stamps American Express Cardholders who pay with their Amex card, or via Apple Pay or Google Pay tied to that card, should trigger the stamp when they make qualifying purchases abroad. Based on reports, the smart contract implementing the program was deployed roughly 25 days before the public announcement, and more than 20,000 stamps had been issued soon after launch. That early uptake suggests some interest among frequent travelers who already use Amex while abroad. American Express: Privacy And Technical Notes According to published coverage, American Express aims to limit what goes on chain. Stamps avoid putting personal information such as names or exact purchase details into the public ledger. Still, the fact that entries live on a public blockchain means there are tradeoffs — some data about visits will be visible to anyone who inspects the contract. The company says privacy safeguards are in place, but users who are cautious about on-chain traces should be aware of those limits. What The Numbers Show A customer survey cited around 73% of respondents saying they want more digital ways to mark trips , while about 56% said they miss getting physical passport stamps. The initial list of eligible places covers 130+ countries and regions, and retroactive stamping reaches back two years. At launch the program applies only to US consumer cards; corporate accounts are not included.

As it stands, record stock valuations, resilient GDP growth, sticky inflation, and cracks are forming in the labor market, leaving the stage open for volatility in traditional markets that could spill over into the next explosive altcoin season. Fed Rate Cuts At Record Valuations Expectations are also high that the Fed will keep lowering rates at the next interest rate decision on Wednesday, September 17, 2025 and through the end of this year. According to a lengthy thread that was posted on the social media platform X, this could have long-term bullish effects on the crypto industry. Related Reading: Altcoin Market Completes Highest Monthly Close Ever: What This Means For Alt Season The Federal Reserve usually cuts rates in the face of economic weakness and depressed equity markets, but this time is different. As noted by The Kobeissi Letter, valuation metrics tracked by Bloomberg show US stocks are more expensive than ever, having surpassed even the 1929 pre-Depression peak and the dot-com bubble. Furthermore, the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio hit 5.3x in late August, its record level. Despite these extremes, policymakers are expected to cut by at least 25 basis points this week based on weakness in the labor market. History shows that when rate cuts occurred with stocks within 2% of all-time highs, as shown in 2019 and 2024, the S&P 500 delivered strong gains over the following year. This unusual mix could once again amplify capital flows into high-growth assets, including cryptocurrencies, in the last quarter of 2025. A Perfect Time For Altcoins Cutting rates into hot inflation adds liquidity fuel just as investors chase risk assets. That backdrop has always caused powerful surges for Gold, Bitcoin, and other major cryptocurrencies, as the return of these assets thrives when fiat returns come under question. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Index Sets New 2025 High, What This Means For The Crypto Market As The Kobeissi Letter framed it, the time has come. The Fed’s decision to cut rates with stocks at record highs, amid a 3% GDP growth and hot inflation 110 bps above the Fed’s long-term target, could be the driver of the next altcoin season. Gold and Bitcoin have already been priced in this new era of liquidity, as both are now up by 450% and 105%, respectively, since 2023. The setup is even better for altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Chainlink, and most especially cryptocurrencies involved in the growing AI niche. There could be more immediate-term volatility, but long-term asset owners will benefit the most from the rate cut. However, if the Federal Reserve opts for a slower pace of cuts than markets are currently pricing in, the disappointment could ripple through both equities and cryptocurrencies and cause short-term declines this week.

Fundamentals supported by Aptos expansion and Kraken Ink partnership. By Jainam Mehta Aave ( AAVE-USD ) is currently trading at $296.30, showing weakness after failing to defend the $300 psychological level and slipping below its short-term moving averages. The 20-day EMA sits at $303.0, the 50-day EMA at $305.9, the 100-day EMA at $307.5, and the 200-day EMA at $308.2, all clustering overhead as resistance. The immediate support is at $295.0–$292.0, with a deeper floor around $276.0 if bearish momentum persists. To shift sentiment, AAVE must reclaim the $300–$305 zone, which now acts as resistance. The RSI at 35.4 indicates oversold conditions, hinting at short-term exhaustion in selling pressure. Technical and on-chain picture On-chain flows reflect mixed signals. Netflows on September 16 recorded +$0.98M inflows, suggesting renewed deposits into exchanges. While this may point to profit-taking or near-term sell pressure, whale accumulation near the $290–$295 region has historically provided local support. AAVE’s market cap remains near $4.2B, securing its status as a top DeFi lending protocol, though it lags behind competitors in recent momentum. Aave price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technically, the loss of the rising channel structure and rejection from the EMA cluster confirm bearish momentum. Holding $295 support is now critical, as a break lower could expose the $276 zone, last defended in July. Conversely, reclaiming $300–$305 would restore confidence, with follow-through targets at $325–$330 if momentum builds. Fundamental positioning and outlook From a fundamentals standpoint, Aave continues to expand its ecosystem. The Aptos integration earlier this year marked its first non-EVM deployment, broadening the reach beyond Ethereum and its L2s. At the same time, the partnership with Kraken Ink is designed to channel institutional liquidity into regulated Aave-powered lending markets, positioning the protocol for long-term adoption. On the downside, regulatory risks tied to stablecoin yields and phishing campaigns targeting Aave users highlight short-term sentiment headwinds. Institutional engagement remains supportive, but retail appetite has weakened as staking yields declined. The V4 Liquidity Hub and Horizon RWA markets provide longer-term tailwinds by bridging DeFi and traditional finance, yet near-term market structure suggests Aave will remain dependent on Bitcoin-led flows. Short-term outlook Looking ahead, AAVE sits at a fragile juncture. If $295 holds, oversold RSI could spark a relief rally back into $305–$310, aligning with EMA resistances. A decisive break above $310–$315 would be needed to unlock medium-term targets at $325–$330. Conversely, failure to defend $295 risks further downside into the $276–$278 demand area. Broader altcoin weakness, fueled by rising Bitcoin dominance at 57.3%, will remain a key external driver. In earlier analysis, the $300–$305 zone was highlighted as the critical pivot. Current price action confirms its role as the key battleground for AAVE’s next directional move.

Whales staked more than $1.5 billion in SOL, reducing circulating supply. A breakout above $240 could accelerate gains toward $260 and $280. By Parshwa Turakhiya ​Solana ( SOL-USD ) is trading around $235.87, consolidating after briefly touching $237 earlier in the session. The token remains in a rising channel that has defined its uptrend since June, supported by strong inflows and whale accumulation that continue to underpin its structure. Technical barriers emerge at $240 The daily chart shows Solana holding comfortably above its 20-day EMA at $219 and 50-day EMA at $201. Broader support rests near the 200-day EMA at $176. The immediate challenge is the $240–$245 resistance zone, where the upper channel trendline aligns with a key Fibonacci cluster. A clean break above this barrier would likely expose the $260 and $280 levels, while a failure to defend $219 risks a slide toward $201 and $187. SOLUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Momentum indicators remain constructive. The RSI prints near 65, reflecting controlled consolidation rather than exhaustion. If RSI reclaims 70 while price sustains above $240, momentum buyers could trigger the next leg higher. Whale accumulation supports conviction On-chain flows highlight growing institutional involvement. Net inflows of $39.7 million entered exchanges on September 16, extending a trend of positive flows through September after months of stagnation. This suggests accumulation pressure is building, aligning with the price recovery. Whale wallets have been particularly active. More than $1.5 billion worth of SOL shifted through Coinbase Prime and Forward Industries staking accounts over the past week. Large tranches of nearly 987,000 SOL, worth about $237 million each, were staked, with additional transfers of 439,000 SOL (~$99 million each) sent into custody. These movements reduce circulating supply and signal long-term commitment rather than speculative rotation. Outlook hinges on breakout Solana’s near-term trajectory depends on whether it can overcome resistance at $240–$245. A confirmed close above this level could open a run toward $260 and $280, while rejection would likely send the token back to the $219 support cluster. Institutional staking and whale inflows provide a strong structural base, reinforcing conviction that Solana remains a leading candidate for outperformance in the current cycle. The scale of accumulation has also fueled speculation that SOL could reach far higher levels if momentum persists, though traders remain cautious near technical resistance. Previously, we noted that Solana’s outperformance against Ethereum was being reinforced by positive inflows and retail rotation into high-beta altcoins. The latest data on whale staking further validates this trend, suggesting that both institutional and retail forces are aligning to sustain the rally.

The strategic move by Chiliz OG Esports , a groundbreaking development, sees Chiliz (CHZ) making a significant foray into the competitive gaming landscape. This pivotal moment involves the acquisition of a 51% stake in the renowned esports organization OG Esports, as reported by Decrypt. It’s a clear signal that the convergence of blockchain technology and professional gaming is accelerating, promising exciting new opportunities for fans and stakeholders alike. What Does the Chiliz OG Esports Acquisition Mean for Fan Tokens? This isn’t Chiliz’s first interaction with OG Esports. Back in 2020, OG Esports was a pioneer, becoming the very first esports team to launch its fan token on the Socios platform. This early partnership laid the groundwork for the deeper integration we see today. The OG fan token has already demonstrated impressive growth, recently hitting an all-time high in market capitalization, soaring past the $100 million mark. Currently, the OG fan token is trading robustly. According to CoinMarketCap, it sits at $16.83, reflecting a healthy 10.23% increase. This strong performance underscores the inherent value and appeal of fan tokens, especially when backed by a popular and successful team like OG Esports. The Chiliz OG Esports acquisition will likely amplify this trend, potentially driving further engagement and utility for these innovative digital assets. How Will Chiliz’s Investment Shape the Esports Landscape? Chiliz, through its Socios.com platform, has been at the forefront of fan engagement in sports and esports globally. Acquiring a majority stake in OG Esports is a strategic move designed to deepen its roots within the dynamic esports ecosystem. This isn’t just about a financial investment; it’s about integrating Web3 technologies more intimately into team operations and enhancing fan experiences. Enhanced Fan Engagement: Expect more innovative ways for fans to interact with OG Esports, from voting on minor team decisions to gaining exclusive access and earning unique rewards. New Revenue Streams: The acquisition could unlock novel monetization strategies for OG Esports, leveraging blockchain’s transparency and efficiency. This provides sustainable growth opportunities. Broader Web3 Adoption: This significant move could serve as a blueprint for other esports organizations, encouraging wider adoption of fan tokens and comprehensive blockchain solutions across the industry. The vision behind the Chiliz OG Esports deal extends beyond simple ownership. It aims to create a more immersive and rewarding experience for the global fanbase, solidifying the role of digital assets in modern sports entertainment and community building. What Are the Future Prospects for Fan Tokens in Esports? The success of the OG fan token and the subsequent Chiliz acquisition paint a clear picture: fan tokens are here to stay and poised for significant growth. This development suggests a future where fan tokens are not just collectibles but integral tools for community governance, loyalty programs, and direct, meaningful interaction between teams and their ardent supporters. Consider the compelling potential benefits: Direct Influence: Token holders gain a tangible voice in minor team decisions, fostering a stronger sense of belonging and ownership. Exclusive Perks: Access to VIP events, limited-edition merchandise, and unique digital content can be directly tied to token ownership, rewarding loyalty. Community Building: Fan tokens facilitate a decentralized community where supporters have a shared stake in the team’s success, creating a powerful collective identity. The Chiliz OG Esports partnership is a testament to the evolving dynamics of sports and entertainment, where digital ownership and active community participation are becoming increasingly vital components of the fan experience. Driving Innovation: The Road Ahead for Chiliz and OG Esports This strategic alliance is set to drive significant innovation within both the blockchain and esports sectors. Chiliz’s established expertise in Web3 technology, particularly with fan tokens, combined with OG Esports’ competitive prowess and dedicated global fanbase, creates a powerful synergy. We can anticipate not only new product offerings and enhanced platform features but also potentially groundbreaking integrations that push the boundaries of what’s possible in fan engagement and digital ownership. However, this journey isn’t without its considerations. Integrating blockchain solutions into a traditional esports organization requires careful planning and execution. Ensuring user-friendliness for fans who might be new to crypto, managing tokenomics effectively, and navigating regulatory landscapes will be key challenges. Despite these, the potential for growth and the creation of a truly interactive fan ecosystem is immense. The Chiliz OG Esports partnership aims to overcome these hurdles, setting new industry standards. This is more than just a business transaction; it’s a statement about the future. It highlights the growing importance of decentralized technologies in mainstream industries. The partnership will undoubtedly inspire other teams and organizations to explore similar ventures, further legitimizing fan tokens and blockchain applications in the broader sports entertainment industry. The goal is to create a more direct, transparent, and rewarding relationship between teams and their most passionate supporters.

The drama will air on MBC, one of South Korea’s biggest terrestrial broadcast networks, in the prime-time 10 pm Friday and Saturday slot. The first episode will air on September 19, and the drama is based on a hit novel by Jang Ryu-jin. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the production team behind the drama explained that the three main characters, played by Lee, Jo (formerly of the K-pop group gugudan), and Ra, all share a common goal: To find wealth through crypto investment. A trailer for the upcoming Korean drama series To The Moon. Korean Drama To The Moon ‘Does Not Encourage Crypto Speculation’ The drama’s producers were keen to emphasize that “although the three main characters have a common interest in cryptocurrency investment, the drama does not encourage speculation.” At a media event on September 16, Oh Da-young, the drama’s chief producer, said: “We are not trying to tell viewers that they can make a lot of money from [crypto investment]. We aren’t trying to stoke speculation.” WATCH: #LeeSunBin , #RaMiRan , #JoAram , And #KimYoungDae Prepare To Board The Cryptocurrency Train In "" #ToTheMoon "" Teaser https://t.co/KEoy2W1A26 pic.twitter.com/K3KYTlPXZr — Soompi (@soompi) September 10, 2025 However, it appears that the drama’s cast members are no strangers to crypto. Ra said that she holds a small amount of Ethereum (ETH) . The veteran actress explained: “I actually have 500,000 won [$362] worth of Ethereum. Sometimes its value goes up to 600,000 won, and sometimes it goes down to 400,000 won. But I don’t know how to withdraw my money, so I just leave it alone. I’ll hold on to it until the day it reaches 500 million won [$361,721]!” The official poster for the South Korean drama series To The Moon. (Image: MBC/X) Drama’s Backdrop Is 2017-2018 Bitcoin Bull Market The drama is set in 2017-2018, at the time of the crypto bull market. At the time, crypto investment was entirely unregulated in South Korea, and media outlets were full of news stories about pensioners and schoolchildren investing their money in little-known altcoins. The action centers around three women from poor families who have grand dreams. However, they are frustrated by their low-salary office jobs at a large confectionery retailer. When one of the trio starts to see positive results from investing in crypto, she shares her experience with the other two, who also follow suit. A trailer for the series appears to show that the three women’s investment experience yields decidedly mixed results. “This is a story that will resonate very well with female office workers,” Oh said. 조아람-이선빈-라미란 '달까지 가자'[엑's HD포토] #달까지가자 #ToTheMoon #이선빈 #LeeSunbin #라미란 #RaMiran #조아람 #JOARAM https://t.co/nqcoCjgfvO — 엑스포츠뉴스 (@xportsnews) September 16, 2025 South Korean Scriptwriters’ Crypto Inspiration Crypto has proved a rich source of subject matter for South Korean drama producers and movie script writers in recent years. This appears to reflect the continuing rise of retail crypto investment in the country, as the domestic stock market remains stagnant and real estate prices remain prohibitively high. South Korean companies are still unable to buy crypto with their balance sheets. And this means that the country’s vibrant crypto scene remains purely retail-based.

(Source: CoinGecko) Earlier this year, the film Crypto Man, starring the late Song Jae-rim , proved a box office smash in South Korea. The movie, based loosely on the story of the Terra-LUNA/LUNC crash, told the tale of a man who exploited loopholes in government grant programs to fund his cryptocurrency project.

While there are several factors from analysts why the price prediction is changing, the rise of new competition is showing more strength. This is because a new pre-launch token has taken center stage lately as a threat to the XRP price prediction, with outlook seeing top analysts calling the new altcoin “XRP 2.0.” However, here is a quick look at why the XRP price prediction could keep changing in the coming weeks as the pre-launch token makes new progress. Analysis Of XRP Price Prediction In The Face Of Rising Competition Checking through the current XRP price predictions, these last few days show a decline in analysts’ sentiment. This is with the price projection seeing a downturn following rising competition in the payment and remittance sector of the crypto market. Furthermore, while the Ripple project has made landmark progress in cross-border partnerships for payment and remittance, the price remains on a slow climb. The price analysis with data from the last few days might give better insight into why the XRP price prediction is getting dull lately. According to the technical analysis of the price, there has been a struggle for the coin to beat the $3.08 resistance since mid-August. As this zone continues to pose a threat to a significant breakout, analysts are divided about what will be the main story this year for XRP. The XRP price prediction now stands between the coin breaking the $3.08 this year and making a new high. Remittix Launches First Live Product In Its Ecosystem The story around the Remittix project as an XRP competitor just got even more interesting today as it launches its first live product. This is with the launch of its much-anticipated wallet for beta testing, giving users a first-hand feel of the finished product. According to the projection from top analysts, this could see the Remittix coin gain another 5x from its current $0.1 as accumulation spikes. Following the project’s comparison to the Ripple coin, here are some features making Remittix the talk of the town right now: It has a low cap, which could fuel an instant doubling effect and upward move. The Remittix solution is introducing a new approach that could change cross-border payment with its over 30 fiat currencies payment to bank accounts using crypto assets New solution to crypto to fiat conversion with a faster, cheaper and easier transaction Furthermore, the introduction of the referral program is another eye-catching approach for users to earn more with Remittix.

The new fund is designed to provide business people with an alternative way to invest in two of the fastest-growing areas of crypto markets, stablecoins and tokenized assets, via a single product. If approved, it would be the first-ever US ETF focused on these themes, providing exposure through a dual-structured product that includes traditional equity investments alongside crypto-linked assets. The move reflects Bitwise’s desire to remain at the cutting edge of crypto investment innovation and leverage recent regulatory clarity and growing market demand for stablecoin- and tokenization-centric products. Bitwise builds a dual exposure model The fund is split evenly into two, one equities and the other crypto assets, according to a filing. The equity sleeve will zero in on businesses that have a direct play around stablecoins and tokenization. These include stablecoin creators, blockchain infrastructure companies, payment processors, exchanges, and even merchants that dabble with digital currencies. Bitwise has also established exposure limits to help control concentration risks. Tier 1 companies identified as having higher exposure could make up to 15% of the fund, Tier 2 companies 8%, and Tier 3 companies up to 3%. Bitwise anticipates selecting about 20 companies for the portfolio across Tier 1 and Tier 2, with as many as up to an additional 10 from Tier 3. The crypto asset sleeve will monitor exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to blockchain infrastructure and tokenization. To be eligible, the asset should make up at least 1% of the entire stablecoin or tokenization market. About 5% of the sleeve will be devoted to oracle tokens, cryptocurrencies that pull in data about the world from outside the blockchain to make smart contracts work. To prevent undue risk, the fund’s single largest crypto holding would be capped at 22.5%. The ETF is also scheduled to be rebalanced each quarter based on market movement. Bitwise’s decision to file the fund under the Investment Company Act could mean a less onerous SEC review path than what would be required for other fund structures. Analysts say this improves the chances of approval of the ETF. Regulation shapes market dynamics and launch timeline The filing is submitted at a time when the US is increasingly embracing stablecoins and tokenization. The draft bill to regulate stablecoins reduces the uncertainty and increases investor confidence that the GENIUS Act, passed in July, created. Meanwhile, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), including bonds and credit instruments, minted on blockchains have exploded in 2025, according to data from Chainalysis, reaching nearly $76 billion. Even stablecoins have experienced a surge. The stablecoin supply went from roughly $205 billion to $268 billion between January and August, a 23% increase. The market has since hit higher highs, and this week surged to nearly $290 billion, according to DefiLlama. These trends have contributed to institutional and retail demand for products with diversified exposure to stablecoins and tokenization. Bitwise already oversees more than $15 billion in its lineup of crypto funds and ETFs. The firm has stated that it sees itself as a leader in plans for crypto investment products, and this latest filing is part of its approach to combining traditional financial mechanisms with new blockchain offerings. Although Bitwise hasn’t revealed management fees for the proposed fund, analysts anticipate they’ll be competitive with so many rival products to choose from. There are already competitors, like Nicholas Wealth’s Crypto Income ETF (BLOX), that use equities for their crypto exposure. Still, Bitwise’s unusual two-sleeve structure could make it stand out in the market. Industry observers have said the SEC may rule on the filing this October or November. If approved, the fund is likely to come to market near Thanksgiving 2025, according to Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst with Bloomberg. That would place Bitwise ahead of competitors scrambling to roll out new products in a regulatory landscape that has evolved rapidly in digital assets’ favor since the start of the year.

Recently, a significant development emerged from South Korea that has caught the attention of investors globally. Parataxis Korea, a dedicated treasury platform for institutional investors, has made its historic first Bitcoin purchase of 50 BTC. This isn’t just another transaction; it marks a pivotal moment, showcasing the company’s commitment to providing robust, institutional-grade solutions for digital asset management. Why is Parataxis Korea’s Bitcoin Purchase a Game Changer? On August 7th, Parataxis Korea officially completed its initial acquisition of 50 BTC. This strategic move highlights a growing trend: traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring digital assets as part of their treasury management. For many institutional players, entering the crypto market can be complex due to concerns around security, compliance, and execution. Parataxis Korea aims to bridge this gap. Their decision to make a substantial Bitcoin purchase demonstrates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its potential as a legitimate treasury asset. It’s a clear signal that the demand for professional-grade crypto services is not just theoretical; it’s becoming a tangible reality for serious investors. Unveiling an Institutional-Grade BTC Treasury Platform: What Does It Offer? Beyond the actual Bitcoin purchase , Parataxis Korea announced a crucial achievement: the successful development of an institutional-grade BTC treasury platform. This platform is designed from the ground up to meet the stringent requirements of large-scale investors. What makes this platform stand out? It boasts: Proven Execution Capabilities: Ensuring large transactions are processed smoothly and efficiently. Robust Security Protocols: Protecting digital assets with advanced cryptographic measures and secure storage solutions. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to South Korean financial regulations, offering peace of mind to institutional clients. Dedicated Support: Providing specialized services tailored to the unique needs of corporate treasuries. This infrastructure is vital. It allows institutions to manage their digital assets with the same level of professionalism and security they expect from traditional financial markets. The development underscores a methodical approach to crypto adoption, focusing on reliability and trust. What’s the Broader Impact of Parataxis Korea’s Bitcoin Purchase? The ripple effects of Parataxis Korea’s Bitcoin purchase are likely to extend beyond the company itself. This move could inspire other institutional investors in South Korea and across Asia to seriously consider integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios. As more credible platforms emerge, the perceived risk of engaging with cryptocurrencies diminishes for established financial entities. However, challenges remain. Regulatory landscapes are still evolving, and market volatility is an inherent characteristic of digital assets. Despite these factors, the benefits are compelling: Increased Legitimacy: Institutional involvement helps solidify Bitcoin’s status as a serious asset class. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater participation from large players can lead to deeper and more stable markets. Innovation in Finance: Pushing the boundaries of traditional treasury management and investment strategies. This development marks a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of digital currencies, particularly for those managing substantial capital. In conclusion, Parataxis Korea’s inaugural Bitcoin purchase and the launch of its institutional-grade treasury platform represent a landmark achievement in the cryptocurrency space. It not only demonstrates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s potential but also provides the necessary infrastructure for other institutional investors to confidently enter the market. This strategic move is poised to accelerate the institutional adoption of digital assets, shaping the future of finance in South Korea and beyond. Keep an eye on how this pioneering step influences the broader crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Parataxis Korea?

New players earn a 200% match-up bonus of up to 10 ETH, 50 free spins, and a $5 sports bet. On the downside, the bonus has to be wagered 35 times to be withdrawable. TG casino also offers its gambling services on the social messaging platform Telegram. It is also unique because of its native token $TGC. Players receive 25% back on all net losses of bets made in $TGC. In addition, $TGC holders earn a percentage of platform profits, i.e., 60% of all profits are distributed to $TGC holders who have staked over 5,000 tokens. The profit is paid in ETH. Other promotions include a $7,000 weekend tournament, a highest odds tournament, and 40% extra for combo bets on sports.

Other than cryptocurrencies, TG casino also allows players to make payments in fiat using a crypto on-ramp feature that supports VISA and MasterCard.

However, this claim has a caveat: new accounts must meet a minimum wagering threshold of $69 to unlock withdrawals. This requirement also helps prevent money mixing, which is illegal. The sign-up process is straightforward. You can sign up with an email address and password or with the Telegram sign-in option. It’s hassle-free, and you can get your account up and running in minutes. The casino operated under a Curacao eGaming license. Initially launched as a single game platform, ToshiBet has quickly evolved and now hosts a variety of casino games, slots, and sports betting, with over 150,000 registered players.

CoinPoker: Our highest ranking choice for strategy plus chance games CoinPoker homepage CoinPoker is the go-to no-KYC casino for poker enthusiasts. At any given time, there are over 2,000 online players in the casino. Founded in 2017, the casino traces its roots to a community of poker lovers and crypto natives. Poker is a family of card games that combines elements of chance and skill, rewarding the best hand depending on the rules of the specific game. While it’s a poker favorite, the CoinPokercasino is also packed with other games. You can play slots, from classic three-reelers to video slots with bonus features and progressive jackpots. Others include fun crash games, table games, and sports betting—all no KYC. CoinPoker runs some of the most exciting promotions in the space. For one, they have a leaderboard that runs every four hours, with a $10,000 daily prize pool. While other casinos with similar promotions reset the leaderboard every 24 hours, CoinPoker’s is reset 6 times daily, giving you more winning chances. Concurrently, another leaderboard runs every week with a $5,000 prize pool. Away from the leaderboards, new players can claim a 150% deposit bonus of up to $2000 to stack up a bankroll. To qualify for the bonus, you must deposit at least $10. The other bonus includes a 33% weekly rakeback paid every Monday. One factor that stood out at CoinPoker was that the casino had a Proof of Reserves, a feature common in centralized exchanges. A Proof of Reserves means that the casino publicly displays the amount of funds in the spirit of transparency, which is essential in winning customer trust. The funds are stored in Fireblocks’ multi-authentication vaults, ensuring maximum protection. They also have a decentralized random number generator (RNG) that you can use to view the impact on the card shuffling. Supported cryptocurrencies USDT, CHP, BTC, POL, ETH, USDC, SOL No KYC limits None Other payment methods VISA, MasterCard, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Pix License Anjouan Internet Gaming license Operational since 2017 Support options Email Available games Poker, slots, live casino, sports Pros and cons Pros: Transparent, verifiable gameplay. Backed up by a dedicated team of poker enthusiasts. Completely KYC-free, no limits. Cons: The casino is only available as a downloadable application; you cannot play on your browser. High wagering requirements on bonuses. Degen Coin Flip: Top decentralized casino on Solana Playing Crash at Degen Coin Flip As the name suggests, Degen Coin Flip is a high-risk, high-reward anonymous online gambling casino for crypto degens. The casino is decentralized, meaning it runs on smart contracts. The smart contracts execute on predetermined conditions, and since they are coded on the Solana blockchain, they cannot be corrupted. The core mechanics of the game can be studied on the blockchain. The casino only accepts SOL, so you will need a Solana wallet: Phantom, Torus, Ledger, or Solflare. Once connected, you can now take your chances without making a deposit. The most popular game on Degen Coin Flip is Coi Flip. The game is provably fair, and you can double your SOL balance or lose it with a coin flip. Bets placed, wins, and losses are displayed publicly. My favorite, however, is the Crash game. Here, you place bets on how high you think a ‘token’ will go on the charts before crashing. During my time there, I consistently watched payouts go above 2X. A downside is that the casino, while fun, is not beginner-friendly. To play, you need prior knowledge of cryptocurrency wallets and transactions. With the knowledge, it is advisable to join their Discord group to stay updated on the latest updates and betting tips. The casino charges a 3.5% fee on every bet. Everything else is straightforward: no hidden charges, bonuses, or wagering requirements exist. However, the casino regularly runs challenges on its social media channels, X and Discord. Supported cryptocurrencies SOL No KYC limits No limits Other payment methods None License None Operational since 2021 Support options Discord Available games Coin flip, mini games including crash and coin dozer Pros and cons Pros: Decentralized and highly anonymous Transparent betting. Vibrant Discord community. Cons: Steep learning curve No bonuses Cryptorino: Top-ranking new casino Cryptorino lobby Cryptorino is a relatively new entrant in the crypto casino space, but continues to steal market share for its extensive game library and competitive bonuses. The sign-up process is simple; you only need an email address and a strong password, after which you are ready to go. Aside from this, the casino is available in over 10 languages, including French, German, and Spanish, catering to a global audience. Cryprorino is also a perfect choice for players looking for privacy and convenience. The casino sets the bar higher by being VPN friendly, meaning you can use a VPN service to mask your location when accessing the casino. The casino allows lightning-fast withdrawals for all payment methods. Deposits are also instant and are free. However, all deposits must be wagered at least 5 times to be withdrawable. This is aimed at preventing the use of the platform for mixing money. The only charge is blockchain fees, paid to miners who confirm crypto transactions. Being a crypto-friendly instant casino only increases its appeal for privacy-focused players. You can choose from many popular options, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether, as well as meme coins like SHIB and DOGE. For your first deposit of at least €10, Cryptorino rewards you up to 1 BTC or its equivalent in other currencies. While the bonus might be high, the casino requires you to meet its wagering requirements within the first 7 days to receive the bonus. Every Thursday, players can claim a free bet and 10% cash back on losses made every Monday, adding to the thrill of remaining loyal to the casino. Every week, Cryptorino runs a $10,000 tournament distributed to the top 50 players on the leaderboard. The scoring system includes points awarded based on your total win per bet minus your stake. You can also participate in the $7,000 pool tournament on selected games over the weekend. Other regular offers like odds boosts and prize drops keep the excitement going. The platform offers various options to casino game enthusiasts, from slots to instant wins and provably fair titles. You can find great game show options among the extensive suite of games, such as Pragmatic Play’s Snakes and Ladders and Dice City. You can also play Mini Roulette, which provides a minimalistic playing experience. There’s a fantastic choice of Mines, Crash, Plinko, and Hi-Lo titles and arcade-style releases such as Save the Princess. If you want a more premium experience, Cryptorino offers exclusive high-roller and private tables, such as Playboy Blackjack and Baccarat High Roller. I managed to play some excellent RNG table games and popular slot machines. Cryptorino’s VIP program is especially advantageous, particularly for loyal players. The VIP program is set in levels determined by the total amount of wagers you place; the higher your level, the better the perks. At the highest level, players become eligible for a personalized casino experience, which includes cashbacks, surprise spins, an account manager, and higher withdrawal limits.

Casinopunkz: Provably fair VPN friendly casino Casinopunkz bonuses Casinopunkz is a relatively new crypto casino offering a broad selection of games from top-tier providers like Playson, Slotmil, BGaming, and Hacksaw Gaming. The casino stands out for its punk-style theme characterized by pixelated images and wording, similar to the popular CryptoPunks NFT collection, adding a distinctive flair. Casinopunkz ensures user privacy by recommending VPN platforms, a feature I have not seen on any other casino. A VPN encrypts your internet connection and masks your real IP address. This means you can access the casino anywhere worldwide while staying protected from online threats and ISP monitoring. Their top VPN recommendations include NordVPN, Proton, and Express VPN. Casinopunkz welcomes new players with a 100% matchup bonus, meaning they double your initial deposit in bonuses. Other promotions include loot box drops, up to 15% cashback, and daily multiplier challenges with big prizes. The casino’s lobby features diverse categories such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and game shows. From the main page, you can switch between casino and live casino games, making it easy for users to locate their favorite games. The casino also features a search function and a section of new releases to keep the excitement alive for all gaming enthusiasts. If you’re more into strategic gameplay, you can explore hundreds of exciting RNG table games, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat, powered by top providers like Pragmatic Play and Evolution Gaming. The live dealer selection doesn’t hold back as well. The ‘Challenges’ section is particularly enticing, showcasing prizes on select games when you achieve the set milestones. For instance, you win €500 when you get 5,000x on the game Zeus by Hacksaw Gaming. When you hit 5,000x on Shaolin Panda by Octoplay with a minimum €10 bet, you win €2,000. I could count over 15 similar challenges running in parallel in the section. The Bonus Buy option, available within games from providers like Hacksaw Gaming, Pragmatic Play, and Playson, allows players to fast-track their way to bonus rounds and enhance their winning potential. Casinopunkz ensures fair play with its Provably Fair feature, giving players confidence in every spin and bet. Casinopunkz’s offers fair play, niche-themed games, and exclusive content.

Cons: Limited registration option Does not offer sports betting. What is a No KYC casino, and how does it work? A no KYC casino is a casino that does not require you to verify your identity to play on the platform. KYC stands for Know Your Customer or, in some settings, Know Your Client. No KYC casinos offer more privacy and anonymity, which helps prevent data breaches and identity theft. No KYC also means more inclusivity and faster account creation. However, it is important to note that non-KYC casinos can request identity verification if their systems flag your account for fraudulent or unusual activity, such as large withdrawal requests. Casinos with KYC requirements ask users to submit identity verification documents, which include a copy of a national identity card or a driving license, and, to some extent, utility bills as proof of residence. Casinos request KYC as a risk assessment measure to prevent fraudulent activity and to comply with local rules and regulations. Pros and Cons of using a no KYC casino Pros: Quick account set up The process of KYC verification can be lengthy and tiresome. The process involves uploading your identity documents and/ or utility bills to confirm your proof of address. You might also be required to upload a selfie holding your identity document. After submission, there is a turnaround time where you have to wait for your details to be verified. The waiting time can be costly, as you might miss the entry point for betting opportunities. Some casinos request KYC when you request a withdrawal, which is inconvenient, especially if you don’t have the documents. At no KYC casinos, you can create an account smoothly within minutes. Anonymity and privacy The casinos do not collect your information, meaning you can play freely without the fear of raising eyebrows from peers or regulatory authorities. Your wins and losses remain private. This is especially convenient for high-roller players who make big bets and regularly have big wins and losses. Accessibility and global reach Like the blockchain, which democratizes access to financial products, non-KYC casinos play a similar role to their KYC counterparts. The fact that you do not have to disclose your location means that anyone globally can sign up for an account without getting flagged. Some casinos go a step further and recommend VPN services that mask your location and IP address. Enhanced bonuses and promotions No-verification online casinos also tend to offer generous bonuses, promotions, and challenges. This is because they have lower operational costs as they don’t conduct KYC checks. The extra funds allow the casinos to splurge money on providing their clients with a more rewarding playing experience. Some casinos offer bonuses of up to 1BTC, while others do not require wagering requirements on bonuses. Reduced risk of data breaches There is always a risk associated with sharing personal and financial details over the Internet. Cases of impersonation and identity theft are rampant, especially with the growth of technology. No verification casinos safeguard their clients as they do not collect personal information, which is also known as anonymous gambling. The casinos assure players of data safety, winning their trust and confidence. Flexibility and freedom The fact that no verification betting sites do not require your verification documents means you get to have more flexibility and freedom. As an account holder, you are not limited to regional restrictions that may limit the amount of funds you transact. The casinos generally offer faster deposits and withdrawals than their KYC counterparts, as no extra checks are required. This gives you better control over your gaming experience. Crypto friendly All anonymous casinos are crypto-friendly. This is because cryptocurrencies share the same ethos of user privacy and anonymity. While crypto transactions can be monitored on the blockchain, they cannot be linked to an individual unless they are publicly declared. Players on the sites, therefore, enjoy better crypto support and faster transactions. Cons: Lack of regulatory oversight No-KYC casinos often operate in a grey area in terms of regulations. The state of crypto regulations across countries also differs, with some outright banning them. This conundrum becomes a challenge since anonymous casinos are known to operate globally with no restrictions on users who can play. For Compliance challenges Since casinos operate in a grey area, they can cause trouble for users who do not comply with local laws. Per their terms, customers must confirm whether the casino’s services are allowed in their jurisdictions. It can also be difficult for users to report taxes from non-KYC casinos. Potential customer support limitations Because these sites operate internationally, gamblers from all over the world are accessing them. That means when a player is wagering, the customer support team may not have assistance due to a language barrier or may not be available to assist due to time differences. Platform misuse Bad actors can mask illegal activity by taking advantage of the anonymity of no-verification casinos. Known bad actors can also use the system for money laundering without raising flags. A KYC check can help identify such threats quickly. Key factors to look for while choosing a no KYC crypto casino Licensing and regulation Anonymous crypto casinos require users to confirm the legality of accessing their services in their jurisdictions. Before engaging with a no KYC casino, checking with your regulator for compliance is important. This is because it is easier to receive assistance from local authorities if you have an issue with the casino. Compliant casinos also tend to be fairer and transparent, as it is a requirement to get licensed. Game selection There are hundreds of online game providers in the casino space. Check that the casino supports your favorite games and their variations, as there are thousands of games to choose from. Also, check whether the casino supports local leagues to avoid getting side-stepped on those fun football weekends. Customer support Before signing up, make a gesture to contact customer service through live chat and see how long it takes them to respond. Fast response times mean a chance to edit bets where you placed an extra zero or an opportunity to follow up on a withdrawal request that is taking too long to clear. Security measures Opt for casinos that offer two-factor authentication features, as they provide extra protection for your account. Some casinos go a step further and publish their proof of reserves as evidence that customer deposits are safely stored in their vaults. Check for features like SSL encryption, third-party accounts, and security audits. Payment methods Check with customer care if they support your payment method. Some gambling sites support fiat payment options like Revolut, Apple Pay, MasterCard, and VISA. For crypto, check whether your token, including the blockchain, is supported. Remember that when you deposit the wrong chain, you risk losing your funds. Also, confirm the casino’s withdrawal methods and limits. Reputation and reviews Reviews from third-party platforms like TrustPilot offer you a front-row seat to issues encountered by real customers. Check for low-rated reviews and follow up if the customer issues were resolved. Repeated negative reviews on the same issue are a red flag. Withdrawal limits and speed Some non-KYC casinos may flag your account if you request a huge withdrawal. Others have a limit on how much money you can withdraw. Check with support about their limits to confirm whether they align with your goals. High roller players may opt for casinos with high or no deposit and withdrawal limits. Low limits could also mean that you can’t withdraw your jackpot wins. Bonuses and promotions Bonuses and promotions are meant to reward player loyalty and keep you returning. Check for generous bonuses and perks like a percentage back on losses made. Some casinos offer rakebacks and cashbacks every other week. However, be wary of bonuses with high wagering requirements. While the requirements are implemented to prevent account misuse, they also prevent users from outrightly claiming their bonuses. Tips to stay anonymous while using a no-KYC crypto casino Fresh no-KYC linked wallets Crypto transactions are publicly displayed on the blockchain, meaning that with the right tools, it is possible to trace how funds move across known crypto wallets, e.g., exchanges, or public figures, to the casino. For this reason, it is advisable to use a new crypto wallet and address for online gambling. You should also regularly change your addresses to prevent leaving traces on the blockchain. Non-custodial wallets Some of the casinos allow users to sign in with their crypto wallets. In these instances, you do not deposit crypto to the casino; the casinos access your crypto in your wallet when you approve the transactions. Such wallets are known as non-custodial wallets. With such a wallet, the casino has limited access to your crypto balance and therefore cannot misuse it. Use VPN and proxy VPNs work by masking a client’s location and VIP address; this way, you can anonymously access the casino’s offerings. You can also access games that would otherwise be restricted in your jurisdiction by using a VPN. Choose a reputable no-KYC casino Check the casino’s reputation from third-party reviews and platforms like TrustPilot. You can also examine the reliability of its random number generators, which are crucial in ensuring fair play. Use privacy-focused crypto like Monero Use privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, Dash, Grin, and Zcash. These cryptocurrencies use special technology like zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, and stealth addresses that make them impossible to trace on the blockchain. Before signing up, check with the casino whether they support cryptocurrencies. Be mindful of transaction history Clear your transaction history on the casino. You can also request the casino for information they have stored about you. It can also help to regularly clear your cache and cookies, which leave traces of your activity on your devices. Also, as explained earlier, regularly switch to new wallet addresses to prevent getting traced. Be cautious of suspicious links or downloads Always be cautious of suspicious links and downloads. Phishing sites take advantage of a user’s ignorance to steal their personal information, which they can use to steal their identity, steal their funds, or perform illegal activity. Review the casino’s policy on anonymity and data policy Read the casino’s terms and conditions on anonymity and data policy. The terms will enlighten you on how they process user data and who they share their data with. Sometimes, the casino will request permission to share your data with third parties. Use a dedicated device for gambling A dedicated device will give you enhanced performance, a more immersive experience, and improved security. By using a separate device, you can prevent distractions and account breaches from other applications or services you access from the device. Also, in the case of an attack, you can contain the damage to the device. Stay updated on best practices With the advent of big data and artificial intelligence, technology is advancing rapidly. It is, therefore, important to keep yourself updated on best practices for staying anonymous while accessing crypto gambling sites through personal or peer-to-peer research. Conclusion No KYC casinos are rising in popularity for their benefits, which include better bonuses, promotions, and game offerings that rival their KYC counterparts and traditional casinos. As discussed, lower operational costs help the casinos provide their customers with a better playing experience. However, there are also significant disadvantages, such as operating without clear regulatory oversight. Our list has outlined ten of the best anonymous crypto and Bitcoin casinos, saving you the trouble. Note that these casinos still reserve the right to request KYC verification if they flag your account for suspicious activity. Check their requirements and local laws to ensure you don’t end up on the shorter end of the bargain. Also, explore responsible gambling tools, as gambling can be addictive.",Deep Dive - Crypto|Web3 & Market Insights,EN,0,0,SOL|USDT|BTC|ETH|DOGE|OTHER|ADA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-16 23:56:25

51846623,582141,1758067240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51846623.jpeg,"Bitcoin To Hit $750,000 By 2030 With ETH And SOL As Survivors, Says Pantera CEO",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-750000-by-2030-eth-sol-survive-pantera-ceo/,"Pantera Capital founder and CEO Dan Morehead told CNBC that Bitcoin could climb to $750,000 within four to five years, arguing the asset still represents only a “very low single-digit percentage of global wealth” and has historically “roughly doubled every year” across the firm’s 12 years in crypto. Morehead coupled the price call with a stark consolidation thesis: only a single-digit number of base-layer blockchains will endure—led by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Why Bitcoin, Ethereum And Solana Will Succeed Speaking on “ Squawk Box ,” Morehead framed Bitcoin’s upside as a function of its penetration into global portfolios rather than a speculative cycle. “I think it could go up to $750,000 in the next four or five years,” he said, reiterating that while a $1 million handle may be conceivable, it is a longer-dated prospect. The forecast extends a through-cycle view Pantera has pushed since launching what it describes as the first institutional bitcoin fund in 2013. The Pantera chief also dismissed “winner-take-all” narratives in smart-contract platforms, but he narrowed the field decisively. “There’s a single-digit number of layer ones… things like Bitcoin, Ethereum , Solana—not thousands, but definitely not one,” he said. In his view, these chains map to distinct use cases: “Bitcoin’s digital gold,” Ethereum anchors programmability, and Solana is “very good at the performance blockchain.” Morehead underscored Solana’s technical and market momentum to explain why it belongs alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in the long-run cohort. “Solana’s had better performance than even Bitcoin over the last four years,” he noted, adding that the network “could do 9 billion transactions a day,” a throughput he argued exceeds activity across traditional capital markets. While the exact comparative framing is debatable, the line reflects Pantera’s view that Solana’s execution capacity—combined with low fees—has crossed a threshold where “it’s not obvious you need a next thing” for high-speed on-chain finance. The interview doubled as a showcase for a new public-markets vehicle offering direct, unlevered exposure to SOL while capturing native staking yield for equity investors. Morehead cast the “digital asset treasury” structure as a bridge product in an era when large-cap crypto ETFs remain unevenly available. “Right now there’s no [spot US] ETF [for Solana]. It’s very difficult to get… For people with a brokerage account, this is the easiest way to get access,” he said, describing staking as “cumbersome” for typical retail users and positioning the listed vehicle to automate validator selection and reward capture. Pantera’s push fits a broader 2025 pattern: public companies raising capital to hold programmatic positions in major cryptoassets—often with staking overlays—and then listing on Nasdaq as equity proxies for tokens without spot ETFs. Just hours before Morehead’s appearance, Helius Medical Technologies announced an oversubscribed $500 million financing led by Pantera and Summer Capital to launch a Solana-backed treasury strategy, with an additional $750 million in warrants that could lift the vehicle’s size to roughly $1.25 billion. Helius said it would explore staking and conservative on-chain yield opportunities around its SOL reserves. Asked to arbitrate Ethereum versus Solana, Morehead avoided a binary call, returning to the same consolidation arc: multiple large-cap winners, but far fewer than the thousands of L1s launched over the last cycle. The market’s job now, he implied, is to price durable differentiation: Bitcoin as pristine collateral and macro hedge; Ethereum as the generalized settlement and execution layer for tokenized assets and DeFi; Solana as a high-throughput venue for consumer-scale and market-microstructure-intensive applications. “There would be lots of blockchains that are important,” he said, “but definitely not one.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $115,319.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin price prediction|btc|btc price|crypto|crypto news|Dan Morehead|ETH|Ethereum|SOL|solana,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 00:00:40

ETH Set Eyes On 77% Breakout Run,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-eyes-on-77-breakout/,"Ethereum has shown signs of strength after completing a healthy pullback. Having met and retested its $4,811 target, ETH is now holding firm, suggesting the correction phase may be over. If buyers regain control, the path could open for a powerful rally in the near term. Ethereum Pulls Back, But Bullish Signals Confirm Strength Javon Marks, in his most recent update, emphasized that ETH reached the $4,811.71 target before entering a pullback phase. Despite the temporary dip, bullish signals have re-emerged, indicating that ETH has regained strength and could soon retest this important level. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Looks Tired – Could Upside Momentum Fade Soon? He noted that surpassing the $4,811.71 zone would mark a decisive step forward for Ethereum. A confirmed breakout above this level could act as a catalyst, unlocking fresh buying pressure and signaling a continuation of the broader bullish trend. According to MARKS analysis, the bigger picture remains highly promising, as a sustained rally above this target could drive ETH toward $8,557.68, an impressive +77% move. Such a development would not only reinforce Ethereum’s dominance in the market but also underscore its ability to outperform as investor sentiment strengthens. Trendline Support Holds Firm, Strengthening Bullish Case According to Crypto King in a recent post, ETH looks to be preparing for its next decisive move in the market. After a period of consolidation, the price action has continued to show resilience, refusing to break down despite fluctuations across the broader crypto space. This behavior highlights the underlying strength of ETH and suggests that buyers are quietly accumulating while defending critical levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces September Profit-Taking Risks Despite $638M ETF Boost The analyst emphasized that ETH is firmly holding its ascending trendline, which has served as a strong backbone of support during recent pullbacks. Each time the price has tested this line, it has attracted renewed momentum, underscoring the importance of the trendline as a technical foundation. Now that the latest retest appears to be complete, Ethereum seems to be shifting toward another potential upside move. The structure of higher lows remains intact, showing that momentum is gradually building and buyers are preparing for a possible breakout attempt. If this bullish pressure continues, ETH could soon reclaim higher levels and aim for fresh targets in the coming sessions. Crypto King further noted that for traders or investors looking to position themselves for the next rally, this could be the ideal time to act. Should Ethereum follow through with a strong rally, the current price zone might be remembered as a key accumulation point ahead of its next major advance.

On Tuesday, Jim told investors on CNBC that he sees the bank as the first non-tech company to cross the $1 trillion market cap line. Right now, JPMorgan’s value is around $850 billion, but Jim thinks that’s just the beginning. He said, “JPMorgan’s got something special. It excels at so many things: lending, capital markets, trading, and perhaps most important, statesmanship, with CEO Jamie Dimon performing at a level that’s rare for any industry.” Jim added that: “JP Morgan has always been a top-quality bank, but it’s now become a fantastic place to work, and its global reach is unmatched. There’s a reason its market cap is so much bigger than the other major banks.” Banks push into trillion-dollar territory as sector rallies Jim made it clear this kind of growth isn’t easy. Only Berkshire Hathaway has made it to $1 trillion outside of tech, and it’s sitting just above that line at $1.05 trillion. Meanwhile, tech is bloated with trillion-dollar beasts. Nvidia is at $4.25 trillion, Microsoft at $3.78 trillion, Apple at $3.35 trillion, Alphabet at $3.04 trillion, Amazon at $2.50 trillion, Meta at $1.96 trillion, Broadcom at $1.70 trillion, and Tesla at $1.36 trillion. The bank isn’t just catching up in value, it’s pushing forward in performance too. JPMorgan just hit a new 52-week high on Tuesday and ended the day slightly up, rising 0.09%. So far this year, the stock has jumped 28.99%. That’s a hell of a move for a sector that’s usually ignored when tech is popping. Jim used a metaphor that works: JPMorgan is like “a horse that’s bided its time but is now at the far turn.” He sees the bank entering a new stretch of momentum, with the rest of the financial sector tagging along. He pointed out that Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are all making big moves too. But JPMorgan is the one leading. What’s driving this? Jim said the “real rocket fuel” is multiple expansion. In simple terms, Wall Street is starting to pay more for each dollar of bank earnings, and that’s not normal in this space. For years, banks have traded cheap. Now, those price-to-earnings ratios are finally climbing. “I’ve been waiting years for the banks to get higher price-to-earnings multiples,” he said . “They’re incredibly important to the broader market. When the banks are winning, it’s a terrific sign for the overall trading.” Jim added that this growth isn’t fragile. Even if the Fed shakes the market, this kind of shift doesn’t snap back easily. “Remember this tomorrow if the averages take a hit from the Fed, because once multiple expansion starts, it’s not easily reversed — we might be ok. These are hard-fought moves and I bet they’re just the beginning.” That’s the key point. Jim thinks JPMorgan’s valuation will keep climbing because earnings are growing, and investors are finally willing to pay more for it. If that trend holds, it means the stock doesn’t have to explode overnight. It just needs to keep moving up steadily. And compared to its peers, JPMorgan is already way ahead. Most other banks are still stuck under $300 billion in value. That gap shows up in investor confidence, deal flow, and stock performance. Jim sees this as validation, not hype.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to cut through the noise, offering a clear snapshot of prevailing market sentiment. Recently, this crucial indicator edged up to 53, holding steady in neutral territory. This reading, provided by cryptocurrency data provider Alternative, suggests a balanced market, where neither extreme fear nor overwhelming optimism dominates. Understanding what this index signifies can be a game-changer for your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a barometer for the cryptocurrency market. It quantifies the emotional state of investors, ranging from “Extreme Fear” (0) to “Extreme Greed” (100). When the index shows extreme fear, it often indicates that investors are too worried, potentially creating buying opportunities. Conversely, extreme greed might suggest the market is due for a correction, as prices could be unsustainably high. This index helps you identify when market participants are acting irrationally. It encourages a disciplined approach, urging you to “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The methodology behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is robust, incorporating several key factors to provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. Here’s a breakdown of its components: Volatility (25%): This measures current Bitcoin volatility and maximum drawdowns, comparing them with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals fear. Market Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a positive market can indicate strong bullish sentiment, while low volumes might suggest uncertainty. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes Bitcoin-related hashtags and mentions on social media, assessing the speed and quantity of interactions. A surge in mentions, especially with positive sentiment, can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Although paused currently, past surveys contributed to gauging investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often suggests fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. A decreasing dominance can signal greed, as money flows into riskier altcoins. Google Search Volume (10%): Analyzing search trends for Bitcoin-related terms provides insight into public interest. A sudden spike in search queries for “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin crash” indicates fear, while searches for “how to buy Bitcoin” might indicate growing interest or greed. What Does a Neutral 53 Reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Imply? A reading of 53, squarely in the “neutral” zone, suggests a balanced market sentiment. It means there isn’t an overwhelming consensus towards either fear or greed. Investors are neither panicking nor exhibiting excessive euphoria. This neutral stance can be interpreted in several ways: Uncertainty: The market might be awaiting a significant catalyst, or there could be conflicting signals pulling sentiment in different directions. Consolidation: Prices might be consolidating, forming a base before a potential move in either direction. Opportunity for Careful Analysis: A neutral reading encourages traders and investors to look beyond raw sentiment and delve deeper into fundamental and technical analysis. It’s a time for careful consideration, not impulsive decisions. Rather than reacting emotionally, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index score prompts a more strategic approach. How Can You Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Better Decisions? The primary benefit of monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is its ability to help you detach from emotional trading. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: When the index shows extreme fear, consider it a potential buying opportunity. When it signals extreme greed, it might be a good time to take profits or reduce exposure. Risk Management: Use the index as an additional data point for your risk assessment. High greed might warrant tighter stop-losses or smaller position sizes. Confirmation Tool: Combine the index with other technical indicators and fundamental analysis. If your analysis suggests a bullish trend but the index shows extreme fear, it could be a strong buy signal. Avoid FOMO and FUD: The index acts as a reminder not to succumb to the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) during greedy phases or Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) during fearful periods. Always remember, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive prediction tool. It works best when integrated into a broader investment framework. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently at a neutral 53, offers invaluable insight into the collective psychology of the cryptocurrency market. By understanding its components and implications, investors can make more informed, less emotional decisions. It’s a powerful reminder that while markets are driven by data, they are often swayed by human emotion. Use this index to stay grounded and navigate the volatile world of crypto with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Q1: What does a high score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A1: A high score (e.g., above 75) indicates “Extreme Greed.” This suggests that the market is overbought, and a price correction might be imminent as investors become overly optimistic. Q2: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only for Bitcoin? A2: While Bitcoin’s data heavily influences the index (especially dominance and search volume), the index reflects overall market sentiment, which generally applies to the broader cryptocurrency market. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A3: The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment. Q4: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as my sole trading indicator? A4: No, it is not recommended to use it as a sole indicator. The index is a sentiment tool and should be combined with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and sound risk management strategies for effective trading and investing. Q5: What factors cause the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to change? A5: Changes in Bitcoin’s volatility, trading volume, social media activity, Bitcoin dominance, and Google search trends for crypto-related terms all contribute to shifts in the index’s score.

51848160,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=810553,1758068897,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51848160.jpeg,Asia’s stock rally faces tariff shock as Trump levies bite into earnings,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/asias-stock-rally-tariff-shock-earnings/,"Asia’s stock markets are starting to feel the heat as Donald Trump’s tariff hikes begin cutting into corporate profits. Fund giants including T. Rowe Price and Franklin Templeton are warning that companies across the region, especially in South Korea and Taiwan, are more exposed than investors think. Export-heavy industries have enjoyed months of gains, but now the numbers aren’t adding up. And the White House isn’t backing down. According to Bloomberg, the warning signs are coming from all sides. Clarence Li, a senior portfolio analyst at T. Rowe Price in Hong Kong, said, “Current earnings and margins for exporters have not yet fully reflected the impact of the recent tariff agreements.” Clarence confirmed that they’ve already reduced their Asia and emerging market positions tied to exports. They’re not waiting around to see the damage unfold. Exporters face hit as profits fall short The rally has been huge. The MSCI Asia index has jumped more than 20% this year, way ahead of the 12% gain on the S&P 500. Investors rushed in, driven by cheap money, a weaker dollar, and the AI hype machine. That pushed the regional benchmark above its previous record from 2021. But now the policy change from Washington is cutting through the noise. Trump’s tariffs, announced in April, are targeting the region’s top exporters. The list is brutal: 34% tariffs on Chinese goods, 50% on India, 19% on Indonesia, and 15% on Japan. These aren’t symbolic. They’re aimed directly at countries with massive trade surpluses with the U.S., and almost all of them are in Asia. William Bratton, head of Asia Pacific cash equity research at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong, said the current earnings forecasts are “too optimistic.” He warned that markets still haven’t priced in the tariff risk properly. “We see continued risk of Asia’s export earnings materializing below current forecasts,” William said. He’s especially cautious about sub-sectors in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, all tightly tied to exports. It gets worse. Last year, over $1.3 trillion worth of goods flowed out of Asia to the U.S. China shipped $438.9 billion, Vietnam $136.6 billion, and South Korea $131.5 billion. Those numbers explain why analysts think the damage hasn’t shown up in full yet. The initial impact might be delayed, but it’s coming. Tech sector vulnerable as semiconductors targeted The problem goes beyond the visible tariffs. Christy Tan, an investment strategist at Franklin Templeton in Singapore, said supply chain disruptions and shrinking margins won’t show up right away. “Investors are expected to stay cautious over export-oriented companies and those exposed to tech sectors, as margin compression could be increasingly evident in months to come,” Christy said . There’s also concern about the semiconductor industry. It’s been one of Asia’s top-performing sectors this year. But that strength is exactly why it’s now in the firing line. Jerry Goh, investment director for Asian equities at Aberdeen Investments in Singapore, said, “There are concerns over potential tariffs on the semiconductor sector, which could weigh on Asia, given that it’s the center of the global semiconductor supply chain.” Jerry said Taiwan and Korea would face the biggest earnings pressure due to how much they rely on chips. Some regional data still looks okay on the surface. Manufacturing numbers in Thailand and Vietnam have been strong. Thai shipments grew by double digits in July. South Korean exports didn’t drop in August. But several managers say that’s just front-loading, companies rushing to export before the tariffs land. There’s still a chance that rate cuts by the Fed and other central banks could soften the hit. But that’s not guaranteed to offset the blow. The rally was built on liquidity and hype. Now it’s getting tested by policy. And the numbers aren’t lying. Everything points to one thing: Asia is vulnerable. The exposure to U.S. demand, the over-reliance on tech exports, and the delay in pricing in risks, it’s all catching up.

One moment, infrastructure projects are front and center; the next, retail momentum coins are dominating headlines. Over the past 48 hours, two stories have emerged: Chainlink (LINK) is showing technical strength that suggests a potential breakout, while Pi Coin (PI) is hovering dangerously close to historic lows. Both illustrate the contrast between projects building institutional confidence and those struggling to regain traction. But investors aren’t only focused on existing tokens. In the middle of this market reshuffling, a new presale has captured the imagination of retail and whale buyers alike. MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves with forecasts of 12,700% ROI , putting it in a class of its own for this cycle. If momentum holds, this presale may not just deliver profits, it could become one of the defining stories of the next bull run. Chainlink builds momentum for a breakout Chainlink has been quietly reasserting its role as a backbone of decentralized finance. According to analysis this week, LINK’s treasury reserves have grown 300% over the past month , underscoring the project’s reinvestment strength and financial discipline. This growth builds confidence that Chainlink can fund development even in choppier market waters. From a technical perspective, Chainlink has carved out a strong base of support. Analysts say this consolidation is laying the groundwork for a significant rally, with a push above resistance potentially opening the door to double-digit gains. Market chatter suggests that ETF discussions and rising institutional adoption of Chainlink’s oracle services are adding to the bullish setup. For investors looking for an established project with both adoption and technical potential, Chainlink offers one of the most compelling cases in the current market. Pi Coin struggles near historic lows On the other end of the spectrum sits Pi Coin. Once a hyped community-driven project, PI now trades around $0.345 , barely clinging to key support at $0.344. Analysts warn that a breakdown here could trigger a slide toward $0.322 , setting new all-time lows. The Pi Network has made progress, notably with the release of Version 23, which introduced decentralized KYC and touted 15 million verified users . Yet these milestones haven’t translated into meaningful price strength. Investor sentiment remains fragile, and without fresh capital inflows, Pi risks becoming another reminder that user numbers alone do not guarantee market traction. Pi Coin’s situation underscores a broader truth: crypto projects must balance community hype with tangible momentum and credible adoption. Without that balance, the downside risks remain acute. While Chainlink builds institutional credibility and Pi Coin faces existential price pressure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is writing a different story altogether. The presale has already attracted over $14 million , with allocations selling out at lightning speed as retail and whales compete for early access. Forecasts of 12,700% ROI reflect the scale of optimism building around this token. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its dual-threat positioning . On one side, it taps into meme culture, creating the kind of viral branding that spreads quickly across Telegram and X. On the other, it is rooted in legitimacy, with HashEx and CertiK audits completed , a rare badge of credibility at this stage of fundraising. Adding fuel to the fire is the PATRIOT50X bonus code , giving early participants 50% more tokens . This incentive not only accelerates adoption but also amplifies FOMO, as traders rush to lock in bigger allocations before rounds sell out. The combination of scarcity, legitimacy, and viral community energy has turned MAGACOIN FINANCE into one of the fastest-rising presales of the year. Features Driving Crypto Market Momentum Several elements explain why the broader crypto market is once again dominating conversations. Leading projects are focusing on credibility and security, with more protocols undergoing independent audits to strengthen investor confidence. Scarcity remains a major theme, as capped supply models across assets like Bitcoin and Chainlink ensure that increasing demand has a direct impact on price action. At the same time, whale participation is rising, with large-scale buyers entering alongside retail investors, a sign of growing institutional and grassroots alignment. Branding and cultural presence also matter more than ever, with projects that capture attention on social platforms often seeing faster organic adoption. Finally, strong fundraising and rapid sellouts in presales highlight that capital is flowing where investors see both narrative energy and structural resilience. Investor takeaways The current landscape offers a stark set of choices: Chainlink is building strength, supported by treasury growth and institutional adoption, and looks ready for a breakout. Pi Coin is testing critical levels, with real user growth but a fragile price structure that leaves little margin for error. MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining the presale model, blending meme culture, scarcity, and audits into a record-breaking story that could define the next bull run. For investors, the message is clear: balance safety with asymmetry. Established players like Chainlink offer measured upside, but the transformative gains of this cycle may come from projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Why timing matters Crypto thrives on cycles. Bitcoin consolidates near highs, Ethereum builds quietly through adoption, and infrastructure coins like Chainlink prepare for renewed rallies. But presales often hit their stride during these transitional phases, when investors want to secure asymmetric opportunities before the next wave of liquidity arrives. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE fits in. With macro headwinds pressuring traditional assets and established coins consolidating, presales with credibility and culture become magnets for capital. By combining legitimacy with hype at exactly this moment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is perfectly timed to ride the next market rotation. Conclusion Crypto markets are at a crossroads. Chainlink appears poised to surge as adoption strengthens, Pi Coin is flirting with breakdown as sentiment weakens, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is seizing the moment with a presale that has already broken records. With forecasts of 12,700% ROI , a PATRIOT50X bonus code boosting allocations, and demand that has allocations vanishing by the hour, it is shaping up as more than just a presale, it could become a defining story of the next bull run.

Employers are holding back, terrified of getting sued for offering higher-cost, harder-to-exit investments in retirement plans. The White House signed an executive order last month telling the Labor Department to cut down the legal risks. But legal experts say that won’t erase the threat. The rule that governs 401(k)s forces companies to act in the best interests of employees, a phrase so vague it’s fueled a nonstop wave of lawsuits for twenty years. Hundreds of companies have been dragged to court. Some, like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, paid millions to settle. It’s why most companies just stick to low-fee, basic investments. Offering hedge funds or crypto means getting slapped with a lawsuit, and no one wants to be the test case. Labor Department gets marching orders but can’t kill lawsuits Jennifer Doss, who leads the defined-contribution team at Captrust, said straight up, “The administration can only do so much to curb litigation.” The law’s too broad, and even new rules can’t promise immunity. Trump’s order gave the Labor Secretary six months to put out guidance for how to include alternative investments inside diversified 401(k) funds. The goal is a legal shield, a “safe harbor” rule. But even that can backfire. Lisa Gomez, who ran the Employee Benefits Security Administration under Biden, said employers could still be sued if they mess up any part of the procedure. Daniel Aronowitz, Trump’s pick to lead the EBSA now, told Congress in June he plans to “end the era of regulation by litigation.” He runs Encore Fiduciary, which sells lawsuit insurance to 401(k) plans. Aronowitz wants to give companies room to take on higher-return investments without worrying they’ll get sued if markets go sideways. But the courts won’t just bow to agency memos. Take what happened to Intel. The company dumped some employee funds into private equity and hedge funds about ten years ago. They got sued. They won. But the lawsuit dragged on for years and cost a fortune. That win didn’t give other companies any real confidence. Michael Kreps, who advises employers at Groom Law Group, said flat out: “Frustration over litigation has reached a boiling point.” New rules come fast, but courts still block employers The Labor Department has already started reversing Biden-era warnings. They pulled back on guidance that told small businesses not to offer private equity in their 401(k)s. They also tossed guidance that flagged crypto as a red flag for investigation. That doesn’t mean lawsuits are going away. In July, the agency filed a brief backing HP in court. Employees sued the company for using leftover matching contributions, money forfeited by workers who left early, to fund future matches. The plaintiffs said that money should’ve gone toward lowering costs. HP said they followed their plan documents and IRS rules. The Labor Department agreed with HP. Bradford Campbell, who led EBSA under George W. Bush, said the department is now backing companies more actively. But none of this fixes the deeper legal mess. In April, the Supreme Court made it harder for employers to get early dismissals in 401(k) lawsuits. That decision keeps cases alive longer and raises the cost of defending even if you win. Another Supreme Court ruling last year killed off the Chevron doctrine, which had forced courts to defer to agencies when laws weren’t clear. Douglas Tang, a partner at Patterson Belknap, said that change weakens any guidance that might come out of Trump’s executive order. Congress could change the law to add real safe harbor rules or make it harder for workers to sue, but Tang said, “there appears to be no momentum on such efforts.” So the lawsuits keep coming, and employers keep ducking risk. That’s where things stand.

Notably, this plan aligns with the nation’s aim to enhance its contribution to the AI ecosystem. The tech giant will collaborate with several partners currently developing their own Stargate UK data centers to achieve this tremendous objective. They include: Microsoft, CoreWeave, Nscale, and OpenAI. This initiative also aligns with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s vision of “sovereign AI,” which stands for developing AI purposefully to fulfill one’s needs and benefit them. Similar projects were initially introduced in France and the United Arab Emirates. Nvidia eyes the UK for AI expansion In a statement, Huang mentioned that the UK was creating the infrastructure needed for an AI-driven industrial revolution. Based on his explanation, this included enhancing science, transforming industries, and developing new economic opportunities. The CEO made these remarks when President Trump’s state had planned a visit to the country. To achieve Nvidia’s plan , Microsoft and Nscale have been assigned to create a superior supercomputer in Loughton, UK. This device will feature 24,000 Nvidia Grace Blackwell Ultra chips, essential to keep Microsoft’s Azure platform running in the country. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, weighed in on the topic of discussion. Nadella said they were committed to ensuring the US and the UK lead AI and cloud innovation globally. Therefore, based on his argument, they must work with NVIDIA to combine their international platform with their recent computing, software, and networking capabilities to achieve this goal. This is because innovators in these countries will acquire powerful tools to shape their future in AI. For Nscale, its contribution includes the installation of 60,000 Nvidia chips across the UK. The tech firm is collaborating with OpenAI to have its Stargate UK data center up and running by 2026. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, also commented on the situation. Altman pointed out the UK’s long history of leading in AI and its ability to attract high-ranked researchers, millions of ChatGPT users, and a government system that swiftly recognized the potential that this technology holds. He further explained that Stargate UK creates a strong base to accelerate science-based discoveries, improve productivity, and stimulate economic growth in the country. The CEO also acknowledged that this collaboration upholds their long-shared belief that with the right resources, AI can create various opportunities for individuals and businesses situated in the UK. Tech firms join forces to make significant advancements in the AI sector Apart from data centers focused on exploring AI, Nvidia has revealed a partnership with quantum computing firms OQC and Digital Realty to develop a Quantum AI center. On the other hand, ORCA Computing, Imperial College London, and Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center have joined forces to develop hybrid-quantum deep neural networks. At the same time, the University of Edinburgh centers its concentration on programs related to GPU-accelerated quantum error-correction. Other projects to contribute to advancing the AI sector include thorough research in robotics and several other fields. In the meantime, Microsoft pledged to invest approximately $30 billion in AI infrastructure and operations based in the UK in a blog dated September 16. According to the company, the plan will be effective from 2025 to 2028. This includes $15 billion specifically for the construction of cloud and AI infrastructure in the country.

Recently, South Korea’s Financial Security Institute (FSI) sounded an alarm, revealing sophisticated new crypto exchange hacking techniques . This isn’t just about simple phishing anymore; attackers are now employing cunning, multi-layered methods to breach security and steal valuable digital assets. Understanding these evolving threats is absolutely crucial for everyone in the crypto space, from seasoned traders to new investors. Understanding the Evolving Crypto Exchange Hacking Techniques Hackers are getting smarter, and their strategies are becoming increasingly elaborate. The FSI report highlights ""pretexting"" as a primary method in recent overseas crypto exchange hacks. But what exactly does this entail? Impersonation: Attackers often pose as recruiters or other legitimate professionals. Building Trust: They engage in seemingly innocent conversations to build rapport. Malware Delivery: The ultimate goal is to trick employees into installing malicious software on their computers. This malware then becomes the gateway, allowing infiltrators to gain an initial foothold within an organization’s network. It’s a social engineering masterclass, designed to bypass initial defenses and exploit human trust. How Hackers Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Once malware is successfully installed, hackers don’t stop there. Their next step involves exploiting ""supply chain vulnerabilities."" This sophisticated approach demonstrates an advanced understanding of network architecture. They target weaker links in the software, hardware, or services that a cryptocurrency exchange uses. By compromising a third-party vendor or a component within the exchange’s operational ecosystem, they can gain deeper access to the core network. This indirect infiltration strategy makes detection much harder, showcasing the growing sophistication of modern crypto exchange hacking techniques . The aim is always to move deeper into the system, often unnoticed, preparing for the final, devastating blow. The Peril of Blind Signatures and Obscure Laundering A particularly insidious method highlighted by the FSI involves ""blind signatures."" This technique is a significant threat to asset security: Deceptive Approvals: Employees are tricked into approving transactions without fully seeing or understanding their underlying details. Unauthorized Transfers: This allows hackers to authorize illicit transfers, effectively stealing assets directly from the exchange. After the theft, the stolen funds are quickly laundered to obscure their origin. Mixer protocols, like the infamous Tornado Cash, are frequently used to anonymize transactions. These mixers intentionally obscure the transaction trail, making stolen funds incredibly difficult to trace. Finally, the funds are converted into ""non-freezable coins"" and cashed out, disappearing without a trace. This entire process underscores the complex nature of these modern crypto exchange hacking techniques . Strengthening Defenses Against Advanced Crypto Exchange Hacking Techniques So, what can be done to counter these evolving threats? Vigilance and proactive security measures are paramount for both cryptocurrency exchanges and individual users. For Exchanges: Employee Training: Implement robust, ongoing training programs to educate staff about social engineering tactics. Supply Chain Audits: Conduct regular and thorough security audits of all third-party vendors and supply chain components. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Mandate MFA for all critical operations and employee access points. Advanced Threat Detection: Deploy sophisticated systems capable of identifying unusual network activity and potential breaches. Regular Security Audits: Perform frequent penetration testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them. For Users: Skepticism: Be highly skeptical of unsolicited communications, especially those requesting personal or sensitive information. Strong Security: Use strong, unique passwords and enable MFA on all your crypto accounts. Reputable Platforms: Only use well-established and reputable exchanges and wallets. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated on the latest scams and crypto exchange hacking techniques . Conclusion: A Call for Unwavering Vigilance The FSI’s revelations serve as a stark reminder of the ever-present dangers in the cryptocurrency world. As hackers continuously evolve their crypto exchange hacking techniques , our collective defenses must adapt and strengthen even faster. Staying informed, maintaining unwavering vigilance, and proactively implementing robust security measures are our best shields against these increasingly sophisticated threats. The security of your digital assets depends on it. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is pretexting in crypto security? Pretexting is a social engineering technique where attackers create a believable, fabricated scenario (a ""pretext"") to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security, such as installing malware. 2. How do supply chain vulnerabilities affect crypto exchanges? Supply chain vulnerabilities allow hackers to compromise an exchange indirectly by targeting a less secure third-party vendor or software component that the exchange relies on. This breach in the supply chain can then provide access to the exchange’s internal systems. 3. What are ""blind signatures"" and why are they dangerous? Blind signatures occur when an employee is tricked into digitally signing or approving a transaction without fully seeing or understanding the actual details of what they are approving. This can lead to unauthorized transfers of funds, as the employee unknowingly greenlights a malicious transaction. 4. How do hackers launder stolen crypto funds? Hackers typically launder stolen funds by routing them through ""mixer"" protocols (like Tornado Cash), which combine and shuffle various crypto transactions to obscure their origin. They then often convert these mixed funds into non-traceable cryptocurrencies before cashing them out. 5. What can I do to protect my crypto assets from these hacking techniques? Individual users should use strong, unique passwords, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), be wary of unsolicited communications, only use reputable exchanges, and stay informed about the latest security threats and scams.

The former CEO and co-founder of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, affectionately known as CZ, recently updated his profile description from “ex-@binance” to simply “@binance.” This seemingly small edit has fueled intense discussion: is CZ truly preparing to step back into the spotlight? What Signals a Potential Changpeng Zhao Binance Return? The recent change to CZ’s X profile is the primary catalyst for this wave of speculation. For many, this isn’t just a casual edit; it’s a deliberate signal. Following his legal challenges in the U.S. for violating anti-money laundering laws, and a period of imprisonment, the timing of this profile update is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a potential shift in his professional status or an upcoming announcement. Profile Update: Changing “ex-@binance” to “@binance” directly implies a renewed association. Industry Timing: Occurs after his legal obligations, raising questions about his future role. Community Reaction: The crypto world is highly sensitive to such signals from influential figures. Beyond the X profile, the broader context of Binance’s legal situation adds another layer to the narrative. Bloomberg recently reported that Binance is nearing a significant agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. This deal could potentially release the exchange from its obligation to retain a third-party compliance monitor. How Does Binance’s DOJ Agreement Impact CZ’s Future? An agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice is a major milestone for Binance. It signifies a move towards resolving past compliance issues and establishing a more stable regulatory footing. This development could pave the way for a more streamlined operation and potentially, a more welcoming environment for key figures like CZ to re-engage, even if not in a direct executive capacity initially. While CZ’s legal journey has been separate from Binance’s corporate entity in some respects, the fortunes of both are often intertwined in the public perception. A cleaner slate for Binance could indirectly facilitate a smoother path for any future involvement from its co-founder, making a Changpeng Zhao Binance return more plausible in the eyes of many. The crypto market thrives on anticipation and signals from its leaders. CZ’s influence on Binance, and indeed the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, remains substantial. His past requests for a pardon from President Donald Trump, made between April and May, also underscore his desire to re-enter the public and professional sphere without lingering legal shadows.

One key indicator that helps gauge these shifts is the Altcoin Season Index , which currently stands firm at 71. This reading, unchanged from the previous day, offers a fascinating snapshot of the market’s sentiment towards digital assets beyond Bitcoin. For many, the question isn’t just “what is this number?” but “what does it mean for my portfolio?” What Does the Altcoin Season Index at 71 Truly Indicate? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, serves as a barometer for market performance. It meticulously tracks whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies – excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens – have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A score nearing 100 unmistakably signals an “Altcoin Season,” a period where these alternative coins experience significant growth. Conversely, a lower score often points to a “Bitcoin Season,” where the pioneer cryptocurrency leads the charge. A steady score of 71 suggests a market in transition. While it’s not a full-blown Altcoin Season yet, it clearly indicates that a substantial number of altcoins are showing robust performance relative to Bitcoin. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it reflects sustained outperformance by a broad segment of the market. Investors often watch this metric closely to identify potential shifts in capital flows. Navigating the Crypto Landscape: Is a Full Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Given the current reading, many are wondering if a definitive Altcoin Season is just around the corner. Several factors could propel the Altcoin Season Index higher. For instance, major upgrades to prominent networks like Ethereum, or the emergence of compelling new narratives in decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), could draw significant capital into altcoins. These developments often spark renewed interest and investment. However, challenges remain. Bitcoin’s dominance can quickly reassert itself, especially during periods of market uncertainty or macro-economic shifts. A sudden surge in Bitcoin’s price could temporarily overshadow altcoin gains, pushing the index lower. Therefore, while 71 is promising, it’s not a guarantee. Smart investors will continue to monitor the broader market and specific project developments. Understanding the Dynamics: How the Altcoin Season Index Impacts Your Portfolio Recognizing the implications of the Altcoin Season Index is vital for strategic portfolio management. When the index climbs, it often signals opportunities for potentially higher gains in altcoins, which typically exhibit greater volatility and upside potential compared to Bitcoin during these periods. This can be an exciting time for those looking to diversify and capitalize on emerging trends. Conversely, misinterpreting the index can lead to risks. Chasing every altcoin without proper due diligence can result in significant drawdowns if market sentiment shifts rapidly. It’s crucial to remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Benefits: Identifying periods for potentially accelerated returns from altcoins. Challenges: Increased volatility and the risk of rapid market reversals. Examples: Historically, periods of high index scores have coincided with strong performances from sectors like DeFi tokens or Layer 1 solutions. Strategic Moves for Savvy Altcoin Investors in a 71-Point Market With the Altcoin Season Index holding at 71, what actionable insights can investors take? This reading suggests a selective approach is best. Research Diligently: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear utility. Don’t just follow the hype. Diversify Wisely: Spread your investments across different altcoin sectors to mitigate risk. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: A declining Bitcoin dominance chart often precedes or accompanies an Altcoin Season. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders. This dynamic environment demands continuous learning and adaptation. Staying informed about market narratives and technological advancements will be key to navigating the opportunities presented by the current Altcoin Season Index standing. The Altcoin Season Index at 71 serves as a compelling indicator of the crypto market’s current health and potential direction.

Standard Chartered has been cited with a year-end forecast of $7,500, while other market commentators and smaller research groups have floated targets as high as $8,500.

A pivot point near $4,811 was named by some analysts as the level that needs to clear for a larger advance to become more likely. Ethereum’s recent trading band has been roughly in the $4,400–$4,600 range in many charts, which means significant upside would be required to reach the lofty targets being discussed. What Would Need To Happen For $8,500 According to market commentary, several things would have to line up. Continued ETF inflows and steady institutional accumulation are key. Also important are clearer rules for ETF products and a soft macro backdrop that keeps risk appetite intact. Some analysts add that if Bitcoin moves higher — a move to roughly $150,000 has been used in scenarios — Ethereum could gain as investors reallocate across major crypto assets. Risks That Would Halt The Rally News cautions that the $8,500 concept is built on several positive developments occurring simultaneously. Policy shifts, softer ETF demand, or a change in macro sentiment might also stop a rally in a hurry.

51848793,582139,1758070833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51848793.jpeg,Shiba Inu Bulls Are Back: Here’s The 512 Billion SHIB Accumulation That Triggered A Spark,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bulls-are-back/,"Shiba Inu bulls are back, with on-chain data indicating heavy accumulation among the meme coin’s investors. Specifically, a 512 billion SHIB transfer has drawn the attention of the crypto community, sparking bullish sentiments towards the meme coin, which has underperformed so far. Shiba Inu Bulls Spark SHIB Accumulation Theory With 512 Billion SHIB Transfer Etherscan data shows that a Kraken hot wallet moved just over 512 billion SHIB ($7.14 million) to an unknown wallet (0x95a…4C4cE), sparking speculations that Shiba Inu bulls are actively accumulating the meme coin. Typically, a move from a hot wallet to what is possibly a cold wallet indicates that investors are looking to hold the crypto asset for the long term. Notably, thanks to this 512 billion transfer, the unknown wallet now ranks as the 38th largest Shiba Inu holder. Meanwhile, further on-chain data suggests that this wallet might be Kraken’s cold wallet , which stores its reserves. This wallet has made several transactions since then but still holds 1.47 trillion SHIB ($19.28 million), representing an increase from the initial 512 billion that was deposited. This confirms that Shiba Inu bulls have indeed been busy accumulating more SHIB even amid the sideways price action from the meme coin. This is a positive development, as it could trigger a supply shock, potentially leading to higher prices for SHIB. Meanwhile, Santiment data also shows that the exchange outflows are currently outpacing the exchange inflows. On September 15, 181.87 billion SHIB were taken off exchanges, while 87.37 billion tokens were moved into exchanges. This indicates that more Shiba Inu investors are currently leaning towards accumulating more SHIB rather than offloading their tokens. These investors are likely taking advantage of the dip opportunity as they anticipate higher prices for the meme coin despite its underperformance. SHIB is down almost 40% year-to-date (YTD). SHIB Could Still Rally 600% From Current Levels Crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the Shiba Inu price could rally by almost 600% from its current levels. He stated that the technicals point towards a near 6x happening in price to reach the $0.000081 target despite some bearish sentiments towards the meme coin. The analyst had earlier revealed that SHIB had confirmed a bullish pattern in a regular bull divergence with the MACD histogram. Fundamentals also present a bullish outlook for the Shiba Inu price. The SHIB team is about to roll out the LEASH v2 migration , which is positive for the entire Shiba Inu ecosystem. Meanwhile, ShibaSwap recently launched an upgrade to enable cross-chain access, further strengthening SHIB’s utility. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001306, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Shiba Inu|Coinmarketcap|etherscan|Javon Marks|Kraken|LEASH v2 Migration|MACD Histogram|meme coin|Santiment|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|ShibaSwap|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 01:00:33

In South Korea, a similar conversation is taking place, specifically concerning the potential introduction of a won-pegged stablecoin . The Bank of Korea, the nation’s central bank, is treading carefully, as highlighted by Governor Rhee Chang-yong’s recent remarks. Why the Caution Around a Won-Pegged Stablecoin? Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong recently shared his cautious perspective on a potential won-pegged stablecoin . Speaking at a special lecture at Seoul National University, Rhee expressed significant uncertainty regarding the benefits such a digital asset might bring to the Korean economy. His primary concern revolves around a crucial question: What tangible advantages would a domestic stablecoin offer that aren’t already addressed by existing financial mechanisms? Moreover, the Governor pointed out a significant risk: the potential for a won-pegged stablecoin to disrupt the nation’s established monetary system. Introducing a new form of currency, even one pegged to the national fiat, could have unforeseen consequences on: Monetary policy effectiveness Financial stability The existing banking infrastructure These are not trivial concerns for a central bank tasked with maintaining economic stability. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: Domestic vs. Dollar-Pegged One might assume that introducing a domestic won-pegged stablecoin would help stem the tide of foreign-pegged stablecoins, particularly those linked to the U.S. dollar. However, Governor Rhee believes this isn’t necessarily the case. He articulated that issuing a local stablecoin would not automatically prevent the influx or usage of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins within the Korean market. Why this distinction? The reasons are multifaceted: Global Liquidity: U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins often offer greater global liquidity and easier access to international markets. Investor Preference: Some investors might prefer the perceived stability and widespread acceptance of dollar-pegged assets, regardless of local alternatives. Regulatory Arbitrage: Different regulatory frameworks might incentivize the use of foreign stablecoins. Therefore, simply creating a won-pegged stablecoin does not solve the broader challenge of managing cross-border digital asset flows or the preferences of market participants. What Are the Potential Upsides of a Won-Pegged Stablecoin? (Even If Uncertain) While the Bank of Korea maintains a cautious stance, it’s worth considering the general arguments often made for stablecoins, even if their specific benefits for the Korean won are currently deemed uncertain by the Governor. Proponents often highlight: Payment Efficiency: Potential for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. Financial Inclusion: Greater access to financial services for underserved populations. Innovation: Fostering new financial products and services within the digital economy. However, Governor Rhee’s remarks suggest that for South Korea, these potential benefits are not yet compelling enough to outweigh the risks. The central bank’s primary role is to ensure stability, and any new financial instrument must clearly demonstrate its value without compromising this core mandate. The Bank of Korea’s stance reflects a pragmatic approach: prioritize stability and thoroughly assess the value proposition of new digital assets. The conversation around a won-pegged stablecoin is far from over, but for now, the emphasis remains on understanding its true impact before widespread adoption. As the digital finance landscape continues to evolve, central banks like the Bank of Korea will undoubtedly continue their careful evaluation, balancing innovation with the imperative of financial security. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a won-pegged stablecoin? A won-pegged stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won. This means its value should theoretically always be equivalent to one Korean Won. 2. Why is the Bank of Korea cautious about a won-pegged stablecoin? Governor Rhee Chang-yong expressed caution due to the uncertain benefits of such a stablecoin and its potential to disrupt the existing monetary system. The central bank prioritizes financial stability. 3. Will a won-pegged stablecoin stop the use of USD-pegged stablecoins in Korea? Governor Rhee believes that issuing a domestic won-pegged stablecoin would not necessarily prevent the influx or usage of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, citing factors like global liquidity and investor preference. 4. What are the general benefits often associated with stablecoins? Commonly cited benefits include improved payment efficiency, potential for greater financial inclusion, and fostering innovation in digital finance. However, the Bank of Korea questions if these apply compellingly to a won-pegged stablecoin in their context. 5. What is the Bank of Korea’s main priority regarding digital assets? The Bank of Korea’s primary goal is to ensure financial stability. Any new digital asset or financial instrument must clearly demonstrate its value without compromising this core mandate.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Polymarket and CME FedWatch are aligned: the Fed’s easing cycle begins tomorrow. Both have a 25 bps cut locked in for the next FOMC meeting, with odds building for a three-cut path through year-end. Polymarket traders leave more room for aggressive easing, while CME assigns steadier probabilities of 25 bps steps. Either way, markets see 75 bps in cuts as the baseline for 2025. Market conviction around the Fed pivot is already showing up on-chain, with BTC trading at $116,762, up 1.3% on the day and 4.7% on the week, while ETH sits at $4,502, up 4.3% on the week as traders price in the cuts. Now, some traders are sitting on the sidelines to see just how the market might react as the Fed announces cuts. In a recent report, CryptoQuant data shows bitcoin exchange inflows have dropped to a 7-day average of just 25,000 BTC, the lowest in more than a year and a half; the level seen in mid-July when BTC first crossed $120,000. The average BTC deposit size has also halved to 0.57 BTC, evidence that large holders are sitting idle rather than rushing to sell. ETH is seeing the same pattern: exchange inflows have fallen to a two-month low of 783,000 ETH, down sharply from 1.8 million in August. The average ETH deposit has declined to 30 ETH from 40–45 ETH earlier this summer, suggesting reduced sell-side activity from whales. If BTC and ETH are being hoarded, stablecoins are flowing in CryptoQuant writes in its report. USDT deposits into exchanges surged to $379 million at the end of August, the highest this year, and remain elevated at $200 million. The average daily USDT deposit has doubled since July, giving exchanges the “dry powder” needed to support a post-Fed rally. But the flows aren’t uniform. Altcoins are seeing a resurgence of exchange activity, with transaction deposits climbing to a 7-day total of 55,000, up from a flat 20,000–30,000 range earlier this year. That divergence signals possible profit-taking in higher-beta names even as BTC and ETH supply remains tight. ""September brings a wave of token unlocks totaling $4.5 billion, a dynamic that could pressure liquidity and test market absorption,"" OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin wrote in a note to CoinDesk. True opportunity lies beyond short-term volatility, Lin argued. ""Stablecoins are nearing $300 billion in supply, token unlocks are putting market depth to the test, and major infrastructure upgrades like Nasdaq’s move toward tokenized securities are signaling that crypto is becoming part of the global financial system, not an outlier,"" she wrote. The message is clear: the Fed pivot is nearly priced in. What matters now is whether crypto’s liquidity buffers, stablecoins, exchange inflows, and token unlocks can absorb the shocks and channel capital into the next leg higher for BTC. Market Movement BTC: BTC is trading above $116,500 as traders are optimistic about potential U.S. interest rate cuts. Technical factors such as the closing of futures gaps have added upward pressure. Some caution is setting in ahead of the Fed meeting. ETH: ETH is trading with modest strength, supported by overall crypto market momentum (dominated by BTC), but with some resistance as investors weigh macro risks and await clarity on policy from the Fed. Gold: Gold is hitting record highs, driven by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates, a weakening U.S. dollar, and heightened geopolitical or macroeconomic uncertainty. Safe‑haven demand from investors is strong. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks fell on Wednesday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.3%, as investors tracked Wall Street losses and awaited a likely Fed rate cut decision. S&P 500: The S&P 500 slipped 0.13% to 6,606.76 Tuesday as investors booked profits ahead of the Fed’s rate decision after touching a record high earlier.

The measure would block the Federal Reserve from creating or distributing a digital dollar before any such system is formally authorized. The proposal, known as the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and sponsored by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN), already cleared the House in July. Lawmakers aim to fold it into the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, the chamber’s flagship market structure legislation. The proposal emerged in a draft agenda from the House Rules Committee that seemingly would force the CBDC ban to be included in market structure legislation via an “engrossment.” That is, rather than play out in a standalone law, the ban would find its way into the final version of the market structure bill before it heads to the Senate. This will speed passage, lawmakers say. The standalone digital dollar legislation faced challenging margins, and packaging it within a broader digital assets package could give senators more ammunition to fend off objections. The bill is designed not only to bring clarity to the respective roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission but also to establish rules about trading, custody, and issuance for digital assets. With the CBDC ban folded in, it now sits squarely at the center of the U.S. crypto regulatory debate — especially in Discord circles. Lawmakers drive CBDC ban across several bills The CBDC ban is not just in the market structure bill, with lawmakers opting to push it through the once-a-year defense policy bil l, which is commonly referred to as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA is one of the must-pass pieces of legislation, establishing the Pentagon’s budget and defense priorities, which means it almost always gets passed by Congress. By grafting the CBDC ban onto this vehicle, lawmakers are opting for one of the surest pathways to ram through a contentious measure. This tactic also makes it harder for critics to prevent the provision from moving forward; voting against the NDAA would be perceived as standing in the way of military funds and defense planning at a time when tensions are escalating around potential international flash points. The provision included in the NDAA is unequivocal. It prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing, testing, or offering its own central bank digital currency. This ban is to work retroactively, blocking the startup of a potential future CBDC and any existing pilot programs or research projects. Supporters say the amendment sends a message to Congress against Fed policy in any administration. Privacy and competition battles heat up Proponents of the ban claim a CBDC could infringe on personal freedom. They caution that a digital dollar could enable the government to track, monitor, or restrict how citizens spend their money. They see a CBDC ban as a firewall against state surveillance and financial manipulation. Cynics, however, say that by banning a CBDC outright, the U.S. risks being left behind other major economies. China has already introduced its digital yuan, and the European Union is moving toward a digital euro. Economists and fintech experts warn that even the lack of an option for a CBDC leaves the U.S. in danger of losing its lead as global financial markets shift to new players .

A groundbreaking development recently emerged from the UK’s LMAX Group, a prominent fintech firm. They are now offering Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures trading with an astonishing up to 100x leverage, as reported by Bloomberg. This move signifies a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency landscape, providing sophisticated investors with powerful new tools. LMAX Group, known for processing an average of over $40 billion in daily spot trading volume, is not just dipping its toes; it’s making a bold leap. The company is launching cash-settled contracts specifically linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This initiative directly addresses the growing demand from institutional clients for more dynamic and leveraged access to the crypto market. What Are Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures and Why Now? Perpetual futures are a unique type of derivatives contract in the crypto space. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. LMAX Group’s decision to offer Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures stems from a clear understanding of market trends. They recognized that this market segment has been a core part of the crypto industry for the past four years, attracting significant retail and now institutional interest. Institutional investors are constantly seeking efficient ways to gain exposure to digital assets, manage risk, and potentially amplify returns. Leverage, in this context, allows them to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. For well-capitalized and risk-managed institutions, 100x leverage can be a powerful tool for strategic trading and hedging. LMAX Group’s Bold Move: A Catalyst for Institutional Crypto Growth? The introduction of such high-leverage Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures by a regulated entity like LMAX Group is a significant game-changer. It legitimizes and formalizes a product previously more associated with retail-focused, often unregulated, platforms. This move is not isolated; it reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption and the maturation of the crypto derivatives market. Consider these key impacts: Enhanced Market Liquidity: More institutional participation typically leads to deeper liquidity, making markets more efficient and less prone to sudden price swings. Sophisticated Risk Management: Institutions can strategically use these instruments for hedging existing crypto holdings, managing exposure, or speculating on price movements without direct ownership of the underlying assets. Increased Accessibility: For institutions, trading with a trusted and regulated provider like LMAX Group reduces counterparty risk and operational complexities, fostering greater confidence in the market. Competitive Landscape: This service follows similar launches, indicating a growing institutional appetite. Coinbase Financial Markets launched a comparable service in July, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has also announced plans for its own version in October, intensifying the race for institutional crypto market share. Navigating the Dynamics: Opportunities and Challenges for Institutional Crypto While the opportunities are significant, institutional clients engaging with Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures must also navigate potential challenges. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, combined with high leverage, means that positions can move dramatically in a short period. Robust risk management frameworks and a deep understanding of market dynamics are paramount for institutions utilizing these products. However, the opportunities for growth and innovation are equally compelling: Arbitrage Strategies: Institutions can capitalize on price discrepancies between spot markets and perpetual futures, generating profits from market inefficiencies. Capital Efficiency: Leverage allows institutions to deploy capital more efficiently across various strategies, optimizing their investment portfolios and maximizing potential returns. Market Maturation: The entry of established players like LMAX Group, alongside Coinbase and CBOE, signals the increasing institutionalization of the crypto derivatives market. This pushes the entire industry towards higher standards of compliance, regulation, and investor protection. This evolving landscape suggests a future where digital assets are more deeply integrated into global financial systems, offering diverse avenues for investment and risk management. LMAX Group’s launch of 100x leverage Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing demand from institutional investors for sophisticated, high-leverage trading products within a regulated framework. This move, alongside similar initiatives from other major financial players, is accelerating the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem. As the market continues to evolve, these offerings will undoubtedly shape how institutions interact with Bitcoin and Ethereum, paving the way for further innovation and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are perpetual futures in the context of cryptocurrency? A1: Perpetual futures are a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, without an expiry date. This means positions can be held indefinitely, unlike traditional futures contracts. Q2: How does 100x leverage work with perpetual futures? A2: 100x leverage means an investor can control a position worth 100 times their initial capital. For example, with $1,000, they could open a position worth $100,000. While this can amplify profits, it also significantly increases the risk of losses. Q3: Why is LMAX Group offering these products to institutions? A3: LMAX Group recognized a strong demand from institutional investors for leveraged market access to cryptocurrencies. They identified perpetual futures as a core part of the crypto industry that institutions want to engage with, within a regulated and secure environment. Q4: Which cryptocurrencies are supported for these perpetual futures?

This colossal shift, reported by the reputable on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, immediately sparked widespread discussion among market participants and analysts alike. What could this significant Bitcoin transfer signify for the future trajectory of the crypto market? Unpacking This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Event Just eight hours prior to the report, a fresh address, identified as starting with bc1qup, received a monumental Bitcoin transfer . Specifically, 5,816 BTC, valued at an astonishing $680 million, was moved from FalconX. As a prominent prime brokerage for institutional investors, FalconX’s involvement strongly suggests a meticulously calculated move by a major financial entity. Such a large-scale Bitcoin transfer naturally raises crucial questions about its underlying motivations. Who orchestrated this colossal transfer? FalconX’s role points towards an institutional entity or a high-net-worth individual. Why did this transfer happen now? The timing could be strategically linked to market conditions, portfolio rebalancing, or preparations for upcoming market events. What Does This Bitcoin Transfer Mean for the Market? A Bitcoin transfer of this immense magnitude rarely occurs without significant underlying activity or strategic intent. There are several compelling interpretations, each carrying different implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Firstly, it could represent a substantial institutional investor shifting funds into cold storage for long-term holding. This best practice secures digital assets away from online exchanges, reducing exposure to hacks or regulatory risks. If true, it could be a profoundly bullish signal, indicating strong conviction in Bitcoin’s enduring value. Secondly, this Bitcoin transfer might be the settlement of an over-the-counter (OTC) deal. Institutional players frequently execute large trades directly to prevent price slippage. The funds could be moving to a new custodian or directly to a buyer’s wallet following such a private transaction. Thirdly, the transfer could simply be an internal reorganization by FalconX or one of its major clients. Large financial institutions routinely rebalance their digital asset holdings across various wallets or custodians to optimize efficiency and enhance security. In this scenario, the Bitcoin transfer is more about internal asset management rather than a direct market indicator. Tracking Significant Bitcoin Transfers: Insights for Investors Observing and analyzing large Bitcoin transfer s offers invaluable insights into overall market sentiment and potential future price movements. Blockchain analytics firms, like Lookonchain, play an indispensable role in bringing transparency to these on-chain movements. By diligently tracking these “whale” transactions, experienced analysts can often infer whether major holders are accumulating, distributing, or simply securing their substantial investments. Key insights derived from monitoring large transfers: Market Sentiment: Consistent transfers to cold storage often suggest long-term bullish sentiment among large holders. Potential Price Impact: While this specific Bitcoin transfer did not directly involve an exchange deposit, any subsequent movements from the receiving address (bc1qup) to an exchange could potentially signal impending selling pressure. Institutional Adoption: The involvement of prime brokers like FalconX in these transactions strongly underscores the accelerating pace of institutional participation and confidence within the crypto ecosystem. Understanding these complex on-chain dynamics empowers investors to make more informed decisions, allowing them to anticipate potential market shifts rather than merely reacting to them. Navigating the Future After This Monumental Bitcoin Transfer The recent colossal Bitcoin transfer vividly underscores the continuous evolution of the cryptocurrency market. As more institutional capital flows into Bitcoin, we can expect similar large-scale movements to become increasingly common. These transfers, while sometimes mysterious, serve as a powerful testament to the growing maturity and sophisticated infrastructure now supporting digital assets globally. For everyday retail investors, the paramount lesson is to remain well-informed and to understand that not every large transfer signals an impending price crash or an immediate pump. More often than not, they are highly strategic, calculated maneuvers executed by sophisticated entities. This particular Bitcoin transfer , moving to a brand-new address from an established institutional platform, strongly leans towards a security-focused or long-term strategic holding narrative, rather than suggesting immediate selling pressure on the market. What key indicators to watch for next: Any subsequent movements or activity originating from the bc1qup address. Further detailed reports and analyses from leading on-chain analytics firms. The overall market reaction and prevailing sentiment in the wake of such a significant event. In conclusion, this monumental $680 million Bitcoin transfer from FalconX is a powerful and unmistakable reminder of the significant capital and strategic depth within the crypto ecosystem. While its exact purpose remains a subject of informed speculation, it undeniably highlights the deep pockets and calculated maneuvers of major players in the digital asset space. Keeping a close eye on such impactful events is absolutely crucial for anyone aiming to truly understand the pulse and direction of the Bitcoin market.

Each transfer needs context. Q4: How can I track large Bitcoin transfers? A: You can follow blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Whale Alert, or Glassnode, which specialize in monitoring and reporting significant on-chain movements. Q5: What is FalconX’s role in this transfer? A: FalconX is a prime brokerage that provides trading, credit, and clearing services for institutional investors in the digital asset space.

What Prompted the Yala Token Burn? The recent incident saw unauthorized YU tokens issued, raising concerns within the community.

By destroying the illicitly created YU tokens, the protocol effectively eliminates any supply that entered the ecosystem without proper authorization. This action is paramount for maintaining the integrity of the YU token’s economic model and preventing potential market instability caused by the unexpected supply. It also serves as a powerful signal to the community: Yala is proactive in neutralizing threats and preserving the legitimate value of its assets. This commitment builds confidence among users and investors, reinforcing the protocol’s reliability. Yala’s Proactive Stance: Beyond the Immediate Threat This incident highlights the constant vigilance required in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Yala’s rapid identification of the unauthorized tokens and the subsequent recovery efforts underscore its robust operational security. The protocol is not just reacting; it is setting a precedent for how a Bitcoin-native platform responds to external threats. Prioritizing asset security and user confidence is central to Yala’s operations. Users can take comfort in the fact that Yala’s core infrastructure and BTC holdings were unaffected, reinforcing its foundational strength. This proactive approach ensures long-term stability. The upcoming Yala token burn is a testament to this commitment, demonstrating that the protocol is actively working to protect its ecosystem from potential risks and maintain a secure environment for its participants. What Does the Future Hold After the Yala Token Burn? With the unauthorized tokens removed, Yala can focus squarely on its long-term vision for Bitcoin-native liquidity. The successful execution of the Yala token burn will likely restore and even strengthen community trust, demonstrating resilience and accountability in the face of adversity.

It showcases the importance of swift action and transparent communication when security breaches occur. Yala’s journey continues, building upon a foundation of security and innovation in the Bitcoin-native liquidity space. The protocol remains dedicated to advancing its mission and providing a reliable platform for its users. The upcoming Yala token burn is more than just a technical procedure; it’s a testament to the protocol’s dedication to security, transparency, and its community.

Koscom, a prominent financial IT firm, is making a significant move into the digital asset space, particularly with its sights set on a won-denominated Koscom stablecoin . This proactive step signals a strategic shift and highlights the growing importance of digital currencies in traditional finance. What’s Driving Koscom’s Stablecoin Ambition? The Korea Economic Daily recently reported that Koscom has filed five distinct trademark applications related to a won-denominated stablecoin. These applications, including names like “KSDC,” “KRW24,” “KRW365,” “KOSWON,” and “KORWON,” clearly indicate Koscom’s intent to establish a strong presence in this evolving market. It’s a clear signal that they are not just observing but actively preparing to launch their own digital currency offerings. Why is a Koscom stablecoin so important? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or, in this case, the Korean Won. This stability makes them ideal for various financial transactions, remittances, and even as a bridge between traditional finance and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Reorganizing for Digital Dominance: The New Task Force Koscom isn’t just filing trademarks; they’re also restructuring internally to support this ambitious venture. The company has elevated its Future Business Division, transforming it into a dedicated Digital Asset Business Promotion Task Force. This new task force now reports directly to the CEO, underscoring the strategic priority and company-wide commitment to digital assets. This organizational change aims to: Enhance Organizational Standing: Giving the digital asset initiative a direct line to top leadership. Strengthen Company-Wide Momentum: Ensuring resources and focus are aligned across departments. Reflect Growing Importance: Acknowledging the undeniable rise of stablecoins and other digital assets in the global financial arena. This strategic realignment demonstrates Koscom’s dedication to becoming a key player in the digital asset sector, particularly with its potential Koscom stablecoin . Why Are Stablecoins So Important Now? The global financial landscape is rapidly embracing digital innovation, and stablecoins are at the forefront of this transformation.

Accessibility: Stablecoins can provide financial services to a broader population, including those underserved by traditional banks. Innovation: They lay the groundwork for new financial products and services, driving further advancements in fintech. For South Korea, a won-denominated Koscom stablecoin could streamline domestic payments, enhance international trade, and position the nation as a leader in digital finance innovation. What Challenges Might Koscom Face? While the prospects for a Koscom stablecoin are exciting, the path ahead is not without its hurdles. Navigating the regulatory landscape will be paramount. South Korea has been cautious but progressive in its approach to digital assets, and any new stablecoin offering will need to comply with evolving financial regulations, including: Consumer Protection: Ensuring the security and stability of the stablecoin for users. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Implementing robust measures to prevent illicit activities. Market Stability: Addressing concerns about the potential impact on the broader financial system. Furthermore, competition from other stablecoin projects, both domestic and international, will require Koscom to differentiate its offering through unique features, robust technology, and strong partnerships. Koscom’s proactive stance with its trademark applications and internal restructuring signals a strong commitment to pioneering the future of finance in South Korea. The potential for a won-denominated Koscom stablecoin could unlock new efficiencies and opportunities, not just for the company but for the entire Korean economy. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, Koscom’s journey will be one to watch closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. It achieves this by pegging its value to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency (like the Korean Won or US Dollar), a commodity (like gold), or a basket of assets. What is Koscom’s main goal with these stablecoin trademark applications? Koscom’s main goal is to proactively enter the digital asset market, specifically with a won-denominated stablecoin. This move aims to leverage the stability of the Korean Won within the efficiency of blockchain technology for various financial applications. How will Koscom’s new Digital Asset Business Promotion Task Force impact its strategy? The new task force, reporting directly to the CEO, elevates the importance of digital assets within Koscom. It is designed to enhance organizational standing, strengthen company-wide momentum, and accelerate their entry and innovation in the digital asset sector, including the development of a Koscom stablecoin . What are the potential benefits of a won-denominated stablecoin for South Korea? A won-denominated stablecoin could offer benefits such as faster and cheaper domestic and international transactions, increased financial inclusion, and a foundation for innovative new financial products and services within South Korea’s economy. What challenges might Koscom face in launching a stablecoin? Key challenges include navigating complex and evolving regulatory frameworks in South Korea, ensuring robust security and consumer protection, and competing with existing or upcoming stablecoin projects in the market.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with an unprecedented event: a massive SOL accumulation by a suspected institutional investor. This significant move has seen an address withdraw a staggering 413,075 SOL, valued at an incredible $98.4 million, from various exchanges. This substantial withdrawal, reported by Lookonchain via FalconX, signals a potentially bullish outlook for Solana and warrants a closer look into its implications. Unveiling the Mystery: Who’s Behind This Massive SOL Accumulation? Over the past eight hours, a specific address, believed to belong to an institutional investor, executed a series of large withdrawals. This entity utilized FalconX, a prime brokerage platform, to consolidate its holdings. The sheer volume of this SOL accumulation suggests a calculated and strategic investment rather than a casual trade. Such significant movements often indicate high conviction from large players. Institutional investors typically conduct extensive due diligence before deploying such substantial capital. Therefore, this SOL accumulation could reflect a strong belief in Solana’s long-term potential and technological advancements. Why Does SOL Institutional Accumulation Matter? When institutions enter the market with such force, it often sends ripples throughout the entire ecosystem. Institutional SOL accumulation provides a crucial validation for the asset. It suggests that traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the value and stability of decentralized networks like Solana. Increased Confidence: Large investments by institutions can boost retail investor confidence, potentially attracting more capital. Market Stability: Institutional involvement can sometimes lead to greater market stability due to their typically longer investment horizons. Legitimacy: It lends further legitimacy to Solana as a serious contender in the blockchain space, moving beyond speculative retail interest. Demand Signal: A major SOL accumulation clearly signals a strong demand for the asset, which can influence future price action. Navigating the Waters: Potential Impacts of Significant SOL Accumulation This substantial withdrawal is not just a headline; it carries tangible implications for Solana’s market dynamics. Firstly, it reduces the circulating supply of SOL on exchanges, which can create upward price pressure if demand remains consistent or increases. Moreover, the sheer size of the transaction means a significant portion of available SOL has been moved into cold storage or private wallets, away from immediate selling pressure. However, it is also important to consider the potential for volatility. While initial reactions might be bullish, such large holdings can also exert selling pressure if the institution decides to liquidate in the future. Therefore, market participants should remain vigilant and observe subsequent on-chain activities. Price Appreciation Potential: Reduced supply on exchanges often correlates with price increases.

In his weekly “Market Outlook #51,” published on September 15, Nik Patel (@cointradernik) for Ostium Research maps out both long and short triggers around a tight cluster of resistance at $117.5k–$120k and a “line in the sand” support at $112k—frameworks he argues should contain BTC’s path through the FOMC and into quarter-end. How To Trade Bitcoin Into September FOMC Nik’s higher-timeframe read starts with a strong weekly close that reclaimed the August open near $115.3k and, crucially, kept price above $112k. “This is now the line in the sand for short-term bullishness,” he writes, warning that a weekly close back below would reopen the route to July’s local lows around $107k and, in a deeper flush, the $99k swing low. To the upside, he highlights $117.5k as the next inflection; a clean acceptance over $120k would set up a swift run at all-time highs, where $123k is the first major cap on the daily timeframe. Into the event, his directional bias remains conditional rather than dogmatic. On the long side, he favors a liquidity sweep early in the week: “On the long side you want to see a sharp flush lower… into $113.5k, where you could layer bids with invalidation on a daily close below $112k,” aiming for a reaction back to $117.5k (TP1) and $119k (TP2) into the FOMC. Related Reading: Analyst Raises Red Flags On Bitcoin Price: Allegations Of Market Manipulation Conversely, if BTC grinds higher without that flush, his short plan is to “short above $119k pre-FOMC,” then “add… on acceptance back below $117.5k post-FOMC,” with $112k as the first target and scope to trail for lower lows if structure weakens. The trader concedes the next couple of weeks are “a lot more unclear… with many variables,” but his base case still envisions “the second half of Q4 will be very strong.” The setup lands as BTC churns around $115k ahead of the decision—a zone multiple analysts have framed as pivotal. Heading into the weekly close, market commentary stressed that a sustained reclaim of ~$114k is a prerequisite for renewed momentum, with one widely tracked technician arguing, “The goal isn’t for Bitcoin to break $117k… The goal is for Bitcoin to reclaim $114k into support first.” Over the weekend and into Tuesday, BTC’s price action remained pinned in that band, keeping both the upside break toward $119k–$123k and the downside sweep into $113.5k–$112k on the table. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set For Short Squeeze Before Long Trap In October Macro context heightens the stakes. Markets broadly expect the Fed to cut its policy rate by 25 bps on September 17, shifting the target range from 4.50% to 4.25%—a baseline Nik explicitly builds into his calendar. Yet traders are equally focused on Chair Jerome Powell’s guidance and the updated “dot plot,” which will shape the path for additional cuts into year-end. While a cut is priced, the tone—whether the Fed signals a shallow or accelerated easing path—could be the catalyst that resolves BTC’s tight $114k–$119k coil. Positioning provides further texture to Nik’s plan. He flags three-month annualized basis and the split between Bitcoin and altcoin open interest, along with concentrated one-week and one-month liquidation pockets just below spot and above the recent range highs—context for why he prefers either reactive longs on a downside flush or fades into strength near $119k–$120k if derivatives chase the move. The framework leans heavily on acceptance/rejection around well-defined levels rather than attempting to front-run the policy outcome itself. Bottom line: in the Ostium playbook, bulls want a controlled dip that holds $112k on a daily closing basis and then forces a reclaim of $117.5k on the way to $119k–$123k; bears get their best shot if price runs late into $119k–$120k pre-FOMC and then loses $117.5k on the reaction. With BTC glued to the mid-$110ks and the market already bracing for a quarter-point cut, the catalyst may come down to Powell’s nuance. At press time, BTC traded at $115,427.

Symbiotic, Chainlink, And Lombard Team Up On Monday, staking protocol Symbiotic announced its partnership with decentralized oracle provider Chainlink and Bitcoin DeFi protocol Lombard to launch the industry’s first-of-its-kind guarantee layer for cross-chain Bitcoin transfers. The collaboration integrates Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to secure transfers of Lombard Staked Bitcoin (LBTC) across blockchains. Additionally, it introduces two new Symbiotic vaults, backed by a Symbiotic-powered monitoring network that verifies LBTC transfers via CCIP and issues alerts in case of discrepancies, the team detailed. One of the staking vaults will hold up to $100 million of Chainlink’s native token, LINK, while the other will have 20 million of Lombard’s upcoming native token, BARD. Notably, the Bitcoin DeFi protocol recently discussed the launch of its native token on X, stating, “Lombard is redefining how Bitcoin moves. At the core of this movement is BARD.” The protocol revealed that the tokenomics will be shared on September 16, while the airdrop and other participant allocation claims will take place on September 18. The integration will introduce immediate token utility for BARD holders, the announcement explained, by enabling staking into the vault via the Lombard App to secure cross-chain LBTC transfers while earning up to 15% APY. Moreover, Symbiotic’s modular architecture will allow Lombard and partners to dynamically customize protection levels, with value transferred and no disruption to ongoing operations, “positioning this model as foundational infrastructure for the next generation of cross-chain DeFi security.” ‘A New Standard’ For Cross-Chain Bitcoin Transfers According to the statement, the integration will deliver a “dual-layer protection system that scales with demand while setting a new standard for cross-chain Bitcoin derivatives” by combining Symbiotic’s permissionless restaking, CCIP’s modular security, and Lombard’s Bitcoin infrastructure . This collaboration not only reinforces LBTC’s position as the leading institutional-grade, yield-bearing Bitcoin asset trusted by top DeFi protocols, but also establishes a replicable framework for securing broader DeFi infrastructure such as oracles and settlement layers, creating systemic resilience that strengthens with network growth. Misha Putiatin, Symbiotic’s co-founder, affirmed that the protocol “turns passive crypto assets into modular, active security infrastructure,” adding that “Integrating our restaking framework with Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain LBTC transfers showcases how decentralized collateral can be deployed quickly and permissionlessly to reinforce cross-chain value flows and deliver tangible benefits to end users.” Meanwhile, Jacob Phillips, Lombard’s Co-founder, highlighted that LBTC is “a chain asset, meeting demand across networks rather than being confined to one.” He noted that holders seek the freedom to move their Bitcoin wherever the best opportunities are, but without compromising security. To address that, Phillips explained that “pairing CCIP’s modular architecture with Symbiotic’s restaked collateral gives our community stronger economic guarantees through staking. Each BARD staked reinforces the robustness of LBTC, aligning incentives and strengthening the integrity of our interoperability stack.”",Crypto News|bard|Bitcoin Transfers|btc|BTCUSDT|chainlink|cross-chain Bitcoin transfers|DeFi Bitcoin Protocol|Guarantee layer|LBTC|LINK|Lombard|Staking protocol|Symbiotic,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|LINK|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 02:00:40

This isn’t just another discussion; it’s a significant opportunity for the industry to directly engage with lawmakers shaping its future. Why This US Senate Crypto Meeting Holds Immense Importance Tomorrow morning, as reported by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, citing multiple sources, this high-stakes US Senate crypto meeting will commence. It brings together key players from both sides: innovative crypto executives and influential U.S. senators. The stakes are incredibly high, as the outcomes could dictate the regulatory landscape for digital assets for years to come. For too long, the crypto industry has grappled with regulatory uncertainty. Different agencies often have conflicting views, leading to a patchwork of rules that makes innovation and compliance challenging. This direct engagement offers a chance for clarity and a more unified approach. Key Discussion Points at the US Senate Crypto Meeting The agenda for this pivotal US Senate crypto meeting is packed with critical topics that have long been at the forefront of regulatory debates. These discussions are expected to delve into the fundamental nature of digital assets and how they should be classified under existing law. Classifying Securities and Commodities: A major point of contention has been whether specific cryptocurrencies should be treated as securities, subject to SEC oversight, or as commodities, falling under the CFTC’s purview. Clear definitions are essential for market participants. The Treatment of DeFi: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) presents a unique challenge due to its permissionless and often anonymous nature. Lawmakers are keen to understand how to regulate DeFi to protect consumers without stifling its innovative potential. Other Key Issues: Broader discussions will likely include stablecoin regulation, anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, and consumer protection frameworks. These conversations are not merely academic; they have real-world implications for how crypto businesses operate, how investors participate, and how the U.S. positions itself as a leader in financial innovation. Challenges and Opportunities Arising from the US Senate Crypto Meeting While the prospect of clearer regulation is exciting, this US Senate crypto meeting also highlights significant challenges. The crypto industry often operates on principles of decentralization and open access, which can clash with traditional regulatory models designed for centralized financial institutions. Challenges: Divergent Perspectives: Bridging the gap between the rapid pace of technological innovation and the often slow, deliberate process of legislative action is a monumental task. Risk of Over-Regulation: There is always a concern that overly stringent regulations could stifle innovation, pushing development offshore and limiting the U.S.’s competitive edge in the digital asset space. Opportunities: Enhanced Consumer Protection: A well-defined regulatory framework can build trust among mainstream investors, encouraging wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Market Stability: Clear rules can lead to more stable markets, attracting institutional capital and fostering greater confidence in the asset class. Innovation with Guardrails: Thoughtful regulation can provide the necessary guardrails for innovation to flourish responsibly, ensuring that new technologies serve the public good. The dialogue at this meeting is crucial for finding a balanced approach that protects consumers and financial stability while also fostering innovation. What’s Next After the US Senate Crypto Meeting? The immediate outcome of this US Senate crypto meeting might not be new legislation, but rather a deeper understanding and a pathway forward. These discussions are often the first step in a longer process of policy formulation. We can expect to see further hearings, white papers, and potentially draft legislation emerging in the coming months. For crypto firms, the actionable insight is clear: continued engagement with policymakers is vital. Staying informed and prepared for potential regulatory shifts will be key to navigating the evolving landscape. For investors, these developments signal a maturing industry, albeit one still finding its footing within established financial systems. This engagement between crypto leaders and U.S. senators is a testament to the growing influence and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. The outcomes of this US Senate crypto meeting will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of the industry, setting precedents for how innovation and regulation can coexist. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary purpose of the US Senate crypto meeting?

Investors in US spot ETH ETFs have just witnessed a notable shift, as these funds recorded net outflows, breaking a five-day streak of positive inflows. This sudden reversal has caught the attention of many, prompting questions about what might be driving this change and what it could mean for the broader Ethereum market. What Caused the Sudden Shift in US Spot ETH ETFs ? On September 16, a significant change occurred for US spot ETH ETFs . These investment vehicles collectively saw $61.84 million in net outflows. This figure, equivalent to approximately 85.4 billion Korean Won, marks a clear pivot from the trend observed over the preceding five trading days, which had all reported net inflows. The data, compiled by Trader T, highlights that not all funds experienced the same fate. The majority of the outflows were concentrated in two major players: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund experienced substantial outflows totaling $20.44 million. Fidelity’s FETH: Even larger outflows were recorded here, amounting to $48.15 million. Interestingly, one fund managed to buck the trend. Bitwise’s ETHW actually recorded net inflows, adding $6.75 million to its holdings on the same day. This mixed performance suggests a nuanced market environment rather than a uniform bearish sentiment across all US spot ETH ETFs . Why Do US Spot ETH ETFs Outflows Matter? The shift from inflows to outflows in US spot ETH ETFs is more than just a daily statistic; it can signal evolving investor sentiment. For five consecutive days, capital had been flowing into these Ethereum-backed exchange-traded funds, indicating growing institutional and retail interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. However, this recent outflow could suggest several possibilities: Profit-Taking: After a period of potential price appreciation, some investors might be cashing out to secure profits. Market Reassessment: Investors might be re-evaluating their positions in response to broader economic news, regulatory updates, or changes in the overall crypto market outlook. Short-Term Volatility: It could simply be a natural fluctuation in a highly dynamic market, where daily flows can swing significantly based on various factors. Understanding these movements is crucial because ETFs often act as a barometer for institutional adoption and broader market confidence. When major funds like BlackRock and Fidelity see outflows, it can influence market perception, even if it’s a short-term phenomenon. Navigating the Volatility: Insights for US Spot ETH ETFs Investors For those invested in or considering US spot ETH ETFs , such daily fluctuations are a reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. While a single day of outflows doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend, it does highlight the importance of staying informed and adopting a strategic approach. What should investors consider in light of these developments? Long-Term Perspective: Daily flows can be noisy. A long-term investment thesis for Ethereum and its ecosystem should ideally not be swayed by short-term movements. Diversification: As with any investment, diversifying your portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with specific assets or funds. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on broader market news, macroeconomic indicators, and regulatory changes that could impact the cryptocurrency space and, by extension, US spot ETH ETFs . The fact that Bitwise’s ETHW still saw inflows suggests that investor sentiment isn’t uniformly negative. Some investors might be shifting funds between different ETF providers, or new capital is entering certain funds while existing capital exits others. This dynamic interplay is typical of maturing markets. The recent net outflows from US spot ETH ETFs , ending a positive five-day streak, serve as a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH experienced significant withdrawals, Bitwise’s ETHW managed to attract new capital. This mixed picture underscores that market sentiment is complex and influenced by various factors, from profit-taking to broader economic considerations. For investors, these movements highlight the importance of a well-informed, long-term strategy, rather than reacting to every daily fluctuation. The journey of institutional adoption for Ethereum is still unfolding, and these ETFs will continue to be a key indicator of its progress. Frequently Asked Questions About US Spot ETH ETFs Here are some common questions regarding the recent performance and broader implications of US spot ETH ETFs. Q: What is a US spot ETH ETF? A: A US spot ETH ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Q: Why did US spot ETH ETFs see outflows after five days of inflows? A: The shift to outflows on September 16 could be due to several factors, including investors taking profits after a period of positive performance, a broader market reassessment influenced by economic news, or simply short-term market volatility. It indicates a change in immediate investor sentiment. Q: How do these outflows impact the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A: While direct causation is complex, significant outflows from US spot ETH ETFs can contribute to negative market sentiment, potentially putting downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. However, the overall impact depends on many other market factors and the scale of the outflows relative to the total market cap. Q: Are all US spot ETH ETFs experiencing the same trend? A: Not necessarily. As seen on September 16, while BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH experienced outflows, Bitwise’s ETHW recorded net inflows. This suggests that investor activity can vary across different funds, possibly due to fund-specific strategies, fees, or investor preferences. Q: Should investors be concerned about these outflows? A: A single day of outflows doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term problem. Investors should view these movements within a broader context, considering their own investment goals and risk tolerance. It’s crucial to focus on long-term trends and fundamental analysis rather than reacting to daily fluctuations. Found this analysis of US spot ETH ETFs insightful?

51853108,https://invezz.com/?p=2884808,1758075973,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Best crypto that should be in your portfolio, a utility token to explode 300x faster than SHIB did in 2021",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/17/best-crypto-that-should-be-in-your-portfolio-a-utility-token-to-explode-300x-faster-than-shib-did-in-2021/,"When meme coins were all the rage in 2021, SHIB’s meteoric rise, which saw it rise more than 300 times in only a few months, was one of the most talked-about tales. That surge was all hype, thanks to memes and commotion on social media. But the surge didn’t have any genuine use behind it, which is why traders frequently wonder what is going on with crypto now that might lead to such big gains, but with real fundamentals. Analysts say that the solution clearly goes to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility token that is building up to provide a comparable multiplier but with better mechanisms, more reasons to use it, and more real-world use. From meme hype to utility growth The SHIB rally in 2021 was a strange event that was fueled by speculation. Investors got in because they thought other people would, but there were no built-in ways to keep demand going for a long time, so it was just a one-time thing on crypto charts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is building its token on an ecosystem that is meant to keep demand high. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized stablecoin that is linked to $1 at its core. This stablecoin will only be made from assets that are overcollateralized, like ETH, SOL, or AVAX. There will be rigorous regulations for issuing it, and accounts will be capped, and smart contracts will be used to enforce them. Decentralized governance will set the borrowing costs, which will change automatically to keep the peg stable. Liquidations will happen automatically, which will keep both lenders and borrowers secure, even if the price of crypto crashes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) loans on top of this stablecoin technology. People will be able to borrow stablecoins against meme tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. Others will be able to get P2C loans against blue-chip tokens and stablecoins. This makes it appealing to a wide range of people, bringing together both serious and speculative investors into one ecosystem. The disparity in results is obvious when you look at instances of investors. Someone who took part in Phase 1 and put up $5,000 when MUTM was worth $0.01 got 500,000 tokens. That bag is worth $17,500 by Phase 6, when the token is worth $0.035. That’s 3.5X what it was worth before the platform was began. If you follow that same path along the 300x path that experts expect, you will get $1.5 million. This shows how a utility-driven token can beat meme currency hype by combining genuine usage with growth potential. The goal of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is to be efficient as well. Transactions will be quicker and cheaper with Layer-2 integration than with typical Layer-1 blockchains. This will make it more appealing for use in the real world. When it first comes out, a beta version of the loan and stablecoin minting platform will already be active, which will create demand for MUTM right away as people start testing it. Presale momentum and credibility anchors The presale stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving along quickly. Phase 6 is now open, and tokens cost $0.035 each. More than $15.85 million has already been raised, and 40% of the supply has been sold to more than 16,350 investors. The price will go up by 15% to $0.040 once Phase 7 starts. This means that this is the last chance for investors to buy tokens at a discount before they are listed. These reduced entry locations provide traders the best opportunity to make money on crypto investments. The strategy for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stresses trust and responsibility. CertiK did an outside audit of the project and gave it a score of 90.00 on Token Scan and 79.00 on Skynet, which shows that the smart contracts are secure and the ecosystem is strong. There is a live bug bounty program with incentives ranging from $200 for minor bugs to $2,000 for major bugs. This ensures that security improvements will continue. In addition to this, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on that rewards people for becoming involved in the community and spreading the word. Phase 4 of the roadmap will provide multi-chain growth, which will turn Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into a cross-network DeFi ecosystem. Along with the token listing, a beta version of the platform will be released. This will provide rapid pressure on early users to employ the borrowing, lending, and stablecoin minting features. Final words SHIB’s rise in 2021 demonstrated how quickly retail speculation can impact markets, but it didn’t really do anything useful. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering both a token linked to a real DeFi ecosystem and a development path that experts think will lead to 300X quicker adoption than SHIB’s hype run. MUTM is pitching itself as the greatest cryptocurrency to add to your portfolio this year. It has already doubled the profits of early investors, has innovative lending mechanisms, and a solid roadmap supported by audits and incentives. If you’re trying to figure out where the next big wave in crypto will come from, don’t look at meme coins. Look at utility tokens that are based on adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is that coin. It has the potential for huge growth and a way to be around for a long time.

It’s the foundation of decentralized finance, NFTs, tokenization, and Layer 2 scaling solutions. But beyond the headlines and price charts, there are elements of Ethereum’s story that most investors overlook. These details explain why ETH continues to dominate attention heading into the next bull market, and why it remains a pillar of the digital asset ecosystem. At the same time, history shows that every bull run produces new stars alongside established giants. Just as Ethereum once emerged from obscurity to define an era, new projects are positioning themselves to do the same today. One name leading that charge is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a presale whose forecasts are drawing comparisons to early ETH and even PEPE’s meteoric rise. With projections of 15,500% ROI , it is being hailed as one of the most explosive early-stage breakouts in modern crypto history. Fact 1: Ethereum wasn’t always meant to be money Unlike Bitcoin, which was created purely as digital cash, Ethereum began life as a world computer , a programmable blockchain for decentralized applications. Vitalik Buterin and the early team weren’t focused on making ETH a currency, but on enabling smart contracts and self-executing code. This distinction explains why Ethereum evolved into the bedrock of DeFi and NFTs, while Bitcoin stayed closer to its “digital gold” narrative. Fact 2: The Ethereum Foundation holds less ETH than you think Despite its central role in Ethereum’s development, the Ethereum Foundation controls less than 0.3% of all ETH in circulation . That’s far less than many assume, reflecting a deliberate effort to keep the ecosystem decentralized. Most of Ethereum’s supply is distributed across exchanges, long-term holders, staking pools, and DeFi protocols. This distribution helps reduce concentration risks and gives the network resilience that extends beyond any single entity. Fact 3: Ethereum dominates tokenization experiments While headlines focus on NFTs and DeFi, Ethereum has quietly become the backbone of real-world asset tokenization . From bonds and treasuries to real estate and commodities, financial giants are piloting projects that run on Ethereum. BlackRock’s foray into tokenized funds, for example, leverages Ethereum infrastructure. This dominance positions ETH as more than just a crypto asset, it’s becoming part of global financial plumbing. Ethereum’s history shows how transformative early entries can be. Investors who backed ETH in its infancy saw astronomical returns as it evolved into a pillar of crypto. Today, some analysts argue MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a similar asymmetry. Forecasts of 15,500% ROI have already put it in a league of its own. Unlike many presales, it has legitimacy through HashEx and CertiK audits , scarcity-driven tokenomics, and viral cultural branding. Demand is so intense that presale allocations are selling out within hours. The PATRIOT50X bonus code is adding fuel, giving early participants 50% more tokens and deepening the sense of urgency. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its dual-threat identity : meme energy that spreads fast across Telegram and X, paired with smart tokenomics designed to sustain momentum. For traders who missed early ETH or PEPE, the narrative is clear, this feels like a second-chance lottery ticket in the middle of a bull market. The fact that it’s even being compared to institutional favorites is creating a powerful narrative that this presale could defy every expectation. Fact 4: Ethereum’s energy use dropped by 99% The shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake during the 2022 Merge was one of the biggest technical upgrades in blockchain history. The result was a 99% reduction in energy consumption , instantly changing Ethereum’s environmental footprint. This move also positioned ETH more favorably with regulators and institutions increasingly sensitive to sustainability metrics. It is no exaggeration to say that the Merge preserved Ethereum’s long-term viability in an ESG-focused financial landscape. Fact 5: ETH supply can actually shrink Unlike Bitcoin’s strictly capped 21 million coins, Ethereum’s supply is dynamic. With EIP-1559 (implemented in 2021), every transaction burns a portion of ETH. Combined with proof-of-stake rewards, this mechanism means Ethereum can sometimes experience net negative issuance , in other words, its supply can contract over time. This “ultrasound money” narrative is one reason analysts remain bullish on ETH’s long-term price trajectory. Why timing matters now The crypto market is in a delicate balance. Bitcoin is consolidating, Ethereum is quietly strengthening its fundamentals, and liquidity expectations are rising as central banks prepare to ease policy. These are the conditions that often set the stage for altcoin breakouts. In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum is timely. It is capturing the exact moment when retail investors are hunting for high-upside plays, while whales are allocating to presales with structural credibility. This combination of timing, scarcity, and legitimacy explains why so many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the defining presale of 2025. Conclusion Ethereum remains the backbone of the crypto ecosystem, with hidden facts that highlight its strength: a programmable origin story, decentralized supply, massive energy savings, potential for deflation, and leadership in tokenization. But every bull cycle also brings new names into the spotlight. Right now, that spotlight is firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE . With forecasts of 15,500% ROI , a shrinking presale supply, and cultural branding that spreads like wildfire, it has already separated itself from the crowd. For traders looking to combine the lessons of Ethereum’s early days with the urgency of today’s market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be more than a presale, it could be the breakout story of the cycle.

Whales and institutions tend to stick with well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but regular investors looking for big gains are starting to look elsewhere. Safe options are all over the news, but there are also chances with asymmetric upside that are hidden among the rising prices of cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most talked-about names right now. It’s a DeFi project that experts think will provide them a 250x return on their investment. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional trust, retail limits People still think of Bitcoin (BTC) as the main currency in the crypto realm. Whales are buying more BTC to protect themselves from traditional markets. The market trusts it so highly that it is worth $4.0 trillion. It is also the most stable asset for anyone who wants to invest in crypto because it is like digital gold. This reliability is good for people who want to hang on to their investments for a long time, but it’s not good for retail investors who want to make a lot of money quickly. Most crypto predictions say that Bitcoin (BTC) will rise by 2x to 3x, which is a lot for its market size. That is strong by traditional measures, but when you look at crypto charts with tokens that are worth double or triple digits, Bitcoin (BTC) doesn’t have much room to grow. Institutions will still like BTC, but its ceiling makes it less appealing to individual investors with ambitious plans. Ethereum (ETH): DeFi backbone, but growth constrained Ethereum (ETH) is just as important. It has formed the backbone of DeFi, smart contracts, and tokenization projects run by big institutions. With a market valuation of more than $540 billion, it stands for confidence and stability in the crypto ecosystem as a whole. ETH is more than simply a money; it’s the base for many apps that are created on it. But this same strength makes it hard for it to give very high returns. Ethereum (ETH) will still be the most important cryptocurrency for investors, but its current value means that a 3x to 4x growth is the most likely outcome. That makes ETH popular with institutions, but it can’t give the uneven growth that lesser altcoins can. For individual investors, ETH’s story is one of dependability, not quick growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The altcoin for asymmetric growth This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. MUTM is still in presale, unlike BTC or ETH. This gives investors the option to buy into a project with huge potential before it becomes live on exchanges. The price is now $0.035 in Phase 6. 40% of the tokens have already been sold, $15.85 million has been raised, and more than 16,350 people are holding them. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% increase that makes people who are thinking about investing in crypto right now feel like they need to act quickly. MUTM is different from other altcoins that are just for speculation because it has real-world uses. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a loan and borrowing system that lets people get cash without having to liquidate their possessions. For instance, an investor who puts $10,000 worth of ETH into a P2C lending account can borrow $5,000 in USDC at a 50% loan-to-value ratio. This lets them preserve their ETH exposure while still getting access to cash. In P2P lending, you can even employ assets like DOGE or PEPE. This makes lending markets riskier while keeping the system safe. Staking mtTokens is another important feature. People who stake mtTokens will get MUTM rewards through a system that lets them buy and sell them. The platform will utilize the money it makes to purchase back MUTM tokens from the market and provide them to people who invest them. This keeps the buy side busy all the time and ties the performance of the platform directly to the rewards for investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have an even bigger edge if it runs on Layer-2. Lower transaction prices and faster speeds will make more people want to utilize the service, which will lead to more overall value locked. Every new transaction, whether it’s a loan, a repayment, or a liquidation, makes money that goes into the MUTM ecosystem. The roadmap for the future is just as big. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its beta version and offer it on exchanges. It will also work to get its stablecoin launched at the time of exchange listing. The goal of each milestone is to encourage people to use the service and reward those who use it for a long time. Conclusion You can already see the upside. In Phase 1, a $10,000 entry is worth $35,000 today in Phase 6. At $2 per token, that same amount of money will be worth $570,000, and at $3, it will be worth $855,000. This is exactly why experts say that MUTM has the potential for a 250x return on investment (ROI), which is not attainable with BTC or ETH at their current prices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the kind of opportunity that can make early investors very rich. Whales and banks still trust Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but retail investors seeking for the next big thing will find MUTM to be the best solution to the issue of what are the best cryptos to buy right now.

ETH is the foundation of decentralized apps, and SOL is known for being fast and able to grow. Both have established themselves as leaders in their fields, but their development has slowed down since their early years. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. It’s a penny altcoin that is still in presale and was created with the same goal of getting people to use it in the real world. Analysts think that it has the momentum and structure to provide investors a speedy 23x return on investment. This mix of usefulness and huge potential makes it stand out from other large-cap possibilities for traders looking at the crypto fear and greed index. Building utility with speed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) doesn’t want to compete with ETH or SOL on heritage. Instead, it is working on a new system where utility is directly tied to token demand and investor incentives. It has a stablecoin that is worth $1 and can only be created using assets that are worth more than they are worth, including ETH, SOL, and AVAX. Unlike initiatives that are based on hype, issuance is tightly managed by authorized accounts with set restrictions. This keeps things stable and secure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized governance will set borrowing rates and change them as needed to maintain crypto values in line with the peg. Liquidation procedures will immediately kick in to defend the system, keeping both lenders and borrowers safe. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers more than just collateralized lending. It also offers P2C lending, which lets users borrow stablecoins against blue-chip tokens and stablecoins themselves, as well as P2P financing for meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. This makes it easier for a lot of different types of users, from high-cap traders to speculative groups, to become involved. This increases the flow of liquidity in the ecosystem. A sample of an early Phase 5 investor illustrates how rapidly profits are growing. A $10,000 investment in crypto at $0.03 got you 330,000 tokens. In Phase 6, those tokens are valued $11,700, which is already a 16% increase before they ever hit the markets. That identical bag will increase to more than $230,000 if the estimated 23x ROI projection holds true. Neither ETH nor SOL can now deliver this kind of growth since their markets are already well-established. This is sped up even more by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s staking strategy. People who own mtTokens will be able to stake them in certain contracts and get MUTM payouts. The platform will utilize the money it makes to purchase back MUTM tokens on the open market, and the benefits will go straight to mtToken stakers. This cycle of buying and distributing puts ongoing pressure on buyers and rewards long-term users. Presale momentum, risk controls, and trust anchors The buzz surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale indicates how rapidly people are getting on board. Phase 6 is now live at $0.035. It has raised more than $15.85 million, sold more than 40% of its tokens, and has more than 16,350 holders. The presale price will go up 15% in Phase 7 to $0.040, which shows how important it is for investors to act quickly if they want to get in before the discount window expires. For anybody keeping an eye on crypto investing trends, getting in early at this point gives you the best chance to make big profits before the coins are listed on exchanges. The project’s comprehensive risk management structure makes this momentum even stronger. Stable interest rates will be dynamically managed to maintain the $1 peg. Collateral efficiency ensures that positions are overcollateralized, and limited collateralization lowers systemic risk. Liquidation triggers are automatic; thus, they work even in unstable markets. These structural features make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reliable for big investors while still giving penny coin returns. From the beginning, credibility has also been a big issue. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was audited by CertiK and got a score of 90.00 on Token Scan and 79.00 on Skynet, which are both good signs of security. A $50,000 bug bounty program has been set up to back this up. Rewards range from $200 for small bugs to $2,000 for major bugs. There is also a $100,000 giveaway going on right now, which is raising awareness and encouraging more people to become involved in the community during the presale phase. Conclusion ETH and SOL laid the groundwork for blockchain adoption based on usefulness. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that a new cent token can do the same thing, but much quicker. Stablecoin-backed lending, P2C and P2P mechanisms, mtToken staking and buybacks, and a presale that has already given double-digit profits are all examples of how it is producing both practical application and rapid development. MUTM is a unique opportunity for traders looking for the next big thing since it has both usefulness and a clear 23x ROI path. ETH and SOL showed what utility currencies can do. MUTM is the finest new crypto investment opportunity right now since it combines usefulness and speed in the crypto pricing tale.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-investors-xrp-looks-strong-for-the-day-heres-why/,"Crypto enthusiast Gonzo shared an update on XRP’s technical setup, noting that the asset displayed strength during the day’s trading. In his words, “$XRP looks strong for the day. It broke the trend line with a re-test of the outside, while holding the 50% level and holding the 50 SMA.” His post was accompanied by a chart illustrating the recent price action, trend structure, and Fibonacci retracement levels. $XRP looks strong for the day. It broke the trend line with a re-test of the outside, while holding the 50% level and holding the 50 SMA. pic.twitter.com/IhJY0CRsMS — Gonzo (@gonzo_3t) September 16, 2025 Breakout and Re-Test of the Trend Line The chart shows that XRP is trading just above the $3.00 level, closing near $3.0454 at the time of capture. A descending trend line that had contained price action for several weeks was recently broken, with XRP moving above it and then returning to re-test the breakout area. This re-test was held, which is the basis for Gonzo’s description of strength. Fibonacci Levels and the 50 SMA as Support In addition to the breakout, the chart highlights the importance of the 50% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). The 50% retracement is placed at $2.9415, while the 0.382 level sits just above at $2.9993. Both of these align with the moving average zone, providing a technical support range between $2.94 and $3.00. Gonzo pointed out that XRP held this zone while maintaining support on the 50 SMA, adding weight to the view that the breakout has been confirmed. Resistance and Support Levels Ahead Upside levels visible on the chart include resistance near $3.1865, with a further marker positioned higher at $3.3924. On the downside, the chart identifies a lower support zone around $2.6965. These price points indicate the next technical areas traders may watch should XRP either extend its move upward or face renewed selling pressure.

The emphasis is on the combination of the trend line break, the re-test that successfully held, and the continued support provided by the Fibonacci levels and the moving average. XRP’s price structure presently reflects a technical recovery from earlier declines, with the $3.00 zone acting as the immediate reference point for strength. Gonzo’s update suggests that as long as this zone remains intact, the outlook for the day favors stability above the breakout level, with attention shifting to resistance levels above.

The digital asset has officially reclaimed its coveted position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, successfully surpassing Solana (SOL). This dynamic shift highlights the intense competition and constant flux characterizing the top tiers of the crypto world, where the BNB market cap continues to be a key indicator of its strength. Understanding the Recent BNB Market Cap Shift The race for the fifth spot has been particularly captivating this month, with BNB and Solana frequently exchanging positions. This ongoing rivalry keeps investors and enthusiasts on the edge of their seats, watching every movement. According to recent data from CoinMarketCap, the BNB market cap impressively reached approximately $133.4 billion. This figure comfortably placed it ahead of Solana’s market capitalization, which stood at around $128.3 billion. Such significant numbers underscore the immense value and investor confidence associated with these leading digital assets. Currently, BNB is trading at $958.84, reflecting a robust 4.02% increase. In contrast, Solana is priced at $236.41, showing a more modest 0.84% gain. These price movements are crucial in determining the overall BNB market cap and its competitive standing. What’s Driving the BNB Market Cap Momentum? Several factors likely contribute to BNB’s recent surge and its ability to reclaim a higher ranking. The BNB Chain ecosystem continues to expand, fostering new decentralized applications (dApps) and projects that drive demand for the native token. Furthermore, investor sentiment often plays a significant role in market movements. An overseas media outlet recently reported that the return of Binance co-founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), appears to be imminent. While the exact timing and nature of his return are speculative, such news can generate considerable buzz and positively influence the perception of BNB, potentially boosting the BNB market cap . The utility of BNB within the Binance ecosystem, including trading fee discounts, participation in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and use in various DeFi protocols, consistently adds to its value proposition. This intrinsic utility provides a strong foundation for its market performance. BNB vs. Solana: A Dynamic Rivalry in Market Cap The competition between BNB and Solana is more than just a battle for market capitalization; it represents a clash of innovative blockchain ecosystems. Both platforms offer distinct advantages and attract different segments of the crypto community. BNB Chain: Known for its high transaction throughput and lower fees, it appeals to a broad base of users and developers. Its strong connection to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, provides unparalleled liquidity and user access. Solana: Celebrated for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and scalability, Solana has carved out a niche, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, often referred to as an ‘Ethereum killer.’ This back-and-forth in the rankings demonstrates the dynamic nature of the crypto market. It also highlights how quickly fortunes can change based on development updates, investor sentiment, and broader market trends affecting the BNB market cap and Solana’s standing. Navigating the Volatility: What Investors Should Consider For investors, understanding these market dynamics is paramount. While BNB’s recent performance is impressive, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile. Rankings can shift, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. It is always advisable to conduct thorough research and consider various factors beyond just market cap. Look into the project’s fundamentals, its development roadmap, community support, and the overall macroeconomic environment. Diversification across different assets can also help mitigate risks in such a fast-moving space. The continuous evolution of the BNB market cap and other major cryptocurrencies requires a well-informed and cautious approach. BNB’s remarkable surge to reclaim the fifth spot by market capitalization over Solana underscores its enduring strength and the vibrant, competitive spirit of the crypto market. While the immediate catalyst appears to be strong investor interest and possibly news surrounding Changpeng Zhao, the underlying utility and ecosystem growth of BNB Chain are fundamental to its success. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the race among top digital assets promises to remain an exciting spectacle for all involved. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is market capitalization in cryptocurrency? A: Market capitalization, or market cap, is the total value of all coins that have been mined or are in circulation. It’s calculated by multiplying the current price of a single coin by the total number of coins in circulation. It helps gauge an asset’s size and relative dominance. Q2: Why is the BNB market cap significant? A: The BNB market cap is significant because it reflects the overall value and investor confidence in the BNB ecosystem. A higher market cap typically indicates greater stability, liquidity, and broader adoption of the token and its underlying blockchain. Q3: What are the main differences between BNB and Solana? A: BNB (Binance Coin) is the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain, closely tied to the Binance exchange, offering utility for trading fees, staking, and dApps. Solana is a separate blockchain known for its high transaction speeds and scalability, popular for DeFi and NFTs. Q4: How does news about Changpeng Zhao (CZ) affect BNB? A: As the co-founder and former CEO of Binance, CZ’s activities and potential return can significantly influence investor sentiment towards Binance and, by extension, BNB. Positive news or developments related to him often lead to increased interest and a potential boost in the BNB market cap . Q5: Will BNB maintain its 5th market cap ranking? A: The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic. While BNB has reclaimed its position, rankings are fluid. Continuous development, market trends, and investor sentiment will determine if BNB can maintain its spot or if Solana, or another asset, will challenge it again.

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to make headlines, yet volatility around key price levels is seeing traders seek alternatives. Newer projects like Remittix, meanwhile, are attracting attention for their blend of utility, security and rapid presale momentum. The gap between legacy giants and disruptive newcomers opens the door to what could be a trend-setting narrative in 2025. Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Trends and Market Shifts The Bitcoin Price recently made an attempt at a major resistance level at $116,000 prior to rejection, trading at $114,703.81, 0.71% lower on the day. Ethereum also followed lower, dropping to $4,495.08, 2.13% lower on the day. Trading volumes for both assets, in spite of the drops, remain high, reflecting strong investor interest. The rejection of Bitcoin at resistance suggests near-term selling pressure, while Ethereum whales moving funds between wallets suggest a shift in strategy, possibly into promising presales like Remittix. Remittix: Presale That Is Luring Ethereum Whales Remittix (RTX) is a cross-chain DeFi solution for global remittances. The $0.1080 token has already raised $25,8 million and sold over 664 million tokens in presale. Remittix’s selling point is its focus on real-world use cases: direct crypto-to-bank transfer, decentralized exchange integration and wallet features currently in beta testing. The team has revealed upcoming listings on BitMart and LBANK, large centralised exchanges that will provide instant liquidity. The roadmap has placed RTX among the best crypto presale 2025 potentials, with Ethereum investors turning to early stage crypto investments. Learn more at Remittix.io. Security, Community and Growth One of the biggest confidence boosters was when Remittix team got verified by CertiK and ranked #1 pre-launch token on CertiK Skynet. The ranking demonstrates the security and transparency of the project something that is typically missing in the launch of new crypto tokens. Alongside its technical development, Remittix has also initiated a $250,000 giveaway and 15% USDT referral program, allowing early users to earn while they spur adoption. All these, along with strong presale momentum, are pointers to why Remittix is rapidly becoming one of the fastest growing crypto 2025 tokens. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction $25,8 Million+ raised and 664 Million+ tokens sold Verified by CertiK, #1 ranked pre-launch project Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBANK Real-world focus on crypto-to-bank payments Looking Ahead As Bitcoin Price struggles at resistance and Ethereum whales diversify, the focus on up-and-coming crypto projects intensifies. Remittix stands out not just as a top crypto under $1, but as a crypto solving real-world problems with transparent FX conversions, low fees and cross-chain capabilities.

Bitcoin Bull Score Index Is Back In Neutral Region In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno has talked about the latest trend in the analytics firm’s Bull Score Index. This indicator basically tells us about which phase of the market Bitcoin is in right now. The index combines the data of several key on-chain metrics to determine its value. Some of these indicators include the Market Value to Realized Cap (MVRV) Ratio, keeping track of average investor profitability on the network, and the Stablecoin Liquidity, measuring the amount of capital stored in the form of fiat-tied tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows In Last 1.5 Years Surpassed First 15 Years Combined: Data When the Bull Score Index has a value of 60 or higher, it means the majority of the underlying metrics are currently giving a bullish signal. On the other hand, the metric’s value being 40 or lower implies BTC is in a bear phase according to its indicators. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Bull Score Index over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Bull Score Index was sitting at a low of just 20 four days ago, but since then, its value has witnessed a sharp climb to the 50 level. This means that on-chain metrics are signaling neutral market conditions for the asset now. This shift comes just as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. BTC price itself has taken to sideways movement ahead of it, indicating that the market is divided about the event’s outcome. Analytics firm Santiment has shared in an X post about how social media users are reacting to the meeting. In the chart, Santiment has attached the data of the “Positive/Negative Sentiment,” an indicator that compares the bullish and bearish posts related to Bitcoin that are appearing on the major social media platforms. This metric has surged recently and hit the 1.77 mark, suggesting that there are 1.77 positive comments being made for every negative comment related to the cryptocurrency. This is the most bullish that retail traders have been on social media in around 10 weeks.

Upcoming XRP and Dogecoin ETFs Boost Optimism The XRP ETF (ticker: XRPR) and Dogecoin ETF (ticker: DOJE) are expected to debut within days, with Dogecoin’s listing scheduled for Thursday and XRP’s by Friday. This will be the first U.S. ETF for Dogecoin, providing traditional investors with access to the meme coin without the need for wallets or direct token ownership. For XRP, the launch signifies a milestone as it becomes the first major altcoin ETF after Ethereum to gain entry into U.S. markets. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas highlighted that the XRP fund will combine direct holdings of the token with exposure to other global spot ETFs. Meanwhile, James Seyffart noted that over 90 additional crypto ETF applications are currently awaiting SEC review, including those tied to Litecoin and Avalanche. What It Means for Altcoin Investors The arrival of XRP and Dogecoin ETFs signals growing institutional acceptance of altcoins, moving beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts believe these products could attract billions in inflows from retirement funds, brokerage platforms, and traditional investment accounts. For Dogecoin , the ETF marks a leap from meme culture into mainstream finance. Already, DOGE has seen price momentum around $0.26–$0.28, with whales accumulating heavily ahead of the launch. Some technical analysts argue Dogecoin is finalizing a bullish chart pattern that could push its price toward $0.35, $0.45, and even $1 if momentum holds. XRP , on the other hand, is positioned as a utility-driven altcoin with strong liquidity. Its ETF could accelerate inflows into Ripple’s ecosystem, especially if paired with dovish global monetary policies in the coming weeks. Broader Market Impact The timing of these ETF launches coincides with key central bank meetings. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, while the Bank of England and Bank of Japan will announce decisions within days. Analysts suggest that if multiple central banks coordinate easing, the result could spark a mega altseason, driving Bitcoin past $120,000 and Ethereum beyond resistance levels. For investors, the message is clear: XRP and Dogecoin ETFs are not just symbolic victories; they could transform altcoin adoption in traditional finance. Now we wait and see what may unfold over the next ten days.

This move will advance Meta’s augmented reality plans while the company is under scrutiny over social media protections for children. At the two-day event at Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Zuckerberg plans to introduce the company’s first commercially viable eyewear with a screen. Analysts expect the device to debut for about 800 US dollars. Internally, the project has been known as “Hypernova,” and the product is expected to reach the market as “Celeste.” The launch would extend Meta’s bid to keep pace in AI-powered hardware against rivals like OpenAI and Alphabet’s Google, though analysts say the price could weigh on demand. The glasses are expected to be far less advanced than “Orion,” a prototype highlighted at last year’s Connect, which Zuckerberg described as “the time machine to the future.” Orion is slated for release in 2027. Meta’s AI smart glasses glasses raise concerns about child safety Meta sells two AI-enabled eyewear lines built with Oakley and Ray-Ban. Those products offer cameras, voice-driven control, and the ability to livestream to Instagram and Facebook. Zuckerberg has directed over 60 billion US dollars since 2020 into the company’s AR divisiont. He has stated that smart glasses will be the main route to bring “superintelligence” into everyday life. In pursuit of AI leadership, he has also fueled an expensive talent contest by recruiting leading researchers from rival firm. Reuters reported that Meta’s artificial intelligence guidelines enabled chatbots to converse with children on topics such as race. Meta pushes ahead with new tech despite losses Along with the display-equipped glasses, Meta is expected to unveil a first-generation wristband that lets wearers control the eyewear using hand gestures. The company also plans to introduce a refreshed Ray-Ban line with better battery life and cameras and added AI features. Meta is one of the few big tech firms that progressed significantly in smart glasses, selling around 2 million pairs of the Ray-Ban model since 2023. According to CNBC the Hypernova glasses may carry Prada branding, since the Italian label’s wide frames can easily contain the electrical components. Even so, the expected price of $800 may be too much for most users, well above above the $299 starting price for the Ray-Ban line and $399 for the sport-focused Oakley glasses. Analysts estimate that the device could sell “a few hundred thousand units at most,” though the rollout could help attract more developers to build software around this new tech.

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with speculation surrounding Grayscale’s recent on-chain activities, suggesting a significant move towards future Grayscale ETH ETF staking . This development, highlighted by a prominent analyst, points to Grayscale potentially positioning itself for an innovative offering in the burgeoning Ethereum ETF landscape. For many investors, the prospect of combining the accessibility of an ETF with the yield-generating potential of staking represents an exciting evolution in digital asset investment. What Recent On-Chain Activity Signals About Grayscale’s Plans? According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, a notable transaction occurred recently that has sparked widespread discussion. Just hours ago, an address associated with the Grayscale ETH Mini Trust ETF executed a substantial transfer of Ethereum. Specifically, 214,400 ETH, valued at an impressive $967 million, was moved from this Grayscale address. These funds were then distributed across 67 newly created wallets, with each wallet receiving an identical allocation of 3,200 ETH. EmberCN’s analysis suggests a high probability that these meticulously divided funds are being prepared for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking. This strategic distribution indicates a methodical approach rather than a simple asset reallocation, strongly hinting at future operational readiness for Grayscale ETH ETF staking activities. Why is Grayscale Preparing for ETH Staking Now? The timing of Grayscale’s actions raises an intriguing question: why now? The analyst speculates that Grayscale might have received some form of advance information, prompting these preparatory steps. This could range from informal discussions with regulators to a strategic anticipation of future policy changes regarding spot ETH ETFs. Historically, market participants often make proactive moves when they foresee significant regulatory shifts. Grayscale’s apparent readiness for Grayscale ETH ETF staking could be a testament to their long-term vision for Ethereum-based investment products, aiming to be at the forefront once regulatory clarity emerges. Understanding the Appeal of Staking for ETH ETFs Staking is a fundamental component of the Ethereum blockchain’s security and operation, particularly since its transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. When you stake ETH, you essentially lock up your tokens to support the network’s validation process. In return, stakers earn rewards, typically paid in ETH. For an ETF, integrating staking offers several compelling advantages: Enhanced Returns: Staking rewards can provide an additional yield on the underlying ETH assets, potentially boosting the ETF’s overall performance. Increased Investor Interest: The ability to earn passive income from an ETF could attract a broader range of investors looking for yield in their crypto exposure. Network Participation: By staking, the ETF would actively contribute to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network, aligning with the ethos of the crypto community. The potential for Grayscale ETH ETF staking to generate extra value is a significant draw, differentiating it from traditional ETFs that simply track asset prices. The Regulatory Roadblock: Can US Spot ETH ETFs Stake? Despite the clear benefits, a major hurdle remains: the U.S. has not yet approved staking for spot ETH ETFs. This regulatory uncertainty is a critical factor. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, the approvals did not explicitly include provisions for staking the underlying ETH. The SEC’s stance on whether staking constitutes a security or falls under existing regulations for investment products is still evolving. This lack of explicit approval means that any preparations for Grayscale ETH ETF staking are currently speculative regarding their immediate implementation in the US market. However, Grayscale’s forward-thinking approach suggests they are either confident in future regulatory shifts or exploring all operational possibilities for their products. What This Means for the Ethereum Market and Investors If Grayscale ETH ETF staking eventually receives regulatory green light, the implications for the Ethereum market could be substantial. A large institutional player like Grayscale staking a significant amount of ETH would likely: Reduce Circulating Supply: More ETH locked in staking contracts could lead to a decrease in the available circulating supply, potentially impacting price dynamics. Increase Institutional Demand: The added yield from staking could make ETH ETFs even more attractive to institutional investors, driving further adoption. Strengthen Network Security: Greater participation from major entities in staking enhances the overall security and robustness of the Ethereum blockchain. For individual investors, this could mean access to a regulated product that offers both exposure to Ethereum’s price appreciation and the passive income potential of staking, all within a familiar investment vehicle. Grayscale’s reported preparations for Grayscale ETH ETF staking underscore a fascinating phase in the evolution of cryptocurrency investments. While regulatory approvals for staking within US spot ETH ETFs are still pending, these on-chain movements signal a proactive and strategic vision from a major player. As the regulatory landscape continues to unfold, the potential for yield-bearing ETH ETFs could redefine how traditional investors engage with the decentralized finance ecosystem, promising a future where innovation and traditional finance increasingly intertwine. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking? Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking is a mechanism where cryptocurrency holders lock up their tokens to help secure a blockchain network and validate transactions. In return for their participation, they earn rewards, typically in the form of new tokens. 2. Has the SEC approved staking for spot ETH ETFs in the US? No, while the SEC recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, the current approvals do not explicitly include provisions for staking the underlying ETH. The regulatory stance on this specific aspect is still under consideration. 3. What are the potential benefits of Grayscale ETH ETF staking? Potential benefits include enhanced returns for investors through staking rewards, increased investor interest due to passive income opportunities, and stronger network security for the Ethereum blockchain through greater institutional participation. 4. How much ETH did Grayscale transfer, according to the analyst? According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, a Grayscale ETH Mini Trust ETF address transferred 214,400 ETH, worth approximately $967 million, to 67 new wallets. 5. What could be the market impact if ETH ETF staking is approved? If approved, it could lead to a reduction in the circulating supply of ETH, increase institutional demand for Ethereum, and further strengthen the network’s security, potentially impacting ETH’s price dynamics and overall adoption.

In the case of XRP, one analyst has highlighted similarities between the 2017/2018 bull market and the current structure forming in 2025. The comparison suggests that XRP could be positioned for another substantial upward movement. Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent market analyst on X, posted a chart that compared XRP’s explosive rally in late 2017 to the ongoing cycle. Alongside the image, the analyst predicted that XRP holders are about to get mega-rich. All #XRP holders about to get MEGA RICH. Time to pay close attention! pic.twitter.com/4VwsU8Im7E — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 16, 2025 Lessons From the 2017/2018 Cycle The left side of the chart tracks XRP’s price action during the 2017/2018 cycle. At its peak, XRP achieved an extraordinary gain of over 40,000%. The rally took XRP from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $3.36 at the time, before a steep correction of approximately 74% followed, pulling the asset into a consolidation phase . That dramatic rise and subsequent decline remain one of the most notable moments in the asset’s market history. The highlighted data shows that XRP’s initial upward momentum was swift and intense, fueled by both retail and institutional interest. While the retracement was severe, the cycle established a precedent for how XRP behaves in a bull market. Analysts continue to use that cycle as a benchmark when evaluating XRP’s potential in new market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Current Trajectory On the right side of the chart, the analyst mapped the ongoing XRP cycle. According to the projection, XRP has already entered a growth phase, with the potential for gains reaching nearly 1,936% from current levels. The chart outlines a possible trajectory that could lift XRP’s price higher, with key levels extending above its all-time high of $3.65 and even pointing toward the $10 range. This perspective builds on the notion that, while XRP’s growth may not replicate the 40,000% of the 2017 cycle, the asset could still generate returns that stand out in the current market. The forecast reflects both the maturation of the cryptocurrency industry and XRP’s established position as a digital asset with ongoing demand from both institutions and retail investors. The chart positions XRP’s current cycle as one with meaningful upside potential. The direct comparison with the previous cycle highlights the belief that XRP continues to follow repeatable long-term patterns , and traders watching XRP may interpret these similarities as signs of another major rally approaching.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as South Korean exchange Bithumb announces its latest additions. These Bithumb crypto listings are set to bring two intriguing digital assets, Toshi (TOSHI) and Holoworld (HOLO), to its platform. Starting September 17th, traders will have the opportunity to engage with these new cryptocurrencies against the South Korean Won (KRW), opening fresh avenues for investment and portfolio diversification. This move underscores Bithumb’s commitment to expanding its offerings and catering to the dynamic interests of its user base. What’s Happening with These Bithumb Crypto Listings? Bithumb, a leading player in the South Korean crypto market, has officially confirmed the listing schedule. Toshi (TOSHI) trading will kick off first, becoming available at 6:00 a.m. UTC. Shortly after, Holoworld (HOLO) will join the fray, with its trading commencing at 7:00 a.m. UTC on the very same day. These back-to-back listings highlight a strategic push by the exchange to introduce promising new projects to its robust trading environment. For many investors, new Bithumb crypto listings represent significant opportunities to get in on the ground floor of potentially high-growth assets. Understanding the specifics of these listings is crucial for any trader. Both TOSHI and HOLO will be paired directly with the KRW, simplifying the trading process for local users. This direct pairing often leads to higher liquidity and more straightforward price discovery, which are beneficial factors for both seasoned traders and newcomers alike. Diving Deeper: Understanding Toshi (TOSHI) Toshi, often associated with the Base blockchain ecosystem, is a community-driven project that has garnered attention for its meme coin appeal and decentralized finance (DeFi) aspirations. Named after the cat of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, TOSHI aims to build a robust ecosystem around its token, focusing on utility and community engagement. While specific details on its long-term roadmap are still evolving, its presence on a major exchange like Bithumb suggests a growing recognition of its potential within the broader crypto landscape.

Why BullZilla Is the Best Crypto to Invest In Now,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/missed-bitcoin-why-bullzilla-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-now/,"The story of Bitcoin will forever be remembered as one of crypto’s most frustrating and exhilarating chapters. In 2009, a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper that barely caused a ripple beyond a small group of cypherpunks. At the time, a single Bitcoin was worth less than a cent. Skeptics dismissed it as “nerd money,” a fleeting internet experiment destined to fade. Yet as the years unfolded, Bitcoin defied every expectation. From pizza purchases at 10,000 BTC to its first big rally past $1,000, then a breathtaking surge to $20,000 in 2017 and a new all-time high above $69,000 in 2021, it transformed from a niche curiosity into digital gold. Early adopters turned pocket change into life-altering fortunes. Latecomers watched headlines scream about overnight millionaires, feeling the sting of missed opportunity. Stories of investors who once owned thousands of coins and sold too soon became cautionary legends. But crypto is nothing if not cyclical, and redemption is always just one bull run away. For every train you miss, another pulls into the station. Today, many see that fresh chance in the explosive rise of BullZilla , a new presale phenomenon capturing the same raw excitement Bitcoin once did. While no project can ever be “the next Bitcoin,” the lesson is clear: markets reward the bold and the early. Remembering the Missed Bitcoin Wave For many seasoned investors, the real lesson of Bitcoin isn’t just its meteoric price chart, it’s the power of conviction when everyone else doubts. Those who bought during the quiet bear markets, when headlines declared Bitcoin dead and friends scoffed, reaped the greatest rewards. That same dynamic drives today’s hunt for the next breakout project. BullZilla’s early presale stage echoes those early Bitcoin days: high risk, yes, but also high potential for those willing to research, commit, and hold through volatility. History shows that the crypto world rewards foresight far more than hesitation. BullZilla Presale: A Fresh Start for Investors The Bull Zilla Presale is the centerpiece of the top meme coin presale to buy now, attracting both retail and seasoned investors. The presale price sits at $0.00005908, with 26 B tokens sold and over 1,500 holders. Early participants have already locked in a staggering 8,822.49% ROI to the projected listing price of $0.00527. Another 11.27% price hike is expected as Stage 3B approaches. Investors see BullZilla as the best crypto to buy today, combining the virality of meme coins with tokenomics designed for sustainability. The promise of the BullZilla best crypto to invest is drawing whales who missed earlier mega-runs like Shiba Inu and PEPE. A unique Progressive Price Engine increases the presale price every 48 hours or after $100k raised, creating urgency. The Roar Burn Mechanism further reduces supply, helping long-term holders. Upcoming Stage 3B signals an 11.27% price surge, a major reason analysts call it the BullZilla best crypto to invest and one of the best crypto to buy today. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Set Up a Wallet: Install a Web3 wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Purchase ETH from exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site: Connect your wallet to the official BullZilla ($BZIL) presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL: Select the amount you want to invest and confirm. Your allocation is instantly secured and claimable once the presale ends. Why BullZilla Could Be the Best Crypto to Invest Meme coins live and die by their ability to capture attention, and BullZilla ($BZIL) is already proving it has the narrative strength to rise. Its presale momentum is fueled by rapid funding milestones, viral exposure, and a narrative of strength and power, something the meme coin crowd deeply resonates with. When you consider Bitcoin’s past and compare it with BullZilla’s trajectory, the similarities are clear: low entry pricing, strong branding, and an eager investor base. These are exactly the conditions that made Bitcoin skyrocket. That’s why many now label BullZilla as one of the top early-stage crypto Investments. Conclusion The harsh reality of crypto is that most only realize potential after the gains are gone. Bitcoin reminded everyone of that fact. But BullZilla offers a chance to apply those lessons, getting in early before mainstream hype arrives. This is the cycle that creates legends in the meme coin world: hesitation leads to regret, but decisive moves toward Early Presale Crypto projects can change lives. Investors who recognize this pattern may find BullZilla to be their moment of redemption. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) FAQs What is BullZilla? BullZilla is a meme coin currently in presale, raising over $350K so far, and is gaining attention as one of the best crypto to invest. Why is BullZilla compared to Bitcoin? Because many see it as a “second chance” after missing Bitcoin, with similar low entry pricing and hype potential. What stage is BullZilla Presale in? It’s currently in Stage 2C, priced at $0.00004575. How do I buy BullZilla? You’ll need Ethereum, connect your wallet to the presale site, and swap ETH for $BZIL tokens. Could BullZilla become the best crypto to invest Meme Coin? While nothing is guaranteed, early momentum and funding success suggest it has that potential. Summary Bitcoin created millionaires, but only for those who acted early. For everyone else, it was a bitter reminder of what hesitation costs. Now, with BullZilla gathering massive presale momentum, investors are being handed a second chance. With its organized presale, growing hype, and low entry point, BullZilla is quickly establishing itself as one of the best crypto to invest and a leading name among best crypto to invest.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the BTC price has officially soared past the remarkable $117,000 mark, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This significant movement, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, signals a vibrant period for the digital asset. As BTC price reaches this new high, many are asking: what’s fueling this incredible rally, and what does it mean for the future of crypto? What’s Driving This Monumental BTC Price Surge? This latest surge in the BTC price isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s often the result of several underlying market forces converging. Understanding these drivers can provide valuable context for investors navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Several factors typically contribute to such a powerful upward trajectory for the BTC price : Increased Institutional Adoption: Major corporations and investment funds are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, seeing it as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against inflation. Positive Macroeconomic Outlook: A generally optimistic global economic sentiment or specific policy decisions, like interest rate cuts, can push investors towards riskier, higher-growth assets such as Bitcoin. Technical Breakouts: Chart analysts often point to key resistance levels. When the BTC price breaks above a significant threshold, it can trigger a wave of buying activity from traders using technical indicators. Halving Cycle Influence: While not immediate, the long-term effects of Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, contribute to its scarcity and can drive up its value over time. Understanding the Significance of the $117,000 BTC Price Mark Reaching a BTC price of $117,000 is more than just a number; it carries substantial weight for market participants. For many, it represents a psychological victory and a reinforcement of Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. This milestone often leads to: Renewed Investor Confidence: A strong upward move can attract new investors and re-engage existing ones, fostering a positive feedback loop. Media Attention: Higher prices naturally draw more mainstream media coverage, further increasing public awareness and potentially bringing in more retail investors. Validation of Bitcoin’s Role: Each new high reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ and a viable alternative to traditional financial assets. As reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, the BTC price is actively trading at $117,000 on the Binance USDT market, indicating robust liquidity and active participation from a global investor base. Navigating the Market: What Should Investors Consider with the Current BTC Price? While the current surge in BTC price is undoubtedly exciting, it’s crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and informed decision-making is key. Here are some considerations for investors: Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Volatility can lead to rapid price swings, so understand your risk tolerance. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your investment strategy is geared towards short-term gains or long-term holding. Bitcoin’s history shows significant long-term appreciation despite short-term fluctuations. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio across different assets, not just cryptocurrencies, to mitigate overall risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic trends that can influence the BTC price . Resources like Bitcoin World provide valuable insights and timely updates. The incredible climb of the BTC price above $117,000 marks a significant moment in the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market.

The BTC price is influenced by a combination of factors including institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions (like inflation concerns or interest rate changes), regulatory news, technological advancements in the crypto space, and market sentiment.

Their current behavior could define the trajectory of the ongoing cycle. Repeat 2021-Style Cycle Top? In the 2021 cycle, long-term holders began their main distribution phase between November 2020 and March 2021. In the process, this cohort of BTC holders trimmed their supply by 13.5% just before Bitcoin’s April 2021 peak, which Michael Nadeau, founder of The DeFi Report, argues was the “true” cycle top. These coins were transferred to short-term holders (STHs) and introduced new liquidity into the market. However, LTHs soon re-accumulated, finishing the year with larger positions than they began with, which explains why the second top in November 2021 was relatively muted as it lacked the influx of new capital and was largely fueled by repositioning of existing holdings. Interestingly, the same structure is unfolding in the present cycle according to the latest findings by Nadeau. LTHs reduced their supply by 12.4% into what may have been the first “true” top earlier this year (in the first quarter Q1 2025). Since then, the re-accumulation trend has returned, which is quite similar to the post-April 2021 phase. Despite this, unlike in earlier cycles, the participation from short-term holders (STH) remains low, and there was minimal evidence of new money entering the market. Nadeau said that this muted demand could cap the strength of future rallies, echoing the two-top structure of 2021, where LTH behavior and time-driven holder transitions, rather than broad inflows, shaped late-cycle price action. BTC Market Remains Vulnerable Glassnode’s data also pointed in the same direction. The analytics platform found that despite modest signs of recovery, fragility lingers beneath the surface, which has left Bitcoin vulnerable if fresh demand fails to make a comeback. While the spot market momentum is strong enough to push RSI into overbought territory, conviction looks shallow, owing to flat volumes and weakening CVD, suggesting sellers continue pressing into strength. Futures markets reflected high activity, as evidenced by open interest and aggressive buy-side flows driving perpetual CVD higher, though softer funding highlighted reduced long demand and a more cautious outlook. Options markets told a similar story: open interest climbed, but volatility spreads narrowed and skew dropped sharply, which means less hedging and greater complacency, thereby increasing the risk of sharp reactions if volatility resurfaces. On-chain signals were mixed. BTC addresses trended toward cycle lows while transfer volumes rose, pointing to capital inflows without broader user growth. Fees declined, reflecting weak block space demand and muted speculative pressure. With profitability metrics improving, investors are broadly in profit, but increasing profit-taking hints at potential demand exhaustion.

Then you’ve likely noticed the buzz around Solana. The ecosystem is truly thriving, and recent reports highlight an incredible milestone: Solana app revenue has seen an explosive surge, reaching an impressive $190 million in August. This isn’t just a small bump; it represents a staggering 126% increase year-over-year, painting a vibrant picture of growth and innovation within the Solana network. Solana App Revenue: An Unprecedented Surge The latest figures from a Step Finance report reveal a remarkable story for Solana. Applications built on the high-performance blockchain generated $190 million in revenue during August alone. This significant jump clearly demonstrates the increasing utility and adoption of the Solana platform. Such substantial year-over-year growth signals strong underlying demand and a maturing ecosystem, solidifying Solana’s position in the competitive blockchain space. This impressive revenue isn’t spread thinly across thousands of apps. Instead, a concentrated effort from a few key players is driving the majority of this success. The report indicates that the top 10 applications are responsible for over 86.5% of the total revenue, showcasing the immense power and popularity of established and innovative platforms within the Solana sphere. This concentration suggests that while the ecosystem is growing, certain applications have found strong product-market fit. What’s Driving This Remarkable Solana App Revenue Growth? Understanding the catalysts behind this impressive Solana app revenue surge is crucial for anyone interested in the blockchain’s future. Several standout applications are leading the charge, each contributing significantly to the overall financial health of the ecosystem. Let’s look at the top performers and their impact: Axiom: This platform led the pack, bringing in a substantial $49.1 million. Axiom’s focus on innovative financial products and services, often involving structured products and yield generation, has clearly resonated with users seeking advanced DeFi opportunities. Its strong performance highlights the demand for sophisticated financial tools on Solana. pump.fun: Following closely, pump.fun contributed $41 million. This platform’s unique approach to enabling quick, fair, and decentralized token launches has attracted a significant user base, especially those interested in meme coins and community-driven projects. It proves the appeal of novel social and financial experimentation on Solana. Phantom: The popular self-custody wallet for Solana users secured $22.3 million. Phantom’s essential role in facilitating secure transactions, managing digital assets, and providing a seamless gateway to dApps underscores its critical importance to the entire ecosystem. Its revenue reflects widespread user adoption and trust in its services, directly impacting overall Solana app revenue . These applications, along with others in the top ten, highlight diverse use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to social applications and essential infrastructure. Their collective success underscores the versatility, robust nature, and growing user base of the Solana blockchain. Beyond the Numbers: Understanding Solana’s Ecosystem Strength The impressive revenue figures are more than just numbers; they reflect the fundamental strengths of the Solana ecosystem itself. Key benefits that attract both users and developers include: High Throughput: Solana’s ability to process thousands of transactions per second makes it ideal for high-demand applications. Low Transaction Fees: Users benefit from significantly lower costs compared to many other blockchains, enhancing affordability and accessibility. Rapidly Expanding Developer Community: A growing pool of talent building innovative solutions ensures continuous advancement and new applications. This combination fosters an environment where innovative applications can thrive and generate substantial value. The growing Solana app revenue indicates increased user engagement and a healthy economic cycle within the network. More users mean more transactions, which in turn drives revenue for applications and validators. This positive feedback loop is vital for long-term sustainability and continued expansion, signaling a vibrant and active community. Challenges and Future Outlook for Solana App Revenue While the growth is undoubtedly exciting, it’s also important to consider the broader landscape. The cryptocurrency market can be inherently volatile, and competition among layer-1 blockchains is fierce. Solana, like any other platform, faces challenges such as maintaining network stability, ensuring robust security, and the need for continuous innovation to stay ahead. However, the current trajectory, backed by strong development and user adoption, suggests a resilient foundation. Looking ahead, the future of Solana app revenue appears remarkably promising. Continued core protocol development, strategic partnerships, and a relentless focus on enhancing user experience are likely to sustain this upward trend. For users, developers, and investors, closely monitoring the performance of key applications and overall ecosystem health will provide valuable insights into Solana’s enduring potential and its capacity for future growth. In conclusion, the astounding 126% year-over-year increase in Solana app revenue to $190 million in August is a powerful testament to the network’s burgeoning strength and innovation. Led by key players like Axiom, pump.fun, and Phantom, Solana is clearly demonstrating its capability to host a vibrant and economically successful decentralized application landscape.

But while assets that get a lot of attention are frequently in the news, the ventures that will really succeed in the long run are the ones that combine new ideas with long-term viability. Early investors realize that good fundamentals and tokenomics are what make wealth grow, and it’s what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out. Analysts say that this cryptocurrency will provide investors a 1200% return by 2026, making it the best one to purchase this month for those who want to see beyond the hype. Staking, buybacks, and roadmap confidence for 1200% The mtToken stake and repurchase strategy is another thing that makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out. Users may stake their mtTokens in certain smart contracts to get MUTM payouts. The platform will also use the money it makes to buy back MUTM straight from the open market. Then, these tokens will be given back to stakers, creating a feedback loop of demand that rewards those who hold on to their tokens for a long time and makes prices more stable. This strategy is what changes MUTM from a speculative play into an asset that pays interest. Another way to tell whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is real is by looking at its roadmap. Phase 1 has already done important presale tasks, community advertising, monitoring platform listings, and an outside audit. The next steps will involve building the core smart contracts and DApps, the back-end infrastructure, the risk management systems, and the analytics tools. Before the presale ends, there will be beta testing, final audits, and ensuring that all rules are followed. After that, the platform will be live, the MUTM token will be listed on exchanges, and the staking and claim procedures will start. In Phase 4, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also roll out institutional collaborations, multi-chain growth, and platform improvements. This will make it a whole ecosystem. Security has also been made a top priority. The CertiK audit gave the project a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00, which made investors feel more confident. There is a $50,000 bug bounty program in place, with payouts of up to $2,000 for serious problems and as little as $200 for less serious ones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving away $100,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 people, each of whom will get $10,000 worth of tokens. This is to get more people involved in the community. Stablecoin utility and presale growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating an ecosystem around its decentralized stablecoin, which will always try to stay at a $1 peg. This stablecoin is different from meme assets that go up and down in value. It is created only when users borrow against collateral like ETH, AVAX, or SOL, and it is burnt when loans are paid back or sold. Only issuers who have been authorized will be able to mint, and there will be constraints to keep systemic risk in check. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s protocol will set the interest rates for borrowing the stablecoin to safeguard the peg. When the stablecoin trades for more than $1, rates will go down, and when it trades for less than $1, rates will go up. Arbitrage possibilities will help bring the price back down, and all loans will be overcollateralized and immediately paid off when required. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has an advantage over ventures that just depend on speculative demand since it has governance, arbitrage, and collateral safety nets. This is the type of thing that helps explain why more and more people are investing in crypto initiatives that provide depth and sustainability instead of just hype. The project is in Phase 6 of its presale right now, with a price of $0.035. It has already generated more than $15.85 million, sold 40% of its supply, and brought on more than 16,350 holders. There can only be 4 billion tokens in total. The next phase, Phase 7, will raise the price of the token by 15% to $0.040. This means that this is the final opportunity for investors to acquire MUTM at this discounted price. The tokenomics are set up to provide value, as the platform’s earnings will be utilized for open-market buybacks that help the price rise over time. An investor who bought $2,500 worth of MUTM at $0.01 in previous rounds now possesses $8,750, and the same bag is expected to be worth $300,000 when the token hits $2. The presale success gives further weight to crypto projections that say MUTM would provide investors more than 1200% profits by 2026. While the market talks about stories about a crypto ETF or daily price swings, this initiative shows that disciplined token economics and steady growth are what really drive gains. Conclusion Whether you’re an investor who wants to know whether crypto is a solid investment right now, the answer is that time and choosing the right projects are more important than anything else. Meme coins do well when there is a lot of buzz, but they don’t last long. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting the stage for long-term development, and the presale is going to move to a higher price, so the chance to get MUTM at an inexpensive price is running out quickly. As SHIB and other meme currencies continue to make news, the sharpest investors are transferring their money to ventures that have a legitimate basis. When 1200% growth becomes genuine in 2026, anyone who bought in today for $0.035 will have shown that actual DeFi innovation, not hype, is where big profits come from.

Recently, one particular event has captured the attention of traders and investors alike: ETH liquidations . Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) has unfortunately led the charge in crypto liquidations, experiencing a staggering $60.45 million wiped out from perpetual futures positions. This substantial figure underscores the volatile nature of digital assets and highlights crucial market dynamics that every participant should understand. What Are ETH Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the crypto derivatives space, the term ""liquidation"" can sound intimidating. Simply put, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when the market moves against their prediction, and they can no longer meet the margin requirements to keep the trade open. The recent surge in ETH liquidations is particularly significant because Ethereum is a major player in the crypto ecosystem. Its price movements and associated liquidations can often signal broader market sentiment and potential future trends. Understanding these events is vital for anyone looking to navigate the complex world of crypto trading. A Closer Look at the Recent Market Wipeout The past 24 hours saw considerable turbulence across various cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial liquidations. Let’s break down the key figures: Ethereum (ETH): Topping the list, ETH saw a massive $60.45 million in liquidations . A striking 69.88% of these were long positions, meaning traders betting on a price increase were caught off guard by a downturn. Bitcoin (BTC): Not far behind, Bitcoin experienced $25.38 million in liquidations. Interestingly, the majority here were short positions, accounting for 75.39%. This suggests that while ETH longs were suffering, some BTC shorts were also squeezed, perhaps indicating a nuanced market movement rather than a uniform crash. Dogecoin (DOGE): The popular meme coin also felt the pressure, with $11.08 million in liquidations. Similar to ETH, long positions were dominant, making up 61.11% of the total. These figures paint a clear picture of heightened volatility and the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. The sheer volume of ETH liquidations alone indicates a significant price movement that impacted a large number of bullish traders. Decoding Long vs. Short Liquidations: What Does It Mean? The distinction between long and short liquidations is crucial for interpreting market sentiment. When long positions are liquidated, it implies a downward price movement that caught bullish traders off guard. Conversely, short liquidations suggest an upward price movement that squeezed bearish traders. For Ethereum, the dominance of long liquidations (nearly 70%) means that a significant number of traders who expected ETH’s price to rise were forced to close their positions. This often creates further selling pressure, potentially cascading into more liquidations. In contrast, Bitcoin’s majority short liquidations suggest a brief upward bounce or resistance to further downside, catching those betting on a deeper fall. These opposing trends in BTC and ETH liquidations highlight the complex interplay between different assets in the market and underscore the need for careful analysis. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors The recent wave of liquidations, particularly the large volume of ETH liquidations , serves as a powerful reminder of market risks. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Risk Management is Key: Always use stop-loss orders when engaging in leveraged trading. This helps limit potential losses and protects your capital from sudden market shifts. Understand Leverage: While leverage can amplify gains, it also significantly amplifies losses. Be conservative with your leverage ratios, especially in volatile markets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different assets can help mitigate risks associated with single-asset volatility. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data. Understanding the broader context can help anticipate potential price movements. Avoid Emotional Trading: Liquidations often trigger fear and panic. Make decisions based on analysis, not emotion. By adopting a disciplined approach and prioritizing risk management, investors can better navigate the unpredictable nature of the crypto market, even amidst significant events like widespread ETH liquidations . In summary, the past 24 hours have been a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency perpetual futures market, with Ethereum leading the pack in liquidations. The substantial $60.45 million in ETH liquidations , predominantly from long positions, signals a challenging period for bullish traders. While Bitcoin and Dogecoin also saw significant liquidations, the specific distribution between long and short positions offers nuanced insights into market sentiment. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, understanding these liquidation events and adopting robust risk management strategies will be paramount for sustained participation and success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about cryptocurrency liquidations: What exactly is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against them, and their collateral (margin) is no longer sufficient to maintain the trade. This prevents further losses beyond the initial margin. Why did ETH liquidations lead the market recently? ETH liquidations were highest primarily because Ethereum experienced significant price volatility, leading to a substantial number of leveraged long positions being closed out. Traders betting on a price increase were particularly affected by a downward price movement. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when a trader betting on a price increase (a ""long"" position) is forced to close due to a price drop. Short liquidations occur when a trader betting on a price decrease (a ""short"" position) is forced to close due to a price increase. How can I protect myself from liquidations? Effective risk management is crucial. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, manage your leverage responsibly, diversify your portfolio, and stay informed about market conditions. Avoid over-leveraging and emotional trading. Do liquidations always mean a market crash? Not necessarily. While large-scale liquidations can contribute to downward price pressure, they are a normal part of leveraged markets. They can indicate significant volatility or a shift in sentiment, but don’t always precede a sustained market crash. Did you find this analysis of ETH liquidations helpful?

However, while traders focus on volatile meme coins, Remittix (RTX) is steadily climbing its way to the top, becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Shiba Inu is currently trading around $0.00001298, following a sharp drop that shocked investors. The decline was partly driven by a $2.4 million hack on the Shibarium bridge , shaking market confidence. On Saturday, SHIB recorded a massive spike in activity, with over 7.17 trillion tokens transferred in a single day, according to Etherscan. From a technical perspective, the failure to stay above the 200-day EMA has made many traders lose confidence in the token. According to some analysts, SHIB is capable of falling to $0.000012 and if it does, it may fall to $0.000010. Others are more optimistic and they are projecting an upward price of $0.00003150 or even up to $0.000081 in the months ahead. source: @ramseycrypto on X For now, the Shiba Inu price prediction suggests a period of uncertainty, with SHIB caught between bearish technical signals and bullish long-term speculation, including rumors of a Shiba Inu ETF. Pepe Coin Faces Consolidation PEPE is currently priced around $0.00001061. A single wallet purchase of 1.52 trillion PEPE tokens , worth nearly $16 million, sent shockwaves through the market. This is among the biggest individual deals in the history of the token. Presently, PEPE is experiencing a narrow range between $0.00000941 and $0.00001340, which is an indication of consolidation. Analysts feel this may be quiet before the storm and there may be a great breakout or a great breakdown in the near future. Support lies at $0.00001035, with resistance just slightly above at $0.00001064. While some analysts see cooling momentum as a sign of exhaustion, others believe PEPE is simply building a base for another leg higher. source: FX_Professor on TradingView Remittix: The Token Taking The Spotlight Remittix is the best crypto under $1 , raising over $25,8 million, selling more than 664 million tokens at $0.1080 each.

XRP was one of the longest runners in cross-border payments, but there is competition, regulatory challenges, and market volatility to consider whether it is in its own good.

XRP Price Prediction and Market Climate XRP has been an established remittance player globally for several years now and is among the most sought-after cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. At a sale price of $3.05, market capitalization of $181.09 billion, and 24-hour trading volume of $5.02 billion (down 15.34%), XRP remains among the most traded cryptocurrency. For XRP to be a real possibility at $100, though, it would need enormous market growth and adoption both in the institutional and retail spaces. Although its role in cross-border payments is monopolistic, the crypto universe is today full of upcoming crypto initiatives offering faster settlement, lower fees, and higher integration flexibility. XRP’s trajectory is also highly dependent upon regulation clarity. In the United States, judicial proceedings have decelerated momentum, whereas other regions keep testing out regulations that would benefit or injure its progress. The Rise of Utility-First Projects The crypto space is moving towards real-world utility. Low gas fee crypto projects, decentralized exchanges, and new altcoins with payment use cases are making large headlines. Investors are more concerned with hype coins now and are instead focusing on crypto with real utility, long-term sustainability, and practical adoption. This shift creates space for platforms that do not only guarantee innovation but have even working solutions. While XRP is fighting to push banking adoption, rivalry from the next big altcoin 2025 players is tough. Among such projects creating buzz is Remittix (RTX), a cross-chain DeFi platform bridging crypto and fiat payments. The Forces Powering Remittix’s Rise Remittix ( $0.1080 per token ) has already secured more than $25.9 million, selling 664Million+ tokens in presale. It solves a $19Trillion payments problem by allowing users to pay crypto straight to bank accounts in 30+ nations. Unlike most early-stage crypto investments, Remittix already possesses a real-world use case which is already being trialed through its wallet beta. Important project highlights are: Ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens First CEX listing confirmed with BitMart and second with LBank $250,000 giveaway active for presale supporters 15% USDT referral incentives paid every day Over $25.9Million raised in one of the best crypto presales 2025 With CertiK auditing, Remittix is a secure, open DeFi project and is increasingly viewed as the next altcoin 2025. Final Thoughts on XRP Price Prediction Whereas XRP is one of the top cryptos to invest in today for others, reaching $100 would require historic adoption and growth in the market. The cryptocurrency market is evolving at a fast pace, and investors are diversifying into low cap crypto gems and future cryptos that have real-world effects. Remittix provides a fresh perspective by integrating cross-border payments with blockchain effectiveness, and therefore it is among the most realistic crypto presales that are currently running. Be it XRP hitting $100 or not, the advent of projects like Remittix is an indication that the future of crypto lies in offering practical solutions and not speculation.

According to reports, the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) of Israel flagged 187 wallet addresses and asked platforms and service providers to take action. Immediate freezes were limited, and most of the funds appear to have been moved before they could be held. Israel Names Wallets And Asks For Action The NBCTF supplied a list of 187 addresses it believes are tied to the IRGC . Tether responded by blacklisting 39 of the flagged wallets, which blocked those addresses from further on-chain transactions. Reports indicate that only about $1.5 million is presently frozen or held, while the larger sum — roughly $1.5 billion in incoming transfers over time — has largely been shifted through other addresses and services. Questions Remain Over Ownership And Flows Reports have disclosed that blockchain analytics firms have urged caution about attributing direct ownership of every flagged address to the IRGC. Companies like Elliptic have said that some wallets could belong to exchanges or third-party services used by many different users, which complicates claims of direct control. Tracing crypto flows is possible but messy, and the distinction between transaction volume through a wallet and direct ownership matters in legal terms. How The Funds Were Handled On-Chain Israeli authorities say they tracked large USDT flows into the flagged network over months. While a small portion was located and frozen, most of the tokens were reported to have been moved before enforcement steps could be completed. Tether’s decision to blacklist some wallets shows one way stablecoin issuers can act, but the moves do not recover funds that have already left the flagged addresses. The situation highlights how quickly assets can be shifted among many addresses. Why It Matters For Sanctions And Crypto Compliance According to market and regulatory coverage, the case illustrates the ongoing challenge of stopping sanctioned actors from using crypto to move value. Stablecoins like USDT are widely used for cross-border transfers, and their scale makes them attractive for many users. Lawmakers and regulators will likely watch how exchanges, wallets, and issuers respond, since cooperation by private firms can make enforcement more effective.

Binance Ethereum Trading In Neutral Zone According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Ethereum trading on Binance during September 2025 is witnessing a period of relative calm compared to other months. Notably, there has been a decline in the imbalance between ETH spot and perpetual volumes. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record 36 Million ETH, Driving Structural Supply Shock Commenting on ETH’s recent price surge, which saw it jump from $2,127 on June 15 to around $4,500 at the time of writing, Arab Chain noted that this rally was not supported by strong momentum. Neither the spot market nor leveraged speculators contributed to the price appreciation. The CryptoQuant contributor brought attention to ETH’s Z-score, which has oscillated between 0.0 and -1.0 for most of September. Such a Z-score typically signifies the asset trading in a neutral zone, with a slight tilt toward the spot market. For the uninitiated, a Z-score measures how far a data point is from the mean, expressed in units of standard deviation. In trading, it’s used to identify whether a value – like volume or price – is unusually high or low compared to its historical average. In essence, ETH’s current Z-score means that perpetual contracts are slowly losing their dominance in trading volume. This could be due to multiple reasons, such as speculators exiting the market or due to increased dependence on real buy/sell orders from actual investors. The decline in perpetual trading volume is significant compared to the period between June and August. As a result, the appetite for leveraged speculation has dwindled too, a sign of growing caution in the market. Arab Chain added: Despite this decline, the spot market also showed limited strength, reflecting a general lack of investor engagement. Spot volume remained below the 500K–1M range, which is significantly lower than the peaks recorded in July and June. The analyst cautioned that although the lack of strong imbalances between the spot and perpetual markets may seem positive at first, it could also mean there is heightened uncertainty and stagnation pertaining to the direction of ETH’s price. Is ETH Preparing For A New Rally? Although ETH appears to be stuck in limbo due to its sluggish price action, some analysts are confident that the digital asset is likely to resume its bullish trajectory in the near term. For example, ETH reserves on exchanges continue to deplete at a rapid pace. Related Reading: Ethereum Outflows Drive Binance Supply Ratio Under 0.037, Signaling Bullish Setup Similarly, institutional demand for ETH continues to be strong, with some analysts forecasting ETH to climb to $6,800 by the end of 2025. At press time, ETH trades at $4,439, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

The promotion, running from 10:00 (UTC) on September 16 to 10:00 (UTC) on September 30 and rewards users for their trading activity. Participants must register and achieve specific trading volume thresholds. Rebates are calculated based on new daily trading volume using a tiered system, with higher percentages applied to higher volumes. All rebates will be distributed in HTX tokens, with a maximum of $20,000 worth of $HTX per user. During the event, trades made through spot trading bots, isolated margin, and cross margin will be counted toward the total spot trading volume. Participants’ new daily trading volume will be calculated using the following formulas: ● New Daily Trading Volume = Daily trading volume during the event − Average daily trading volume in the 30 days prior to the event. ● Actual Daily Rebate Amount = Daily net spot trading fees × Rebate coefficient. Daily New Trading Volume (Per user) Rebate Coefficient Reward (in $HTX) ≥1 million USDT 10% net trading fees ≥ 5 million USDT 15% net trading fees ≥ 10 million USDT 25% net trading fees ≥ 20 million USDT 35% net trading fees ≥ 50 million USDT 50% net trading fees Example: Suppose User A’s average daily spot trading volume in the past 30 days before the event was 8 million USDT: On September 18, User A’s spot trading volume reaches 20 million USDT, then User A’s daily new trading volume is therefore 12 million USDT. According to the rebate rules, if the rebate coefficient for that day is 25%, then User A’s rebate = Net spot trading fees from 20 million USDT * 25% in equivalent $HTX; On September 23, User A’s spot trading volume reaches 60 million USDT, then User A’s daily new trading volume is therefore 52 million USDT. According to the rebate rules, if the rebate coefficient for that day is 50%, then User A’s rebate = Net spot trading fees from 60 million USDT * 50% in equivalent $HTX. HTX is committed to delivering a secure, convenient, and efficient digital asset trading experience for users worldwide. The platform continues to strengthen its technology and risk management to safeguard assets and transactions. It also enhances product features and user experience, making trading accessible for investors at all levels.

The price is now recovering losses and faces hurdles near the $3.080 zone. XRP price is consolidating losses after declining below the $3.120 resistance. The price is now trading below $3.080 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the price clears the $3.080 zone. XRP Price Attempts Recovery XRP price started a fresh decline below the $3.120 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $3.020 level to enter a short-term bearish zone. There was a move below the $3.00 pivot level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A low was formed at $2.957 and the price recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.186 swing high to the $2.957 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $3.060 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls protect the $3.00 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.060 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.186 swing high to the $2.957 low. A clear move above the $3.080 resistance might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.180 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.060 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.00 level. The next major support is near the $2.950 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.950 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.880. The next major support sits near the $2.840 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $3.00 and $2.950.

Today, a significant development has unfolded on one of the largest crypto exchanges, Binance, with the announcement of new Binance perpetual futures listings. This move opens up fresh avenues for traders looking to capitalize on price movements of emerging digital assets. What Exactly Are Binance Perpetual Futures? For those new to the concept, perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract in the crypto market that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without actually owning it. Unlike traditional futures, these contracts have no expiry date, meaning you can hold them indefinitely as long as you meet margin requirements. This flexibility makes them incredibly popular. Here are some core aspects of Binance perpetual futures : No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions as long as they maintain sufficient margin. Leverage: They enable traders to amplify their potential returns (and risks) by trading with borrowed funds. Funding Rates: A unique mechanism that ensures the perpetual futures price stays anchored to the spot price. Binance, as a leading exchange, continually adds new assets to its perpetual futures lineup, providing a diverse range of trading instruments for its global user base. This expansion keeps the market dynamic and responsive to emerging tokens. Diving Into TOSHI and STBL: New Binance Perpetual Futures Pairs Binance has officially announced the immediate addition of two new perpetual futures pairs: TOSHI/USDT and STBL/USDT. These listings are set to go live today, offering traders new frontiers for speculation and portfolio diversification. The TOSHI/USDT pair will commence trading at 5:30 a.m. UTC, quickly followed by the STBL/USDT pair at 5:45 a.m. UTC. Let’s look at the specifics for these new Binance perpetual futures : TOSHI/USDT: This pair will offer an impressive leverage of up to 75x. Such high leverage allows for significant exposure with a relatively smaller capital outlay, though it also magnifies potential losses. STBL/USDT: Traders can access up to 50x leverage for this pair. While slightly lower than TOSHI, 50x leverage still presents substantial opportunities for amplified trading strategies. These additions reflect Binance’s commitment to expanding its derivative offerings, catering to the growing demand for diverse trading instruments in the fast-paced crypto market. The inclusion of these tokens suggests a growing interest and liquidity around them. Why Do These Binance Perpetual Futures Listings Matter? The introduction of TOSHI and STBL as Binance perpetual futures is more than just a routine update; it carries significant implications for the broader crypto ecosystem and individual traders alike. Firstly, it enhances market liquidity for these specific tokens. When an asset is listed on a major platform like Binance for futures trading, it typically sees increased trading volume and visibility. Moreover, these listings offer traders: Diversification: New pairs mean more options to spread risk and explore different market segments. Price Discovery: Futures markets often play a crucial role in price discovery, helping to establish fair market values for assets. Hedging Opportunities: Holders of TOSHI or STBL in their spot portfolios can use these futures contracts to hedge against potential price declines. For the projects behind TOSHI and STBL, this Binance listing is a massive vote of confidence, potentially attracting more users and developers to their respective ecosystems. It signifies a maturation and increased acceptance of these digital assets within the institutional trading landscape. Navigating the World of Crypto Perpetual Futures: Risks and Rewards While the prospect of high leverage and new trading pairs can be exciting, it’s crucial to approach Binance perpetual futures with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. Leverage, while offering amplified gains, also significantly increases the potential for rapid losses, sometimes exceeding initial capital if not managed properly. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies further compounds these risks. Here are some actionable insights for traders: Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Never trade with more capital than you can afford to lose. Education: Understand how perpetual futures work, including funding rates, margin calls, and liquidation mechanisms. Market Analysis: Conduct thorough technical and fundamental analysis before entering any trade. Start Small: Especially when dealing with new, potentially less liquid assets like TOSHI and STBL, begin with smaller position sizes. Responsible trading is paramount. The thrill of potential gains should always be balanced with a disciplined approach to risk. By staying informed and cautious, traders can better navigate the complexities of these powerful financial instruments. The addition of TOSHI and STBL to Binance’s perpetual futures lineup marks an exciting development for the crypto derivatives market. It offers traders fresh opportunities to engage with emerging assets, leveraging Binance’s robust platform and liquidity. However, as with all high-leverage trading, understanding the risks and implementing sound risk management strategies are essential for success. This expansion underscores Binance’s continuous effort to remain at the forefront of the digital asset trading landscape, providing diverse tools for its global community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the maximum leverage offered for TOSHI/USDT perpetual futures? A1: Binance will offer up to 75x leverage for the TOSHI/USDT perpetual futures pair. Q2: When will the STBL/USDT perpetual futures pair go live on Binance? A2: The STBL/USDT perpetual futures pair is scheduled to go live at 5:45 a.m. UTC today. Q3: Do Binance perpetual futures contracts have an expiry date? A3: No, Binance perpetual futures contracts do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as margin requirements are met. Q4: What are the main risks associated with trading Binance perpetual futures with high leverage? A4: High leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses, meaning traders can lose their capital very quickly. Market volatility further increases these risks, making robust risk management crucial. Q5: Why is Binance listing new perpetual futures pairs like TOSHI and STBL? A5: Binance lists new pairs to expand its derivative offerings, enhance market liquidity for these assets, provide more diversification options for traders, and respond to growing market interest in emerging tokens.

Ethereum is also attracting interest as whales place strategic bets. While so much focus has been on these two giants, investors have also been keeping an eye on new faces such as Remittix (RTX) , which has already made a name for itself as a leading candidate among the best crypto presale 2025 investment prospects. Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Trading Setup Bitcoin is valued at $115,702.01, with a slight daily gain of 0.93%. Its market cap is $2.3 trillion, with the daily trading volume falling by 16.88% to $40.97 billion. All of these figures are indicative of growing caution among investors, as the Bitcoin Price consolidates after recent highs. Ethereum, which is going for $4,450.01, has dropped 0.68% in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization is $539.06 billion, with $30.15 billion worth of trading in the past 24 hours.

Circle’s Strategic Move Into Hyperliquid As part of this initiative, Circle has launched Native USDC and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP V2) on HyperEVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) integrated into Hyperliquid’s layer-1 blockchain. This move is expected to streamline the adoption of USDC and enhance its utility. Plans also include enabling direct deposits and ensuring CCTP interoperability for Hyperliquid USDC on HyperCore, a platform that specializes in on-chain financial operations. Related Reading: Crucial Ten Days Ahead For Crypto: Will They Ignite Mega Altcoin Season? Circle’s announcement further revealed that it has become a direct stakeholder in Hyperliquid. The stablecoin issuer is also considering becoming a Hyperliquid validator, which would strengthen its position within the network. Hyperliquid also boasts nearly $6 billion in USDC, which is a little over 8% of Circle’s total USDC supply. These deposits would reportedly generate approximately $250 million in annual interest for partners such as Circle and Coinbase (COIN). Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s CEO stated on X (formerly Twitter): Don’t Believe the Hype. We are coming to the HYPE ecosystem in a big way. We intend to be a major player and contributor to the ecosystem. Happy to see others purchase new USD tickers and compete . Hyper fast native USDC with deep and nearly instant cross chain interoperability will be well received. HYPE Token Hits New All-Time High The blog post further asserted that the integration of Native USDC onto HyperEVM—and the upcoming support from HyperCore—promises to enhance the capital efficiency of transactions within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. This initiative is said to allow developers and users to transact seamlessly across the crypto economy, making it easier for fintech firms and other service providers to leverage USDC. Circle’s investment in Hyperliquid is just the beginning as the company plans to introduce incentive programs for builders working on HyperEVM, aiming to stimulate innovation and collaboration. The blog post concluded: We’ve simply been blown away by the growth and success of Hyperliquid over the last year, and as we’ve gotten to know Jeff and team, and many of the major emerging builders in the ecosystem, it’s very clear that this is something incredibly unique and special. Circle is here. We’re investing. We’re thrilled to be supporting this incredible community.

As of this writing, the price of Hyperliquid’s native token has retraced toward $53 after reaching a new all-time high of $57 last Friday. Circle’s stock, on the other hand, which recently debuted on the Nasdaq, is trading at $135 per share — a nearly 55% drop compared to its all-time high of over $298.

PayPal To Allow Users To Transfer Crypto With Personalized Payment Links According to a press release , PayPal has expanded its peer-to-peer (P2P) offerings to include cryptocurrencies. US users will soon be able to send and receive these tokens directly within the app, transferring not only to PayPal and Venmo, but also to other digital asset wallets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and PYUSD are in the list of coins confirmed to be supported so far. The news comes a couple of months after PayPal’s July announcement about adding a “Pay with Crypto” feature to help merchants accept digital asset payments in a convenient manner. This new integration into the P2P system would now allow everyday users to seamlessly transfer cryptocurrencies to friends and family. The digital asset integration isn’t the only new feature that PayPal has revealed. Starting today, users in the US can start creating personalized payment links via “PayPal Links.” These are one-time links that users can share with others to send and receive money. “For 25 years, PayPal has revolutionized how money moves between people. Now, we’re taking the next major step,” said Diego Scotti, General Manager, Consumer Group at PayPal. “Whether you’re texting, messaging, or emailing, now your money follows your conversations.” According to the payments processor giant, P2P and other consumer payments saw solid growth in the second quarter of 2025, with volume jumping 10% year-over-year. The company’s latest P2P expansion ties into its greater “PayPal World” initiative, a global platform that connects digital payments systems and wallets from around the world. PayPal World is expected to launch in late 2025, but for now, no specific timeline is known for when Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will become available in the P2P system. PayPal has also reassured users on the tax side of P2P transfers, noting, “as always, friends-and-family transfers through Venmo and PayPal are exempt from 1099-K reporting. Users won’t receive tax forms for gifts, reimbursements, or splitting expenses, helping ensure that personal payments stay personal.” Bitcoin Has Stalled In Its Recovery Surge Bitcoin has steadily made its way up since the bottom at the start of the month, but over the last few days, the coin has taken to sideways movement as its price is still trading around $115,400. Below is a chart that shows how the price action has looked for the cryptocurrency over the past month. The sideways movement may be about to break, however, if the pattern related to dormant transactions is anything to go by. In a post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out how BTC has just seen a large movement of coins aged between 3 to 5 years old. In the chart, Maartunn has identified an interesting pattern. “Notice how this metric aligns with the sharp price reactions in recent times,” explains the analyst. Given that another such movement of dormant coins has surfaced, it’s possible that Bitcoin may be due some volatility.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|ETH|Ethereum|PayPal|PayPal crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|TRADING|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 05:00:57

SOL price is now consolidating gains below $240 and might aim for another increase if it stays above $230. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $240 and $242 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $240 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $238 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend losses if it dips below the $230 zone.

Today, the same early voices are talking about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and saying that its current presale stage is similar to Bitcoin’s (BTC) first growth cycle. If you’re an investor wondering why crypto prices are going up or watching them now, the answer is clear: businesses that are still in their early stages generally see huge increases. MUTM is distinct from other coins because it has a mix of presale momentum, mechanisms that are useful, and infrastructure that is meant to be faster than rivals like Ethereum (ETH). Five reasons Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mirrors early Bitcoin (BTC) momentum Analysts notice similarities with BTC since the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is growing so quickly. The project has now generated $15.85 million and gotten more than 16,350 holders, from Phase 1 at $0.01 to Phase 6 at $0.035. Demand has been stable, and prices have gone up with each phase. Investors who act sooner get the best deals. An investor who put $1,500 into Phase 1 got 150,000 MUTM, which illustrates how big the increase was. At the current Phase 6 price, that amount is already $5,250. With the ultimate listing price set at $0.06 and predictions going up to $2, the same tokens will be worth $300,000, which shows why getting in early is important. The second argument is usefulness. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adds peer-to-contract pools with stablecoins like DAI and USDC, which provide lenders with steady, predictable profits. If you put $20,000 in DAI, you will get mtDAI, which will yield you around 12% APY. That is a passive return of $2,400 in one year, which is a good thing in a market where volatility is regularly in the news. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows how predictable income streams may be combined with exposure to token growth for investors who want to know whether crypto is a solid investment. Third, borrowing is meant to be flexible. Picture someone with $5,000 worth of ADA. They may borrow up to 75% of the value of their ADA instead of selling it. This gives them $3,750 in cash flow while still benefiting from ADA’s performance. This method gives you flexibility without giving up long-term exposure, which is a problem that many crypto holders encounter. Fourth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) goes beyond conventional financing by creating a peer-to-peer model in detail. The P2P approach will link individual lenders and borrowers, whereas peer-to-contract lets funds communicate directly with a protocol. Because of this flexibility, users may agree on conditions that work for them, and the platform will make sure that everything is protected, backed up, and settled. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a financing environment that works for a wide range of users by integrating P2C and P2P. Analysts point to security as the fifth reason. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed a CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. In a market where trust is important for investor confidence, these figures matter. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with reward levels up to $2,000 for important findings strengthens security by making sure that the system is always being watched and is able to withstand attacks. Expected listings on Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase will give traders throughout the world more trust. Historically, exposure on these exchanges has led to quick uptake, which puts MUTM in a good position to reach a lot of people once the presale rounds are over. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s infrastructure will outpace Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) changed decentralized finance, but its problems with scale are still a problem. High gas prices and long wait times for transactions have frequently made it hard for people to join, particularly when the network is busy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developed with Layer-2 integration from the start, which means that transactions will be almost immediate and much cheaper. This makes things easier for both borrowers and lenders, which is something that is now preventing DeFi from being used on ETH. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also stand out in terms of how volatile the market is. The loan-to-value ratios are carefully planned. For example, Ethereum (ETH) and other stable tokens will have LTVs of around 75%, while Chainlink (LINK) and other more volatile assets would have LTVs of about 40%. These settings operate as guardrails to prevent users from having to sell their assets when prices shift quickly. The platform builds trust in long-term interaction by putting safety and accessibility first. A final call before the next price rise The emergence of Bitcoin (BTC) is now a legend, but the essential lesson is still the same: those who acted first got the most out of it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering the same mix of usefulness, safety, and investment growth that early BTC experts saw. The presale is now in Phase 6, and the token costs $0.035. In Phase 7, this price will go up by 15%. People who are keeping an eye on crypto prices now know that the window for an inexpensive entrance shuts rapidly if a project gets big listings. Whether you’re wondering whether crypto is a viable investment, look at utility-driven enterprises that are still in their early stages. Just as those who bought BTC early didn’t think too much about their choices, people who buy MUTM today will get in before the presale momentum leads to widespread acceptance.

The Bullrunners host explained that while government officials are projecting strong economic growth, market data suggest recession risks are building. He urged XRP investors and broader crypto participants to take defensive measures to protect their holdings in the uncertain months ahead. Ripple #XRP Holders – You have 90 DAYS to PREPARE (Watch This NOW!) pic.twitter.com/CGW0JFeDbe — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) September 15, 2025 Statements from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick The video highlighted comments from Howard Lutnick, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, who said the United States is on the verge of record-scale factory construction, with projects exceeding ten trillion dollars. He projected that this expansion would create major job growth and make the first quarter of next year the strongest in U.S. history for construction. Lutnick also forecast GDP growth above four percent under President Donald Trump’s administration. Recession Concerns and Economic Strains The Bullrunners host challenged these projections, arguing they overlook mounting risks. Analysts such as Andy Goldberg expect a recession by late 2025 or early 2026, while Daily Op Capital has flagged labor market weakness and a potential AI bubble. U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities delinquency rates have risen to 11.7%, surpassing levels seen during the 2008 crisis. Banks are also carrying $395 billion in unrealized losses, raising doubts about financial stability. Cycles and Historical Parallels The video compared current conditions to past cycles, including the dot-com bubble of 2000 and the shale industry downturn of the late 2000s. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence markets was described as showing bubble characteristics. The Federal Reserve is also expected to cut rates this week for the first time in 2025, a step that historically has preceded financial turbulence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Role and Market Outlook The discussion turned to Ripple’s efforts to modernize cross-border payments . Ripple’s CEO explained that most banks rely on intermediaries like JPMorgan or Citibank. However, Ripple is working with over 100 banks to enable direct settlement using XRP, which processes transactions in three seconds. He said XRP’s long-term value lies in solving large-scale liquidity problems. Looking ahead, Bullrunners pointed to Ripple’s upcoming Swell event, with institutions such as the European Central Bank, IMF, Federal Reserve, and BRICS expected to test Ripple’s technology. Anticipation also surrounds pending XRP spot ETF applications due by late October, which could boost institutional demand. At the time of the video, XRP was priced at $3.04, with resistance seen around $3.56 to $3.70 and an upside target of $4.38 if momentum continues. Bullrunners concluded that the next ninety days are crucial for preparation. While official forecasts highlight growth, mounting data points to financial risks. At the same time, Ripple’s advancing role in banking and the spot ETFs underscore XRP’s growing significance in global finance.

Recent news has sent a ripple of concern through the crypto community, shedding light on a significant Coinbase data breach . It’s an unsettling development that highlights the constant need for vigilance in safeguarding digital assets. Unmasking the Suspect: Who Was Behind the Coinbase Data Breach? According to recent reports from Fortune, citing crucial court documents, the likely suspect in the extensive Coinbase data breach that came to light in May is an employee of TaskUs, a third-party contractor. This revelation points to Ashita Mishra as the individual allegedly at the center of the security incident. The investigation suggests that Mishra began exploiting access to Coinbase customer information as early as last September. The method involved systematically stealing this sensitive data and subsequently selling it to various hackers. This alleged operation underscores a critical vulnerability: the trust placed in external service providers. The Staggering Scale of the Customer Data Compromise The scale of the alleged data theft is truly alarming. Investigators found that Ashita Mishra was reportedly passing on details for more than 200 customer accounts every single day, each fetching a price of $200. This sustained activity painted a grim picture of the potential damage. Key findings from the investigation include: Over 10,000 Customer Records: Mishra’s mobile phone was found to contain the information of more than 10,000 Coinbase customers. Estimated 69,000 Victims: The total number of individuals impacted by this particular Coinbase data breach is estimated to be around 69,000. This figure highlights the widespread nature of the compromise. Recruitment of Accomplices: It’s also alleged that Mishra actively recruited colleagues to establish a dedicated channel for these illicit data leaks, indicating a more organized effort than a solitary act. Such a large-scale compromise originating from an insider within a contractor’s team raises serious questions about vetting processes and internal security protocols. What Does This Mean for Coinbase Users and Crypto Security? This incident serves as a stark reminder of the multifaceted threats present in the digital asset space. While exchanges like Coinbase invest heavily in their own security infrastructure, the reliance on third-party contractors introduces additional layers of risk. The Coinbase data breach through a contractor’s employee underscores this challenge. For Coinbase users, and indeed all crypto enthusiasts, it emphasizes the importance of: Vigilance: Regularly monitoring account activity for any suspicious transactions. Strong Security Practices: Always using unique, complex passwords and enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on all accounts. Awareness: Being skeptical of unsolicited communications that ask for personal information or login credentials. Protecting Your Digital Assets After a Data Breach In the wake of any Coinbase data breach or similar security incident, proactive steps are essential. While Coinbase itself would likely take measures to secure affected accounts, individual users also have a crucial role to play in protecting their investments. Consider these actionable insights: Change Passwords Immediately: If you use the same password across multiple platforms, change them all, especially for your Coinbase account and associated email. Strengthen 2FA: Ensure you are using the strongest form of 2FA available, such as hardware keys (YubiKey) or authenticator apps, rather than SMS-based 2FA. Monitor Financial Statements: Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and credit card statements for any unauthorized activity. Be Wary of Phishing: Scammers often capitalize on news of data breaches to launch phishing attacks. Be extremely cautious of emails or messages claiming to be from Coinbase. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about the latest security best practices in the cryptocurrency world. The alleged actions of a contractor’s employee in this Coinbase data breach serve as a powerful reminder that security is a shared responsibility. While exchanges strive to protect their users, individual vigilance remains a cornerstone of digital asset safety. This incident highlights the critical need for continuous review of security protocols, both internal and external, to safeguard customer data in an ever-evolving threat landscape. Staying informed and proactive is your best defense. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is the suspected individual in the Coinbase data breach? A1: Ashita Mishra, an employee of Coinbase’s contractor TaskUs, is the likely suspect, according to court documents cited by Fortune. Q2: What was the estimated scale of the customer data compromised? A2: The investigation suggests information from over 10,000 customer mobile phones was accessed, with an estimated total of around 69,000 victims in this particular Coinbase data breach incident. Q3: How did the suspect allegedly carry out the data theft? A3: Ashita Mishra allegedly began stealing Coinbase customer information last September and selling it to hackers, reportedly passing on more than 200 customer accounts per day for $200 each. Mishra is also said to have recruited colleagues to facilitate these data leaks. Q4: What should Coinbase users do if they suspect their account was affected? A4: Users should immediately change their Coinbase password and any linked email passwords, enable or strengthen Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and actively monitor their account for suspicious activity. Be cautious of phishing attempts related to the breach. Q5: What lessons can be learned from this incident regarding crypto security? A5: This incident underscores the critical importance of robust security vetting for third-party contractors, continuous monitoring of internal and external access, and the necessity for users to maintain strong personal security practices like unique passwords and 2FA.

OKX, a leading global crypto exchange, has just announced the much-anticipated listing of ENA/USDT and PENDLE/USDT perpetual futures contracts. This move is set to open up thrilling new avenues for traders, allowing them to engage with these popular altcoins with substantial leverage. Understanding the implications of these new OKX perpetual futures listings is key for anyone looking to capitalize on market movements. What Are OKX Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? Perpetual futures are a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t expire, making them a popular choice for continuous trading. For many in the crypto space, these contracts offer flexibility and opportunities to profit from both rising and falling markets. Flexibility: No expiration date means traders can hold positions as long as they wish. Leverage: Amplify potential gains (and losses) with borrowed funds. Market Access: Trade popular cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. The introduction of ENA and PENDLE to the OKX perpetual futures lineup signifies growing institutional and retail interest in these specific projects. OKX’s decision to list them underscores their market relevance and potential for significant price action. Deep Dive into ENA and PENDLE: What Makes Them Special? ENA (Ethena) and PENDLE (Pendle Finance) represent innovative corners of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Their inclusion on OKX’s perpetual futures platform highlights their increasing prominence and trading demand. Ethena (ENA): Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, offering a crypto-native solution for money that is independent of traditional banking infrastructure. Its USDe stablecoin aims to be censorship-resistant and scalable, making it a compelling asset in the DeFi world. Traders are often drawn to its unique approach to stability and yield generation. Pendle Finance (PENDLE): Pendle is a DeFi protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future yield. Essentially, it splits yield-bearing assets into principal tokens (PT) and yield tokens (YT), enabling users to fix their yield, speculate on future yield, or provide liquidity. This innovative approach to yield management attracts users looking for advanced strategies to optimize their returns. Both ENA and PENDLE offer distinct value propositions within the crypto sphere, contributing to their appeal for traders engaging with OKX perpetual futures . Navigating the High-Leverage Landscape: Risks and Rewards of OKX Perpetual Futures One of the most compelling features of these new listings is the availability of up to 50x leverage. This means that for every dollar you put in, you can control a position worth fifty dollars. While this can dramatically amplify potential profits, it also significantly increases the risk of substantial losses. Consider these points when trading with high leverage: Amplified Gains: A small price movement in your favor can lead to significant returns. Amplified Losses: Conversely, a small adverse price movement can quickly liquidate your position. Risk Management is Crucial: Always use stop-loss orders and only trade with capital you can afford to lose. Market Volatility: ENA and PENDLE, like many altcoins, can experience high volatility, which is further exacerbated by leverage. Engaging with OKX perpetual futures requires a thorough understanding of these dynamics. It’s not just about picking the right asset, but also about managing your exposure effectively. Actionable Insights for Trading ENA and PENDLE on OKX Perpetual Futures For traders looking to dive into these new opportunities, a strategic approach is essential. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Research: Understand the fundamentals of ENA and PENDLE. What are their use cases? What are the latest developments? Start Small: Especially if you’re new to perpetual futures or high leverage, begin with smaller position sizes to get a feel for the market. Implement Risk Management: Set clear stop-loss and take-profit levels. Never trade without a plan. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on news and social media trends surrounding ENA and PENDLE, as these can influence price action. Stay Informed: Follow OKX announcements and market analysis to stay ahead of potential shifts. By combining careful research with disciplined risk management, you can navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of OKX perpetual futures . The listing of ENA and PENDLE perpetual futures on OKX represents a significant expansion of trading opportunities for crypto enthusiasts. With up to 50x leverage, these contracts offer the potential for substantial gains, but also come with heightened risks. Successful engagement hinges on a deep understanding of the underlying assets, meticulous risk management, and continuous market awareness. As the crypto landscape evolves, platforms like OKX continue to innovate, providing powerful tools for traders to interact with the digital asset economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

However, the company faces serious challenges due to having to build liquidity and establish distribution channels from scratch, according to Bernstein analysts. Tether's new US product, USAT, aims to meet regulatory compliance requirements such as proof of reserves and bankruptcy protection. However, analysts argue that simply operating within the legal framework won't be enough for success. They point out that Tether's main challenges lie in generating liquidity and integrating into the US market.

Furthermore, analysts noted, “Fundamentally changing liquidity in the crypto ecosystem is extremely difficult, and simply sharing incentives is not enough.” Tether will need to build liquidity from scratch and attract partners for USAT, which is scheduled to launch towards the end of the year.

A recent survey reveals that more than half of financial institutions currently not using stablecoins are planning to adopt them within the next year. This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a clear signal of mainstream acceptance and a future where digital assets play a pivotal role in traditional finance. The Crucial Surge of Stablecoin Adoption in Finance The groundbreaking survey, conducted by EY-Parthenon, the strategy consulting arm of Ernst & Young, polled 350 financial executives. The findings are compelling: 54% of firms that haven’t yet embraced stablecoins intend to start using them within the next six to twelve months. This rapid planned adoption highlights a growing recognition of the unique benefits these digital currencies offer. For institutions already leveraging stablecoins , the advantages are tangible. A significant 41% reported achieving cost savings of at least 10% compared to traditional payment methods. This efficiency gain is a powerful motivator for firms looking to modernize their operations and reduce overheads. When it comes to preferred choices, the survey offers clear insights into the current market leaders: USDC: Dominates with 77% adoption among current users. USDT: Follows closely at 59%. Euro-denominated stablecoins: Show strong regional interest at 45%. These figures underscore the practical utility and trust being built around specific stablecoins within the financial sector. Why Are Financial Firms Embracing Stablecoins? The move towards stablecoins isn’t arbitrary; it’s driven by a confluence of factors that address critical pain points in traditional finance. Financial institutions are constantly seeking ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the speed of transactions. Stablecoins offer a compelling solution to these challenges. Consider the benefits: Reduced Transaction Costs: As reported, significant savings of 10% or more are a major draw. Faster Settlements: Transactions can settle in minutes, not days, improving liquidity and operational flow. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain technology provides an immutable ledger for all transactions. Global Reach: Facilitating seamless cross-border payments with fewer intermediaries. These advantages make a strong case for integrating stablecoins into existing financial frameworks, particularly for payment processing and treasury management. Navigating the Path to Stablecoin Integration While the benefits of stablecoins are clear, their integration isn’t without its considerations. Financial firms must navigate an evolving regulatory landscape. Governments and central banks worldwide are still developing comprehensive frameworks for digital assets, including stablecoins . Staying informed and compliant is paramount for any institution venturing into this space. Moreover, firms need to address: Technological Integration: Ensuring seamless compatibility with existing legacy systems. Security Concerns: Implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect digital assets. Scalability: Choosing stablecoins and platforms that can handle high transaction volumes. Risk Management: Understanding and mitigating risks associated with digital asset volatility and smart contract vulnerabilities. Despite these challenges, the proactive stance of over half of non-adopting firms indicates a willingness to overcome these hurdles, viewing stablecoins as an inevitable and beneficial evolution. What Does This Mean for the Future of Payments? The survey’s findings paint a vivid picture of a future where stablecoins are no longer niche digital assets but integral components of the global financial infrastructure. This widespread adoption by financial institutions could revolutionize how payments are made, how capital is moved, and how financial services are delivered. The increasing use of USDC, USDT, and euro-denominated stablecoins points to a diversified ecosystem. This suggests that different stablecoins may find specialized roles, catering to various regional needs or specific use cases within the financial industry. The trend also signals a potential shift away from traditional correspondent banking models, offering more direct and efficient payment rails. This is a transformative moment for finance. The clear intent of institutions to adopt stablecoins underscores their potential to drive significant innovation and efficiency across the industry. It’s an exciting time to watch as these digital assets reshape the future of financial transactions.

BTC gained 1.5% on the day, and almost 5% on the week, but had retreated slightly to $116,600 at the time of writing on Wednesday morning in Asia. The move comes on the day that the US Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates for the first time this year. This will lead to greater liquidity and a potential cycle of monetary easing, which has been historically bullish for riskier assets such as crypto. Crypto Analysts Weigh In Economist Alex Krüger said he was ready for the dovish cut despite markets already pricing the move in. “Though my market views have not changed much. I’m bullish on equities and Bitcoin. The market often forgets how much BTC can move due to recency bias.” Rate cuts also result in liquidity flow from less-risky assets like treasury bills to high-risk assets like stocks and crypto, observed ‘Ash Crypto.’ “As more cuts happen, liquidity flows into Bitcoin, and altcoins will increase,” he said before adding: “We already have major catalysts like ETF approval, pro-crypto administration and regulatory clarity. Once liquidity starts to flow, these catalysts will be priced in, leading to a parabolic Q4 rally.” “The last time the FED cut rates, the market pumped very hard,” said crypto analyst Sykodelic. The last time the FED cut rates the market pumped very hard. So I honestly do not understand why so many people are bearish about rate cuts? We are quite literally, almost to the day, in the exact same position we were last time the FED cut rates. IF we had been mega pumping… pic.twitter.com/OWVDcwgnZY — Sykodelic (@Sykodelic_) September 16, 2025 Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes spoke about the Fed’s “third mandate,” which is now being discussed. Advocacy for yield curve control (YCC) signals a potential shift in monetary policy, which is good for Bitcoin , he alluded. Weakening the Greenback Excess liquidity also tends to weaken the US dollar as more dollars chase fewer goods and assets. Bitcoin, often viewed as a “digital gold” or hedge against inflation, historically benefits from a weaker dollar. The dollar index (DXY), which measures USD against a basket of currencies, has already weakened 12% so far this year. Speaking on CNBC on Monday, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee said the Fed “can actually reinject confidence by saying we’re back into an easing cycle,” before adding that a rate cut will be a “real improvement in liquidity.” He predicted that Bitcoin and Ethereum would make a “monster move” in the last three months of this year.

Meanwhile, REX-Osprey is preparing to debut two altcoin funds this week: the XRP ETF (XRPR), the first US spot product for the token, and the Dogecoin ETF (DOJE), which will be the country’s first meme coin ETF. Both products are launching under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which provides an automatic approval pathway after the 75-day review period. Bitwise Plans Stablecoin Tokenization ETF Bitwise filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the “Stablecoin & Tokenization ETF.” The proposed ETF is designed to track an index split evenly between equities and crypto assets, targeting the fast-growing stablecoin and tokenization sectors. According to the filing, the equity sleeve will include companies directly tied to stablecoins and tokenization, like issuers, payment processors, infrastructure providers, exchanges, and even retailers. Meanwhile, the crypto asset sleeve will offer exposure to blockchain infrastructure supporting these technologies, including oracles and regulated exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The index will undergo quarterly rebalancing, with the largest crypto ETP capped at 22.5% of the sleeve. Bitwise filing with the SEC This new filing reflects the fact that there is growing competition in the market for mixed crypto-equity ETFs, as products like Nicholas Wealth’s Crypto Income ETF (BLOX) also combine stocks and crypto-linked exposure. Bitwise was founded in 2017, and already manages over 20 US-listed crypto ETFs. This makes it one of the most active players in the space. Analysts suggest Bitwise’s product could be approved by November if regulators give the green light. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas pointed out that the SEC is currently delaying most crypto ETF applications until October and November, setting up a busy period for potential launches. The timing of Bitwise’s filing also proves the rising importance of stablecoins and tokenization as investment themes. Since the US passed the GENIUS Act in July, the market expanded by growing from $205 billion in January to nearly $290 billion this week, according to DefiLlama . Stablecoin market overview (Source: DeFiLlama ) Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), like blockchain-based bonds and credit instruments, have also seen a lot of adoption, with their market reaching $76 billion in 2025. Analysts attribute this surge to the pro-crypto policy shift under President Donald Trump’s administration, and SEC Chair Paul Atkins explicitly endorsing tokenization as an innovation worth supporting. This political backing unleashed a wave of ETF proposals across the sector, ranging from straightforward Bitcoin and Ethereum funds to more specialized strategies like Bitwise’s latest submission. If approved, the Stablecoin & Tokenization ETF will give investors a unique vehicle to gain diversified exposure to two of the fastest-growing areas in the industry. XRP and Dogecoin ETFs Coming This Week Meanwhile, two new altcoin ETFs are set to debut in the United States this week, and will offer investors fresh exposure to XRP and Dogecoin as regulators seem more open to crypto-linked investment products. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, which will trade under the ticker XRPR, is expected to be the first US ETF to provide spot exposure to XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. According to the fund issuer, trading could begin as early as Friday after the expiration of the SEC’s 75-day review window. Unless unexpected objections arise, the ETF will be automatically approved under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a framework that provides a faster approval route than the Securities Act of 1933, which governs spot Bitcoin ETFs. The 1940 Act approach allows these products to move forward without direct SEC intervention after the review period, setting the stage for XRPR to test investor demand for altcoin exposure in an ETF structure. Nate Geraci , president of ETF store Nova Dius, believes that this launch will serve as a litmus test for appetite around XRP spot products, particularly as futures-based XRP ETFs are already approaching $1 billion in assets under management. Dogecoin will follow closely behind, with Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas confirming that the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, trading under the ticker DOJE, is slated for a Thursday launch. This fund was also cleared under the 1940 Act framework, and will be the first meme coin ETF in the United States. While the Dogecoin fund may attract some attention due to the token’s popularity, REX-Osprey’s previous Solana staking ETF (SSK), which launched in July, struggled to gain momentum. It is managing $274 million in assets with less than $25 million in recent inflows . The firm also plans to expand its lineup, with a BNB staking ETF filing submitted in late August.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/jake-claver-xrp-at-10-13-is-realistic-20-25-by-years-end-isnt-crazy-heres-why/,"Crypto proponent John Squire drew attention to a recent appearance by business leader Jake Claver on the Paul Barron Show, where Claver outlined his expectations for XRP’s price performance in connection with exchange-traded funds. According to Squire’s post, Claver described a range of $10 to $13 for XRP as realistic if ETFs are launched, adding that a move to $20 to $25 by year’s end would not be out of reach. In the video clip of “The XRP Pod” attached to the post, Claver explained his broader theory for how XRP could reach much higher valuations, noting that he envisions several catalysts aligning together to create significant momentum. While he stressed that multiple elements would be required for extremely high prices, he placed strong emphasis on the role ETFs could play in creating liquidity and broad market access. JUST IN: Jake Claver told the Paul Barron Show that with ETFs on the horizon, seeing #XRP at $10–$13 is realistic and $20–$25 by year’s end isn’t crazy! pic.twitter.com/cOSlU9R11k — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 15, 2025 Key Points From the Discussion During the conversation, Barron encouraged Claver to consider the scenario under minimal assumptions, such as the confirmation of ETFs and the likelihood of a rate cut, which he estimated at 90 percent. Responding to this framework, Claver stated that a price between $10 and $13 for XRP would be very reasonable, with the potential for $20 to $25 depending on market conditions. He specifically tied the higher range to the introduction of ETFs this year, emphasizing that the liquidity generated from such products would be a decisive factor. When Barron asked if this forecast applied to the end of the current year or the following year, Claver was clear that his projection was for the end of this year, provided that ETFs are launched. He acknowledged that other factors beyond ETFs could contribute to XRP surpassing even these estimates. However, within the specific context of ETFs, he argued that the stated ranges were the most reasonable expectations. Broader Implications of the Forecast Claver’s comments, highlighted by Squire, contribute to ongoing expectations that regulated financial products tied to XRP could attract substantial institutional capital. The potential approval of ETFs would mark a major development for the digital asset, as they provide traditional investors with exposure without direct custody of the token. According to Claver, the liquidity the instruments would bring into the market could transform the pricing environment within a short timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While Claver did not provide a detailed timeline for scenarios involving higher valuations beyond $25, he reiterated that multiple catalysts beyond ETFs would be needed to drive such outcomes. His focus in this discussion remained on what he called the “bare minimum” case involving ETF approval and monetary policy adjustments, which he believes would already be sufficient to push XRP into a new price range by year’s end. Squire’s highlighting of Claver’s remarks places attention on a developing narrative surrounding XRP’s integration into regulated investment products. With expectations surrounding ETF approvals and interest rate cuts forming the backdrop, Claver’s forecast reflects a view that significant liquidity inflows are both possible and impactful in the near term. Whether these conditions align as anticipated will be central to determining whether XRP reaches the ranges he described before the close of the year.

Reportedly, the Justice Department is discussing with Binance whether it should continue to have an outside compliance monitor. The development marked another sign of the DOJ’s softer stance on independent oversight after rolling back several monitors introduced under the Biden administration. This comes as Binance sought to reassure customers on Tuesday last week after one of the largest supply chain attacks ever to hit the JavaScript ecosystem. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the exchange said no user data or assets were compromised during the incident. In a statement posted on X, Binance confirmed its database was unaffected by the breach, which targeted widely used Node.js packages involved in more than 2 billion weekly app downloads. The US Justice Department has scrapped monitorship programs for some companies Binance has been trying to smooth ties with US regulators . The exchange’s founder. Changpeng Zhao, who went to prison for four months as part of the 2023 settlement, even said in May he hoped for a pardon from President Trump. The exchange has also worked with the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial to establish a new stablecoin. Per reports, the platform wrote the basic code to power WLFI’s USD1. The Justice Department is still reviewing the status of the three-year Binance monitorship. However, it would probably demand the company step up its compliance reporting before dropping it. US prosecutors have also been considering dropping the requirement for other companies to retain outside monitors, a compliance tool critics have claimed is both expensive and intrusive. The DOJ has often used independent monitors in settlements to prevent repeat corporate offenses, such as bribery or money laundering. However, in a memo this year, Criminal Division leader Matthew Galeotti noted that these monitors can also add extra costs and interfere with lawful business operations, despite their usefulness. So far, according to recent court filings, the DOJ has already terminated monitorships for three firms that agreed to them under the Biden administration. Additionally, prosecutors stated they would drop monitors at two Glencore Plc subsidiaries, which reported $142 million in related costs over 2023 and 2024. Not to mention, they agreed to end monitoring for a NatWest Group Plc subsidiary and Austal USA after both companies consented to stricter compliance reporting obligations. Binance has been under dual monitorships since its DOJ plea and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) settlement, though only the FinCEN-appointed monitor is still active at the moment. Boeing agreed to use a compliance consultant instead of a monitor Several companies are still under monitoring. According to Bloomberg Law, a monitor remains at a US subsidiary of Toronto-Dominion Bank, which pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, the first case of its kind. Balfour Beatty Communities LLC will also stay under oversight until mid-2026 so regulators can continue to assess its compliance systems after its 2021 guilty plea for defrauding the US military. Other companies are still under oversight but not under monitorships. The Boeing case especially turned monitorships into a point of contention. Prosecutors reversed course on installing an independent monitor tied to the plea agreement over the deadly 737 Max crashes. The original deal had been rejected by a Texas judge, who criticized a requirement that diversity and inclusion play a role in the monitor selection process. In May, the government and Boeing announced that they had struck a preliminary deal under which the company would sidestep criminal charges. The agreement calls for using a compliance consultant, not a monitor, who would guide the company without formally signing off on its compliance program.

51859618,582924,1758088800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51859618.jpeg,Google Unveils AI Payment Protocol With Coinbase As Partner For Stablecoin Integration,https://bitcoinist.com/google-unveils-ai-payment-protocol-with-coinbase/,"On Tuesday, the multinational tech company Google announced the release of a new payment protocol designed to streamline the process of sending and receiving money for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This open-source initiative expands beyond traditional payment methods like credit and debit cards to include stablecoins. Google’s New Payments Protocol To facilitate the integration of stablecoins , Google collaborated with US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which has already developed its own AI and crypto payment solutions through its x402 Bazaar program. Google also engaged with over 60 organizations, including major players like Salesforce, American Express, and Etsy, to incorporate a wide range of perspectives and capabilities into the new protocol. James Tromans, the head of Web3 at Google Cloud, emphasized the protocol’s design in an interview with Fortune, stating, “We built it from the ground up to consider both existing payment infrastructures and emerging capabilities like stablecoins.” Over the past year, AI solutions have been one of the largest trends in the cryptocurrency sector, driven by their ability to automate complex tasks such as trading and decentralized finance (DeFi) management. Given the significant interest in stablecoins following the passage and signing of the GENIUS Act , the United States’ first stablecoin bill, it seems that Google is positioning itself in support of this development, as well as of the Trump administration’s support for both crypto and AI solutions. Many industry leaders predict a future where AI systems will communicate autonomously, potentially allowing AI financial advisors to negotiate mortgages directly with AI representatives from various institutions, or personal shopping agents to engage with AI retailers. Tech Giants Embrace Stablecoins The recent launch builds on a protocol introduced by Google in April, which established a standard for communication between different artificial intelligence agents. Tromans noted that this new payments protocol is intended to ensure that transactions between artificial intelligence agents are safe, secure, and aligned with user intentions. Coinbase’s head of engineering, Erik Reppel, highlighted the importance of their partnership, stating, “We’re all working to figure out how we can make AI transmit value to each other.” Reppel believes that this new collaboration between the two giants, aims to pave the way for a more interconnected digital economy, where AI systems can seamlessly facilitate financial transactions. Google’s entry into the stablecoin space aligns with a growing interest among major tech firms . Companies like Apple, Airbnb, and Meta are exploring stablecoin integrations, reflecting a broader trend in Silicon Valley toward embracing cryptocurrency. In June, e-commerce platform Shopify also announced plans to implement stablecoin payment options later this year, further indicating a shift towards new financial solutions.

Bitcoin Is Still Maintaining Above Short-Term Holder Realized Price In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about the Realized Price of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor or address on the BTC network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Score Sees Sharp Jump, No Longer Signals Bear Phase When the value of the metric is greater than BTC’s spot price, it means the investors as a whole are sitting on some net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the asset’s value implies the overall market is in a state of net loss. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of a specific segment of the userbase is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). This cohort includes the investors who purchased their tokens within the past 155 days. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price for the STHs over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin retested the STH Realized Price at the start of the month and found support at it. Since then, the coin’s price has seen some recovery. This pattern of the STH Realized Price acting as a support barrier has actually been seen many times through this bull market. The reason behind the pattern may lie in investor psychology. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. Since the STHs have a relatively low holding time, however, they don’t tend to be resolute, and thus, easily make panic moves when shifts occur in the market. The STHs can particularly be susceptible to panic when the cryptocurrency retests their break-even level. When the market mood is bullish, the reaction comes in the form of buying. This is because the STHs look at drawdowns to their cost basis as dip-buying opportunities. Similarly, STHs react to surges to their Realized Price by selling during bearish periods instead, fearing that the asset would decline again in the near future and send them back into a state of loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows In Last 1.5 Years Surpassed First 15 Years Combined: Data For now, Bitcoin is maintaining above the STH Realized Price. “As long as the price respects this level, the trend remains constructive,” notes the analytics firm. “Losing this support has coincided with phases of contraction or pullbacks.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $116,200, up almost 5% over the last seven days.

Investors are now looking for safer options as the crypto market experiences turbulence. Meme coins like PEPE are showing signs of a possible rebound, but many are turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) . With real-world PayFi features, a live wallet beta, and ranking #1 on CertiK for prelaunch tokens, Remittix provides a practical way to protect investments while staying involved in crypto growth. Shiba Inu Price Falls After Shibarium Hack Shiba Inu price is currently $0.00001307. The coin has taken a heavy hit recently due to the broader crypto market downturn. Ethereum dropped to $4,500, and other major altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, and Chainlink also fell by over 3%. The main blow to Shiba Inu came from a hack on Shibarium, its largest DeFi protocol. The attacker used a flash loan of 4.6 million BONE tokens worth $2.3 million. They also gained control over 10 of 12 validator signing keys, allowing them to approve state checkpoints. This led to the theft of 224 ETH (over $1 million) and 92.6 billion SHIB tokens (over $1.27 million). The SHIB price has fallen below the 50-week EMA, showing that bears are in control. The weekly chart shows a symmetrical triangle forming, which is part of a bearish pennant pattern. When the two lines converge, a strong bearish breakout is likely. If this pattern plays out, the Shiba Inu coin price could fall to around $0.000005955, its lowest level in 2023. This represents a potential drop of about 55% from the current level, which is a warning for investors looking at Shiba Inu price prediction for the near term. PEPE Price Gains Momentum PEPE price is currently $0.00001085. After slowing down over the last year, PEPE has started showing bullish signs. Over the past weekend, the meme coin rallied more than 10%, forming a falling wedge pattern on the chart. A falling wedge pattern is generally a bullish reversal signal. It shows that sellers are losing strength and buyers are likely to take over. If this pattern confirms, PEPE could see a strong rally, potentially rising above $0.000018. This would be more than a 60% increase. In the best-case scenario, the meme coin could even approach a 90% gain if momentum continues. Remittix Offers a Hedge Against Volatility Remittix is a PayFi token that allows users to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. The project has CertiK verification and a top pre-launch ranking, highlighting its security and credibility. The Q3 wallet beta is live, giving early users access to cross-border payment features. The token’s latest metrics show over 664 million sold, a price of $0.1080, and more than $25.9 million raised. Some features of Remittix are as follows: The referral program pays 15% in USDT, claimable daily via the Remittix dashboard. Remittix supports real-time FX conversion, making crypto-to-bank transfers faster and easier. Deflationary tokenomics are designed for long-term growth, rewarding patient holders. The platform is ideal for freelancers, remitters, and global earners, giving practical use beyond speculation. Project momentum is rising ahead of the wallet launch, giving early investors a strategic advantage. RTX Offers Investors New Opportunities The Shibarium hack and broader crypto sell-off have put pressure on Shiba Inu price prediction, suggesting that SHIB could fall significantly in the short term. PEPE shows promise with bullish patterns, but Remittix stands out as a practical and secure choice for investors looking to hedge against volatility. With its real-world PayFi use, growing adoption, referral program, and upcoming wallet launch, Remittix offers both stability and upside potential in a market filled with uncertainty.

The amended class-action complaint, filed Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, expands on earlier disclosures about how criminals infiltrated Coinbase’s support operations in India. Plaintiffs accuse TaskUs of systemic failures and concealment, saying insiders funneled user data to hackers from late 2024 until the breach was uncovered in Jan. 2025. Court documents reveal further details of the Coinbase data breach. Ashita Mishra, an employee at Coinbase's outsourced customer service company in India, stole sensitive customer information, including social security numbers and bank account details, starting in September 2024.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 17, 2025 TaskUs Staff Allegedly Paid $200 a Photo to Leak Coinbase Data According to the filing, TaskUs employees were paid $200 per picture to photograph customer information displayed on their computer screens. The complaint estimates that the bribes generated at least $500,000, a sum equivalent to the annual salaries of more than 100 employees in India. Investigators identified one worker, Ashita Mishra, as joining the conspiracy as early as Sept. 2024. The filing says she stored personal data from more than 10,000 Coinbase customers on her phone and at times took up to 200 photos a day. The documents describe a “hub-and-spoke” conspiracy in which Mishra and an accomplice directed smaller groups of TaskUs employees to collect and pass along Coinbase user records. The filing claims that many participants were unaware of others’ involvement, allowing the operation to continue even if one individual was exposed. Complaint Says TaskUs Tried to Silence Insiders Over Data Leak TaskUs dismissed around 300 staff in January after discovering the scope of the breach. Plaintiffs allege the company attempted to silence insiders who raised concerns and even fired human resources personnel who began investigating. Reuters previously reported that TaskUs staff used personal phones to capture screenshots of Coinbase accounts, exposing names, addresses, transaction logs and bank details. The new complaint characterizes the scheme as “a far broader and coordinated criminal campaign” than TaskUs has admitted publicly. @Coinbase has disclosed a data breach involving a small subset of customer information. #Coinbase #DataBreach https://t.co/qfBEmf3Cc0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 15, 2025 The plaintiffs also accuse TaskUs of delaying disclosure. They argue that Coinbase knew about the leak in January . However, the company only went public in May. By then, criminals had already stolen between $180m and $400m in customer assets. Exchange Cut Ties With Overseas Agents Following Data Leak Coinbase said it notified regulators and users as soon as it became aware of the breach and reimbursed affected customers. In response, the company said it terminated the TaskUs personnel involved , cut ties with other overseas agents and implemented tighter controls. It has not publicly named the other foreign agents implicated. The case exposes the risks of outsourcing critical customer functions in the crypto industry, where exchanges handle sensitive personal data alongside financial assets. Analysts say the allegations, if proven, could reshape how exchanges manage offshore operations. For TaskUs, the claims could prove damaging to its reputation as a trusted business process outsourcing provider.

Hong Kong is stepping up its game in the digital asset space, signaling a future where traditional banking and innovative blockchain technology merge seamlessly. This bold move is set to redefine how commercial banks operate and how investors access assets. At the heart of this transformation are Hong Kong’s tokenization initiatives , poised to unlock new efficiencies and opportunities across the financial landscape. What Are Hong Kong’s Tokenization Initiatives All About? Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee recently made a pivotal announcement, confirming the city’s commitment to fostering digital assets. As reported by the Shanghai Securities News, this isn’t just talk; it’s a strategic roadmap. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively preparing to support commercial banks as they venture into groundbreaking areas: Tokenized Deposits: Imagine your bank deposits existing as digital tokens on a blockchain. This innovation promises enhanced efficiency, faster settlements, and potentially new financial products. Trading Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA): This is a game-changer. RWAs can be anything from real estate and art to commodities and intellectual property, all represented as digital tokens. Tokenizing these assets can unlock liquidity, enable fractional ownership, and broaden investment access. Furthermore, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is carefully considering an expansion of digital asset products and services for professional investors. This expansion comes with a crucial caveat: robust investor protections must be firmly in place. Hong Kong is prioritizing innovation, but not at the expense of security and trust. Why is Hong Kong Tokenization a Game Changer? The embrace of Hong Kong tokenization initiatives isn’t an isolated event; it’s part of a consistent, forward-thinking strategy. Hong Kong has been methodically building a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Previous steps include establishing clear guidelines for: Cryptocurrency exchanges Stablecoin issuers Strengthening custody systems for client assets on licensed platforms These foundational measures ensure that as new tokenized products emerge, the underlying infrastructure is secure and regulated. This systematic approach builds confidence among institutions and investors alike, positioning Hong Kong as a reliable hub for digital finance innovation. The move towards tokenized deposits and RWA trading offers several compelling benefits: Enhanced Efficiency: Blockchain technology can streamline processes, reduce intermediaries, and accelerate transaction speeds. Increased Liquidity: Tokenizing illiquid assets like real estate can make them more easily tradable, opening up new investment avenues. Greater Transparency: The immutable nature of blockchain ledgers provides a high degree of transparency for asset ownership and transactions. Fractional Ownership: Tokenization allows large assets to be divided into smaller, more affordable units, making them accessible to a wider range of investors. Expanding Digital Horizons: Beyond Basic Hong Kong Tokenization The SFC’s consideration to broaden digital asset offerings for professional investors signals a deep commitment to evolving the financial landscape. This isn’t just about facilitating existing transactions; it’s about fostering an environment where new and complex digital asset products can thrive responsibly. For professional investors, this could mean access to a more diverse portfolio, incorporating innovative financial instruments backed by blockchain technology. The emphasis on “robust investor protections” highlights Hong Kong’s balanced approach. Innovation is encouraged, but regulatory oversight remains paramount. This commitment to security and integrity is vital for building long-term trust in the digital asset ecosystem. The goal is to ensure that as the market for Hong Kong tokenization grows, it does so on a foundation of stability and accountability. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in Hong Kong Tokenization While the prospects for Hong Kong tokenization initiatives are exciting, the journey ahead will involve navigating certain challenges. These include: Regulatory Nuances: Continuously adapting and refining regulations to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology. Technological Integration: Ensuring seamless integration of blockchain solutions with existing banking infrastructure. Market Education: Educating commercial banks, investors, and the broader public about the benefits and risks of tokenized assets. Cybersecurity: Maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to protect digital assets from sophisticated threats. Despite these challenges, the opportunities are immense. Hong Kong is positioning itself to be a global leader in digital finance, attracting talent, capital, and innovation. The support for commercial bank tokenization could serve as a blueprint for other financial hubs looking to embrace the future of finance. This proactive stance is a clear signal of Hong Kong’s ambition to remain a competitive and cutting-edge financial center. A Vision for a Digitally Advanced Financial Hub Hong Kong’s commitment to supporting commercial bank tokenization initiatives marks a pivotal moment in its financial evolution. By embracing tokenized deposits and real-world assets, and by expanding digital asset services for professional investors under stringent protections, Hong Kong is not just adapting to the future; it’s actively shaping it. This strategic vision promises a more efficient, liquid, and accessible financial ecosystem, reinforcing Hong Kong’s status as a leading global financial hub in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are tokenized deposits in the context of Hong Kong’s initiatives? Tokenized deposits are traditional bank deposits represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. This allows for more efficient, faster, and potentially programmable transactions compared to conventional banking methods. Q2: What are tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA)? Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) are physical or intangible assets (like real estate, art, commodities, or intellectual property) that are converted into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process can unlock liquidity, enable fractional ownership, and broaden investment access. Q3: Who can invest in these new digital asset products in Hong Kong? The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is considering expanding digital asset products and services primarily for professional investors, ensuring robust investor protections are in place. Q4: How does Hong Kong ensure investor protection in digital assets? Hong Kong emphasizes robust regulatory frameworks. This includes guidelines for licensed platforms to strengthen custody systems for client assets, along with ongoing oversight from bodies like the HKMA and SFC to ensure market integrity and security. Q5: What benefits do tokenization initiatives bring to Hong Kong’s financial sector? These initiatives promise enhanced efficiency, increased liquidity for illiquid assets, greater transparency through blockchain, and the possibility of fractional ownership. This positions Hong Kong as a leading, innovative digital finance hub. Did you find this article insightful?

In an X post, SMQKE wrote, “Yes, XRP was created before Ripple. Documented.” Alongside the post, he shared an image of a passage from the SMU Science and Technology Law Review. The section, titled “Difference Between Ripple and XRP,” contains detailed commentary on the relationship between the two, noting their separate purposes and histories. Yes, XRP was created before Ripple. Documented. pic.twitter.com/wOXHqUNTA7 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 15, 2025 Details from the Referenced Legal Review The academic review explains that Ripple and XRP are often incorrectly used as if they mean the same thing, when in reality they are distinct. Ripple is described as a privately owned company focused on developing solutions such as software and platforms to facilitate global money transfers at a lower cost. In contrast, XRP is defined as an independent cryptocurrency designed to operate as a bridge currency across various platforms. The review makes clear that while Ripple employs XRP in its products to provide banks and financial institutions with liquidity , the company does not own or control the technology behind XRP. Instead, XRP runs on open-source technology that is not controlled by any single entity and can be utilized or modified by anyone. This separation is central to the legal review’s conclusion, which emphasizes that XRP operates independently of Ripple and that the two cannot be interchanged. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Emphasis on Independence The review further distinguishes Ripple’s governance from XRP’s structure. Control over Ripple is held by its founders, directors, employees, and investors. By contrast, XRP is open to anyone who chooses to use it, with no centralized ownership. This distinction highlights the broader framework in which XRP functions, where governance is distributed and access is not dependent on corporate involvement. The review positions Ripple as a company that builds financial products, and XRP as a digital asset that stands on its own. The Core Point Presented By highlighting the statement from the SMU Science and Technology Law Review, SMQKE’s post underscores the documented fact that XRP predates Ripple. This chronology is presented in the review as evidence that the two should never be considered the same. The distinction carries implications for how XRP’s role is discussed within the broader financial and regulatory environment, as it emphasizes its independence from the corporate entity.

This price range reflects a broader stagnation in the cryptocurrency market, as various digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), struggle to regain the momentum that led both BTC and ETH reach new records above $124,000 and $4,9000 respectively. Notably, Citigroup, the third-largest investment bank in the United States, has tempered expectations for the Ethereum price, forecasting a year-end price target of $4,300 for the altcoin. Citi Forecasts Moderate ETF Inflows Into Ethereum According to a report by Reuters, Citigroup’s analysis attributes the current demand for Ethereum to burgeoning interest in Ethereum-based applications, including stablecoins and tokenization. However, the bank cautions that the recent price strength may be more a reflection of market sentiment than underlying fundamentals. Related Reading: Analyst Raises Red Flags On Bitcoin Price: Allegations Of Market Manipulation In a note released on Monday, Citi remarked, “Current prices are above activity estimates, potentially driven by recent buying pressure and excitement over use-cases.” Ethereum’s appeal has grown among investors looking for more than just price appreciation. Analysts forecast increased price growth for the altcoin due to the recent passage of bills, including the GENIUS Act, which aims to provide a new framework for stablecoins, as well as the surge in interest in tokenization. Despite these developments, Citigroup predicts that the inflow of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into Ethereum will be less robust compared to Bitcoin. In contrast, Standard Chartered has recently revised its year-end target for Ethereum significantly upward, from $4,000 to $7,500. Bearish And Bullish Scenarios For ETH This adjustment reflects stronger engagement within the industry and increasing corporate investments. The bank anticipates that the stablecoin sector could grow eightfold by 2028, which would likely drive up Ethereum network fees and demand. Citi also presented a more optimistic bull case, projecting a potential price of $6,400 if activity and adoption of Ethereum-based applications continue to rise. This would represent a major 42% uptrend ahead for the leading altcoin. Conversely, the bank outlined a bearish scenario in which the Ethereum price would drop to $2,200 in the event of a macroeconomic downturn or a decline in the equity market. If this scenario plays out, it could spell major trouble for bulls, as it would represent a 50% drop from current levels.

Interestingly, a recent report from Sygnum, a digital asset bank, has painted a more favorable outlook for Ethereum. The bank highlights Ethereum’s upgrades and increasing institutional interest as significant factors that could position ETH to benefit from anticipated trends in stablecoin issuance and broader adoption. Furthermore, the digital asset bank highlighted that as liquid Ethereum reserves on exchanges diminish and demand intensifies, the possibility of a supply squeeze arises, potentially sending the altcoin into a new leg up to retest all-time high levels. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $4,480, which is up 5% on the weekly time frame. Compared to record prices, the altcoin is trading nearly 10% below all-time high levels.

51861777,582968,1758092423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51861777.jpeg,8.3 Million Bitcoin Will Be Considered ‘Illiquid’ By 2032: Fidelity Report,https://bitcoinist.com/8-3-million-bitcoin-illiquid-2032-fidelity/,"According to a recent report by Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) illiquid supply could climb to 8.3 million BTC – roughly 42% of its total supply – by Q2 2032. As a result, the digital asset’s price may experience extraordinary price appreciation by then. Bitcoin Illiquid Supply Could Jump To 8.3 Million For their analysis, Fidelity used two distinct BTC cohorts to determine the illiquid supply. The first cohort consists of BTC that was last moved seven or more years ago. The second cohort includes public companies that hold at least 1,000 BTC. Bitcoin included in the first cohort was found to be highly illiquid, as its total portion of the BTC supply has only increased quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) since tracking became possible in 2016. The following chart shows the quarterly net change observed in this cohort. When it comes to public companies holding more than 1,000 BTC, there has only been one QoQ decrease in total supply since 2020. As of June 30, this cohort held a total of 830,000 BTC. Notably, public companies holding more than 1,000 BTC represent 97% of the total BTC held across all public companies. It is also worth noting that the vast majority of these holdings are concentrated among 30 companies. When looking from a macro viewpoint, it can be observed that there has been an accelerating trend of holding BTC versus trading or transacting. Specifically, the rising adoption of BTC among public companies has led to a rise in illiquid supply since Q3 2024. The following chart illustrates the rise in BTC’s illiquid supply. The report adds that at the end of Q2 2025, BTC’s circulating supply hovered around 19.8 million. Of this, close to 8.3 million BTC could become illiquid by Q2 2032. The following chart shows this projection. The analysis predicts that Bitcoin’s maximum finite supply of 21 million is likely to become relatively more illiquid over time. Further, the trend of more companies buying BTC is likely to provide additional momentum. The following chart further shows the change in Bitcoin’s liquid, illiquid, and still to be mined supply since Q2 2010.

BTC Adoption Continues To Grow A trend spearheaded by Strategy – formerly known as MicroStrategy – the corporate adoption of BTC is not slowing down. The firm recently added to its BTC holdings, as it bought another 525 BTC. Earlier this month, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet shared plans to raise $880 million to purchase more BTC. Similarly, Cyprus-based firm Robin Energy allocated $5 million toward its Bitcoin strategy. Latest data shows that total BTC held by public firms recently crossed the one million mark, signifying the increasing trust in BTC as a reliable store of value.

According to Steph, XRP holders are going to get rich today, and he shared a chart highlighting September 17, with a picture of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in the background. Dear #XRP holders, We’re all getting RICH tomorrow! This man will make it happen. pic.twitter.com/251zLhE8UQ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 16, 2025 The Market Prepares for the Federal Reserve’s Decision Today is the day of one of the most closely watched Federal Reserve meetings of the year, where investors expect a move that could set the tone for both traditional and digital markets. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates today after months of hesitation. Market data places the probability of a rate cut at 99.1% , reflecting near certainty among traders. Powell has resisted lowering rates throughout 2025, but mounting pressure from financial markets and political leaders, including President Trump , has created conditions where a policy shift appears imminent. The expected reduction is likely to be 25 basis points, though some believe a larger cut remains possible. Either decision would mark the first rate cut of the year, signaling that monetary policy is moving toward easing. This change carries significance for all asset classes, but digital assets such as XRP stand to benefit significantly from the shift in liquidity and sentiment. Why Rate Cuts Matter for XRP A rate cut lowers the cost of borrowing, encourages lending, and injects additional liquidity into the financial system. Traditionally, this environment benefits risky assets because investors seek higher returns outside of conventional fixed-income instruments. Cryptocurrencies, positioned as speculative and high-growth investments, often rise in such circumstances. For XRP specifically, a rate cut could serve as an accelerant. The asset already has an established role in discussions of cross-border payments, and institutional interest has remained steady . As liquidity expands, demand for alternative assets is expected to increase, placing XRP in a favorable position for both short-term price appreciation and longer-term adoption momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Powell’s Position and Market Expectations Powell has delayed cutting rates for much of 2025, but the current economic backdrop makes it difficult to avoid action. The financial world believes the Fed will deliver the cut not only because of economic indicators but also due to political preference for looser economic conditions. If Powell confirms the cut today, XRP and other digital assets could see immediate gains. Investors have already positioned themselves for this outcome, but confirmation from the Fed typically creates fresh momentum. The extent of XRP’s movement will depend on whether the cut matches expectations or exceeds them with a larger reduction.

DAT companies are seen as relatively risky, but SOL offers additional passive income opportunities. An unnamed large-scale buyer of SOL may be building a treasury. Based on FalconX transfers, a whale acquired 412,075 SOL, valued at $98.4M. The amount is close to the size of purchases used in treasury companies. The SOL was acquired at market rates, as FalconX moved the tokens from major exchanges Binance, OKX, Coinbase, and Bybit. SOL still took a step back to $233.86, allowing the whale to buy the dip. Recent accumulation raised the influence of Solana DAT companies, already holding 2% of the SOL supply, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. The SOL buying continued, even after Forward Industries completed the purchases for its large-scale treasury . At the same time, some whales are using the hype to leave the market, as in the case of one whale sending $23M worth of SOL to OKX. FalconX reflects the growing demand for SOL, with active trading through its public wallets. | Source: Arkham Intelligence . FalconX still carries around 449K SOL, valued at over $117M. At the current stage, large-scale treasuries locked in 2M SOL, while smaller ones still hold under 500K tokens. Treasury companies are offsetting the selling and unlocks, which pressured the price of SOL. Solana treasuries still lag behind the accumulated reserves for BTC and ETH, but are showing strong growth and significant daily buying pressure. SOL treasuries also mostly have mNav ratio above 1, showing their stock is still attractive. For mow, Forward Industries is traded most actively, with the price of FORD near a six-month peak at $37.35 . SOL treasuries boost staking SOL treasuries are not passively held, and are sending significant amounts of tokens for staking and liquid staking. As of September 17, Solana treasuries hold an estimated 17.112 SOL, spread to 17 entities of varying size. A total of 7.4M SOL is staked at 7.96 annualized rate, meaning treasuries may receive another 589K SOL as a reward for liquid staking. Even with price risk, treasuries are showing significant demand for this kind of return. The SOL rewards are an automated expansion of the treasuries, compounding the holdings of the biggest entities. The treasury companies may also not sell their SOL, but instead use the value through liquid staking tokens. As a result, SOL ecosystem value locked is near peak levels at $12.35B. Entities like Jito, Jupiter, Binance Staked SOL and even BONK are competing to gain access to treasuries. In the past month alone, Binance Staked SOL expanded its holdings to a new record above $2.88B . Is the altcoin season a Solana season? The SOL market capitalization dominance is at 3.2%, the highest in six months. The Solana ecosystem contributes to the overall altcoin season, adding a mix of new and older memes. However, meme coins are lagging with just $12B in market capitalization and only three assets valued at over $1B. The Solana ecosystem is yet to recover the token-based hype from January. Currently, the network is switching to DeFi, including lending and liquid staking. Solana also produces the most revenues from apps compared to all other chains, offering passive income for SOL holders. Get seen where it counts.

Recent analysis suggests that increased Fed intervention crypto to manage interest rates might actually be a surprising boon for the cryptocurrency market. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a potential shift that could redefine how we view the relationship between traditional finance and decentralized assets. What Does Fed Intervention Crypto Mean for Interest Rates? According to a detailed analysis by Cointelegraph, a more active approach from the U.S. Federal Reserve in maintaining appropriate interest rate levels could signal a positive turn for cryptocurrencies. This perspective gained traction following comments from Steve Miran, a newly appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Miran emphasized the central bank’s core mandate: ensuring “moderate long-term interest rates.” This mandate is crucial. When the Fed actively works to keep rates within a certain range, it influences everything from borrowing costs to investment returns. The Cointelegraph report speculates that a potential Trump administration might push for even more aggressive intervention in the bond market to achieve these goals. Purchasing Government Bonds: One key method could involve the Fed directly buying government bonds. This action injects liquidity into the financial system. Expanding Quantitative Easing (QE): Another tool is expanding QE, which is essentially large-scale asset purchases designed to lower long-term interest rates and increase money supply. How Could Low Interest Rates Fuel Crypto Growth? The core argument is simple yet powerful: if government policies successfully keep interest rates low, traditional savings and fixed-income investments become less attractive. This scenario often prompts investors to seek alternative assets that offer better potential returns or serve as a hedge against inflation. This is where the Fed intervention crypto connection becomes vital. Bitcoin, in particular, has increasingly been viewed as a digital gold – a robust inflation hedge. When the purchasing power of fiat currencies is eroded by inflation, or when interest rates offer negligible returns, assets like Bitcoin can attract substantial capital. This isn’t just about chasing high returns; it’s about preserving wealth. Consider these benefits: Capital Influx: Low-yield environments can push institutional and retail capital into riskier, yet potentially more rewarding, assets like Bitcoin. Inflation Hedge Appeal: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive alternative to fiat currencies susceptible to inflation, especially if the Fed’s actions lead to an expanded money supply. Market Maturation: Increased interest from traditional investors due to macroeconomic factors can further legitimize and mature the overall cryptocurrency market. Navigating the Economic Landscape: What Challenges Lie Ahead? While the prospect of Fed intervention crypto creating a bullish environment is exciting, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. Economic policies are complex, and their effects can be multifaceted. The specific nature and duration of any Fed intervention will significantly influence its impact on the crypto market. For instance, an aggressive expansion of quantitative easing, while potentially lowering rates, could also lead to concerns about asset bubbles or increased market volatility. Investors need to remain vigilant and understand that while a correlation might exist, it’s not a direct causation. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a myriad of factors beyond just interest rates. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts Understanding this potential dynamic allows crypto enthusiasts and investors to approach the market with more informed strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Fed Announcements: Pay close attention to Federal Reserve statements, especially regarding interest rate targets and bond market activities. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin might benefit, a diversified crypto portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with single asset volatility. Educate Yourself: Continuously learn about macroeconomic indicators and how they traditionally influence various asset classes, including how Fed intervention crypto dynamics play out. The Future of Crypto and Monetary Policy The intersection of central bank policy and the burgeoning world of digital assets is a fascinating space. The idea that more deliberate Fed intervention crypto in managing interest rates could provide a tailwind for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin highlights the increasing interconnectedness of global finance. As traditional financial systems evolve, so too does the narrative around digital assets. This ongoing dialogue between centralized economic management and decentralized finance will undoubtedly shape the future of investment. In conclusion, the analysis suggesting that active Fed intervention to maintain moderate long-term interest rates could benefit cryptocurrencies presents a compelling outlook. By keeping traditional interest rates low, the Federal Reserve might inadvertently steer significant capital towards digital assets like Bitcoin, solidifying their role as an inflation hedge. This potential synergy between monetary policy and crypto market dynamics offers a unique perspective for investors navigating today’s complex financial landscape.

What is “Fed intervention” in the context of interest rates? Fed intervention refers to actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve to influence interest rate levels, often through monetary policy tools like buying government bonds or adjusting the federal funds rate. The goal is typically to achieve economic stability, such as maintaining moderate long-term interest rates and controlling inflation. 2. How do low interest rates benefit cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? When interest rates are low, traditional investments like savings accounts or bonds offer diminished returns. This often encourages investors to seek higher-yielding alternatives or assets perceived as inflation hedges, such as Bitcoin, thereby driving capital into the cryptocurrency market. 3. What is quantitative easing (QE), and how does it relate to crypto? Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy where a central bank purchases large quantities of government bonds or other financial assets to lower long-term interest rates and increase the money supply. This can make traditional assets less attractive and potentially push investors towards cryptocurrencies as a store of value or an inflation hedge. 4. Is Bitcoin truly an effective inflation hedge? Many investors view Bitcoin as a potential inflation hedge due to its decentralized nature and fixed supply, which contrasts with fiat currencies that can be devalued by central bank policies. However, its effectiveness as a hedge can be debated, as its price can also be subject to significant volatility and market sentiment. 5. What are the risks of Fed intervention for the crypto market? While some Fed interventions might benefit crypto, aggressive policies could also lead to increased market volatility, concerns about asset bubbles, or unforeseen economic shifts that negatively impact investor confidence across all asset classes. It’s crucial for investors to understand that correlations do not always imply direct causation. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing this article with your network!

Other players, like Solana and the emerging XYZVerse, are also gaining speed. With prices shifting and new stories unfolding, all eyes are on whether these moves will hold. More details reveal what’s driving interest and what may come next. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005 . At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin’s Bold Journey: From Idea to Today’s Digital Gold Rush Bitcoin appeared in 2009 after a person called Satoshi Nakamoto shared a plan for money without banks. It runs on a public list called a blockchain that sits on many computers at once. People send coins to each other directly, and helpers named miners check each move by solving tricky puzzles. New coins drop into their accounts as a prize, but only until 21 million exist. Every four years the prize shrinks, a moment fans call the halving. This shrinking supply has often sparked fresh price waves, as fewer new coins meet growing demand. While newer tokens chase quick fame with flashy apps, Bitcoin stays the main yardstick of the whole market. Big firms now hold it as a store of value, styling it as digital gold. If rising rates cool risky bets, Bitcoin can still draw eyes thanks to its long record and tight limit. As the next halving nears, some traders see a fresh climb, though swings stay wild compared with regular cash. Ethereum: The Beating Heart of Web3 Gears Up for a New Price Run Ethereum, born from Vitalik Buterin’s idea in 2013, went live in 2015. It moved from mining to a lighter Proof-of-Stake system after the 2022 Merge. This cut energy use and lets users earn ETH by staking. The chain hosts smart contracts, the code behind many apps for lending, games, art, and more. It also set the ERC-20 rule, so any team can launch a token that still pays fees in ETH. Layer-2 tools like Arbitrum and Polygon help send those tokens faster and cheaper. Sharding, the next step, should push costs even lower. Past cycles hint at big moves when Bitcoin halves its supply. Analysts expect ETH to swing between $2,700 and $6,580 in 2025, with a slow climb toward the decade’s end. That range puts it ahead of many altcoins that still rely on hype. Demand comes from gas fees, staking rewards, and its use as loan collateral. New spot ETFs and rising interest in DeFi add fuel. While rivals like Solana boast speed, they trade off age and size. Ethereum keeps the lead in users, tools, and trust, making it a strong pick for the current upswing. Solana’s Fast Lane: Can SOL Overtake the Crypto Pack? Solana was built for speed. While chains like Ethereum and Cardano juggle heavy traffic with add-ons, Solana keeps one straight road and pushes more cars through. Its design lets apps run in many coding languages, so builders can launch games, markets, and art hubs without learning a new toolkit. The network clocks thousands of transactions in a blink, and each move is paid for with SOL, the coin that keeps the engine warm. In this market cycle, users crave quick and cheap moves after feeling the sting of high fees elsewhere. DeFi and NFT creators are flocking to Solana, betting that a smooth ride will lure the next wave of fans. SOL gains value every time someone trades, stakes, or launches a fresh project, so growing activity could pump new life into the coin. Prices still sit well below past peaks, offering room if momentum returns. If the rush to fast, high-capacity chains continues, SOL may steer closer to the front of the crypto race. Conclusion BTC, ETH and SOL look strong in the early 2025 surge, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% and could eclipse mainstream gains.

He said those factors could challenge the recent rally that’s pushed the market to all-time highs. BofA noted that the S&P 500 hit the bank’s 6,500 target this summer and pushed to another new high. The bank also revealed that its 6,625 secondary target is close to getting hit, with the index exchanging hands at 6,606. Summer-to-fall transition pushes stocks lower Ciana maintained that the summer-to-fall transition tends to be rough for stocks. According to BofA data, the S&P 500 typically sees its worst performance in September. He also believes the stock market could now be headed for the worst week-and-a-half-long stretch of the year. BofA data shows that stocks tend to have the largest downside risk in the last 10 days of September. The bank’s stock data analysis dating back to 1928 shows that the S&P 500 was only up 40% of the time, with an average return of -1.1%. Ciana said that the prospect of a downturn is worse when coupled with a year that kicks off a president’s term in office, like 2025. BofA data shows that the index is only up 29% of the time and posts an average return of -1.5% during the last 10 days of the month in the first year of a new presidential cycle. The bank’s analyst revealed that the last 10 trading days of the month usually begin on September 17, which coincides with the Fed’s next rate decision. According to Ciana, investors expect Wednesday to be a volatile day for trading since the market priced in a 96.1% chance the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 bps at the September meeting. Interest rate cuts could cause stocks to rise Andrew Tyler, the global head of market intelligence at JPMorgan, cited research from the bank’s chief U.S. economist and stated that there might be a dovish cut, which could produce a positive gain. He revealed that S&P 500 options are currently pricing in an 88 basis point move on the rate decision day. Tyler maintained that the bank pegged a 47.5% probability that the central bank will issue a 25 bps cut and issue dovish commentary about the state of the economy. He believes such a scenario could see the S&P 500 gain around 1% immediately after the rate cut, suggesting that the benchmark index could rise to around 6,650. “As we look toward the month-end, Fed Day may act as a ‘sell-the-news’ event as investors take time to consider the macro environment, the Fed’s future reaction function, potentially stretched positioning, a temporarily weaker corporate buyback bid, waning retail investor participation, and quarter-end rebalancing.” -Andrew Tyler, Global Head of Market Intelligence at JPMorgan. Tyler argued that stocks could fall as much as 5% if those headwinds take hold in the coming weeks. He also believes that a sell-off could make room for several buying opportunities for investors. The Bank of America technical analyst also noted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average recently rose to a fresh all-time high. However, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, a separate index linked to the benchmark index, has lagged. Ciana said the Transportation average has not broken above anything relevant to confirm the breakout. The BofA analyst revealed that the Dow Jones Transportation Average also recently plummeted below its trend line support, and its 200-day simple moving average is also dropping. He believes it shows signs that the index is losing momentum. Ciana noted that market breadth, which measures the proportion of rising stocks versus those dropping, is starting to pull back. He also found that the NYSE advance-decline line, which measures the number of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange that are rising versus falling, has stalled recently.

Through the hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) are quickly becoming top coins to keep an eye on. Mutuum Finance is emerging as something greater than a mere ERC-20 token, but a groundbreaking DeFi protocol that works towards bridging the disconnect between innovation, liquidity, and long-term sustainability. While meme coins fueled by hype are moving in the opposite direction, Mutuum Finance is offering more utility with its decentralized borrowing and lending process. Shiba Inu Clings to Support as Market Observes Ethereum Ecosystem Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001374, with recent price action having been noted to move around that number while volumes are held in check. The recent movement of the tokens is characterized by being cautious momentum, with the push by profit-taking and competition by other meme coins for attention from users. SHIB’s development milestones, such as Shibarium updates and higher burn rates, are repeatedly hyped as potential drivers but yet to bring meaningful price appreciation. As SHIB continues to linger in the meme coin sector of the market, it is being compared to emerging DeFi project Mutuum Finance, which some believe may carry more growth this cycle. PEPE Price Update and Outlook PEPE currently trades at levels of $0.00001126, as price oscillates between $0.00001117 and $0.00001178 over the last 24 hours. The near-term history shows moderate selling pressure, with moderate volume losses and resistance just above its current price. With its meme-coin fame and enormous circulating supply, PEPE’s upside potential is extremely volatile and more a reflection of sentiment action than by virtue of underlying network advancements. As opposed to newer, lower-market-cap, higher-utility protocols, some feel there is less space for huge percentage upside in PEPE. Meanwhile, focus is being placed increasingly on newer DeFi player Mutuum Finance, which most people think have better upside in this cycle. Mutuum Finance: Phase 6 Presale Underway Mutuum Finance has witnessed humongous traction during presale with more than 16,340 investors buying coins and more than $15.85 million raised thus far. Tokens can be bought during Phase 6 for $0.035 per token. Its tiered pricing system is a reward scheme and the individuals who jump on early are eligible to receive maximum rewards. Mutuum Finance’s long-term vision is to reshape the DeFi market as we know it today. Besides that, the project is also driving early adoption through a $100,000 giveaway where 10 people will land a $10,000 MUTM reward. Development of Stablecoin with Security and Credibility Besides its general development of an ecosystem, Mutuum Finance is going to release a USD stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Compared to algorithmic stablecoins that have collapsed under financial stress, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and thus capable of maintaining its peg during financial stress. The mechanism takes advantage of the power of idle collateral reserves to secure long-term stability with value preservation assurance. This makes the stablecoin a safe unit of exchange, and a safe store of value, in the Mutuum Finance scheme. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to be the most stable altcoin bet of 2025, coming with 10x potential gains in view for early-in investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as the top Ethereum-based digital assets to bet on 2025, ahead of meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) on the basis of exclusive DeFi potential alone. Now at Phase 6 presale at $0.035, MUTM has already raised $15.85M+ and has 16,340+ investors with prices about to be higher in the subsequent phase. Whereas SHIB and PEPE surf community mania, Mutuum offers decentralized borrowing and lending, a USD-backed overcollateralized stablecoin, and long-term scalability. With a $100K giveaway and top exchange listings in the works, analysts are calling for 10x for early birds. Lock your tokens today in Phase 6 before the next price rally.

With a real-world cause (#FreeThePandas campaign) fuelling its momentum, this new meme coin on presale proves there’s room for more at the party Pudgy Pandas challenges the Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) franchise, which has dominated the year, reaching a market cap of over $2B and gaining social currency in the form of over 900M daily views on X. Speaking of, the $PENGU ETF and the $DOGE ETF filings are more signs of meme coins being seen as serious investment products. That institutional acceptance, combined with the growing buzz around projects like Pudgy Pandas and Pudgy Penguins, is spilling over into newer projects, with degens hunting for the next breakout token. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is pumped up and ready to ride this wave, already soaring past $2.2M in its presale. Meme Coin Mania Isn’t Stopping – Here Are the Tokens Degens Are Watching Now The meme coin market has surged over the past seven days, with several tokens reaching new highs. Dogecoin led the market with a 12.3% increase, followed by Pepe at 5.27%, signaling that the major meme plays still command the spotlight. In the lower cap range, MemeCore exploded by 20%, Bonk saw a 4% gain, and Pudgy Penguins inched up by +0.06%, highlighting how degens may be piling into newer, high-volatility tokens. Riding the meme coin wave, here are the top meme coins that our experts believe could surge in value in 2025. Historically, meme coins have shown the potential to deliver gains ranging from 10x to 100x during bullish periods. This is particularly true when investors enter early in a project’s cycle, as seen with the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale, which is drawing significant attention from early adopters eager to capitalize on the current meme coin mania. Meme Coin Frenzy Pushes Maxi Doge Presale to New Heights Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a high-octane trading meme token built for ultra-leveraged strategies. The token rewards traders who love to time entries, ride market swings, and turn each green candle into an opportunity for massive gains. Besides high-leverage plays and relentless market action, here’s why $MAXI could be the next moonshot bag: An ‘Alpha Dog’ lifestyle token fueling conviction, stamina, and risk-taking in the bull run. It delivers the raw edge and motivation needed to out-trade, out-pump, and outlast. Its smart contract handles presale mechanics and automates prize distributions directly on-chain. Keeps the community always buzzing – firing up the squad with non-stop giveaways and degen competitions, pumping engagement, and keeping the vibes WAGMI. Plans for integration with larger DeFi platforms, including swaps, liquidity, and partner events, as the ecosystem expands. Maxi Doge is flexing hard right now. At just $0.0002575 per token, the presale has already raised over $2.2M; though the next price surge is set to occur once it reaches $2.4M, most likely tomorrow. The $MAXI vibe is MAX RIPPED. MAX GAINZ. MAX MENTALITY – a mantra so strong it;s seen some whales drop as much as $37K on $MAXI . Pure meme-fuelled early entries like this are where the real degens play, which can turn them into mega moonshots. Feeling the FOMO? If you ape in with $500 today, you’ll get about 1.94M $MAXI tokens plus an additional ~2.79M tokens in staking rewards at 144% APY p/a. That means your buy could stack serious passive gains, even before the next pump kicks in With over $5.2B $MAXI already staked, the community is clearly riding this bull wave. If meme coin momentum keeps raging, $MAXI could be the next crypto to explode . Bulk up on the $MAXI presale before the next pump. This is not financial advice. The cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile and speculative. Please do your own research before making any investments.

They’ve just unveiled two groundbreaking crypto ETPs designed to give investors unique exposure to cutting-edge technologies: artificial intelligence and the Solana ecosystem. This move signifies a growing maturity in the market, offering regulated pathways into some of the most exciting areas of decentralized innovation. What Are These New Crypto ETPs and Why Do They Matter? Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) are financial instruments that track the price of an underlying asset, like a cryptocurrency or a basket of assets. For many investors, crypto ETPs offer a familiar and regulated way to gain exposure to digital currencies without directly owning or securing the underlying assets themselves. This launch by 21Shares is particularly significant because it targets two distinct yet highly promising sectors within the crypto space. AFET: This ETP focuses on decentralized AI protocols. It aims to capture the growth of projects that are building AI applications on blockchain technology, offering a new frontier for investment. ARAY: This product dives into the Solana ecosystem, specifically investing in tokens traded on Raydium, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Solana. Unlocking Decentralized AI: The AFET Crypto ETP Artificial intelligence is already transforming industries, and its integration with blockchain technology promises even more revolutionary changes. The AFET crypto ETP is designed to track the performance of various decentralized AI protocols. These protocols are working to democratize AI, making it more transparent, censorship-resistant, and accessible. Investors keen on the intersection of AI and blockchain now have a streamlined way to participate. AFET is set to begin trading on prominent European exchanges, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris. This listing on regulated platforms provides a significant level of accessibility and institutional credibility for an otherwise niche and emerging market segment. Imagine investing in the future of AI through a familiar investment vehicle. This ETP could represent a pivotal shift in how traditional investors approach decentralized AI, bridging the gap between innovative technology and conventional finance. Diving into the Solana Ecosystem with the ARAY Crypto ETP Solana has rapidly emerged as a leading blockchain platform, renowned for its high throughput and low transaction costs. Its vibrant ecosystem hosts a multitude of decentralized applications (dApps), including powerful decentralized exchanges like Raydium. The ARAY crypto ETP offers a unique entry point into this dynamic environment. By investing in tokens traded on Raydium, ARAY provides exposure to the diverse projects and liquidity within the Solana network. This isn’t just about Solana itself; it’s about the innovative projects building on top of it. The ETP will be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, further broadening its reach to European investors. This product allows investors to gain exposure to a broad basket of assets within a high-performance blockchain ecosystem, potentially benefiting from its continued growth and development without the complexities of managing individual tokens or navigating decentralized exchanges directly. What Are the Key Benefits of Investing in These Crypto ETPs? These new crypto ETPs from 21Shares offer several compelling advantages for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors looking to dip their toes into the digital asset space: Regulated Access: ETPs trade on traditional stock exchanges, providing a familiar and regulated investment environment. This can offer a sense of security and compliance that direct crypto investments sometimes lack. Diversification: Instead of picking individual tokens, these ETPs offer diversified exposure to specific themes – decentralized AI or the broader Solana DEX ecosystem. This can help mitigate risks associated with single-asset investments. Ease of Investment: Investors can buy and sell ETPs through their standard brokerage accounts, simplifying the process compared to setting up crypto wallets or navigating various exchanges. Institutional Grade: Products from issuers like 21Shares often come with robust infrastructure and oversight, appealing to institutional investors and those seeking professional-grade solutions. Navigating the Landscape: Considerations for Crypto ETPs While the benefits are clear, it’s crucial for investors to understand the inherent considerations when dealing with crypto ETPs . The underlying assets, cryptocurrencies, are known for their volatility and are subject to rapid price fluctuations. Therefore, these ETPs carry similar risks. Market Volatility: The value of these ETPs will largely depend on the performance of decentralized AI protocols and the Solana ecosystem tokens. Cryptocurrency markets can be highly unpredictable. Regulatory Changes: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the value and availability of these ETPs. Technological Risks: While robust, the underlying blockchain technologies are still developing. Potential bugs, hacks, or network issues could affect performance. It’s always advisable for investors to conduct thorough due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before investing in such innovative, yet potentially volatile, financial products. The launch of AFET and ARAY by 21Shares marks an exciting progression in the digital asset investment landscape. By offering regulated, thematic crypto ETPs focused on decentralized AI and the Solana ecosystem, 21Shares is not only expanding investment opportunities but also validating the long-term potential of these emerging technologies. This development provides a more accessible and structured avenue for investors to participate in the future of finance, showcasing the continued innovation within the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto ETPs What is an ETP? An Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) is a type of security that tracks an underlying index, asset, or basket of assets. ETPs trade on exchanges like stocks, offering investors a way to gain exposure to markets without directly owning the underlying assets. How do 21Shares’ new ETPs differ from buying crypto directly? These ETPs provide regulated access to specific crypto themes (decentralized AI, Solana ecosystem) through traditional brokerage accounts. You don’t need to manage private keys or set up crypto wallets, simplifying the investment process compared to direct crypto purchases. Where can I trade the AFET and ARAY ETPs? AFET is scheduled to trade on Euronext Amsterdam and Paris. ARAY will be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, making them accessible to European investors through conventional financial platforms. Are these crypto ETPs suitable for all investors? While they offer regulated access, the underlying crypto assets are highly volatile. These ETPs are generally more suited for investors with a higher risk tolerance and those who have conducted thorough research into the specific technologies and market dynamics they track. What kind of AI protocols does the AFET ETP track? The AFET ETP tracks the performance of decentralized AI protocols. These are projects that leverage blockchain technology to create more open, transparent, and distributed artificial intelligence applications and services.

The company said the move provides exposure to the asset at an effective discount of 65%. Caret Digital mines Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, but did not specify what tokens would be traded or the magnitude of the conversion. XRP is trading near $3 with a market cap of around $182 billion. “A key objective of this strategy is to secure XRP exposure at the lowest average cost possible, through a combination of token swapping from digital asset mining activities and by purchasing Ripple Lab shares.” VivoPower International The swap complements VivoPower’s broader plan to reduce acquisition costs by combining token purchases with equity deals based on Ripple Labs. The dual-pronged strategy exhibits an institutional model of treasury management in the altcoin market. Ripple equity deals add to the discount strategy The company’s XRP pivot was launched in May with a $121 million private placement by His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Talal Al Saud. Former Ripple board member Adam Traidman also joined as the advisory chairman. In June, VivoPower partnered with BitGo to provide it as an exclusive custodian and trading partner for XRP acquisitions, as Cryptopolitan reported. Around the same time, the firm announced a $100M yield initiative with Flare, the Ripple Labs-backed blockchain network, signaling an intent to generate returns on treasury reserves. Further deepening its stake, VivoPower revealed “definitive agreements” in August to purchase $100 million of Ripple Labs equity from existing shareholders, pending final approval. The deal would translate into 211 million XRP, or $0.47 per token worth of ownership, an 86% discount compared to market conditions at the time. These moves point to a systemic attempt to integrate discounted exposure with institutional-grade custody and yield solutions. Treasury push extends into payments and yield VivoPower’s XRP strategy is no longer limited to balance sheet management. Its electric vehicle subsidiary, Tembo, will now accept Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoins as payment. The integration of RLUSD promises to eliminate transaction friction and bank charges, while improving enterprise-grade crypto capabilities for VivoPower. The company also recently announced a $30 million pilot with Doppler Finance, which will see the company deploy XRP into structured yield pools with direct reinvestment of proceeds in reserves. That initiative could grow to $200 million. In parallel, VivoPower’s partnership with Flare has grown, deploying $100 million worth of XRP onto the chain to generate yield via decentralized finance applications. These integrations enable the treasury to be a yield-generating platform, instead of merely a passive holding strategy. XRP’s market activity has also picked up with VivoPower’s announcements. Open interest in XRP derivatives jumped to $8.45 billion in recent weeks from $7.7 billion in August, when liquidations sparked a 30% drop. The rebound is an indicator of increasing speculative activity and renewed trader conviction. Source: CoinGlass. Technical levels indicate that $3.05 could be a significant support level. Analysts believe XRP could break out of the $3.50-$4.00 range if defended. However, a breakdown below $3.05 is in danger of retesting $2.80.

That’s precisely the situation Japan faces today. Its deepening debt crisis isn’t just a concern for economists; it’s a topic that could surprisingly reshape the future of digital assets. Experts suggest that as traditional financial systems feel the strain, investors might increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies as a viable alternative. Understanding the Severity of Japan’s Debt Crisis Japan, a nation renowned for its economic stability, now confronts a significant hurdle: a soaring national debt. Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, highlights the country’s alarming debt-to-GDP ratio, which has climbed to roughly 240%. This figure is not merely a statistic; it signals a potential debt crisis on the horizon. What is Debt-to-GDP? This ratio compares a country’s public debt to its economic output. A high ratio indicates that a nation might struggle to repay its debts without further borrowing. Exacerbating Factors: Rising inflation, which erodes purchasing power, and increasing bond yields, which make government borrowing more expensive, are compounding the issue. These elements create a challenging environment for traditional investments. As concerns about this growing financial instability mount, investors are naturally seeking safe havens and alternative instruments to protect their wealth. This shift in sentiment creates an unexpected opening for digital currencies. Why Are Investors Looking Beyond Traditional Assets During Japan’s Debt Crisis? When a major economy like Japan faces such severe financial headwinds, the confidence in conventional assets like government bonds or even certain fiat currencies can waver. Investors typically look for stability and growth, but in a crisis, their priorities shift towards preservation and diversification. The traditional playbook for managing economic uncertainty often involves gold or other precious metals. However, the digital age introduces a new player: cryptocurrencies. These assets offer distinct characteristics that can be appealing in times of economic distress: Decentralization: Unlike fiat currencies, which are controlled by central banks, many cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, making them less susceptible to government policy changes or inflationary pressures. Accessibility: Digital assets are globally accessible, allowing investors to move capital across borders more freely and efficiently than with traditional banking systems. This evolving landscape suggests that Japan’s debt crisis could act as a significant catalyst for broader crypto adoption. The Strategic Appeal of Crypto and Stablecoins Amidst Economic Uncertainty As investors evaluate their options during Japan’s debt crisis , cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, emerge as compelling alternatives. Stablecoins, in particular, are designed to minimize price volatility, often by pegging their value to a stable asset like the US dollar. This characteristic makes them particularly attractive for those looking to preserve capital without exposure to the extreme price swings often associated with other cryptocurrencies. For investors, the potential benefits include: Inflation Hedge: While not all cryptocurrencies are inflation hedges, some, particularly Bitcoin, are seen by proponents as ‘digital gold’ due to their limited supply. Diversification: Adding crypto to a portfolio can offer diversification away from traditional financial markets, potentially reducing overall risk. Ease of Transfer: Cryptocurrencies facilitate quick and low-cost international transfers, which can be crucial for capital flight or securing assets in a different jurisdiction. The move towards these digital assets is not just a speculative gamble; it represents a strategic decision by investors seeking robust alternatives in an increasingly uncertain global economy. Navigating Potential Benefits and Risks for Crypto Adoption While the prospect of cryptocurrencies benefiting from Japan’s debt crisis is exciting, it’s essential to consider both the upsides and the challenges. The increasing institutional interest and growing regulatory frameworks could pave the way for more mainstream adoption, but risks remain. Benefits: Innovation: The crypto space is constantly evolving, offering new financial products and services. Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can provide financial services to the unbanked or underbanked populations. Transparency: Blockchain technology offers a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions. Risks: Volatility: Many cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, meaning their prices can fluctuate dramatically. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for crypto is still developing, which can pose risks for investors. Security Concerns: While blockchain is secure, individual users must take precautions against hacks and scams. Ultimately, the long-term impact of Japan’s economic challenges on crypto adoption will depend on how these benefits and risks are managed by both investors and regulators. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto? Japan’s deepening debt crisis serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional financial systems. As concerns grow, the appeal of alternative assets like cryptocurrencies and stablecoins intensifies. While challenges and risks are part of any emerging market, the unique characteristics of digital assets—such as decentralization, global accessibility, and potential for value preservation—position them as increasingly attractive options for investors seeking to navigate economic turbulence. The unfolding situation in Japan could very well mark a crucial turning point, propelling cryptocurrencies further into the mainstream financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason Japan’s debt crisis could benefit crypto? A1: The primary reason is that as confidence in traditional assets like government bonds erodes due to high debt and inflation, investors seek alternative, more resilient assets. Cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, offer diversification and a potential hedge against economic instability. Q2: What is Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio, and why is it significant? A2: Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 240%. This figure is significant because it indicates that the country’s debt is more than double its annual economic output, raising concerns about its ability to manage and repay its obligations, which can impact investor confidence. Q3: How do stablecoins differ from other cryptocurrencies in this context? A3: Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. This stability makes them particularly appealing during economic uncertainty, as they offer a way to preserve capital without the high volatility typically associated with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Q4: Are there any risks for investors moving into crypto due to Japan’s debt crisis? A4: Yes, risks include the inherent volatility of many cryptocurrencies, the evolving and sometimes uncertain regulatory landscape, and security concerns such as hacks and scams. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. Q5: Could Japan’s situation influence other countries’ approaches to crypto? A5: Potentially, yes. If Japan’s debt crisis indeed leads to a significant shift towards crypto adoption, it could serve as a precedent. Other nations facing similar economic challenges might observe Japan’s experience and consider how digital assets could play a role in their own financial strategies.

Key Takeaways: The Ether Machine has filed an SEC Form S-4 to go public via a SPAC merger with Dynamix Corporation. The firm has amassed 495,362 ETH, valued at over $2.1 billion, making it the third-largest corporate Ethereum holder. Founder Andrew Keys contributed nearly $741 million in ETH, anchoring a treasury backed by over $800 million in institutional funding. The filing, submitted on Form S-4 , relates to the firm’s proposed combination with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Dynamix Corporation, which trades on Nasdaq under the ticker ETHM. The Ether Machine confirmed the move on Tuesday via social media, writing: “We’re shifting into the next gear, and officially on its path to full public form.” Ether Machine–Dynamix Merger Expected to Close in Q4 Originally announced in July, the merger is expected to close in Q4, pending shareholder approval at Dynamix’s upcoming extraordinary general meeting. The Ether Machine has gained attention for rapidly growing its ETH reserves. Earlier this month, the company disclosed it had added 150,000 ETH in August alone , bringing total holdings to 495,362 ETH. The latest investment adds to The Ether Machine’s existing pool of institutional backing. In prior rounds, the company raised more than $800 million from a mix of institutional and strategic investors, including an anchor commitment from co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys. Keys’ initial contribution of 169,984 ETH, now valued at roughly $741 million, has served as a cornerstone of the company’s treasury. The company was formed through the merger of Ether Reserve LLC and blank-check firm Dynamix Corporation. The Ether Machine initially set out to raise over $1.5 billion , courting names such as Blockchain.com, Kraken, and Pantera Capital. As of today, we have confidentially filed our S-4 with the SEC. We're shifting into the next gear, and officially on its path to full public form “The submission of our Form S-4 is a critical step towards becoming a publicly traded Ethereum company. We have also retained… — The Ether Machine (@TheEtherMachine) September 16, 2025 While the company has since adjusted its fundraising strategy, the latest capital injection leaves it with a sizable stockpile of Ethereum. In total, the firm has secured commitments for 495,362 ETH, currently worth around $2.16 billion, with approximately $367.1 million available for further acquisitions, assuming no shareholder redemptions. That puts it behind only Bitmine Immersion Tech and SharpLink Gaming among public Ethereum treasuries, according to SER data. SharpLink Deepens Ethereum Strategy as Share Buybacks Top 1.9 Million As reported, SharpLink Gaming has repurchased nearly 1.94 million shares under its buyback program launched in late August, citing undervaluation and strong fundamentals. With no outstanding debt and a net asset value of $3.86 billion (or $18.55 per share), the company is using repurchases as a way to return value to shareholders amid favorable market conditions. At the same time, SharpLink has significantly expanded its Ethereum treasury, now holding 838,152 ETH—most of it staked, generating ongoing yield. Since June, staking rewards have added 3,240 ETH, and the firm’s ETH concentration ratio has nearly doubled, signaling a long-term bet on Ethereum’s role in the digital asset economy. Co-CEO Joseph Chalom says SharpLink aims to become the “MicroStrategy of Ethereum,” aligning shareholder interests with the growth of ETH while showcasing how digital assets can be deployed responsibly. With over $4 billion in ETH exposure and ongoing buybacks, SharpLink is positioning itself as a corporate leader in Ethereum adoption.

Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped exciting news that could reshape your trading strategies. They’ve announced the addition of new SKY margin trading pairs, offering fresh avenues for advanced market participants. What Does This Mean for Your SKY Margin Trading Strategy? Starting at 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 17, Binance will officially list SKY/USDT and SKY/USDC for both cross and isolated margin trading. This significant development expands the utility and accessibility of the Skycoin (SKY) asset, bringing enhanced flexibility to those looking to leverage their positions. For many, the introduction of these pairs on a major platform like Binance signals growing confidence in the underlying asset. It provides traders with the tools to potentially amplify their gains, or even hedge existing spot positions, through sophisticated strategies. Understanding Cross and Isolated Margin Trading If you’re new to the world of margin, these terms might sound a bit complex. Let’s break them down simply: Cross Margin: Your entire margin balance is shared across all open positions. This means that if one position performs poorly, other profitable positions can help cover the margin requirements, potentially preventing liquidation. However, a significant downturn can impact your entire portfolio. Isolated Margin: Margin is allocated independently to each position. If a position goes south, only the margin allocated to that specific trade is at risk. This offers better risk management for individual trades, but you’ll need to manually add margin if a position approaches liquidation. The availability of both options for SKY margin trading empowers users to choose the risk management approach that best suits their individual trading style and market outlook. Why Is Binance Adding SKY Margin Trading Pairs Now? Binance consistently evaluates market demand and asset liquidity before introducing new trading options. The decision to add SKY/USDT and SKY/USDC margin pairs suggests increased interest and stability for the Skycoin project. This move can lead to several benefits: Increased Liquidity: Margin trading typically brings more trading volume, improving the liquidity of the SKY token. Enhanced Trading Opportunities: Traders can speculate on both upward and downward price movements, utilizing leverage to potentially increase returns. Broader Market Participation: Attracts a segment of traders who specifically engage in margin trading, expanding the overall community interacting with SKY. It’s a clear indication that Binance is keen to provide its users with a diverse range of trading instruments, reinforcing its position as a leading exchange. Navigating the Risks of SKY Margin Trading While the prospect of amplified gains is enticing, it’s crucial to remember that margin trading comes with significant risks. Leverage can magnify both profits and losses. A small adverse price movement can lead to substantial losses, potentially exceeding your initial investment. It is paramount to: Understand Leverage: Know how much leverage you are using and its implications. Implement Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders and only trade with capital you can afford to lose. Conduct Due Diligence: Research Skycoin (SKY) thoroughly before engaging in leveraged trading. Binance often provides educational resources on margin trading, and it’s highly recommended that users familiarize themselves with these materials before diving in. Ready to Explore SKY Margin Trading on Binance? The addition of these new pairs opens up a new chapter for Skycoin traders on Binance. Whether you’re an experienced margin trader looking for new opportunities or considering exploring advanced strategies, this development is worth noting. Always approach margin trading with caution, a clear strategy, and a solid understanding of the market dynamics. This expansion by Binance reflects the continuous evolution of the crypto market, where sophisticated tools are becoming increasingly available to a wider audience.

This milestone underscores Bybit’s commitment to supporting Vietnam’s digital asset ecosystem and deepening long-term cooperation in building Da Nang into a hub for international finance and innovation. Da Nang, one of Vietnam’s largest cities and a major economic center, has been approved to deploy a blockchain sandbox — making it a natural location for the country to pilot progressive policies and attract international partnerships in digital assets and blockchain technology. Under the MOU, the partners will jointly support the city’s vision to establish an International Financial Center (IFC) through three core pillars: Digital asset liquidity to connect Da Nang with global financial markets. Ecosystem connectivity to link Vietnam with leading international finance hubs. Infrastructure security to ensure a resilient, risk-controlled environment for blockchain innovation. The partnership is key to translating national strategies into local implementation, ensuring that the IFC model is both policy-flexible and risk-controlled - minimizing exposure to threats targeting digital asset ecosystems. The MOU underscores mutual commitments. Da Nang will facilitate administrative procedures for the partners to invest, open offices, and integrate into the IFC. In turn, Bybit and its partners will offer policy consultation on digital assets and blockchain technology, share international best practices, and support Da Nang in building a modern regulatory framework. Helen Liu, Co-CEO of Bybit, said: ""Vietnam is an inspiring example of a nation embracing digital transformation, and we are honored to contribute to its journey. Bybit is committed to sharing our global expertise in blockchain and digital asset innovation to support Da Nang’s vision of becoming an International Financial Center. This partnership reflects our belief in building sustainable ecosystems hand in hand with governments, institutions, and trusted partners."" This collaboration builds on Bybit’s earlier engagement in Vietnam. In April 2025, Bybit Co-Founder and CEO Ben Zhou met with H.E. Nguyen Van Thang, Minister of Finance of Vietnam, at the Ministry of Finance headquarters in Hanoi. During the meeting, Bybit expressed strong support for Vietnam’s regulatory sandbox initiative and its vision to establish a safe, transparent, and innovation-friendly digital asset ecosystem. Discussions focused on the Government’s plan to launch a pilot sandbox mechanism to test the issuance and trading of crypto assets in a controlled environment, with robust safeguards such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols to protect investors and strengthen financial security. Today’s MOU marks a natural continuation of these efforts, reaffirming Bybit’s role as a long-term partner in Vietnam’s digital transformation journey.

Ethereum & Altcoins Have Seen Their Futures Volume Rise Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the futures trading volume share of Ethereum and the altcoins . The futures trading volume here naturally refers to the amount that’s becoming involved in futures-related trades on the various derivatives exchanges. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the dominance in this metric for ETH and the alts over the last couple of years: As is visible in the graph, the futures trading volume dominance has seen a sharp increase for the altcoins recently, implying that speculative interest in these coins has gone up. The metric is still significantly down for Ethereum compared to its earlier high, but it has nonetheless also enjoyed an uptick at the same time as the altcoin growth. Combined, ETH and the alts occupy around 85.2% of the total cryptocurrency futures trading volume following the increase. This means that the remaining portion, Bitcoin, has gone below 15% in dominance. Historically, periods like these have been a bad omen for not just BTC, but the market as a whole. Examples of these are visible in the chart during both the late 2024 and Summer 2025 price tops. Thus, considering that Ethereum and the altcoins are once again dominating futures trading activity, it’s possible that Bitcoin and other assets may be in for some volatility. In some other news, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared in an X post an update on how the various projects in the digital asset sector rank up in terms of the Development Activity . This indicator measures the total amount of work that the developers of a given project are doing on its public GitHub repositories. The metric makes its measurement in units of “events,” where one event is any action taken by the developer on the repository, like the push of a commit or creation of a fork. Here is the table posted by Santiment that shows the ranking for cryptocurrency projects on the basis of their 30-day Development Activity: As displayed above, Ethereum is only the 10th largest project in terms of 30-day Development Activity, despite its market cap being second only to Bitcoin. The project that’s seeing its developers work the hardest right now is Internet Computer (ICP), which has the metric sitting at a value nearly three times that of ETH’s. ETH Price Ethereum recovered above $4,750 earlier, but it seems the asset’s price has once again faced a pullback as it’s now back at $4,450.",Ethereum|altcoins|Altcoins Futures Volume|bitcoin|btc|ETH|Ethereum Futures Volume|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|ALTCOIN|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 08:00:13

XRP and the Banking System SMQKE stated that XRP is integrated into regulated systems processing trillions of dollars daily. He stressed that his presentation was based on verifiable documentation, not speculation, making it a rare disclosure of XRP’s role in global finance. Interledger Protocol He explained that Ripple’s ILP , introduced in 2012, was created to connect otherwise incompatible blockchains and traditional ledgers. ILP routes payments across independent networks, offering scalability, privacy, and interoperability. RippleNet, Ripple’s payments network, is built on ILP and uses XRP for liquidity. According to SMQKE, banks prefer ILP for its ability to scale while maintaining transaction secrecy. The Single Most Important XRP Video You’ll Ever Watch. https://t.co/911qz6lO6x — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 14, 2025 ISO 20022 Compliance SMQKE highlighted the link between ILP and ISO 20022, the new global messaging standard replacing SWIFT. XRP is among the few ISO 20022-compliant assets , giving it direct compatibility with banking systems. He cited RippleNet’s use of ISO 20022 PACS-008 messages and Standard Chartered Bank’s recognition of XRP as a native ISO 20022 token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 International Finance Bank Evidence SMQKE pointed to the International Finance Bank (IFB), which has adopted ILP in its settlement framework. IFB is compliant with Basel, FATF-16, DORA, and EU sanctions. Its payment matrix shows scenarios where XRP is chosen, such as when counterparties are Ripple-native or when XRP liquidity provides cost advantages. Ripple’s presence alongside traditional rails like SWIFT GPI and SEPA Instant was described as confirmation of XRP’s role in banking infrastructure. He concluded that RippleNet already covers 90 percent of the global foreign exchange market and partners with over 100 banks, including tier-one institutions, covering more than 80 percent of trade corridors. SMQKE explained that banks are prepared to use XRP as a liquidity bridge once its market capitalization supports large-scale adoption. SMQKE’s presentation framed XRP as an integrated part of banking infrastructure through ILP and ISO 20022 standards. He presented evidence that banks are already positioned to utilize XRP for liquidity, with the framework for adoption firmly in place.

But now, Remittix (RTX) is gaining serious attention with its bold vision and rapid growth. Some analysts are even wondering if Ripple could be losing market share to this fast-rising project. Ripple Battles $3 Resistance as ETF Launch Boosts Sentiment XRP is currently trading around $3.03. In a recent interview with Paul Barron, Claver highlighted multiple catalysts, including the upcoming launch of the REX-Osprey XRPR ETF , the first-ever spot exchange-traded fund for XRP. Well-known trader Papa shared a bullish chart indicating XRP could surge to $8.50 by November, while popular crypto analyst WhaleGuru made an even more explosive prediction of $300. source: @mamagucci on X Despite the bullish XRP news and optimistic predictions, Ripple’s token has struggled to make a decisive breakout. Recent on-chain data reveals a sharp decline in Coinbase’s XRP cold wallet holdings, plunging from 970 million XRP three months ago to just 98 million XRP today. However, despite this dramatic drop, XRP’s price has managed to stay above the crucial $3 level, indicating that strong buying demand is stepping in. This tug-of-war reflects growing uncertainty as Remittix continues to rise, challenging Ripple’s dominance in the cross-border payments space. Why Remittix Is Gaining Attention Fast Remittix has quickly become the best crypto to buy now . The project has achieved remarkable milestones in a short period of time. It recently crossed $25.9 million raised, with over 664 million tokens sold at $0.1080 each. Remittix has also officially confirmed BitMart and LBank as its first CEX partners. The team has also already launched its beta wallet, which allows users to store, send, and receive RTX securely. On top of that, Remittix recently passed a comprehensive security audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted names in blockchain security. Investors can also earn 15% of every referral purchase, paid instantly in USDT and claimable every 24 hours. Here’s why Remittix is the top crypto under $1 : Over $25.9 million raised, showing strong global investor confidence. First exchange listings confirmed with BitMart and LBank, creating massive excitement for the public launch. Beta wallet already live, giving users a functional tool to manage their RTXX tokens. CertiK security audit passed and ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens. Built to transform global remittances, tapping into a trillion-dollar cross-border payments market. Could Ripple Be Losing Market Share to Remittix? The latest XRP news shows that Ripple still has strong backing and bullish predictions. However, Remittix is quickly proving that it’s the next 100x altcoin . For investors looking to diversify, Remittix could deliver much higher upside potential, especially for those who get in early enough.

The filings show that a TaskUs employee, Ashita Mishra, helped plan the theft of confidential customer information and funneled it to criminals who used it in phishing schemes. Coinbase revealed in May that the breach had affected at least 69,000 customers, and the damage was estimated to be worth around $400 million. The exchange initially linked the breach to a rogue staff member in an Indian-based vendor. The amended court filings outline how Mishra, a TaskUs service center employee, stole the information beginning in September 2024. TaskUs employee allegedly sold customer data The latest lawsuit alleges that Ashita Mishra, a TaskUs employee in Indore, India, sold confidential customer data, including Social Security numbers and bank details, to a phishing hacker group. She also recruited other TaskUs employees to carry out the breach in a style described as a hub-and-spoke conspiracy. The investigators uncovered over 10,000 Coinbase customer data points on Mishra’s phone. Mishra was allegedly paid $200 per data record, which she captured for up to 200 customers. The hacker group behind the breach was associated with a loose group called ‘the Comm,’ who used the stolen data to impersonate Coinbase staff and deceive customers into giving up their crypto holdings. According to the latest findings , the breach was disclosed in May. The petitioners argued that TaskUs took extra steps to hide the extent of the compromise, including the dismissal of 226 employees in January and the termination of its internal HR team. TaskUs has been accused of misleading regulators by downplaying the breach in its February Form 10-K filing. The filing omitted any revelation of a material incident despite the outsourcer later dismissing hundreds of staff linked to the breach. The Indian vendor allegedly continued to assure the regulators that it faced no material breach even as it pursued a $1.6 billion buyout deal with Blackstone. Coinbase has distanced itself from the vendor. It immediately notified the regulators and affected customers, reimbursed the impacted accounts, tightened the internal controls, and ended its partnership with TaskUs. In a statement by a Coinbase spokesperson, the exchange refused to pay the criminals and instead created a $20 million reward for information leading to the arrest and convictions. Coinbase says the vendor actions were systemic TaskUs, headquartered in Texas, has not yet responded to the accusations but has previously reiterated its commitment to safeguarding client data and confirmed that it has strengthened its security protocols. Coinbase alleged that TaskUs’ actions were systemic and not isolated, citing violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act, which covers unfair practices. Regulators are expected to take the next step to assess whether TaskUs used sufficient safeguarding methods, such as encryption or multi-factor authentication. They will also assess whether the risk could be avoided and whether the breach exposed customers to identity theft or financial loss. Coinbase, on the other hand, has received multiple lawsuits from the affected customers, although the exchange has so far sought to consolidate the claims and move the case to arbitration. Cryptopolitan reported in May that Binance and Kraken may have also been involved in social engineering attacks similar to Coinbase’s. The report stated that hackers attempted to bribe Binance employees to steal sensitive information, even sharing Telegram contacts to coordinate. Binance utilized AI-driven monitoring to flag and stop the conversations, alongside limiting access to user data for verified customer-initiated calls. Kraken, on its part, denied the allegations, saying it had already warned Coinbase of suspicious activities before its breach. Get seen where it counts.

51864516,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/a-closer-look-at-the-real-world-use-cases-of-fasttoken-ftn,1758096585,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/51864516.jpeg,A Closer Look at the Real-World Use Cases of Fasttoken (FTN),https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/a-closer-look-at-the-real-world-use-cases-of-fasttoken-ftn,"Since launching less than three years ago, Fasttoken (FTN) has made good on its promise to facilitate fast, secure, low-cost transactions in a range of domains, from iGaming to lending. While many utility tokens lack practicality outside their native realms, Fasttoken's adoption and integration across gaming, e-commerce, and payments highlight the value of digital assets beyond mere speculation. The native currency of the Bahamut blockchain, an EVM-compatible Layer-1 with a Proof of Stake and Activity (PoSA) mechanism, FTN has found favor with gamers, stakers, developers \and merchants alike. For the uninitiated, we've taken a deep dive into the real-world uses of this crypto asset as its third anniversary draws closer. Strong Foundations: The Bahamut Blockchain Fasttoken derives its name from its progenitor Fastex , a multifaceted network of blockchain services. These services extend far beyond the Bahamut network, encompassing an eponymous trading exchange, NFT marketplace (ftNFT) for digital collectibles, payment arm (Fastex Pay), and 3D metaverse platform (YoCerebrum) designed to host customizable spaces for virtual events, conferences and concerts. Needless to say, the chain upon which a token is minted is vital to its success – and that's certainly the case here. Bahamut is no ordinary network, employing a novel PoSA consensus mechanism that combines staking with active participation. In other words, validators are motivated to not just hold tokens but deploy and maintain smart contracts. The net result? Amplified security, efficiency and network effects. While the consensus mechanism is unique, the use-cases of FTN within Bahamut itself are fairly typical, in that it is utilized to facilitate transactions and secure the network. At present, over 40 million FTN is locked in Bahamut's staking smart contracts and liquid staking dApps, while another 10 million is ring-fenced for the Bahamut Grants Program. With a market cap of $1.9 billion and holdings in over 7 million wallets, FTN's momentum is undeniably impressive considering it's less than three years old. The Uses of FTN in iGaming and Web3 Clearly, FTN has plenty of utility within the Fastex world; but that's to be expected since they designed it for that reason. What about beyond that world? One of the most compelling use-cases for the token lies in the gaming sector, where speed, economy and interoperability are paramount. Since early 2023, Fasttoken has been the primary payment method for BetConstruct, a leading provider of iGaming and betting solutions. The latter's ecosystem includes a decentralized casino platform built directly on Bahamut, as well as a comprehensive sportsbook, and with users able to deposit, wager, and withdraw FTN seamlessly, they can take advantage of cheap transactions and fast settlement. It's not just BetConstruct either: over 70 major iGaming suppliers have integrated Fasttoken in one form or another. Away from iGaming, FTN has been woven into a raft of Web3 applications (dApps) including those concerned with gaming and staking. Apps like Ortak, Lolik, YoHealth and Mutuari leverage FTN in multiple ways, granting utility while incentivizing hodling. Of course, Fastex's Web3 suite puts the token to good use too: the aforementioned ftNFT marketplace and YoCerebrum metaverse are priced in FTN. Bridging Crypto and Commerce In today’s world, the ability to actually spend your crypto assets counts for a lot. In this regard, Fasttoken is well-covered, serving as a versatile payment option thanks to its integration with not only Fastex Pay but also Simplex, Banxa, CoinPayments, CryptoPay, AEON and other infrastructure entities. Thanks to these partnerships, it is extremely easy for merchants to accept FTN for goods and services, and thus for FTN users to spend their tokens whenever the notion takes them. The recently-announced partnership with AEON alone instantly enabled FTN holders to make transactions at over 20 million global retailers. Naturally, the integration of Fasttoken with major payment platforms doesn’t just make the asset spendable. It makes it easier to cash out, to switch from crypto-to-fiat or fiat-to-crypto. For example, those utilizing FTN for the purposes of staking may prefer to cash out their profits to USD while retaining the deposit. Of course, you can’t contemplate spending FTN tokens without first acquiring them. Fortunately, the token is listed and actively traded on around a dozen top-tier exchanges, among them Gate.io, MEXC, BitGet, and Bybit, ensuring deep liquidity and optimal trading conditions. An FTN Future From powering high-stakes iGaming to enabling lending and e-commerce payments, Fasttoken reflects the power of Web3 tech to drive efficiency and deliver meaningful value. By securing numerous partnerships and integrations, Fastex has succeeded in fostering real-world interactions with crypto at the core.

This strategic initiative involves establishing two new subsidiaries, signaling a bold step forward in its Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy. The company is set to launch Bitcoin Japan in its home country and Metaplanet Income in the United States, aiming to deepen its engagement with the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Behind Metaplanet Bitcoin’s Latest Strategic Move? Metaplanet’s decision to create these new entities reflects a deliberate effort to solidify its position within the global Bitcoin ecosystem. By extending its reach, the company aims to not only manage its existing Bitcoin holdings more effectively but also to explore new avenues for growth and adoption. This move is a clear indication of Metaplanet’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The establishment of these subsidiaries comes at a time when institutional interest in Bitcoin is soaring. Companies worldwide are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, prompting many to consider similar treasury strategies. Metaplanet, however, stands out as a pioneer in Japan with its aggressive adoption. Unpacking the Vision: Bitcoin Japan and Metaplanet Income Let’s delve deeper into what each new subsidiary is poised to achieve: Bitcoin Japan: This entity will focus on the domestic Japanese market. Its primary goals are expected to include promoting Bitcoin education, facilitating easier access to Bitcoin for Japanese investors and businesses, and potentially developing localized Bitcoin-related services. This could involve everything from educational seminars to partnerships with local financial institutions. Metaplanet Income: Positioned in the United States, this subsidiary likely aims to tap into the mature and dynamic U.S. cryptocurrency market. While specific details are forthcoming, its name “Metaplanet Income” suggests a focus on generating yield from Bitcoin holdings or exploring investment opportunities within the U.S. digital asset space. This could involve lending, staking, or other sophisticated financial strategies leveraging Bitcoin. These two entities represent a dual-pronged approach, tackling both regional market penetration and advanced financial strategies, all centered around the Metaplanet Bitcoin vision. Why is Metaplanet Bitcoin Doubling Down Now? The timing of Metaplanet’s expansion is no coincidence. Several factors likely contribute to this accelerated embrace of Bitcoin: Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and currency devaluations, make Bitcoin an attractive alternative for corporate treasuries. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply offer a compelling contrast to traditional fiat currencies. Increasing Institutional Acceptance: The past few years have seen a significant shift in how traditional finance views Bitcoin. With major asset managers launching Bitcoin ETFs and increasing regulatory clarity in some regions, the path for corporate adoption is becoming clearer. Shareholder Value: Companies like MicroStrategy have demonstrated that a significant Bitcoin treasury can attract a new class of investors and potentially boost shareholder value, despite market volatility. Metaplanet appears to be following a similar strategic playbook. This proactive stance by Metaplanet Bitcoin highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. Challenges and Opportunities for Metaplanet Bitcoin While the prospects are exciting, Metaplanet’s expansion into new territories with Bitcoin-focused operations also comes with its set of challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscapes in both Japan and the U.S. will be crucial. Each jurisdiction has unique requirements for digital asset businesses, and compliance will be paramount. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile. While Metaplanet has shown resilience in managing its existing holdings, expanding operations means increased exposure and the need for robust risk management strategies. Operational Complexities: Establishing and running new subsidiaries in different countries requires significant operational expertise, including staffing, legal compliance, and technological infrastructure. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges. Metaplanet could cement its position as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption, attracting further investment and talent. Its move could also inspire other Japanese companies to explore similar strategies, driving broader adoption of Metaplanet Bitcoin initiatives in the region. In conclusion, Metaplanet’s decision to launch Bitcoin Japan and Metaplanet Income marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company, but for the wider corporate adoption of Bitcoin. This bold expansion reinforces Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a global treasury asset and sets a precedent for how traditional companies can strategically integrate digital assets into their long-term vision. As Metaplanet continues to lead with its innovative Metaplanet Bitcoin approach, the financial world watches eagerly, anticipating the ripple effects of this strategic move.

Every week, some “next-gen” token claims to be the one that changes everything. Most disappear in months. So when you hear about x1000 project , it’s natural to raise an eyebrow. What is it really? Another pump-and-dump? Or something with actual tech behind it? I’ve dug into the project’s docs, looked at the team’s approach, and tested the tools myself. And I can tell you - while x1000 isn’t flawless, it’s not just smoke and mirrors either. What Exactly Is the X1000 Project? x1000 is positioned as an ecosystem for algorithmic trading and DeFi, not just a standalone token. x1000 presents itself as more than just a token. It’s an ecosystem built around algorithmic trading and decentralized finance. At its core, the project aims to give traders - from complete beginners to seasoned pros - a single hub where they can access automation, analytics, on-chain AI analysis, Twitter-based market sentiment insights, and staking mechanisms. Instead of bouncing between five different apps, you get everything under one roof. It combines three main parts: On-chain AI analytics and sentiment tools: already live and helping users track blockchain activity and social trends. Staking X1000: live feature that allows token holders to earn rewards. Future roadmap: yield farming, DAO governance, advanced bots for trading automation, and arbitrage scanners are all planned, but not yet launched. The goal? Make it easier for both beginners and pros to trade smarter without juggling 10 different platforms. Technology: Why X1000 Feels Faster Than Competitors Here’s the tricky part: running everything on-chain is transparent but slow. That’s why x1000 uses a hybrid architecture: On-chain: transactions, smart contracts, user funds → ensures transparency and trust. Off-chain: heavy data crunching, AI models, and bot logic → ensures speed and efficiency. This way, you don’t get the usual lag that makes some crypto bots useless when markets move fast. What makes x1000 interesting is its focus on accessibility. Most trading automation platforms are intimidating: you need coding knowledge, advanced market understanding, and a lot of time to configure them. x1000 is trying to lower that barrier. If you’re new, you can start with ready-made trading strategies that run with minimal setup. If you’re experienced, the system still gives you room to tweak bots, combine them with DeFi options, and customize strategies. In that sense, it feels a bit like having both a beginner-friendly autopilot and a manual gearbox for those who want more control. The true engine behind X1000 is its AI layer. Unlike projects that only drop “AI” as a buzzword, here the tools are practical and already live: On-chain activity analysis. AI tracks wallet flows, token swaps, and liquidity movements, highlighting abnormal spikes that may signal whale actions or early trends. Market sentiment from Twitter and social feeds. Algorithms measure engagement, mood, and hype around projects in real time, showing when the community starts to shift bullish or bearish. Risk scoring. Instead of raw data, the system assigns risk levels to tokens and trading pairs, helping traders filter noise. Smart signal generation. AI combines on-chain patterns with sentiment and liquidity depth to generate actionable alerts, not just charts. Why is this important? Because in crypto, speed and context matter more than raw numbers. Retail traders rarely have the bandwidth to monitor multiple blockchains, liquidity pools, and Twitter accounts at once. X1000’s AI compresses that flood of data into simple insights: “This token is gaining traction on-chain,” or “Market mood is shifting bearish on X.” This gives both newcomers and professionals a practical edge - one that is usually reserved for hedge funds with entire quant teams. Tokenomics: More Than Just Another Coin The x1000 token is the backbone of the ecosystem. The x1000 token is not just a speculative asset floating around exchanges. It plays an active role in the ecosystem. Users can stake it for rewards, use it for paying for premium analytics and AI insights. Governance via DAO is not live yet, but it’s clearly stated in the roadmap. The supply mechanics are worth noting: capped supply and periodic burns. This combination of scarcity and utility makes the token more resilient than many short-lived coins. Analysts estimate that, if adoption grows and the roadmap is executed, the token has realistic potential to reach a $100M market cap - a milestone that would significantly strengthen its position among AI-driven crypto projects. Now, if you’ve read reviews online, you’ve probably seen concerns. Let’s tackle them directly. “The token is volatile.” → True, but so is every early-stage crypto. That’s not a bug; it’s the market. “What if adoption is slow?” → That’s always a risk, but the project is shipping real tools, not just a roadmap. That’s more than half the space can say. So yes, there are risks, but they’re the normal risks of crypto, not red flags unique to X1000. Practical Tools for Traders This is where the project moves from theory to practice. X1000 isn’t just about holding tokens; it’s about using them. AI-powered analytics: on-chain data processing and Twitter sentiment tracking. Staking X1000: allowing users to earn passive rewards. Instead of giving vague “AI will change crypto” promises, they’re shipping tools you can test today. Let’s be blunt: there are plenty of trading platforms. So why X1000? Plenty of projects talk about automation and AI. Few actually deliver tools that are usable right now. X1000’s main advantage is speed, thanks to its hybrid design. Add to that its flexibility across multiple blockchains and a transparent set of smart contracts, and you have a platform that stands out in a space where buzzwords often outweigh results. Future Outlook: Where X1000 Could Go If the team delivers, here’s what X1000 could evolve into: A go-to hub for algorithmic trading, similar to what MetaTrader did for forex. A trusted DeFi toolkit with staking and farming under one roof. A governance-driven ecosystem where token holders shape the product. And given the rising hype around AI-driven trading, the timing is on point. Another angle worth noting: the X1000 community is growing, and the team is active in keeping people updated. Regular AMAs, roadmap releases, and smart contract audits show they’re not hiding. Compare that to projects that go silent for months - X1000’s openness is a strong signal. Conclusion X1000 is not a guaranteed moonshot, but it’s far from being an empty hype coin. Unlike projects that only promise bots and DeFi, X1000 already delivers working AI-powered tools: on-chain analysis, Twitter sentiment, and staking. Yes, trading automation and arbitrage scanners are still ahead, but the roadmap is realistic. The technology makes sense, the tokenomics are thought out, and the vision is backed by real progress. Considering the potential to reach a $100M market cap, X1000 positions itself as more than speculation — it feels like an early-stage AI startup in crypto. There’s risk, of course, but also clear upside. FAQs 1. What makes X1000 different from other crypto bots?The hybrid system: off-chain speed + on-chain transparency. 2. Does the token have real utility?Yes — staking, governance, payments, and unlocking platform features. 3. How safe is it to use?Smart contracts are auditable, and funds remain on-chain.

A significant development is on the horizon for those keenly watching the pulse of decentralized finance. Binance Alpha, the dedicated on-chain trading service nestled within the Binance Wallet, has officially announced the highly anticipated Binance Alpha DL listing . This exciting addition is set to take place on September 19th, promising new avenues for discovering promising early-stage digital assets. What is the Binance Alpha DL Listing All About? Binance Alpha serves as a specialized gateway for investors looking to engage with nascent cryptocurrencies before they hit mainstream exchanges. It operates directly within the Binance Wallet, providing a seamless and secure environment for on-chain trading. The platform’s core mission is to spotlight early-stage coins, offering users the chance to be among the first to participate in their growth journey. The upcoming Binance Alpha DL listing on September 19th signifies the introduction of a new digital asset, “DL,” to this exclusive trading ecosystem. While specific details about DL itself are often revealed closer to the listing date, its inclusion on Binance Alpha immediately signals its potential as an early-stage project that has met the platform’s vetting criteria. Why Does Binance Alpha Focus on Early-Stage Coins? Investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies can offer substantial rewards, though it also comes with inherent risks. Binance Alpha aims to bridge this gap by providing a curated environment. The platform understands the allure of getting in on the ground floor, where exponential growth is a possibility. However, it also recognizes the need for a robust infrastructure to support these ventures. The appeal lies in the potential for significant returns if a project gains traction. Early investors often acquire tokens at lower valuations, which can appreciate considerably as the project develops and its community expands. Binance Alpha’s role is to facilitate this discovery process for its users, making it easier to access these opportunities directly through their Binance Wallet. Navigating the Binance Alpha DL Listing and Beyond For those interested in participating in the Binance Alpha DL listing , understanding how to interact with the platform is key. Accessing Binance Alpha is straightforward, as it is integrated directly into your existing Binance Wallet. This integration simplifies the process of managing funds and executing trades for these emerging assets. When approaching any early-stage listing, including DL, thorough research is paramount. While Binance Alpha provides a platform, individual due diligence remains crucial. Investors should: Examine the project’s whitepaper: Understand its technology, use case, and roadmap. Assess the team: Look for experienced developers and advisors. Analyze tokenomics: Understand the supply, distribution, and vesting schedules. Monitor community sentiment: Engage with the project’s social channels. These steps help in making informed decisions and managing the inherent risks associated with new ventures in the crypto space. Furthermore, remember that market volatility is common for early-stage projects. What Opportunities Does the Binance Alpha DL Listing Present? The addition of DL to Binance Alpha creates several exciting opportunities. Firstly, it offers early access to a potentially innovative project, allowing investors to be part of its foundational growth. Secondly, it enhances the diversity of assets available within the Binance ecosystem, providing more choices for those seeking high-growth potential. Moreover, the listing could bring increased visibility and liquidity to the DL project itself, fostering its development and community engagement. For Binance Alpha users, it reinforces the platform’s commitment to continuously expanding its offerings with carefully selected early-stage assets, maintaining its position as a go-to for cutting-edge crypto opportunities. The Binance Alpha DL listing on September 19th is more than just another coin addition; it represents a continued commitment to fostering innovation and providing unique investment avenues within the decentralized finance landscape. For savvy investors, this could be an excellent opportunity to explore the next wave of promising digital assets. As always, remember to conduct your own research and invest wisely. The potential for growth in early-stage crypto projects is undeniable, and platforms like Binance Alpha play a vital role in making these opportunities accessible. Keep an eye on September 19th for the official launch of DL on this dynamic platform.

The coin’s price faces new guesses and possible shocks, with a key ETF launch and fresh signals from the Federal Reserve all set for this month. Investors and fans alike wait to see which way the odds will turn. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ , the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet . Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin trades between $0.23 and $0.31 after a lively week. The coin climbed 10.57% in 7 days, 15.69% in a month, and a solid 50.14% over 6 months. The 10-day average sits at $0.27, almost on top of the 100-day line at $0.28, showing price is coiling for a clear move. Momentum signals show a tug-of-war. RSI at 47.81 is neutral, while a Stochastic reading of 68.33 tilts bullish but not overheated. MACD is barely negative at ‑0.0014, hinting that bears have not seized control. If buyers push above $0.31, the nearest ceiling is $0.35. A break there could unlock $0.43, adding roughly 40% from today’s mid-range. Failure to hold $0.23 opens a slide toward $0.18, about 25% lower. Long-term holders still point to that 50% six-month jump as proof of strength, yet short-term traders wait for a spark. Watch $0.27 as the pivot. Above it, bulls press for fresh highs; below it, the support bench comes into play fast. Conclusion DOGE stays bullish through Q4, but XYZVerse (XYZ) rises as the first all-sport memecoin, targeting 20,000% growth with a community-led GameFi plan that could crown it the next cultural icon.

The partnership brings to Saudi banking Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), a step towards onchain financial services. The CCIP facilitates secure cross-chain transfers of assets and data. This functionality bridges decentralized applications and traditional financial platforms, opening up the path for the seamless integration of tokenized assets, programmable contracts, and real-time settlement mechanisms. CRE provides SAB with a developer-friendly platform for testing, building, and deploying next-generation banking tools reliably and securely. In a tweet on X, SAB noted, “This collaboration marks a pivotal step in our commitment to drive Financial Innovation in Saudi Arabia.” Through these technologies, SAB has the ability to test new applications such as automated lending, tokenization of physical assets, and faster cross-border payments. Tokenization is relevant to financial markets, where stocks, bonds, and real estate can be digitally represented for easier and safer transactions. Smart contracts can also make loans and insurance contracts more efficient by automating the process and cutting down on paperwork and operational delay. Saudi Awwal Bank ( @alawwalsab ), one of Saudi Arabia’s largest banks with over $100 billion in total assets, is leveraging several Chainlink services to facilitate the deployment of next-generation onchain applications in Saudi Arabia.

Earlier this year, in a message on his vision for 2030, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom would “turn the Public Investment Fund into the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Our nation holds strong investment capabilities, which we will harness to stimulate our economy and diversify our revenues,” he said. Early stages of the collaboration will include pilot projects that will test the viability of blockchain in live banking environments. These trials will include cybersecurity safeguards, regulatory alignment, and customer education. Chainlink’s built-in security standards and compliance ethos help advance SAB’s objective of bringing solutions that comply with domestic and international best practices. In April, Saudi Arabia also announced that it has invested in almost 40 U.S. venture capital firms, with several targeting cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 initiatives. Sanabil, the investment arm of the Public Investment Fund, is central to this push. The firm invests approximately $2 billion per year in several funding rounds to support companies developing innovative business models. Expanding Saudi banking through blockchain partnerships The partnership with Chainlink furthers SAB’s history of blockchain adoption. Earlier this year, SAB led the world’s first Islamic Repo using blockchain in collaboration with Oumla, a Saudi-based blockchain infrastructure provider. The transaction enabled the bank to lend funds to its peers according to Islamic finance regulations, while using blockchain to increase speed, transparency, and safety. SAB has also held a virtual assets summit to demonstrate its digital ambitions and opportunities in tokenized finance. Saudi Arabia’s blockchain hype goes beyond SAB. Oumla, in partnership with Avalanche, recently announced plans to construct the nation’s first Layer 1 blockchain that will be fully hosted within the Kingdom. The project aims to support startups and small businesses, support technological development, and grow the regional Web3 ecosystem. Following the announcement, Chainlink is up 3.36% in the last 24 hours, trading at $23.40.

Analysts point to its parabolic rise and growing utilization as signs that MUTM could disrupt investor expectations, setting it apart from more speculative assets and firmly putting it on the radar as the top crypto to invest in for the next cycle. Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance possesses strong protection measures for any collateralized asset in order to ensure protocol’s and users’ security. They include target collateral ratios, lending and deposit caps. In an attempt to encourage systemic stability, off close undercollateralized positions are incentivized to be liquidated, call penalties and charge liquidation guarantee remediation in a timely manner. Collateral effectiveness is maximized in the correlated assets, i.e., lending power is increased proportionally to Loan-to-Value (LTV) levels in securely collateralized lending. Reserve factors are supplied as a hedge against exceptional market circumstances, and excess reserves can be imposed on highly volatile assets to charge for volatility. Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has seen more than 16,340 investors buy in to raise $15.85 million amid unimaginable demand. In pursuit of better security and transparency, the project is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Through the program, vulnerabilities can be submitted by researchers and developers, with the reward set on four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. Dynamic Interest Rate Adjustments Mutuum Finance is based on a floating interest rate system that changes depending on the liquidity level. Borrowing is cheap when there is high liquidity and leaves room for higher utilization. Borrowing is expensive when there is low liquidity, leaving room for loan repayment and higher deposits. This helps in balancing the system as well as avoiding over-borrowing. The long-term strategy of Mutuum Finance is to have high-exchange listings to offer liquidity as well as real-world adoption. Further, the project is also incentivizing early adoption by conducting a $100,000 giveaway campaign with $10,000 MUTM rewards for 10 participants. Reclaiming Market Volatility and Preserving Liquidity Mutuum Finance is extremely sensitive to having the correct on-chain liquidity in order not to liquidate low-slippage, low-quality positions. The LTV ratios and liquidation levels are extremely sensitive to the volatility of the underlying token. Tokens that are less volatile and more stable can have higher borrow amounts and lower liquidation levels, whereas riskier and more volatile tokens can have more conservative parameters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most watched tokens of the 2025–26 bull cycle, with analysts calling for it to hit $10. Already in Presale Phase 6, MUTM has collected $15.85M and added 16,340+ investors, demonstrating high demand and early accumulation. Unlike hype projects, MUTM provides genuine real-world DeFi utility with lending and borrowing protocols underpinned by dynamic interest rates and robust risk management, as well as a $50K CertiK bug bounty for security peace of mind. It is that utility, security, and scalability combination that has so many labeling it as the best crypto to keep an eye on. Lock your tokens in Phase 6 today before Stage 7’s increasing price.

Confluence Of Signals Says Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/is-the-dogecoin-bottom-in-signals-says-yes/,"The Dogecoin daily chart is clustering several classical support signals around $0.256–$0.265, as highlighted by Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) via X: “DOGE finding support. Tweezer bottom. 0.382 linear fib holding. AVWAP from cycle high holding.” On the Coinbase DOGE/USD one-day view shown, price is reclaiming the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $0.26537 while riding the Anchored VWAP drawn from the cycle high, with yesterday’s session marked at an open of $0.26840, high $0.27214, low $0.25680 and last $0.27119. What This Means For Dogecoin Price For readers less familiar with the terms, a “tweezer bottom” is a two-bar reversal formation in which consecutive candles print almost identical lows after a decline. The repeated low shows that dip buyers defended the same price on back-to-back sessions, and the intraday wicks rejecting that level often indicate absorption of sell pressure. In the chart, the twin lows cluster exactly into the $0.265 area, giving a clean reference for risk. On higher timeframes such as the daily, this pattern is watched because it defines a precise inflection without requiring a long basing process; confirmation is typically evaluated by whether subsequent candles hold above those lows and push through the interim highs of the pattern. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could See Another Double-Digit Surge This Week As These Developments Take Place The 0.382 “linear fib” refers to a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement calculated on a linear price scale from the prior swing extremes drawn on the chart. In practical terms, it marks a shallow retracement level where trends frequently pause or resume. Here, that retracement prints at $0.26537, almost perfectly overlapping the tweezer lows. “Holding” in the analyst’s note means price probed the level intraday but closed back above it, preserving it as support rather than converting it to resistance. AVWAP—the Anchored Volume-Weighted Average Price—is the running average price of all trades since a chosen starting point, weighted by traded volume, with that starting point “anchored” to a specific candle. The anchor here is the cycle high visible on the left side of the chart. Functionally, this AVWAP (drawn as the blue band) represents the composite cost basis of market participants from that top onward. When price is below an AVWAP anchored to a major high, it often behaves as dynamic resistance because many holders are underwater; when price reclaims it, the same line can flip into dynamic support as the average participant moves back to break-even or profit. On this chart, the AVWAP is sloping through $0.265–$0.27 and “holding,” meaning successive tests have found buyers along that band, precisely where the 0.382 retracement and tweezer lows coincide. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $0.54 ‘Final Boss’ Breakout, Says Top Analyst Technically, that three-way overlay—pattern, retracement, and anchored cost basis—is what traders call confluence. It improves the quality of a level because different methods, derived from different data (price structure, proportional retracement, and volume distribution over time), all argue for the same zone. Where Is DOGE Heading Next? The chart also frames the next directional checkpoints. The nearest marked resistance is the 0.5 retracement at $0.30724, which capped the latest advance before the pullback into $0.265. Above that, the Fibonacci ladder steps to $0.34911 (0.618), $0.40871 (0.786), $0.44419 (0.886), and $0.48464 (1.000), with extensions labeled at $0.58115 (1.272) and $0.63153 (1.414). If the confluence at $0.265 were to fail on a closing basis, the next plotted downside reference on this template is the 0.236 retracement at $0.21357, while the bottom of the displayed range sits at $0.12984. Put together, the chart Cantonese Cat shared communicates a straightforward message: DOGE tested a cluster of technical supports at $0.265, produced a tweezer-style reaction there, and is attempting to stabilize above both the 0.382 retracement and the AVWAP from the cycle high. That is the specific technical context behind the analyst’s “local bottom” read. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.267.

Jūs varat noguldīt CS2 skins no sava personīgā inventāra. Ieroču skini tiek konvertēti virtuālajā valūtā (monētās), kuras tiek izmantotas, lai spēlētu dažādas spēles platformā. Alternatīvi, dažas spēles ļauj arī tieši veikt likmes ar skiniem. Vietne ir pilnībā savietojama ar mobilajām ierīcēm, kas nozīmē, ka jūs varat spēlēt un uzvarēt no sava tālruņa vai planšetdatora. Kādas spēles piedāvā SkinsLuck? SkinsLuck darbojas kā skinu balstīts tiešsaistes kazino, kas pielāgots CS2 kultūrai. Platforma piedāvā daudzveidīgas spēles, kas visas ir izstrādātas ātrumam un izklaidei. Kādas spēles piedāvā SkinsLuck? SkinsLuck darbojas kā skins balstīts tiešsaistes kazino, kas pielāgots CS2 kultūrai. Platforma piedāvā daudzveidīgas spēles, kas visas ir izstrādātas ātrumam un izklaidei. Starp tiem izceļas Skins Cases, kur jūs atverat kastes, kas satur nejaušus ieroču skinus, ar iepriekš noteiktām izredzēm. Pirms atverat katru kasti, jūs varat redzēt izredzes un to, ko varat vinnēt. Case Battles jūs spēlējat viens pret vienu ar citiem spēlētājiem, un uzvarētājs ir tas, kuram ir visvērtīgākie laimesti. Tas ir viens no populārākajiem un konkurētspējīgākajiem režīmiem. Upgrader funkcija ļauj spēlētājiem apmainīt parastos skinus, cerot uzvarēt retākus. Rezultāts ir balstīts uz nejaušības sistēmu (laimīgā rulete), kas padara pieredzi aizraujošu. Ir arī klasiskais Coinflip, kur divi spēlētāji veic likmes uz skiniem vai monētām, un sistēma nosaka uzvarētāju ar digitālu “monētas mešanu”. Visbeidzot, jūs varat spēlēt Roulette vai Crash, kur jūs veicat likmes un gaidāt pareizo brīdi, lai izņemtu savus laimestus, pirms spēle “sabrūk”. Vai SkinsLuck ir drošs? Platforma liek lielu uzsvaru uz drošību un pārredzamību. Visi savienojumi tiek veidoti caur Steam, un transakciju sistēmas ir šifrētas. Spēles izmanto pierādāmi godīgu tehnoloģiju, kas balstīta uz nejaušu skaitļu algoritmiem. Tas nozīmē, ka katrs rezultāts ir pārredzams un pārbaudāms, nodrošinot godīgumu visiem spēlētājiem. Lapā atklāti tiek parādītas uzvaras izredzes katram skinam vai gadījumam, un lielākā daļa darījumu (īpaši izņemšana) tiek izpildīti gandrīz uzreiz. Ko var laimēt? SkinsLuck var laimēt dažādus ieročus, nažus, cimdus un uzlīmes. Daži no tiem ir ļoti reti vai dārgi, kas padara spēlēšanu vēl aizraujošāku. Visus laimestus var pārskaitīt atpakaļ uz spēlētāja Steam kontu, ļaujot tos paturēt vai izmantot citos darījumos vai pirkumos. Kopiena un atbalsts SkinsLuck nav tikai azartspēļu platforma. Tai ir aktīva kopiena Discord, reāllaika informācija par rezultātiem un uzvarētajiem skiniem, kā arī atbalsts, kas pieejams 24/7, ja rodas jautājumi vai bažas. Spēlētāji var čatot, izveidot cīņas un parādīt savu kolekciju, tādējādi nodrošinot sociālāku un jautrāku pieredzi. Secinājumi Secinājumi SkinsLuck ir pilnvērtīga un droša skinu azartspēļu vietne CS2 spēlētājiem, kuri vēlas izklaidēties, izmēģināt savu veiksmi un iegūt retus skinus.

Among these, Near Protocol stands out as a formidable player, aiming to simplify blockchain adoption for developers and users alike. As interest in high-performance, scalable blockchain solutions grows, many are asking: What does the future hold for NEAR? This comprehensive guide delves into the NEAR price prediction for the coming years, exploring the factors that could drive its value and whether a significant surge is on the horizon for NEAR crypto . Understanding Near Protocol: The Foundation of Future Growth Before we dive into numbers, it is crucial to understand what makes Near Protocol unique. It is a layer-one blockchain designed for scalability and usability, focusing on developer-friendliness and seamless user experiences. Unlike many complex blockchain environments, Near aims to be an intuitive platform where developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) without extensive prior blockchain knowledge. Its core technology, Nightshade sharding, allows the network to process transactions in parallel, significantly boosting its capacity and speed. Key aspects that define Near Protocol include: Sharding Technology: Nightshade enables dynamic scaling, allowing the network to expand its processing power as demand grows. Developer Experience: Supports familiar programming languages like Rust and AssemblyScript, lowering the barrier to entry for developers. Usability for End-Users: Features like human-readable account names (e.g., ‘yourname.near’) and transaction fee abstraction (users don’t always pay gas directly) enhance user experience. Ecosystem Focus: A strong emphasis on fostering a vibrant ecosystem of dApps, wallets, and infrastructure projects. These foundational strengths are vital for any long-term crypto price forecast , as they dictate the project’s utility and potential for widespread adoption. Current Market Dynamics and NEAR Crypto Performance The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and NEAR crypto is no exception. Its price movements are influenced by broader market trends, investor sentiment, technological developments within the Near ecosystem, and competitive pressures. Historically, NEAR has shown periods of significant growth, especially during bullish market cycles, demonstrating its potential to capture investor interest. When evaluating the current performance, it is important to consider: Market Capitalization: A higher market cap often indicates greater stability and investor confidence. Trading Volume: Healthy trading volumes suggest liquidity and active interest in the NEAR token . Ecosystem Development: New dApp launches, partnerships, and upgrades within the Near Protocol ecosystem can positively impact its value. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, and regulatory news can sway the entire crypto market, including NEAR. Understanding these dynamics provides a baseline for any credible NEAR price prediction , allowing us to contextualize future projections within the current landscape. Factors Driving the NEAR Price Prediction 2025-2030 Several critical factors will shape the trajectory of Near Protocol and its native token, NEAR, in the coming years. These elements contribute to the overall utility and demand for the platform, directly impacting its market value. Technological Advancements: The Core of NEAR Protocol’s Edge Near’s commitment to innovation, particularly with its Nightshade sharding, is a major driver. As the network further refines its sharding implementation and introduces new features, its ability to scale efficiently will attract more developers and users. Continued improvements in transaction speed, cost-effectiveness, and security will solidify Near’s position as a leading blockchain for Web3 development. Any breakthroughs in these areas will provide a strong tailwind for the NEAR price prediction . Ecosystem Growth and Adoption: Fueling NEAR Crypto Demand The strength of a blockchain often lies in its ecosystem. The growth of dApps, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and gaming projects built on Near Protocol directly translates to increased utility and demand for the NEAR token . Strategic partnerships, grants for developers, and successful marketing campaigns to onboard new users will be crucial. As more projects choose Near for its scalability and user-friendly environment, the demand for NEAR to pay for transaction fees, staking, and governance will naturally increase, positively impacting the NEAR crypto value. Market Sentiment and Broader Crypto Trends: What Does the Crypto Price Forecast Say? The overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market plays a significant role. A bullish market cycle, often driven by institutional adoption, clearer regulations, or technological advancements across the industry, tends to lift all boats, including NEAR. Conversely, bearish trends can exert downward pressure. Monitoring the broader crypto price forecast and understanding market cycles is essential for anticipating NEAR’s movements. Factors like Bitcoin’s performance, global economic stability, and regulatory clarity will continue to influence investor confidence in altcoins like NEAR. Competition and Regulatory Landscape: Navigating Challenges for the NEAR Token The blockchain space is highly competitive, with numerous Layer 1 protocols vying for market share. Near Protocol must continue to innovate and differentiate itself to maintain its edge against competitors like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Additionally, the evolving regulatory landscape globally could introduce challenges or opportunities. Clearer regulations could foster greater institutional investment, while restrictive policies might hinder growth. The ability of Near Protocol to adapt to these external pressures will be vital for its long-term success and the stability of the NEAR token . NEAR Price Prediction 2025: A Look at the Mid-Term Horizon As we approach 2025, several factors could converge to shape the NEAR price prediction . The continued maturation of its sharding technology, coupled with an expanding ecosystem of dApps, could drive significant user adoption. If the broader crypto market enters a sustained bullish phase, fueled by macroeconomic improvements or increasing institutional interest, Near Protocol is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum. In 2025, we might see: Increased Network Activity: More dApps launching and higher transaction volumes. Stronger Developer Community: Continued growth in developer tools and resources. Potential for Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with major Web2 companies or other blockchain protocols. Analysts often project a conservative yet steady growth for NEAR crypto in the mid-term, with potential for more aggressive surges if specific catalysts, such as a major technological upgrade or a widespread adoption wave, materialize. A 2X surge from current levels by 2025 is certainly within the realm of possibility, contingent on favorable market conditions and strong execution by the Near team. NEAR Price Prediction 2026-2030: Long-Term Growth Potential Looking further out to 2026 and beyond, the long-term outlook for Near Protocol appears promising, assuming it continues to deliver on its roadmap and adapt to market changes. By 2030, the Web3 landscape is expected to be significantly more developed, with blockchain technology integrated into various aspects of daily life. Near’s focus on usability and scalability positions it well to be a foundational layer for this future. Key drivers for the long-term NEAR price prediction include: Mass Adoption of Web3: If Web3 truly goes mainstream, platforms like Near, which prioritize user experience, will be at the forefront. Interoperability Solutions: Near’s ability to seamlessly interact with other blockchains (e.g., through bridges like Rainbow Bridge) will enhance its utility. Decentralized Governance: The maturation of Near’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) will ensure community-driven development and resilience. Inflationary/Deflationary Mechanisms: How the supply of the NEAR token is managed over time will also influence its value. A significant crypto price forecast for Near Protocol in this timeframe often anticipates substantial growth, potentially seeing the token reach new all-time highs as its ecosystem expands and Web3 adoption accelerates. While a 2X surge is a near-term possibility, the long-term potential for multiple X gains exists if Near becomes a dominant player in the decentralized internet. Is NEAR Protocol a Good Investment? Weighing Potential and Risks The question of whether Near Protocol represents a good investment depends on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market outlook. The project has strong fundamentals, a clear vision for Web3, and a dedicated development team. Its technological approach to scalability and user-friendliness gives it a competitive edge. However, like all cryptocurrency investments, it comes with risks: Market Volatility: Prices can fluctuate wildly, leading to potential losses. Competition: The Layer 1 space is crowded, and innovation from competitors could challenge Near’s position. Regulatory Uncertainty: Future government regulations could impact the entire crypto market. Technical Risks: While robust, any blockchain can face unforeseen technical challenges or security vulnerabilities. For those who believe in the future of Web3 and the importance of scalable, user-friendly blockchain infrastructure, Near Protocol offers a compelling investment thesis. It is crucial to conduct thorough due diligence and consider these risks before making any investment decisions. A diversified portfolio is always recommended. Actionable Insights for Navigating the NEAR Crypto Market For investors and enthusiasts looking to engage with NEAR crypto , here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Regularly follow official Near Protocol announcements, roadmap updates, and ecosystem developments. Monitor Market Trends: Keep an eye on broader cryptocurrency market sentiment and macroeconomic indicators that influence the overall crypto price forecast .

Bitcoin vor der Entscheidung,https://www.newsbtc.com/deutsch/zinsschock-oder-kursexplosion-bitcoin-vor-der-entscheidung/,"Der Markt wartet gespannt auf die Zinsentscheidung der US-Notenbank. Im Vorfeld zeigt Bitcoin eine auffällige Stärke. Nach einem Rücksetzer konnte der Support gehalten werden, wodurch sich der Kurs erneut nach oben bewegte. Besonders der Ausbruch über eine diagonale Trendlinie gab den Bullen kurzfristig Rückenwind. Das Ziel bei rund 117.400 US-Dollar wurde jedoch knapp verfehlt. Der Chart zeigt eine bullische Flagge, die Raum für weitere Anstiege lassen könnte. Bitcoin Bullflag, Quelle: www.tradnigview.com Die Unsicherheit bleibt. Kommt eine Zinssenkung von 0,5 Prozent, wäre ein explosives Szenario nach Norden denkbar, möglicherweise sogar neue Allzeithochs. Bei nur 0,25 Prozent und einer mahnenden Rede von Jerome Powell droht dagegen ein Abverkauf. Anleger müssen sich also auf starke Schwankungen einstellen. Unterstützungen und Widerstände sind in dieser Lage entscheidend, um klare Setups zu finden. Widerstände im Blick Die entscheidende Zone liegt im Bereich von 119.000 bis 123.000 US-Dollar. Erst wenn Bitcoin diese Hürde nachhaltig überwindet, könnte der Weg frei sein für ein Schließen aller offenen Gaps und einen größeren Aufwärtsschub. Scheitert der Kurs an diesem Bereich, droht ein Rückfall in die Region um 113.000 oder sogar 100.000 US-Dollar. Charttechnisch verstärken sich die Risiken, da eine bearishe Divergenz auf dem Vierstunden-Chart sichtbar ist – steigende Kurse, aber ein schwächerer RSI. For those still fooled thinking the bull is “about to start” wake up. It started in Jan 2023. BTC has been moving up for 2 years and 8 months! In 2015-2017 bull market lasted 820d2019-2021 bull market lasted 1004dCurrent ""bull market"" lasting 1035d.. You’re late! — Doctor Profit 🇨🇭 (@DrProfitCrypto) September 15, 2025 Kurzfristig bleibt der Markt also ein Spiel zwischen Geduld und Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit. Trader beobachten engmaschig die Bewegungen rund um diese Zonen. Auch die Entwicklung anderer Märkte wie S&P 500, Nasdaq oder Edelmetalle spielt eine Rolle, da sie stark mit der US-Geldpolitik verknüpft sind. Ethereum kämpft mit wichtigen Marken Ethereum verläuft ähnlich wie Bitcoin. Nach einem Rücksetzer konnte die Tageskerze oberhalb einer wichtigen diagonalen Linie schließen – ein positives Signal. Kurzfristig ist ein Anstieg bis in den Bereich zwischen 4.615 und 4.640 US-Dollar möglich. Erst über dieser Zone wäre der Weg zu 4.700 und darüber hinaus frei. Doch auch bei Ethereum ist Vorsicht angesagt. Fällt der Kurs unter 4.333 oder gar 4.200, könnten weitere 15 Prozent Verlust folgen, mit Kursen bis in den Bereich um 3.600 US-Dollar. Das eröffnet langfristig neue Einstiegschancen, kurzfristig droht aber Druck auf die gesamte Altcoin-Landschaft. Die Marktlogik bleibt also dieselbe: Überraschende Zinsschritte könnten für Rallys sorgen, während warnende Worte der Notenbank die Kurse belasten. In beiden Fällen reagieren Kryptowährungen besonders heftig. Gerade diese Unsicherheit macht die Nebenwerte spannend. Nach jeder größeren Bitcoin-Korrektur hatten Altcoins in den vergangenen Zyklen das Potenzial, überproportional zu steigen. Projekte mit innovativen Ansätzen nutzen die Marktphasen, um Investoren, die auf den Aufschwung hoffen, schon vorzeitig abzuholen. Ein Top-Beispiel ist hier Pepe Node ($PEPENODE). Das neue Projekt vereint spielerisches Mining von Memecoins mit einem Krypto Presale und bringt damit enormes Potenzial für einen Bullenmarkt. Das Projekt setzt nicht auf klassische Coud-Mining-Modelle, die in der Vergangenheit durch Skandale aufgefallen waren. Stattdessen kombiniert es Mining mit einem spielerischen Ansatz. Nutzer können virtuelle Mining-Setups aufbauen, upgraden und damit Meme-Coins wie Pepe oder Fartcoin verdienen. Ein entscheidender Mechanismus ist dabei die Deflation: 70 Prozent aller eingesetzten PEPENODE-Token beim Upgraden werden dauerhaft verbrannt. Dadurch sinkt das Angebot kontinuierlich. Zudem können Käufer ihre Tokens bereits im Presale staken mit dynamischen Renditen von über 1.100 Prozent pro Jahr (zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt). Damit entsteht eine seltene Kombination: frühzeitige Belohnungen und ein deflationäres Modell, das langfristig Druck auf den Kurs ausüben könnte. Mit inzwischen über 1,2 Millionen US-Dollar eingesammeltem Kapital zeigt PepeNode, wie stark das Interesse an innovativen Meme-Projekten derzeit ist. Auch wenn das Risiko eines Memecoins mitschwingt, scheinbar glauben viele Investoren an einen Altcoin Bullrun und an den Anstieg von PepeNode. Hier PepeNode Token im Presale kaufen.

FORD's pivot to Solana follows years of declining revenues and negative net income, with its SOL holdings now exceeding $1.58B in value. Despite staking SOL for a 6.8% yield, FORD trades at over 30x forward sales, suggesting the stock is significantly overvalued at current prices. I rate FORD as a 'hold,' preferring a moderate premium to the PIPE price over the current ~$40 share price for SOL exposure. As I laid out in my recent Solana ( SOL-USD ) piece highlighting the impending SOL purchases through public equities, we have a new leader in the race to be the biggest Solana DAT, or Digital Asset Treasury company. That crown is currently worn by Forward Industries (FORD), which recently purchased over 6.8 million SOL tokens following a PIPE investment from Multicoin Capital, Galaxy Digital (GLXY), and Jump Crypto. In this piece, we'll look at some of the key details of those investments and assess whether FORD shares are a 'buy,' 'hold,' or 'sell' at the present time. Forward Industries As has often been the case in some of the more recent examples from the DAT craze this summer, the public companies that transition to the DAT model often have very little in the way of assets or profitable business lines prior to shifting to crypto. Such is the case for Forward Industries, which previously operated a product design business for medical and technology companies. Data by YCharts In addition to declining revenues going back at least the last 3 years, Forward Industries has had negative net income for 7 consecutive quarters. Thus, a timely pivot to Solana was aided by a massive capital raise. The PIPE Through a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, Forward Industries was able to raise approximately $1.65 billion from various investors at a price of $18.50 per share. The proceeds from that PIPE were to purchase Solana for the company's SOL strategy. On September 15th, the company announced over 6.8 million SOL tokens purchased with the proceeds from that PIPE. That amount of SOL currently makes Forward Industries the largest Solana DAT by a wide margin. In fact, not including Helius Medical Technologies (HSDT), which is also raising millions of dollars for a SOL treasury, Forward Industries has a bigger SOL balance than the previous 8 SOL DAT companies combined: Entities Total Solana Market Value DeFi Development Corp. ( DFDV ) 2,027,817 $470,453,544 Upexi ( UPXI ) 2,018,419 $468,273,208 Sharps Technology ( STSS ) 2,000,000 $464,000,000 Sol Strategies ( STKE ) 370,420 $85,937,440 BIT Mining Limited ( BTCM ) 44,412 $10,303,584 Exodus Movement ( EXOD ) 43,738 $10,147,216 Torrent Capital ( OTCPK:TRRPF ) 40,039 $9,289,048 Lion Group Holding ( LGHL ) 6,629 $1,537,928 Combined 6,551,474 Forward Industries 6,822,000 $1,582,704,000 Source: CoinGecko, values at $232 SOL price Subsequent to the PIPE, Forward Industries raised another $32.9 million through a direct investment at $18.50 per share. Per that prospectus , there are now 84,527,120 shares outstanding. This is an important number because it implies an equity valuation of $3.3 billion at a $39 closing price on September 15th. Should the company really be worth that much? I'm not convinced. Valuation Given the company's $3.3 billion valuation relative to the $1.6 billion SOL that the company holds, it would be fair to call FORD overvalued at a 2x mNAV multiple if it were a DAT that held a non-productive asset. However, the company has put the SOL to work through native staking. Meaning, these tokens do generate a yield on top of any price appreciation that they might produce. 1 yr Solana APYs ( Staking Rewards ) Presently, staked Solana generates 6.8% annually. Keep in mind, as more Solana is purchased and subsequently staked for income, the yields from staking come down, similar to how a bond yield would come down when the price of the bond increases. But at 6.8%, we can at least model a price-to-sales multiple for FORD based on expected annual revenue from staking. Current SOL holdings: $1,582,704,000 Staking Yield 6.8% Annualized revenue $107,623,872 Market Capitalization $3,296,557,680 FWD P/S Multiple 30.63 Source: Author's calculations Assuming the staking yield stays the same and the price of SOL doesn't deviate from current levels, FORD is trading at over 30x forward sales. To be sure, there are other things that the company can do to maximize returns for shareholders. It could take SOL out of stake and instead put it into riskier, higher-yield DeFi protocols. It could make investments in companies that build on and grow the Solana ecosystem as well. But, before any of that happens, FORD is probably overpriced at $39 per share. Closing Thoughts It is a very interesting time in the digital asset markets. Publicly listed companies are essentially competing with ETFs and other asset managers for capital to put into the blockchain ecosystem. Part of what makes the share price gains in these smaller cap companies so explosive is that the floats are so small. For example, prior to the PIPE, there were slightly more than 1 million FORD shares outstanding. Now that number is closer to 85 million shares, but the overwhelming majority of them are temporarily locked up. You could talk me into FORD at a moderate premium to the PIPE offering price of $18.50. At closer to $40, I would find alternative ways to get exposure to SOL. I'll initiate with a 'hold.'",SOL-USD|FORD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-17 09:41:50

The Guaranteeing U.S. Exchange Neutrality for Interconnected and Universal Stablecoins Act , passed in July, is a federal framework that has given institutions and banks clarity on how to issue stablecoins. According to CoinGecko data, the global market for these assets is now valued at $294 billion. Coinbase economists predict the industry could reach $1.2 trillion by 2028. The market is undoubtedly expanding, but Ripple executive Jack McDonald believes not every project meets the standards required for an interoperable, compliant and transparent stablecoin. Many tokens, he argues, are developed for purely hype, which in turn limit their potential. Ripple executive wary of short-sighted stablecoin issuers McDonald, who is the chief executive of Standard Custody & Trust Co. and senior vice-president for stablecoins at Ripple, said many current projects lack vision. Pouring his sentiments in an insight published on Ripple’s website on Wednesday, McDonald reiterated that stablecoins should not be treated as “just a marketing initiative.” Stablecoins carry responsibilities of trust, compliance, and scale. Tokens focused on loyalty programs, gaming economies, or closed ecosystems often fall short of this,” he wrote. The Ripple stablecoins SVP coined the hype-based stablecoins as “isolated islands of value” that fail to connect with broader financial systems, and lack the liquidity, portability, or utility sought in real-world payments. McDonald explained how stablecoins thrive in jurisdictions where financial infrastructure is considered “limited or inefficient” by world standards, because they can bridge access to the US dollar, lower the cost of remittances, and make faster settlements than the slow and expensive banking networks. “The benefits are tangible and measurable,” McDonald continued, “This is where stablecoins can unlock real economic value, and where the need is greatest.” Moreover, he asserted that stablecoins can only succeed if they are interoperable across platforms and networks, transparent about reserves, and capable of scaling as core infrastructure. “These are prerequisites for mainstream adoption and the stability that the term ‘stablecoin’ implies,” the Standard Custody CEO surmised. Concluding his insight, McDonald listed Ripple USD (RLUSD) as the example of a compliance-first token, fully backed 1:1 by U.S. dollar reserves held in reputable US banks. As reported by Cryptopolitan during launch, RLUSD is issued under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Services and is built on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Ripple says this dual-network issuance makes it flexible for cross-border payments, in tandem with enterprise-grade compliance standards. The UK wants to control stablecoins The stablecoin discussion was also part of The Rollup Podcast’s interview earlier this month with David Grider of Finality Capital, who said “the most interesting thing happening in crypto is TradFi convergence and the unshackling of regulation,” “That’s what’s allowing companies to do DATs and Hype to get their own stablecoin, and it’s also allowing tokenization you are seeing today with Nasdaq. I feel this is pretty exciting for everyone,” the Finality Capital partner reckoned. While the US has created room for stablecoin issuers to thrive, the Bank of England is proposing limits on how many stablecoins individuals and businesses can hold. According to the UK’s central bank, systemic stablecoins could weaken the banking system by draining deposits if left unchecked. Its plan would cap individual holdings at between £10,000 and £20,000, while businesses could be restricted to £10 million. Officials said they intend to press ahead with the policy to “safeguard financial stability,” but for crypto and payments groups, it would leave the UK lagging. “Imposing caps on stablecoins is bad for UK savers, bad for the City and bad for sterling,” said Tom Duff Gordon, vice-president of international policy at Coinbase. The Financial Conduct Authority’s research shows that 93% of UK adults have heard of crypto, and seven million people own some form of it. “Capping stablecoin holdings is how you drive capital away,” complained one naysayer of the BoE’s proposed stablecoin cap on X.

51867787,583284,1758102294,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51867787.jpeg,Why Bitcoin Hyper’s L2 Solution Could Power $BTC’s Next Big Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-l2-can-save-troubled-bitcoin/,"Many industry experts and analysts predict $BTC to touch $1M by 2030. Given that it has generated around 188M% returns since 2010 and governments across the world are embracing digital assets, the prediction doesn’t seem far-fetched. But here is the problem: does the Bitcoin blockchain have what it takes to back its growing popularity, at only seven transactions per second (TPS)? The answer is a resounding yes, thanks to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Not only does this new Layer-2 (L2) solution bring more speed and scalability to the Bitcoin blockchain, it also makes it programmable for Web3 innovation. The best part is that the project is still in the early phases with solid technical progress. Bitcoin Hyper offers a low-cost entry into Bitcoin’s journey ahead, making it no surprise that the viral $HYPER token presale has already reached $16.4M+. Why Bitcoin Hyper is Trending Bitcoin Hyper is one of the best new cryptocurrencies to buy this year, with both whales and retail investors in a hurry to secure its native crypto $HYPER. This week alone has seen whale buys of $27.1K and $31.5K . These purchases follow a much bigger transaction last month, where a whale swapped 35.149 $ETH worth $161.3K for $HYPER tokens. What’s fueling this buying frenzy? To understand that, we need to first look at the pain points that Bitcoin Hyper sets out to solve. Bitcoin is a brilliant store of value, as its value appreciation over the years proves. But when it comes to everyday transactions, $BTC doesn’t justify the ‘currency’ in cryptocurrency. Transaction fees can climb so high during busy times that you’d be better off paying with fiat. Bitcoin transactions can also be incredibly slow. $BTC’s seven TPS is dwarfed by Visa’s 65K TPS , making it obvious why its entry into the mainstream as digital cash remains elusive. While Bitcoin is often heralded as the crypto king, real innovation in the blockchain space takes place elsewhere. Interestingly, it has been close to 17 years since the Bitcoin blockchain launched, but it still lacks programmability. Web3 owes its growth to blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano for their networks, compatible with smart contracts – not Bitcoin. As a blockchain, Bitcoin is outdated. Developers can’t rely on it for building dApps, DeFi solutions, NFTs, and meme coins. And that’s exactly the reason why Bitcoin Hyper is trending now; it is on a mission to make the Bitcoin blockchain relevant again. The Mechanics of Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2 Bitcoin Hyper is a fast, cheap, and secure L2 solution designed for Bitcoin, with two core pillars: The first is a non-custodial Canonical Bridge . You send your $BTC to an address monitored by the Canonical Bridge, and once verified, it’s minted on the L2 as wrapped $BTC. Unlike $BTC, you can use the wrapped $BTC across different applications, from DeFi to NFTs and games. The L2 unlocks Web3 avenues that $BTC never could. When you want your $BTC back, simply withdraw it back to Bitcoin’s native Layer-1, any time you choose. The second is the Solana Virtual Machine , which brings Solana-level performance to Bitcoin. For developers familiar with Solana’s framework and tools, it will be easy to build apps onto Bitcoin Hyper. Near-instant execution and low fees are added incentives. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper website to learn more about the L2 infrastructure. Solid Tech Progress Justifies the FOMO The crypto market is a decentralized space where anyone can launch a project. Low entry barriers lead to innovation, but they can also overcrowd the market with substandard projects. Investors who have watched the crypto market for a while know that new projects are not to be judged by the promises they make. Their dev updates matter more than their roadmap. It is for this reason, strategic investors are buying $HYPER tokens before it hits exchanges. Here is what we can expect next: Better roll-up sequencing models, refined for anchoring to Bitcoin’s base layer Stronger dev workflows for SVM-compatible contracts, from deployment to monitoring Lightweight infra services (RPC, indexers, explorers) to help developers interact with Hyper efficiently Pathway for early builders to test contracts and infra components before the mainnet launch. In addition, the project has undergone two smart contract audits by leading blockchain security firms Coinsult and SpyWolf . The reports clear any concerns investors may have around rug pulls and code traps – both genuine risks in the crypto space. Backed by a strong project with consistent tech progress, it wouldn’t be surprising to see $HYPER explode on its initial exchange listings. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , $HYPER could make a 28x gain from its presale price, hitting $0.32 by the year-end. $16.4M Raised: The Presale Window is Now Open – But Not For Long The $HYPER presale is racing ahead, with growing support from Bitcoin investors. They are making a strategic move with the new token, as it is closely tied to Bitcoin’s brand value and utility. The pro-crypto shift across the world hints at Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption. For example, Japan plans to cut crypto taxes from 55% to 20%, and the new rule treats crypto gains similarly to stock gains. The US, on the other hand, is on a mission to become the crypto capital of the world. SEC Chair Paul Atkins reiterated this goal in his keynote address at the inaugural OECD Roundtable on Global Financial Markets . ‘An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come. And today, ladies and gentlemen, we must admit that: crypto’s time has come.’ – Paul Atkins, SEC Chair As Bitcoin climbs up the charts, $HYPER is expected to follow. But here is the distinction. Bitcoin has a gigantic market cap of $2.3T , which limits its pace, while Bitcoin Hyper is a small-cap project with more room for returns. The tokenomics is designed with eyes set on long-term growth and value appreciation. Waiting until the exchange listing, however, might be a bad idea, as the residual FOMO from the presale could push the token price exponentially. The dynamic staking program also encourages early investments with higher APYs. Right now you can buy $HYPER for $0.012935 and unlock a juicy 70% staking APY. Our How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper guide explains how to do just that. Being a presale, though, the price rises in stages while the APY lowers as more holders stake their tokens. And the next price surge is less than two days away. So early action is key. Ready to join the presale? Buy your $HYPER via the official Bitcoin Hyper website today.

Most altcoins have failed to produce any big moves over the past day, while BNB charted a new all-time high, and HYPE has neared its own. BTC Stopped at $117K The primary cryptocurrency has been on an evident uptrend for the past week or so, after bouncing off the $111,000 support last Tuesday. The asset started to recover some of the recently lost ground almost immediately and had risen to over $116,000 by Friday. It failed there at first and remained sideways for most of the weekend, at least after it jumped to $116,800 on Saturday morning, where it was quickly stopped. The bulls went on the offensive on Monday, but the subsequent rejection at the same level pushed BTC south to $114,400. However, bitcoin recovered again and headed north to just over $117,200 earlier today, which became a four-week peak. Although it has slipped slightly since then, it’s still in the green on a daily scale. More volatility is expected later today when the US Federal Reserve will announce whether it will indeed lower the interest rates as many anticipate. For now, though, BTC’s market cap sits at just over $2.325 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is up to 56.2%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BNB New Peak Most larger-cap alts have remained at essentially the same price levels as yesterday, including ETH, XRP, SOL, ADA, DOGE, TRX, and SUI. In contrast, BNB topped $960 earlier today to mark a new all-time high. HYPE also neared its own record but now trades at $55. LINK, AVAX, XLM, and HBAR are slightly in the red on a daily scale. MYX has skyrocketed the most from the larger-cap alts, gaining over 50% in a day to trade above $16. IP and SKY are far behind with 6% and 5%, respectively. The total crypto market cap has risen to $4.140 trillion on CG, gaining more than $140 billion in the past several days. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Ethereum e altcoin registrano un aumento del volume dei futures In un post su X , l’analista della community CryptoQuant, Maartunn , ha discusso dell’ultima tendenza nel volume dei futures di Ethereum e delle altcoin.Con “volume dei futures” si intende la quantità di trading legata ai contratti derivati sulle principali piattaforme di scambio. Il grafico condiviso da Maartunn mostra come negli ultimi anni il dominanza del volume dei futures di ETH e delle altcoin abbia subito variazioni: Negli ultimi giorni, il volume dei futures delle altcoin ha registrato un forte aumento, indicando un rinnovato interesse speculativo verso queste monete. Ethereum, pur non avendo raggiunto i picchi passati, ha comunque registrato un leggero incremento contemporaneo alla crescita delle altcoin. Combinati, ETH e le altcoin ora rappresentano circa l’85,2% del volume totale dei futures crypto, lasciando Bitcoin sotto il 15% di dominanza. Storicamente, periodi simili sono stati un cattivo segnale non solo per BTC, ma per l’intero mercato, come evidenziato dai grafici dei massimi di prezzo della fine del 2024 e dell’estate 2025. Questo suggerisce che, considerando il predominio di Ethereum e altcoin nei futures, Bitcoin e altri asset potrebbero affrontare maggiore volatilità nei prossimi giorni. Attività di sviluppo dei progetti crypto In altre notizie, la società di analisi on-chain Santiment ha condiviso su X un aggiornamento sull’ attività di sviluppo dei vari progetti crypto.Questo indicatore misura quanto lavoro stanno facendo gli sviluppatori sui repository pubblici GitHub dei progetti.

Sales dropped 6% year-over-year in the two months leading up to the global launch of the iPhone 17, according to data from Counterpoint Research. That dip hit harder than what the company usually sees before a new model drops. The pullback happened in July and August, weeks before Apple’s new lineup is set to go live this Friday, September 19. And it wasn’t just Apple. Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Vivo, and Honor also had slower numbers, which dragged the entire market down 2% in the same period, despite government-backed incentives meant to push more people to buy. China matters to Apple more than anywhere outside the U.S., and the latest numbers show it’s becoming a tougher place to win. CEO Tim Cook told investors during Apple’s latest earnings call that the company saw a short-term sales recovery in China during the June quarter, helped by subsidies. But even with that bounce, Apple still landed in sixth place over the summer, owning just 12% of the market. Chinese rivals were ahead: Xiaomi, Oppo, and Huawei each grabbed 16%, while Vivo led with 19%. Xiaomi fast-tracks its release after Apple’s announcement To stay competitive, Xiaomi pushed up its next flagship launch to this month. Lei Jun, the company’s co-founder and CEO, said he wants Xiaomi phones to be judged next to Apple’s top-tier devices. The iPhone 17 lineup is Apple’s biggest hardware shake-up in years, with four different models rolling out: the regular iPhone 17, the thinner Air, the higher-end Pro, and the super-sized Pro Max. Every single one of them runs on Apple’s updated in-house chips, has better cameras, and comes wrapped in tougher glass. Preorders started September 12. The company also tweaked its pricing. Most models kept last year’s pricing, but the iPhone 17 Pro now starts at $1,099, which is $100 higher than before. That version now ships with 256GB of storage, matching the price of last year’s 256GB iPhone 16 Pro. The global release date for all four models is September 19. On that same day, Bloomberg reporters got hands-on time with the new devices during Apple’s media event, which also showed off the newest AirPods Pro and updated Apple Watch models. Those first impressions focused on the hardware upgrades, especially the new body build and camera system, but didn’t mention much about software features. Apple’s AI suite missing in China but buyers don’t care yet One major gap still looms large. Apple hasn’t rolled out its Apple Intelligence features in China yet. But so far, that hasn’t seemed to affect how people are buying phones. Analysts from Counterpoint say Chinese consumers are still looking at basics like battery life, storage, and value for money. None of the major brands are seeing AI features drive sales. That means Apple’s lack of AI in China isn’t hurting … yet. Even so, the broader Chinese smartphone market is still weak. Counterpoint expects sales across the country to drop slightly for the full third quarter. There’s no major change happening this year, and no signs that a single product, iPhone or otherwise, is going to turn that around. Cook told investors that Apple’s customer base in Greater China hit a record in the last quarter. He said, “If you look at the other products, Mac, iPad, and Watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China mainland were new to the product.” So Apple’s still pulling in first-time buyers for its other devices, even if the iPhone is losing ground. The problem is, Chinese phone makers aren’t sitting still. They’re speeding up launches, matching specs, cutting prices, and competing more aggressively than ever. Apple is still chasing the lead in a market where value sells more than hype, and features matter more than branding. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After a 1.23% gain yesterday, Bitcoin is now challenging the $117K resistance, which caused a 9% fall in August. There’s a high likelihood $BTC blasts past this resistance, seeing as it made a healthy retest on September 15. This is a strong sign the token wants to sustain its move. Even better, Bitcoin’s September rally is coming right from the 61.8% Fibonacci level – drawn on the weekly chart from the June low ($98,242) to the August high ($124,501). This is a picture-perfect technical pattern, suggesting BTC’s August downtrend was nothing more than a healthy pullback. Looking forward, we can expect Bitcoin to continue trading higher, till at least the Fib high of $124,501, which also happens to be Bitcoin’s all-time high.

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is reportedly planning to ease some of its rules for cryptocurrency companies, signaling a more adaptable approach to UK crypto regulation . This move aims to foster innovation within the burgeoning crypto sector while still upholding essential financial stability and consumer protection. What’s Changing in UK Crypto Regulation? According to reports from the Financial Times, the FCA’s proposal suggests a more tailored regulatory environment for crypto firms. This isn’t a complete deregulation but rather a strategic adjustment, recognizing the unique operational models of digital asset companies compared to traditional financial institutions. Less Stringent Oversight: Crypto firms might face less rigorous requirements than banks or established investment platforms, particularly concerning senior management responsibilities and internal systems and controls. Targeted Approach: This differentiation acknowledges that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach might stifle growth in a rapidly evolving sector like cryptocurrency. Balancing Act: The goal is to strike a balance, allowing crypto businesses more operational flexibility without compromising core regulatory objectives. Why is the FCA Adjusting its Stance on UK Crypto Regulation? The decision to revisit existing rules stems from a broader governmental push to establish the UK as a global hub for crypto and blockchain innovation. By creating a more accommodating regulatory framework, the FCA hopes to attract leading crypto firms and talent, encouraging investment and job creation within the country. This strategic shift in UK crypto regulation is a testament to the growing recognition of digital assets’ potential. It reflects an understanding that an overly restrictive environment can push innovation offshore, leading to a loss of economic opportunity. Where Will Stricter Rules Still Apply? While some areas may see a loosening of controls, it is crucial to understand that the FCA is not abandoning its commitment to security and market integrity. In fact, certain critical areas will face even stricter oversight to protect consumers and the financial system. Cybersecurity Measures: Expect heightened regulations concerning cyberattacks and data security. As digital assets are prime targets for malicious actors, robust defenses are paramount. Consumer Protection: The FCA will likely maintain or enhance rules designed to safeguard retail investors from fraud, market manipulation, and misleading promotions. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): These areas are consistently high priorities for regulators globally, and the UK will continue to enforce stringent measures to prevent illicit financial activities. The proposed framework for UK crypto regulation seeks to differentiate between the risks associated with operational management and those related to market integrity and cyber threats. What Does This Mean for Crypto Firms in the UK? For cryptocurrency companies operating or looking to establish themselves in the UK, these proposed changes could be a significant boon. They signal a more welcoming environment and potentially reduced compliance burdens in specific administrative areas. However, it also means a clear expectation of excellence in critical security and compliance domains. Firms should view this as an opportunity to engage constructively with the regulator, understand the nuances of the new rules, and demonstrate their commitment to responsible innovation. Adapting quickly to evolving UK crypto regulation will be key to success. The Future of UK Crypto Regulation: A Balancing Act This planned easing of rules represents a thoughtful evolution in the UK’s approach to digital assets. It moves away from a broad, often ill-fitting application of traditional financial regulations towards a more bespoke framework. The aim is to create a regulatory landscape that is both progressive and secure, positioning the UK as a leader in the global crypto space. The journey towards optimal UK crypto regulation is ongoing, but these developments indicate a positive direction. It’s a clear signal that the UK intends to be at the forefront of the digital finance revolution, fostering an environment where innovation can thrive responsibly. In summary, the FCA’s proposed adjustments to UK crypto regulation are a nuanced and strategic move. They promise a more flexible operating environment for crypto firms in some aspects, while simultaneously reinforcing robust safeguards in critical areas like cybersecurity. This forward-thinking approach aims to cement the UK’s position as a hub for digital asset innovation, benefiting both businesses and the broader economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the FCA’s proposed changes to UK crypto regulation? The main goal is to balance fostering innovation within the UK’s cryptocurrency sector with maintaining robust financial stability and consumer protection. It aims to create a more tailored regulatory environment for crypto firms. Q2: How will these changes make rules less stringent for crypto firms? Under the proposal, crypto firms may face less stringent rules than traditional banks or investment platforms regarding senior managers, systems, and controls, recognizing their unique operational models. Q3: In which areas will UK crypto regulation become stricter? Stricter regulations are anticipated in critical areas such as cybersecurity measures to combat cyberattacks and robust controls for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) to protect market integrity. Q4: Why is the UK government encouraging these regulatory changes? The UK government aims to establish the country as a global hub for crypto and blockchain innovation. By creating a more accommodating regulatory framework, it seeks to attract leading crypto firms, investment, and talent. Q5: When are these changes to UK crypto regulation expected to take effect?

51868397,583112,1758103221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51868397.jpeg,Is XRP Becoming A Privacy Coin? Ripple’s New Proposal Says Yes—And No,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-privacy-coin-ripple-new-proposal-yes-no/,"Ripple’s developer arm has floated a blueprint to bring privacy-coin-like functionality to the XRP Ledger—without abandoning the network’s long-standing emphasis on public supply integrity and compliance tooling. In a new XRP Ledger Standards (XRPLF) discussion opened on September 13, Ripple engineers Murat Cenk and Aanchal Malhotra propose “Confidential Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs),” an amendment that would encrypt balances and transfer amounts using EC-ElGamal and zero-knowledge proofs, while preserving the accounting semantics of XRPL’s existing MPT framework. RippleX subsequently highlighted the proposal on X, drawing mainstream attention to what could be the most consequential privacy addition yet considered for XRPL. Is XRP Becoming A Privacy Coin? At its core, the draft introduces confidentiality at the token layer without obscuring aggregate supply. Confidential MPTs provide confidential transfers and balances using EC-ElGamal encryption and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), while preserving XLS-33 semantics,” the authors write. Crucially, they stress that “Public auditability” remains intact because issuance limits continue to be enforced by the network’s existing invariant—OutstandingAmount never exceeding MaxAmount—so validators can verify that no new tokens are silently minted even if individual balances are encrypted. The design leans on a practical architectural compromise. Instead of redefining supply math for a private system, issuers would maintain a designated “second account” that the ledger treats like any other holder. Public supply metrics, including OutstandingAmount, then account for both public and confidential balances, with a new ConfidentialOutstandingAmount field tracking the private portion. This lets validators enforce the same XLS-33 rule set they already understand, while transactions themselves rely on equality proofs and range proofs to ensure spends are valid without revealing amounts. The proposal is explicit about the “twist” that differentiates it from pure privacy chains such as Monero or Zcash : selective disclosure and issuer controls are built in. The spec outlines two auditor models—an on-chain, trust-minimized approach that supports pre-defined auditors and later additions via re-encryption, and a simpler issuer-controlled “view key” option. It also proposes issuer-only freeze and clawback capabilities over confidential balances, framed as compliance tools rather than discretionary surveillance. In the authors’ words, the system enables “flexible auditability” while keeping private balances “encrypted under the holder’s key,” with optional auditor copies of the same ciphertext verifiably bound via ZK equality proofs. To make the flow reliable at scale, the draft adopts a split-balance model that separates a holder’s encrypted funds into a spendable “Spending” balance and an “Inbox” for new incoming transfers. A lightweight merge operation prevents “stale proof” failures that can occur when a new receipt lands while a user is preparing a proof for an outgoing transfer. That operational detail, commonplace in high-throughput confidential systems, suggests the authors are mindful of UX and wallet-developer realities, not just cryptographic elegance. If advanced, the change would arrive as an XRPL amendment and need to clear the ledger’s formal governance hurdle: more than 80% validator approval sustained for two weeks before activation on mainnet. Nothing in the discussion implies a live vote yet; the status is “Discussion,” and any production path would first require code landing in a stable server release. Context matters here. The multi-purpose token standard (XLS-33, “MPT”) already equips XRPL with a more compact, compliance-aware fungible token primitive than legacy trustlines, including allow-lists, freeze and clawback, and on-chain metadata. Confidential MPTs don’t replace that model; they extend it. The ledger would continue to expose supply caps and enforce invariants even as per-account balances become opaque, aiming squarely at institutional tokenization where privacy, auditability, and policy controls must coexist. Technically—and politically—the framing invites the obvious question in the headline. Is XRP becoming a privacy coin? The honest answer is ambivalent by design. On one hand, balances and amounts would be encrypted end-to-end, with ZKPs securing the flow—indistinguishable at a glance from what privacy coins promise. On the other hand, the draft hardwires audit channels and issuer recourse that privacy-maximalist communities typically reject, and it preserves validator-enforced supply checks that make “stealth inflation” mathematically impossible. That is the “Yes—and No” in a nutshell.

SOL Can Pump 10% But Institutes Are Rotating To an Altcoin Already 3.5x Up,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-to-buy-today-for-short-term-sol-can-pump-10/,"When traders check crypto charts or ask what is going on with crypto today, many are eyeing SOL for a potential 10% swing. That’s attractive for day traders chasing momentum. But institutions—who tend to think beyond short-term fluctuations—are shifting their attention toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This presale altcoin has already delivered a 3.5x return to early buyers before even listing, showing the kind of acceleration that SOL’s modest pump cannot compete with. For serious investors, the real question is not about chasing 10% gains, but about entering into a platform designed with structural safeguards and long-term capital flow in mind. Why Institutions Are Choosing MUTM Over SOL’s Small Swings Consider the numbers: a $20,000 investment during Phase 2 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.015 secured 1.33 million tokens. Today, in Phase 6, with the presale price at $0.035, that same allocation is worth $46,600. That’s 3.5x returns before launch—returns far beyond the 10% SOL swing traders are watching. The presale itself has momentum, with $15.85 million already raised, 40% of the supply sold, and over 16,350 holders. With Phase 7 approaching, the price will climb to $0.040, a 15% increase from today’s level. Institutions are not waiting for that shift—they are positioning now. Their reasoning is simple: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not only offering high returns in the presale, it is also structured with features that directly appeal to institutional risk frameworks. The platform introduces deposit and borrow caps alongside restricted collateral lists, which means lending operations will remain within controlled limits. Institutions value these guardrails because they reduce exposure to sudden liquidity crunches and ensure that only vetted assets, such as leading cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, are accepted as collateral. This prevents low-quality or volatile assets from destabilizing the system, creating the kind of risk-controlled environment that funds demand. Another innovation that strengthens Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal is Enhanced Collateral Efficiency. Traditional DeFi protocols often lock excess collateral that sits idle, reducing capital efficiency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will change that by allowing borrowers to unlock greater borrowing power relative to the value of their collateral. For institutions, this means being able to deploy larger positions without requiring disproportionate amounts of locked-up capital. The result is a more active borrowing market, more lending activity, and higher overall protocol usage—all of which generate recurring revenue streams for the platform and boost demand for MUTM tokens. Complementing this is the utilization-based interest model, which dynamically adjusts rates depending on how much liquidity is being used. When liquidity is abundant, borrowing rates will be lower, encouraging borrowers to take on loans. When liquidity becomes scarce, rates increase, incentivizing lenders to supply more capital. This feedback loop ensures balance in the system, preventing scenarios where either side of the market is neglected. For institutions, this adaptability is crucial because it guarantees market stability even during volatile times. Rather than being locked into rigid rate structures, they will operate in an ecosystem that naturally regulates itself to attract and maintain liquidity. Beta Launch and Layer-2 Efficiency: Why Timing Matters Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not waiting until long after listing to roll out features. A beta version will already be live at token launch, allowing users to test lending and stablecoin functions from day one. This readiness makes the token even more attractive to institutions, who want to see practical use cases in action before committing large sums. Unlike other presales that raise funds first and build later, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will present a working foundation immediately, accelerating adoption. Layer-2 integration is another key factor in this early adoption story. Operating on Layer-2 ensures faster transactions and lower costs than traditional Layer-1 blockchains, an essential feature for funds managing large-scale activity. Reduced transaction fees and near-instant execution provide an edge in efficiency that will appeal both to institutions and to retail investors seeking smoother experiences. In contrast, while SOL’s 10% swing is drawing short-term excitement, it does not offer the structural growth opportunities that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already providing. SOL is a mature asset with steady movements, while MUTM is a rising token combining safety mechanisms, efficiency upgrades, and adoption-ready features. That combination explains why institutions are rotating early into MUTM, while retail traders still have a narrowing window at $0.035 before Phase 7 pushes the price higher. The choice for short-term investors is becoming clear. SOL may deliver its 10%, but the real gains are already unfolding in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale. With 3.5x growth locked in for early buyers and institutional rotation underway, retail investors only have days to align with the same opportunity before the price climbs again. In a market that often punishes hesitation, this is the moment to act decisively.

According to a report from Bloomberg , federal prosecutors are discussing ending the requirement for Binance to maintain an outside compliance monitor, which has a three-year duration under the original 2023 agreement. BINANCE CLOSE TO AGREEMENT TO AVOID DOJ COMPLIANCE MONITOR — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) September 16, 2025 DOJ Reviews Monitor Program as Corporate Costs Mount The reported ongoing negotiation is the latest softening in DOJ’s approach to independent oversight under the Trump administration, which, according to the report already ended monitors for three companies appointed during the Biden era. Binance would likely adopt enhanced compliance reporting requirements before the DOJ signs off on eliminating the monitor requirement. The Justice Department has been conducting an internal review of corporate monitor usage after companies complained that the oversight is onerous and expensive. Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ’s Criminal Division, noted in the report that while monitors reduce repeat offenses, they “ can also impose substantial expense and interfere with lawful business operations. “ Binance was initially saddled with two corporate monitors after pleading guilty and reaching separate settlements with both the DOJ and the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The FinCEN monitor remains in place while discussions focus on the DOJ oversight requirement. Trump Administration Scales Back Corporate Monitor Program Amid Industry Pressure According to Bloomberg, the DOJ has already terminated independent oversight for three companies that agreed to monitors under Biden administration settlements, including two Glencore units that accumulated $142 million in combined costs during 2023 and 2024. NatWest Group and navy shipbuilder Austal USA agreed to enhanced compliance reporting as alternatives to continued monitoring. The review happened as concerns raised by corporations about the financial burden and operational interference caused by independent monitors. Meanwhile, some monitors remain in place despite the review. Toronto-Dominion Bank’s U.S. subsidiary retained its monitor after becoming the first U.S. bank to plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy charges. Balfour Beatty Communities extended its monitorship until June 2026 after pleading guilty to defrauding the U.S. military. Particularly, the report highlighted the Boeing case controversies surrounding the monitor selection criteria. The Justice Department backtracked on imposing an independent monitor that included diversity and inclusion requirements, instead allowing Boeing to retain a compliance consultant rather than a certified monitor. Binance’s settlement negotiations occur amid broader crypto industry influence within the Trump administration. The sector donated heavily to Trump’s campaign . It supported crypto-friendly legislators, while the new administration appointed crypto-supportive agency heads and issued executive orders expanding banking access for digital asset companies. The cryptocurrency industry has donated over $26 million to @realDonaldTrump this year, according to newly released campaign finance filings. #Trump #Crypto https://t.co/mANxOneHxh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 2, 2025 From $4.3 Billion Fine to Potential Freedom Through Political Transformation The monitoring requirement stems from Binance’s November 2023 guilty plea to criminal charges, including Bank Secrecy Act violations, failing to register as a money transmitting business, and violating sanctions laws. The settlement required founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao to step down as CEO and serve four months in prison while paying a personal $50 million fine. The DOJ investigation revealed Binance failed to prevent transactions involving Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Al Qaeda, ISIS, money launderers, and ransomware attackers. The regulators insist that virtual currency exchanges must “ play by the rules ” to access the U.S. financial system. Ever since then, Binance has launched Binance.US to be compliant with the US regulations. Zhao’s legal troubles continued through multiple class action lawsuits alleging money laundering facilitation , with cases eventually transferred to the Florida federal court under the first-to-file rule. Despite the legal challenges, Zhao confirmed in May 2025 that he formally applied for a presidential pardon , citing Trump’s previous pardons of BitMEX executives. @cz_binance , the founder and former CEO of @Binance , has confirmed that he has formally applied for a presidential pardon. #Binance #CZ https://t.co/9owHRhfIhU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 Binance’s compliance efforts included assisting international law enforcement, notably helping India’s Enforcement Directorate dismantle a $47.6 million gaming scam through its Financial Intelligence Unit. Looking forward, if a deal is struck, the potential end of DOJ monitoring would be a significant milestone in Binance’s rehabilitation following one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history. However, the Treasury Department’s FinCEN monitor remains active, and final DOJ approval depends on satisfactory enhanced reporting arrangements that maintain regulatory oversight while reducing operational burden.

Currently, its price is rallying above $250 and attracting strong institutional interest. Analysts are now asking if the SOL price prediction for 2026 could realistically point toward $1,000. But while Solana enjoys market momentum, new PayFi projects like Remittix (RTX) are catching attention, offering real-world adoption that could rival traditional payment tokens and reshape the next crypto bull run. Solana Price Breaches $250 With Renewed Market Confidence Solana is back in the headlines after reclaiming $250 on Sept. 14, its highest level in nearly eight months. The surge lifted market capitalization above $133 billion, sparking optimism across Solana News circles. The SOL price today has eased to around $243. However, analysts are positive about the market, citing technical arrangements that indicate growth in the future. Targets now range from $300 to $460, with some seeing $1,000 in play by 2026. A big driver of confidence has been institutional buying. Galaxy Digital recently added 325,000 SOL in just hours, bringing its three-day total to nearly 5 million tokens. This aggressive accumulation signals long-term conviction in Solana’s network strength. At the same time, chatter about a potential Solana ETF is adding momentum to the Solana price prediction. Solana price climbing to $1,000 by 2026 will grossly depend on sustaining this momentum while holding key support levels. Remittix Positions Itself As The Next Global Payment Leader While traders debate whether the SOL price prediction could take Solana toward $1,000 by 2026, Remittix is proving that adoption-driven projects are where confidence lies today.

The world of decentralized finance and Web3 is constantly evolving, and projects like The Graph are at its core. If you’ve been wondering about The Graph price prediction for the coming years, you’ve come to the right place. We’ll dive deep into what makes GRT unique, analyze its past performance, and explore the factors that could shape its value from 2025 through 2030. Get ready to uncover the possibilities! What is The Graph (GRT) and Why Does it Matter for Web3 Data? Before we jump into price predictions, let’s clarify what The Graph is. Imagine the internet without search engines. Finding information would be nearly impossible. In the decentralized world of Web3, a similar challenge exists: how do you efficiently query and access data from blockchains? That’s where The Graph steps in. It’s a decentralized indexing protocol designed to make blockchain data accessible. Think of it as the Google for blockchains. Developers can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, to make blockchain data easily queryable. This is crucial for dApps (decentralized applications) that need to retrieve data quickly and reliably to function. Without The Graph, dApps would have to process vast amounts of raw blockchain data themselves, which is slow, expensive, and impractical. Key Benefits of The Graph: Efficient Data Access: Simplifies querying complex blockchain data for developers. Decentralization: Operates on a decentralized network, ensuring censorship resistance and reliability. Interoperability: Supports indexing data from various blockchains, enhancing the Web3 ecosystem. Developer Empowerment: Provides tools for creating powerful dApps that rely on organized, accessible data.

The judgment follows a three-day bench trial where the court found the couple committed securities fraud by selling worthless tokens between June 2022 and April 2023. ‘False Prophets’ Weaponize Faith for Multi-Million Dollar Crypto Fraud Colorado Securities Commissioner Tung Chan called the Regalados “ 21st century false prophets who leveraged promising cryptocurrency technology to run an old-fashioned scam, victimizing their own congregants. ” The case gained international attention when Eli Regalado admitted in a viral YouTube video to using investor funds for personal expenses, including a “home remodel the Lord told us to do.” The Denver couple raised $3.4 million from more than 300 individuals despite having zero crypto experience and receiving a security audit score of 0 out of 10. They promised INDXcoin would trade on their Kingdom Wealth Exchange, which collapsed after one day of operation. The Regalados used investor money for luxury purchases, including jewelry, designer clothes, and a Range Rover. A Denver grand jury separately indicted both defendants on 40 criminal counts in July , adding to a growing pattern of faith-based crypto fraud targeting religious communities across the United States.

Back in August, federal courts awarded the CFTC $228.6 million against Eddy Alexandre , who exploited his church position and Haitian community standing to defraud over 25,000 investors of $262 million through his EminiFX scheme. Alexandre marketed EminiFX as an “investment club” promising 5% to 9.99% weekly returns through non-existent “robo-assisted advisor” technology. He enlisted congregation members to recruit additional investors, leveraging sacred relationships to expand the fraudulent operation across ethnic and religious communities. Court documents revealed Alexandre diverted at least $15 million in investor funds to personal accounts, purchasing luxury cars, including a BMW, while his trading platform lost money during 24 of its 30 weeks of operation. The fake technology claims centered on proprietary algorithms that never existed throughout the scheme’s eight-month duration. CFTC wins $228M judgment against pastor who ran crypto Ponzi promising 5-10% weekly returns, defrauding 25,000 investors. #Ponzi #Crypto https://t.co/2eLsOeMuMg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 20, 2025 Washington state witnessed similar exploitation when former Spanish-speaking church pastor Francier Obando Pinillo allegedly orchestrated a multiyear fraud, raising $5.9 million from over 1,500 investors. December last year, the CFTC alleges Pinillo promised up to 34.9% monthly profits through his “Solanofi” platform using proprietary trading bots he described as “risk-free.” Pinillo added multi-level marketing elements, offering 15% referral fees to customers who recruited friends and family. He provided fake online dashboards allowing investors to track supposed profits while operating a classic Ponzi scheme using later investor funds to pay earlier participants. Crypto Fraud Epidemic Religious Communities Through Social Engineering Colorado has emerged as a significant battleground against crypto fraud, with state investigators documenting a large number of crypto-related scams resulting in losses exceeding $81 million as of last year. Recent incidents include sophisticated law enforcement impersonation scams where fraudsters convinced victims to send Bitcoin under threats of arrest warrants. A Keystone resident lost over $6,000 in Bitcoin after scammers posed as deputies threatening arrest for missing jury duty, while a Denver woman lost nearly $5,000 following similar tactics. Scammers increasingly use caller ID spoofing to appear as official law enforcement agencies, as seen recently in a $2.8M UK theft case . These scammers exploit the irreversible nature of crypto transactions, which makes fund recovery nearly impossible. Bank staff have prevented additional losses by stopping residents from transferring thousands in crypto after receiving suspicious calls. Since last year, the FBI Denver office has issued public warnings highlighting cases where fraudsters specifically targeted religious communities, noting the aggressive and persuasive tactics employed by cryptocurrency scammers. In fact, during this first half of this year alone, crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and breaches, with phishing attacks accounting for $410 million across 132 incidents.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase is urging the DOJ to block state crypto laws that conflict with federal policy. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal says inconsistent state rules are harming innovation and legal clarity. The exchange points to Oregon’s lawsuit as a key example and backs federal legislation for uniform regulation. In a formal letter , the exchange asked federal authorities to preempt state laws it says are stifling innovation and hurting consumers. Coinbase CLO Slams State-Level Crypto Patchwork Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal criticized what he described as a confusing patchwork of state-level crypto rules, accusing states of relying on broad and inconsistent interpretations of securities law. He pointed to Oregon’s ongoing lawsuit against Coinbase as a prime example of the problem. “When Oregon can sue us for services that are legal under federal law, something’s broken,” Grewal said on social media, arguing that the current regulatory setup hampers progress and adds legal risk for businesses. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed suit against Coinbase in April, accusing the exchange of promoting unregistered securities in the state. This came just two months after the SEC dropped its own case against the company, which had alleged that Coinbase operated as an unregistered broker and exchange.

Coinbase is pushing back. In June, the company escalated the Oregon case to federal court and filed a separate lawsuit in July targeting Governor Tina Kotek, challenging the state’s authority in the matter. In its letter, Coinbase called on the DOJ to support federal legislation that would override conflicting state rules. Grewal cited pending bills like the CLARITY Act and the Responsible Financial Innovation Act as possible solutions that could deliver long-awaited clarity for the crypto industry. Coinbase Struggles to Stay Ahead of the Race As reported, Coinbase is racing to stay ahead of a wave of new competitors as it pivots from being a pure crypto exchange to a broader financial services platform. Founded in 2012, Coinbase entered the S&P 500 this year and now boasts a market cap of $83 billion. Its shares have surged 70% since Donald Trump’s election, thanks in part to his administration’s crypto-friendly stance. However, second-quarter earnings disappointed , and the stock dropped 15%, signaling investor caution. A growing concern is the company’s exposure to the price of Bitcoin. Trading fees, still the core of Coinbase’s revenue, rise and fall with crypto market volatility. Fee compression and competition from Asian exchanges are also eating into its margins. Coinbase has secured its position as custodian for eight of the top 11 US Bitcoin ETFs, earning $43 million in the last quarter of 2024 from that alone. However, new legislation could open the door for traditional custodians like State Street and BNY Mellon to enter the market , threatening Coinbase’s dominance. The firm is also eyeing tokenized stock trading and small business banking services, while leaning heavily into stablecoins and staking. Revenues from its USDC stablecoin partnership with Circle now trail only trading, while staking offers high-margin returns and defensibility. In its boldest move yet, Coinbase acquired crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion , signaling its intention to dominate that space. The company has also partnered with banks like JPMorgan and PNC to bridge crypto and traditional finance.

Related News: The US Department of Commerce Announces: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and 7 Altcoin Networks Selected for Economic Data As institutional interest in Chainlink continues to grow, news of another partnership has arrived. According to the official announcement, Saudi Arabia's Awwal Bank has partnered with Chainlink. Awwal Bank, a major Saudi Arabian bank with over $100 billion in assets under management, announced that it will use Chainlink services to deploy on-chain applications within the country. This partnership will allow Awwal Bank developers to utilize Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interaction Protocol (CCIP) and runtime environment for their development work. The partnership aims to integrate Chainlink's oracle technology into Awwal Bank's systems to enable real-time data verification and secure smart contract execution. This move is expected to increase transparency, reduce fraud, and streamline the bank's back-office operations. With this partnership, Awwal Bank stated that Chainlink could set an example for other financial institutions in the region and further increase the demand for the LINK token. LINK, which has gained nearly 120% since the beginning of the year, continues to trade at $23.3 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) released the latest inflation figures on Wednesday. The data matched analysts’ forecasts and strengthened expectations that the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will keep rates at 4% on Thursday. ONS shows food and fuel costs rise while airfares fall Price pressure in the grocery sector is still the same, with the inflation rate for food rising from 4.9% to 5.1% in August. Shopping trips have become more expensive for consumers as basic items like vegetables, cheese, fish, beef, butter, and coffee all increased during the month. However, the biggest changes have affected sweets and chocolates as the cost rose by 10.5%. These increasing costs across food categories prove that controlling inflation is difficult. At the same time, the transport cost for households and businesses also suffered a major hit as both petrol and diesel prices increased. Hotels and restaurant prices also increased, but the ONS said the rise was less sharp than last year. On the other hand, airfares dropped sharply in August, preventing overall inflation from rising above 3.8%. Although households remain under pressure, there are early signs of cooling in some parts of the economy as services inflation dropped from 5% in July to 4.7% in August. Core inflation (excluding volatile components like energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco) also dropped from 3.8% to 3.6%. The declines show that some elements of inflation are starting to cool down, but the core sectors like food and fuel continue to weigh heavily on families and businesses. Bank of England weighs rates as economy and politics add pressure The Bank of England has lowered borrowing costs five times since the summer of 2024, and the interest rate is now 4%. Financial markets expect the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to pause any further rate cuts in September because the overall inflation rate remains almost double the bank’s target of 2%. The UK economy is also growing slowly, with the GDP rising by just 0.2% in three months to July after a stronger 0.7% expansion in the first quarter. Businesses are also struggling with high energy costs and restrictions from the U.S. trade tariffs that continue to affect imports and exports. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces intense scrutiny as she prepares the November budget. She said that families are struggling and promised to help reduce the financial pressure. However, businesses warn that companies could be forced to cut jobs or raise prices because insurers plan to increase employer national insurance contributions by £25 billion. Internationally, the UK remains high compared to other big economies like Germany, whose inflation was 2.1% in August, France with just 0.8%, and the eurozone overall reading at 2.1%. Inflation in the U.S. rose to 2.9% , which is still lower than the UK’s level, proving that the country is experiencing strong price pressures relative to its peers. Furthermore, UK consumers have been said to have become more positive about household budgets this year than in the past few years. And it was largely because the individuals viewed the Bank of England’s interest rate cuts favorably. This announcement came after GfK’s index, popularly known as the GfK Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers’ perception regarding their household finances, expressed a notable increase of 3 points from last month’s surge to 5.

DeepSeek Ranks the Best Altcoins to Buy Right Now,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-supercycle-2025-best-altcoins-to-buy-now-deepseek/,"The TOTAL chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of the entire crypto space, looks extremely bullish right now. It recently hit a new all-time high, after which it made a healthy pullback to the 10 EMA (Exponential Moving Average). It’s now just 4% shy of a new ATH . The best part? The current weekly candlestick is turning out to be an inside candle – a popular trading pattern that often signals a big move is coming once price breaks out. And the stars couldn’t be better aligned. After all, the FOMC meeting is set to take place in a few hours, and there’s a nearly 100% chance the Fed will slash rates . To help you find the best altcoins to buy now , we turned to DeepSeek. As the newest mainstream AI chatbot, DeepSeek is equipped with cutting-edge analytical and narrative-building skills. It can crawl through real-time online chatter, price movements, and important updates – like rate cut announcements – to identify the best cryptos to buy now . Here are the AI’s top 3 suggestions for Q4 2025. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Brand-New Bitcoin L2 for Speed, Scalability & Web3 Support Bitcoin’s market dominance is simply insane. It’s to the point where it’s become synonymous to ‘crypto’ in general. That said, what if it could be even better? Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . It’s a new cryptocurrency project that aims to crank up Bitcoin’s real-world utility by supercharging it with lightning-fast speeds, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 compatibility. As of now, the Bitcoin blockchain is pretty ‘meh.’ It’s sluggish and doesn’t support dApps. $HYPER’s brand-new Layer 2 solution, though, will integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). This means $HYPER can execute thousands of transactions at once, improving the age-old network’s efficiency. Even better, it lets developers build smart contracts and dApps on Bitcoin. Say hello to Bitcoin-based DeFi trading, NFTs, lending, staking, DAOs, and gaming dApps. The best part? All these can be built without sacrificing Bitcoin’s top-notch security. To let you actually interact with this SVM-run Web3 environment, $HYPER converts your Layer 1 Bitcoin into ‘wrapped’ Layer 2-compatible tokens. This is done via a non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge, which locks your L1 tokens and then mints an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens on Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2. Currently in presale, $HYPER has already raised a whopping $16.4M from early investors. Interested? Check out our detailed guide on how to buy $HYPER . Each token is priced at just $0.012935. Plus, according to our $HYPER price prediction , the token could hit $0.32 by year-end – a massive 2,380% ROI. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to learn more about how the Canonical Bridge works. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Dogecoin-Themed Meme Coin Gunning for 1000x Gains Maxi Doge ($MAXI) flips the script on traditional animal-themed meme coins, and we’re here for it. Unlike $DOGE, $BONK, or $SHIB, which feature cute-looking dogs, $MAXI’s mascot is a bulked-up and furious Shiba Inu. Why is he angry, though? Because he had to grow up in loneliness, courtesy of his cousin Dogecoin who hogged all the limelight. But like every good-old action hero, Maxi thrived in adversity. He hit the gym, gulped protein shakes, and mastered the art of crypto trading – he even has a green candlestick-based lightsaber. So cool! And this is exactly the kind of raw, degen energy that’s powering its presale. You see, meme coin investors look for a unique edge, which doesn’t necessarily have to be an otherworldly roadmap or utility. It’s also worth noting that $MAXI has reserved a whopping 40% of its total token supply for PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and social media blitzes. All of this is to make the project go viral. Moreover, $MAXI is also eyeing a futures listing. This would make it the best crypto for meme coin traders, who want to put their skills to good use and churn out potentially life-changing gains using 1000x leverage. Maxi Doge’s presale has so far pulled in over $2.25M in early investor funding, with each token available for just $0.0002575. According to our $MAXI price prediction , a $100 investment right now could turn into $930 by the end of 2025. Ready to join the tribe? Here’s our guide on how to buy Maxi Doge . Check out $MAXI’s official website to learn more about how he aims to overthrow Dogecoin. 3. Test ($TST) – Dogecoin-Themed Meme Coin Gunning for 1000x Gains Think of Test ($TST) as the king who never wanted the crown. On paper, it supposed to be exactly what its name suggests: a test/demo/tutorial token. It was created by the BNB Chain team to presumably show how easy it is to deploy tokens on their ‘four.meme’ platform. However, thanks to the market’s curiosity and the absurd mechanics of the meme coin world, $TST became a top trending crypto . It’s up over 70% this week, currently trading around $0.04596. Even better, its weekly candle has broken through the long-term resistance level of $0.05835, though we still have to wait and see where it closes. Still, this puts $TST in a great position to rally higher – at least ~50% from current levels until it hits the next resistance. Interested? Buy $TST on Binance , or any of the other major crypto exchanges it’s available on. Recap : With a full-fledged crypto supercycle on the way, there couldn’t be a better time to buy low-cap altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Test ($TST).

51871844,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=823081,1758108627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51871844.jpeg,"Solana Sees Institutional Accumulation: 413,075 SOL Moved Off Exchanges In Hours",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sees-institutional-accumulation-413075-sol-moved-off-exchanges-in-hours/,"Solana has been in the spotlight after delivering a powerful rally, surging more than 50% since August and climbing to the $248 level. This move has reaffirmed bullish sentiment across the market, with momentum continuing to build around one of the leading altcoins. Analysts are now calling for the possibility of a massive surge in the coming weeks, pointing to both technical strength and increasing institutional participation as key drivers. Related Reading: Whale Unstakes 2M HYPE After 9 Months – $89.8M Profit On The Line Bulls appear firmly in control as Solana consolidates its gains at higher levels, showing resilience even in the face of broader market volatility. Unlike past rallies driven mainly by retail speculation, this surge is being accompanied by institutional accumulation, signaling deeper conviction and long-term positioning by large players. Fresh data from Lookonchain highlights this trend, revealing that another major institution has been buying significant amounts of SOL. These purchases align with the broader narrative that big players are preparing for the next phase of the crypto cycle by loading up on high-conviction assets. Solana Sees Accumulation Ahead of Fed Decision Solana has once again taken the spotlight as fresh data reveals significant institutional activity in the market. According to Lookonchain, over the past eight hours, FalconX—a well-known institutional trading platform—has withdrawn 413,075 SOL, worth approximately $98.4 million, from major exchanges including Binance, OKX, Coinbase, and Bybit. Such large-scale withdrawals are often interpreted as a signal of accumulation, with institutions moving tokens off exchanges for custody, staking, or long-term holding rather than short-term trading. This activity suggests that institutional players are quietly but aggressively positioning themselves in Solana. By removing supply from exchanges, FalconX’s actions could reduce the immediate liquidity available for trading, tightening supply and potentially fueling upward price pressure if demand continues to rise. Historically, moves of this scale have often preceded strong rallies, particularly when they align with broader bullish momentum. Solana, which has already surged over 50% since August, may now be setting the stage for another leg higher if accumulation trends persist. At the same time, macroeconomic factors are converging with this institutional demand. Later today, the Federal Reserve will announce its decision on interest rates, a pivotal event that will influence risk sentiment across global markets. Whether the Fed opts for a modest 25bps cut or a deeper move, the outcome will shape liquidity conditions for months to come. For Solana, the combination of institutional buying and the Fed’s decision creates a high-stakes backdrop that could define its trajectory well into year-end. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Moves Align With Recent Price Reactions: 7,547 BTC Awakens Testing Key Levels After A Rally Solana (SOL) has been in a powerful uptrend since August, gaining more than 50% and reaching a high of $248 before cooling slightly. The daily chart shows SOL now trading at $236, consolidating after the sharp rally. The uptrend remains intact, with the 50-day SMA ($197) and 100-day SMA ($178) trending upward, both acting as solid dynamic support. The 200-day SMA at $161 is far below current levels, confirming the strength of the long-term bullish structure. However, the recent slowdown near $240 suggests that the market is encountering resistance. This level previously acted as a supply zone in late 2024, and bulls will need to push through it decisively to open the door toward a potential retest of $300. A rejection here could trigger a short-term pullback toward $220 or even the $200–$210 area, where the moving averages cluster, offering strong support for continuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risk Index Signals Stability: All Eyes On Fed Decision Institutional accumulation has also been a major catalyst for Solana’s recent surge. Large withdrawals from exchanges highlight ongoing whale positioning, suggesting that demand remains strong despite near-term volatility. If momentum continues and macro conditions—particularly the Fed’s decision on rates—provide a favorable backdrop, SOL could extend its rally toward new highs.

On September 10, the company’s shares jumped 36% in a single session, pushing its year-to-date gain to 84%, as Cryptopolitan extensively reported . Oracle told investors it expects cloud revenue to surge 700% over the next three fiscal years. That one forecast was enough to pull it into the top tier of the S&P 500, ranking seventh overall this year. This sudden price action has dragged Oracle into the middle of a bigger debate on whether artificial intelligence is inflating another tech bubble. Investors are betting on long-term AI bets, and with Oracle playing a central role in TikTok’s cloud infrastructure in the U.S., the political spotlight has only gotten hotter. President Trump’s White House extended the TikTok ban deadline to December 16, allowing negotiations to keep running. That gives Oracle more time in its role as the platform’s main cloud host, a position it’s held for years. Oracle’s future profits raise valuation questions ORCL now trades at 43 times estimated earnings, the highest level since the early 2000s. That puts it above every major tech name in the S&P 500 except one. Nvidia, which is actually pulling in profits today, trades at 31 times forward earnings. The difference? Oracle’s growth is based on what might happen in 2027 and 2028, not what’s showing up in this fiscal year. Michael Bailey, director of research at Fulton Breakefield Broenniman, said, “Investors viewed Oracle as a boring low growth company, and all of a sudden it’s an AI winner. But you’ve got a lot of risk. You’re buying the stock now based on hope that we’re going to see massive growth in year four, five and six.” The problem is, analysts haven’t adjusted their forecasts for this year or the next. That makes the stock look expensive on paper right now. But when you stretch the numbers across three years, the valuation drops to 25 times profits. That’s still way above Oracle’s ten-year average, but at least it’s not nosebleed. Bailey added, “This year is irrelevant, next year is irrelevant, the year after that is more important. If you go out a few years, there’s going to be this massive spike in growth. You’ve got to value that today.” Wall Street stays bullish but flags the risks Oracle’s long game might sound like a moonshot, but it’s not the only one playing it. Tesla and Palantir are both trading at over 180 times forward earnings, even though they’re in very different sectors. And even when stretched over three years, those names still sit around 100 times earnings, making Oracle’s 25x seem mild. But those are edge cases. Even Nvidia , which has been a poster child for the AI wave, is only trading at 24 times expected earnings over three years. And unlike Oracle, Nvidia’s revenue is hitting now — 58% growth this year, 33% next, then 17% in 2027. Oracle’s revenue path is slower: 17% growth this year, 22% in 2027, and a huge 42% jump in 2028, based on Bloomberg analyst estimates . That delayed growth is exactly what’s making people cautious. It’s not about whether Oracle gets the contracts. It’s about whether the end clients, the companies using these AI tools, actually turn that tech into value fast enough. Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital, said, “The issue isn’t Oracle not getting the business, it’s the end customer, will they get the benefit out of it as fast as the market assumes?” He pointed to the dot-com era, when everyone was laying fiber cables but returns were negative. Despite all of that, the analysts aren’t backing off. Out of 47 analysts tracked by Bloomberg, 34 say buy, 13 say hold, and zero have a sell rating on ORCL. Tyler Radke at Citigroup upgraded the stock to buy after its September earnings release, citing a stronger growth path as reason enough to pay a higher valuation. In his note dated September 10, he wrote that Oracle shares “still have upside from here with top/bottom-line growth significantly accelerating in the years ahead.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Business|NVDA|ORCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-17 11:33:31

B Strategy's Nasdaq Move: $1 Billion Target for BNB Treasury In the video shared on the X platform, CZ emphasized that BNB is not only a utility token but also a native currency used on multiple blockchains. CZ stated that BNB is one of the few tokens with widespread use on centralized exchanges (CEX). These include trading fee discounts, yield generation, and the Launchpad, Launchpool, and Alpha platforms. BNB is also accepted as a payment instrument in some countries. Regarding the BNB Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), CZ said he has met with approximately 50 potential DAT teams, but that it's impossible to support every initiative. Zhao stated that he will only support a select few companies with strong long-term potential. Meanwhile, on August 25th, B Strategy announced plans to list its BNB treasury on Nasdaq. The company aims to raise $1 billion with this move. The treasury, whose name has not yet been announced, will be strategically backed by YZi Labs. While these developments strengthened BNB’s position among institutional investors and digital asset treasuries (DAT), they also raised the question of whether a new growth era for BNB is beginning in the crypto markets. *This is not investment advice.

Since Trump returned to the White House, the flow of money into hedged U.S. investments has jumped to levels not seen in four years, according to Deutsche Bank. George Saravelos, head of FX strategy at the bank, said foreign buyers “may have returned to buying U.S. assets, but they don’t want the dollar exposure that goes with it,” adding they’re cutting their dollar positions “at an unprecedented pace.” Investors hedge despite booming U.S. stocks This behavior helps explain why the dollar has stayed weak, even as U.S. stocks continue rising. Wall Street had taken a hit in April when Trump rolled out his so-called “liberation day” tariffs, but the S&P 500 has since rebounded and is now up 12% in dollar terms. Yet, for investors in Europe, that return drops to negative 2% in euro terms, because the dollar itself has sunk more than 10% this year against major currencies. About $7 billion has moved into U.S. equity ETFs owned abroad in the past three months. Deutsche Bank found that 80% of this was hedged, compared to just 20% at the start of the year. Hedging protects investors from currency moves, allowing them to track the performance of the asset alone, although it comes with extra costs. This surge in currency protection is a key factor behind the drop in the dollar , which helped push the euro above $1.18 for the first time in four years. With U.S. interest rates falling, the cost of these hedges has also come down, making it more attractive. Pictet Asset Management’s Arun Sai said his firm increased its dollar hedges on U.S. stocks, expecting the greenback to keep sliding. “It will continue to be the dollar that takes the brunt of eroding institutional credibility,” Arun said. He described the trend as part of a “secular bear market” for the currency. Global funds ramp up hedging as dollar weakens A Bank of America survey in September found 38% of global fund managers planned to increase their hedges against a weakening dollar, compared to just 2% preparing for a stronger one. Meera Chandan, who co-heads global FX strategy at JPMorgan, said the trend wasn’t about dumping U.S. assets altogether. “It’s not a ‘sell America’ moment. It’s a ‘hedge dollar’ moment,” Meera said. She warned that further soft economic data could push the dollar lower and trigger more currency hedging. Bondholders usually hedge more often to smooth out returns. Stock investors, until recently, didn’t bother. But now, investors say the benefits of hedging outweigh the costs. In past years, foreign buying of U.S. stocks had helped lift the dollar itself. This year, that link has broken. Charles-Henry Monchau, CIO at Swiss private bank SYZ Group, said he moved to fully dollar-hedged U.S. stock positions in March. “It was a geopolitical call,” Charles-Henry said, pointing to Trump’s public stance against a strong dollar. “This year, you need to be hedged.” Large pension funds are doing the same. Danish pension managers cut their unhedged dollar holdings by $16 billion in the second quarter, bringing it down to $76 billion. Dutch pension funds also raised their dollar hedges earlier this year. Funds in Australia have taken similar steps. In June, the Bank for International Settlements said currency hedging by investors outside the U.S. played a big role in dragging down the dollar in April and May. BIS researchers said Asian investors were especially active in hedging during that period. Investors usually use currency forwards to hedge. These derivatives allow them to lock in a future exchange rate, and since the cost is tied to interest rate gaps, falling U.S. rates have made them cheaper. Kit Juckes, FX strategist at Société Générale, said investors had long avoided paying high costs to hedge the dollar. But now, “there’s a tipping point that’s quite close,” Kit said. “People ask, ‘why haven’t I done this yet?’” Kamakshya Trivedi, chief FX strategist at Goldman Sachs, said falling hedging costs could encourage more Asian investors to join the wave, which could lead to even further weakness in the dollar.

Binance Wallet has just announced a game-changing development that could redefine how new digital assets are launched. They are introducing a brand-new Binance TGE solution , developed in collaboration with Aspecta’s innovative BuildKey technology. This advancement promises to streamline and enhance the process of token distribution, offering a fresh perspective on engaging with emerging crypto projects. What is the Revolutionary Binance TGE Solution? Traditionally, Token Generation Events (TGEs) involve direct distribution of tokens to participants after a fundraising round. However, the new Binance TGE solution with BuildKey introduces an entirely novel approach. Instead of immediate token allocation, users receive a unique, certificate-like instrument known as a BuildKey. This method aims to create a more dynamic and accessible pre-market environment. It’s a significant shift from the conventional model, offering more flexibility and potential for early engagement before a project’s official token launch. How Does Aspecta’s BuildKey Transform Token Distribution? Aspecta’s BuildKey is at the heart of this innovation. Think of it as a digital voucher that represents an allocation in an upcoming token launch. Here’s how it works: Deposit BNB: Participants acquire BuildKeys by depositing Binance Coin (BNB) through Aspecta’s platform. Certificate-like Instrument: The BuildKey itself is a tradable asset. It’s not the token directly, but a right to receive tokens. Pre-Launch Trading: Crucially, these BuildKeys can be traded on secondary markets even before the actual project token goes live. This provides early liquidity and price discovery. Token Exchange: At the time of the official Token Generation Event, these BuildKeys can then be exchanged for the project’s actual tokens. This system offers a unique opportunity for participants to engage with projects earlier and with greater flexibility. What are the Benefits of this New Binance TGE Solution for Users? This innovative approach brings several compelling advantages for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike. It’s designed to enhance user experience and provide more strategic options. Early Engagement: Gain exposure to promising projects before their official public launch. Flexibility and Liquidity: The ability to trade BuildKeys pre-launch offers participants a chance to manage their exposure and realize value even before the tokens are live. Reduced Risk (Potentially): By allowing pre-launch trading, the market can discover a more natural price point for the allocation, potentially mitigating some initial launch volatility. Transparent Allocation: The certificate-like nature of BuildKeys provides a clear, verifiable record of participation and allocation. This Binance TGE solution is set to make token launches more interactive and user-centric. When Will We See the First Project Utilizing This Technology? The anticipation is building! Binance Wallet has confirmed that the very first project to leverage this groundbreaking Binance TGE solution will be officially announced on September 18 . This upcoming announcement will mark a significant milestone, providing a concrete example of how this new system will operate in practice. Keep an eye on Binance’s official channels for this exciting reveal. It will offer crucial insights into the types of projects that will benefit from this new distribution model and how participants can get involved. Conclusion: A New Era for Token Launches The introduction of Binance Wallet’s new Binance TGE solution with Aspecta’s BuildKey marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of token generation events. By moving beyond traditional methods, this innovative approach promises to deliver greater flexibility, liquidity, and engagement for participants. The ability to trade allocations before a token’s official launch could set a new standard for transparency and market efficiency in the crypto space. As we await the first project announcement on September 18, the crypto community is keenly watching to see how this revolutionary solution will shape the future of digital asset distribution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Binance TGE solution? A1: The Binance TGE solution is a new method for distributing token allocations for upcoming projects, developed by Binance Wallet in partnership with Aspecta’s BuildKey. It replaces direct token distribution with tradable certificate-like instruments called BuildKeys. Q2: How does BuildKey differ from traditional TGEs? A2: Unlike traditional TGEs where participants receive tokens directly, BuildKey issues a tradable certificate that represents an allocation. This certificate can be exchanged for actual tokens at the time of the TGE and can be traded before the official token launch. Q3: When will the first project using this solution be announced? A3: The first project to utilize this new Binance TGE solution will be announced on September 18. Q4: Can BuildKeys be traded before the token launch? A4: Yes, one of the key features of BuildKeys is their tradability before the official token launch, offering participants early liquidity and flexibility. Q5: What are the benefits for users participating in the Binance TGE solution? A5: Users benefit from early engagement with projects, increased flexibility and liquidity through pre-launch trading, and a potentially more transparent allocation process compared to traditional TGEs.

51872672,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=811014,1758109248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51872672.jpeg,"Markets prepare for altcoin break out as XRP, BNB, HYPE rally ahead of Fed decision",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-bnb-and-hyperliquid-surge/,"XRP, BNB, SUI, and Hyperliquid have outperformed other altcoins ahead of Wednesday’s expected U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision. BNB has surged by 2.56% to $955.10, while SUI, Hyperliquid, and XRP are up 2.64%, 3%, and 1.49%, respectively. Investment analyst at Fischer8 Capital, Lai Yuen, argued that those digital assets are pumping due to coin-specific developments and the anticipated central bank’s rate cut decision on September 17. He noted that Hyperliquid and BNB are rising due to their digital asset treasury initiatives, in addition to their solid businesses and clear accumulation models. Digital assets see increased inflows The analyst also believes that the surge in XRP is fueled by the newly approved spot ETF, which is expected to launch on Friday. Cryptopolitan reported that the REX-Osprey XRP ETF will be the first U.S. fund to provide investors direct access to XRP. On-chain data shows that Layer 1s have outperformed other sectors like Layer 2s, memecoins, or gaming over the past seven days and thirty days. The S&P 500 index is up 2.44%, while gold surged by more than 10% in the last thirty days. Yuen noted a strong inflow into equities and gold heading into the FOMC, while digital assets continue to lag, with majors capped by lower highs. On-chain data still shows that on Tuesday, crypto broker FalconX withdrew 413,075 SOL from Binance, OKX, Coinbase, and Bybit. Yuen believes it signals accumulation from larger players as they seek to reduce their stockpiles on exchanges to sell quickly. U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs also recorded $292 million in net inflows on September 16, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) pulling in $209 million. The strong inflows came in anticipation of the Fed’s monetary policy decision, suggesting that investors increase their exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs to hedge against potential macroeconomic shifts. A lower interest rate environment could draw fresh capital into the stock market and crypto, leading to inflows into high-risk assets like altcoins. Coinbase’s Institutional global head of research, David Duong, mentioned last month that the current market conditions suggest a potential shift toward a full-scale altcoin season in September. Altcoin season nears as Bitcoin dominance declines Duong argued that altcoin season was already in the early stages, pointing to Bitcoin’s declining market dominance. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s market dominance is 58.32%. He also believes that the catalyst will likely push altseason into full swing in the expected Fed rate cuts on Wednesday. Coinanalyze data also shows that speculation around altcoins reached new highs, as the recent surge in Altcoin Open Interest briefly overtook Bitcoin’s on Saturday. Vtrader founder Stephen Gregory previously mentioned that the rise in leverage indicates investors’ eagerness for the alt season ahead of Q4’s historically bullish performance. CoinGlass and CoinMarketCap altcoin season index show a score of 76 and 65 out of 100, respectively, indicating that they’re at their highest levels since December. Blockchain Center data also shows the metric sits at 80% in the last 90 days, with only 75% of the top 50 crypto assets required to signal altcoin season. Analyst at CryptoQuant, Maartum, noted that altcoins have the upper hand as they gain volume dominance. He revealed that altcoins make up 85.2% of total futures trading volume. The analyst also stated that altcoin speculation is surging as the gap between BTC and Altcoin Open Interest recently hit a new high. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin has increased more than 4% in the past 7 days and nearly 1.5% in the past 30 days. At the time of publication, BTC is trading at $116,762. On-chain data also shows that the digital asset has surged 99% yearly despite a shift in altcoin dominance.

The company submitted a draft registration on Form S-4, advancing its plan to enter the public markets through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company. The Form S-4 submission follows The Ether Machine’s proposed business combination with Dynamix Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed SPAC trading under the ticker symbol ETHM. An S-4 filing is used to register securities issued in mergers or acquisitions, which in this case would clear the Ethereum-focused firm to list shares publicly. As Cryptopolitan reported in July, Ether Machine revealed its plan to merge with Dynamix, expecting the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. As of today, we have confidentially filed our S-4 with the SEC.

We’re shifting into the next gear, and officially on its path to full public form.” Ether Machine waiting for SEC greenlight to join Nasdaq Andrew Keys, co-founder and chairman of The Ether Machine, said the filing will help the company become one of the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasuries. He added that the firm had engaged KPMG, one of the Big Four auditors, to oversee its governance and disclosure standards. “The submission of our Form S-4 is a critical step towards becoming a publicly traded Ethereum company,” Keys said. “We believe The Ether Machine is positioned to set a new benchmark for digital asset treasuries entering the public markets.” The company was formed earlier this year through a business combination between The Ether Reserve LLC and Dynamix Corporation. Under the terms of the definitive business combination agreement, Dynamix and The Ether Machine, referred to as “Pubco,” will submit additional regulatory filings, including a preliminary proxy statement and prospectus. Filing dictates shareholder approval process The registration statement will include a proxy statement for Dynamix shareholders and a prospectus for The Ether Machine. According to the filing, definitive proxy materials and other relevant documents will be mailed to shareholders of Dynamix at a record date yet to be determined, alongside details of the merger and other transactions related to the proposed business combination. Dynamix and The Ether Machine could also file more documents about the proposed deal with the SEC. Company representatives told reporters the current communication does not contain all the details that should be considered for investment decisions. Both companies and their respective boards and executives may be considered participants in the proxy solicitation process under SEC rules. Details regarding the directors, executive officers, their interests in the merger, and their holdings of Dynamix securities are included or will be included in filings with the SEC. Ethereum holdings cross $2.16 billion pre-Nasdaq listing In preparation for its Nasdaq listing, The Ether Machine secured $654 million worth of Ether on September 2. The 150,000 Ether investment was led by Jeffrey Berns, a longtime Ethereum enthusiast, and delivered to the firm’s wallet later in the week. The firm is expected to enter the public market with a treasury of more than 495,362 Ether, valued at $2.16 billion, along with an additional $367.1 million in capital to acquire more ETH. According to data from SER, The Ether Machine is currently the third-largest corporate holder of Ethereum, behind Bitmine Immersion Tech and SharpLink Gaming . Bitmine holds about 1.2 million ETH, while the latter increased its position this past week to 838,152 coins.

Amidst the optimism, Mantle’s native token MNT has skyrocketed to fresh all-time highs of $1.69 after the network transitions into a zero-knowledge rollup. The OP Succinct-powered upgrade marks the end of a long-awaited process. Moreover, it makes Mantle the largest Ethereum-based ZK rollup, with over $2 billion in total value locked. The latest blog confirmed: With today’s mainnet upgrade, the journey is complete: Mantle is now the world’s largest ZK rollup by TVL, with over $2 billion secured by Succinct’s technology. Mantle @Mantle_Official · Follow D-Day: A defining moment for Mantle Network.We’ve upgraded to @SuccinctLabs ‘s OP Succinct on Mainnet, becoming the first OP Stack L2 to launch as a ZK Validity Rollup — and the largest ZK rollup by TVL.The Liquidity Chain is evolving. 🧵 Watch on Twitter View replies 6:30 pm · 16 Sept 2025 196 Reply Copy link Read 71 replies Furthermore, the transition represents a crucial step in Mantle’s vision of creating a “Liquidity Chain”. The innovative chain connects decentralised finance (DeFi), institutional funds, and RWAs (real-world assets) tokenisation on one L2 platform. Mantle’s native token rallied to new all-time highs above $1.69 hours after the announcement. Mantle introduces lower costs and faster settlement The latest upgrade addresses the primary challenges facing the Ethereum blockchain: high transaction costs and slow finality times. With OP Succinct, Mantle Network offers a 6-hour withdrawal timeframe and 1-hour transaction settlement. That outperforms the 7-day exit time seen on most Layer2 blockchains. Such enhancement will likely attract institutional participants prioritising settlement speed and capital efficiency. The upgrade also reduces transaction costs. Succinct’s Prover Network enables individuals to spend as low as $0.002 per transaction. Furthermore, end users will not incur disruptive fees when utilising ZK offerings. According to the Mantle team: These capabilities are making the Liquidity Chain real. With faster settlement secured by cryptography, a new class of applications will be possible. Capital will flow seamlessly between digital and real-world economies. MNT price outlook While analysts forecast massive breakouts in the crypto space after a possible rate cut, the Mantle community appears early to the party. MNT surged to all-time highs of $1.69 today, September 17, after gaining 20% and over 35% the past week and month. The alt is now over 250% up since its inception. Chart by CoinMarketCap Mantle looks poised for extended upside considering the current broad market sentiments. Odds of the Fed executing a rate cut in today’s meeting continue to soar, fueled by the struggling economy. Polymarket shows a 91% chance of a 25% interest rate reduction. Digital tokens are trading near key price levels, eying significant breakouts after a dovish Federal Reserve. Either way, Mantle has welcomed a new era with the ZK rollup transition. Lower transaction fees, faster finality, and a comprehensive roadmap for institutional adoption could attract more liquidity in the coming times.

The price spike came after months of consolidation and capped a week of strong upward movement that carried the token to an eight-month high. With trading volumes soaring and market capitalisation briefly pushing beyond $425 million, the question is whether TOSHI can sustain this momentum or if the surge marks the peak of a short-lived speculative wave. Upbit listing The clearest catalyst behind TOSHI’s breakout was its listing on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit, on September 17. The listing triggered a flood of retail activity, with trading volume spiking over 3,400% in just 24 hours. At its peak, Upbit accounted for nearly 40% of global TOSHI transactions, highlighting the heavy role of Korean traders in the surge. Upbit’s influence often carries what analysts call the “Kimchi premium,” a phenomenon where newly listed assets experience outsized price jumps on Korean exchanges. In TOSHI’s case, the effect was amplified by earlier listings on Binance Futures and Binance US, which added credibility and liquidity to the token. The Binance Futures listing also opened up 75x leverage, creating fertile ground for speculative bets that magnified the price action. Memecoins outperform as altcoin season index rises TOSHI’s rally has not occurred in isolation. The broader crypto market has been leaning toward altcoins, with the Altcoin Season Index climbing to 69, its highest level in months. Bitcoin dominance has slipped below 58%, giving smaller-cap assets room to attract speculative flows. Within this environment, memecoins have outperformed, drawing retail enthusiasm and opportunistic capital. On-chain data adds another bullish dimension, with exchange balances for TOSHI dropping by around 8% following the listings, reducing the immediate supply available for trading. Such outflows often limit selling pressure and can stabilise prices in the short term. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator shows a negative reading, hinting that capital may be gradually leaving the market even as speculative interest grows. Technical breakout from a 9-month symmetrical triangle The rally coincided with a technical breakout from a nine-month symmetrical triangle, with TOSHI clearing the $0.00071 resistance level. The move flipped the MACD histogram into positive territory, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains at a moderate 47, suggesting room for further upside without entering overbought territory. There was also the breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern earlier in September, with a neckline at $0.00068 and a base near $0.00053. The breakout from the cup-and-handle pattern on the 4-hour chart pushed the token’s price to an intraday high of $0.0011, where sellers eventually emerged. TOSHI 4-hour chart | Source: GeckoTerminal Market analysis now points to $0.00083 as an important support zone, as it aligns with the measured target from the breakout. Short-term analysis reveals a descending triangle pattern that could bring volatility around the $0.0006–$0.00062 zone. This area also overlaps with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, a key marker that many traders will watch closely in the coming days. A decisive hold above this level could reinforce bullish sentiment, while a breakdown may invite a retest of deeper support near $0.00053.

As the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting approaches, all eyes are on the US Dollar Outlook , especially after leading financial institutions like UBS have shared their definitive, and notably bearish, perspectives. For crypto investors, understanding these macro shifts is paramount, as a weakening dollar can sometimes signal a ‘risk-on’ environment, potentially benefiting digital assets. Why is UBS So Bearish on the US Dollar Ahead of the FOMC Meeting? UBS, a global banking giant, has publicly maintained a bearish stance on the US Dollar (USD) as the highly anticipated FOMC Meeting looms. This isn’t just a fleeting observation; it’s a strategic forecast built on a comprehensive analysis of economic indicators, monetary policy expectations, and global market dynamics. Their conviction suggests that the current strength of the dollar might be unsustainable, especially when confronted with potential shifts in the Federal Reserve’s stance. Several factors contribute to this critical UBS Forecast : Shifting Interest Rate Expectations: The market is increasingly pricing in potential rate cuts later in the year, or at least a pause in rate hikes. If the Fed signals a dovish pivot, even subtly, it could erode the dollar’s yield advantage. Global Economic Rebalancing: As other major economies, particularly in Europe and Asia, show signs of recovery or tightening monetary policy, the relative attractiveness of the dollar could diminish. Inflationary Pressures: While inflation has been a key driver for aggressive Fed action, signs of easing inflation could reduce the urgency for further rate hikes, weakening the dollar’s support. This collective outlook forms the bedrock of UBS’s bearish sentiment, advising investors to prepare for a potential depreciation of the greenback. Understanding the FOMC Meeting: What Drives Interest Rate Decisions? The FOMC Meeting is arguably the most influential event in global finance. Comprising members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, the FOMC meets eight times a year to discuss and make crucial Interest Rate Decisions . These decisions, particularly regarding the federal funds rate, directly impact borrowing costs, consumer spending, and ultimately, the valuation of the US Dollar. The FOMC’s decisions are not arbitrary; they are meticulously crafted based on a dual mandate: Maximum Employment: The Fed aims to foster employment conditions consistent with its assessment of the economy’s long-run potential. Price Stability: This typically translates to maintaining inflation around a target of 2%. Key economic data points heavily scrutinized by the FOMC include: Inflation Reports: Consumer Price Index (CPI), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). Employment Data: Non-farm payrolls, unemployment rate, wage growth. Economic Growth: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures. Consumer Sentiment and Spending: Retail sales, consumer confidence surveys. Any deviation from expected data, or any hawkish or dovish commentary from Fed officials, can send immediate shockwaves through the Currency Market Analysis and beyond. How Do Interest Rate Decisions Influence the US Dollar Outlook? The relationship between Interest Rate Decisions and the US Dollar Outlook is fundamental. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it generally makes dollar-denominated assets (like US Treasury bonds) more attractive to foreign investors. This increased demand for US assets requires investors to buy US Dollars, thereby strengthening the currency. Conversely, when the Fed signals or implements rate cuts, the dollar’s appeal can diminish, leading to depreciation. Consider the following dynamics: Yield Differential: Higher US interest rates compared to other major economies create a positive yield differential, attracting capital inflows. Carry Trade: Investors might borrow in low-interest-rate currencies and invest in high-interest-rate currencies, creating demand for the latter. Economic Confidence: Rate hikes often signal confidence in the economy’s ability to absorb higher borrowing costs, which can also bolster the dollar. UBS’s bearish stance anticipates that the Fed’s future actions or rhetoric will likely lean towards less aggressive tightening, or even easing, thereby eroding the dollar’s current yield advantage and impacting its overall strength. Navigating the Currency Market Analysis: What Does a Bearish Dollar Mean for Investors? A bearish US Dollar Outlook , as predicted by UBS, carries significant implications across various asset classes, requiring a nuanced Currency Market Analysis from investors. For those in the cryptocurrency space, a weaker dollar can sometimes correlate with a stronger appetite for riskier assets. Potential Impacts: Asset Class Potential Impact of Weaker USD Reasoning Commodities (e.g., Gold, Oil) Generally rise Commodities are often priced in USD. A weaker dollar makes them cheaper for holders of other currencies, increasing demand. Equities (Non-US) May rise US investors’ foreign holdings become more valuable when converted back to a weaker dollar. Non-US companies’ exports to the US become more competitive. Emerging Market Currencies May strengthen Reduced pressure from a strong dollar, potentially leading to capital inflows and less debt servicing burden for dollar-denominated debt. Cryptocurrencies Potential for upside Often seen as alternative assets or ‘digital gold’. A weaker dollar can push investors towards assets perceived as inflation hedges or those with higher growth potential in a ‘risk-on’ environment. Actionable Insights: Diversification: Consider diversifying portfolios beyond dollar-denominated assets. Hedging Strategies: For businesses with significant dollar exposure, hedging against currency fluctuations might be prudent. Commodity Exposure: Increased allocation to commodities like gold could act as a hedge against dollar weakness. Monitor Cross-Currency Pairs: Pay close attention to EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY, as these pairs will reflect the dollar’s movement most directly. The UBS Forecast serves as a crucial signal for investors to re-evaluate their positions and adjust strategies accordingly. The UBS Forecast: Historical Precedent and Future Trajectories The UBS Forecast for a bearish dollar is not made in a vacuum; it draws on historical precedents where shifts in monetary policy or global economic conditions have significantly altered the dollar’s trajectory. Historically, periods of slowing US economic growth relative to other major economies, or a sustained dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve, have often led to dollar depreciation. Past Cycles and Lessons Learned: Early 2000s: Following the dot-com bubble and subsequent Fed rate cuts, the dollar experienced a prolonged period of weakness. Post-2008 Financial Crisis: While initially a safe haven, once global recovery began and other central banks began normalizing policy, the dollar’s rally faced headwinds. Mid-2010s: The ‘taper tantrum’ and subsequent rate hike cycle provided strong support for the dollar, demonstrating the power of monetary policy divergence. Looking ahead, the future trajectory of the US Dollar Outlook hinges on several key variables: Inflation’s Path: Will inflation truly recede to the Fed’s target, or will it prove more persistent? Global Growth: How strong will the economic recovery be in Europe, China, and other regions? Stronger global growth could reduce reliance on the US economy as a primary driver. Geopolitical Events: Unexpected geopolitical shifts can always trigger safe-haven demand for the dollar, temporarily overriding fundamental weaknesses. The expertise behind the UBS Forecast suggests that these factors are aligning to create a challenging environment for the dollar’s current strength. Challenges and Counterarguments to a Bearish US Dollar Outlook While UBS presents a compelling case for a bearish US Dollar Outlook , it is important to consider potential challenges and counterarguments. Financial markets are complex, and no forecast is without its risks or alternative scenarios. Factors that could support the US Dollar: Persistent Inflation: If inflation proves stickier than anticipated, forcing the Fed to maintain higher Interest Rate Decisions for longer, the dollar could find renewed support. Global Economic Slowdown: Should other major economies face unexpected downturns or recessions, the US Dollar could once again act as a safe-haven asset, attracting capital flows despite its yield disadvantage. Unexpected Geopolitical Shocks: Major global crises often lead to a flight to safety, with the dollar typically being the primary beneficiary. Stronger-than-Expected US Economic Data: If the US economy continues to outperform expectations, it could delay any dovish pivot from the Fed, keeping the dollar stronger. These counterpoints highlight the inherent uncertainty in Currency Market Analysis and underscore the need for investors to remain agile and monitor incoming data closely, even when considering a strong UBS Forecast . Concluding Thoughts: Preparing for the Post-FOMC Landscape The impending FOMC Meeting stands as a pivotal event that will undoubtedly shape the near-term US Dollar Outlook . UBS’s clear and consistent bearish UBS Forecast signals a potential inflection point for the greenback, driven by evolving Interest Rate Decisions and broader economic trends. For investors, particularly those in the volatile cryptocurrency markets, understanding these macro shifts is not merely academic; it is crucial for strategic positioning. While the dollar’s journey ahead is fraught with variables, the weight of a major institution like UBS backing a bearish view warrants serious consideration. Whether the dollar experiences a gradual decline or a more abrupt shift, preparedness through informed Currency Market Analysis and diversified strategies will be key to navigating the post-FOMC landscape successfully. The next few weeks promise to be exceptionally revealing for global currency markets.

According to the White House, Steve hasn’t completed the process of divesting from World Liberty Financial , a company co-founded by Trump’s sons Donald Jr., Eric, and Barron, along with Steve’s sons Zach and Alex. Steve began working for the administration unofficially in January, and was sworn in formally at the Oval Office in May, but his crypto holdings tied to Trump are still intact, raising conflict of interest concerns. A White House official allegedly confirmed to Bloomberg News that Steve “has completed his financial disclosure and is working with ethics officials and counsel to ensure he is in full compliance with government rules,” and that includes taking the legal steps needed to fully divest. But that process is still ongoing. Steve had said in March that he was in the middle of handing off his real estate and crypto assets to his sons to avoid ethical issues, but the White House now says the transfer is still underway. Trump sons run crypto firm while envoy stays invested World Liberty Financial has become a major crypto player with ties to foreign investment. In May 2025, the company’s USD1 stablecoin was used by MGX, an Abu Dhabi-backed fund, to pour $2 billion into Binance. MGX was launched last year by the UAE to target investments in a deal that happened the same month Trump visited the country and signed an AI cooperation agreement. The firm’s public activities run directly through the same regions where Steve now leads diplomatic negotiations. His role includes helping manage the U.S. response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, as well as Middle East peace efforts, both of which demand regular meetings with foreign leaders. Federal ethics law prohibits officials from participating in matters where they have a personal financial interest. That law doesn’t apply to Trump himself, but it does apply to Steve. The Trump sons are now central to the family’s growing crypto empire. Donald Jr. and Eric still hold executive roles in the Trump Organization but are publicly leading the charge into crypto, alongside their younger brother Barron. World Liberty opened its token for public trading on September 1, and then reached a deal with a listed company to stockpile the asset, adding $670 million to the Trump family’s net worth, based on Bloomberg Billionaires Index data . $1.3 billion in crypto gains collide with White House role That wasn’t the only windfall. In March, the Trump family also launched American Bitcoin Corp , a crypto mining outfit. Eric’s stake alone was valued at more than $500 million when the company’s stock shot up on September 3, just two days after World Liberty opened its token. Altogether, the two projects, both under a year old, have generated about $1.3 billion in new wealth for the Trumps. That doesn’t include roughly $4 billion worth of locked tokens that Bloomberg says are still off-limits. The crypto gains now rival the value of legacy Trump assets like Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower. For a family that’s stamped its name on steaks, vodka, golf courses, and skyscrapers, the pace and size of the crypto windfalls are something new entirely. Steve is tied to all of it. The White House released his financial disclosure on a Saturday, showing that he sold his stake in his real estate firm for $120 million to address potential conflicts. The disclosure also showed he collected $34 million in payouts from a holding company that owns real estate, hotel and golf assets, as well as a stake in World Liberty Financial. But that crypto exit is still in limbo. “Divestiture can be lengthy for someone with Steve’s wealth and long career,” the White House said. And while the paperwork drags on, the legal risk climbs. The longer Steve stays invested in a firm that’s active in regions where he negotiates peace deals, the closer he gets to crossing into violation territory. Don’t just read crypto news.

That is beginning to change with the arrival of XRP Tundra, a platform built to give XRP holders access to staking rewards while linking Solana and XRPL through a two-token presale. The first phase of the presale is priced at $0.30. For each purchase, participants receive two tokens for one entry: TUNDRA-S on Solana, a utility and staking asset, and TUNDRA-X on the XRP Ledger, a governance and reserve token. This dual structure is designed to bridge speed and liquidity on Solana with stability and governance on XRPL, creating an ecosystem that may strengthen XRP’s appeal on market trackers. Cryo Vaults and Yield Potential The most anticipated feature of XRP Tundra is its Cryo Vaults, which will allow XRP holders to earn rewards by locking their tokens for set periods ranging from a week to three months. The reward system is capped, with multipliers increasing as commitments get longer. At the top end, advertised yields reach 30% APY, far higher than what most staking programs currently provide. Enhancements are available through Frost Keys, NFT-style instruments that can boost yields or reduce lock times. Importantly, staking is not live yet, but presale buyers secure priority access. This has created a surge of interest from investors who want to lock in their allocations before the Cryo Vaults open, positioning themselves for yield as soon as rewards are enabled. Shiba Inu Investors Look for Reliable Income The Shiba Inu community has always been vocal and ambitious, but much of SHIB’s growth has relied on speculation and token burns rather than structured yield. With XRP Tundra presenting a chance to generate real returns from idle XRP, Shiba Inu holders are beginning to diversify. Discussions across Telegram and X highlight how the combination of a $0.30 entry, dual-token allocations, and promised yields up to 30% is viewed as a way to complement speculative holdings with income-producing assets. A recent Token Empire review examined the presale terms and staking design. The analysis pointed out that platforms offering clear reward mechanics can attract cross-community support, and XRP Tundra is beginning to demonstrate that effect as SHIB investors join early rounds. Audits, KYC, and Building Trust Independent reviews have been central to XRP Tundra’s rollout. The project has published audits from Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins , covering contract security and staking mechanics. In addition, the founding team has been verified through Vital Block , adding a layer of accountability that investors increasingly expect. For new buyers, these measures demonstrate that risks have been addressed early. Combined with the presale’s fixed price and dual-chain structure, the audits and verification provide confidence that the system is built on a foundation of transparency. How Tundra Could Influence XRP Rankings The influx of new participants has already sparked speculation about XRP’s wider market position. While XRP Tundra is not XRP itself, the utility it creates could support stronger sentiment around the asset. If adoption continues and staking generates sustainable returns, some analysts believe XRP’s presence on Coinmarketcap could climb as investors reassess its long-term role in DeFi and payments. Whether those expectations are realized will depend on execution, adoption, and continued transparency. What is clear is that XRP Tundra has created momentum by linking Solana and XRPL while giving crypto communities a reason to commit capital for income rather than speculation alone.

In a post on X, DiSarro summarized the status succinctly: “Update on Midgard: We have a functional node, with support for state settlement on the L1, and state commitment finalization. You can transact on the L2 at lightning speeds with low latency and the results are displayed in your wallet (a fork of Lace ) in real-time.” He added that the next engineering checkpoints are “the delivery of L1 deposits and withdrawals, and the forced transaction inclusion mechanism,” concluding, “Things are coming together nicely and we’re extremely excited to bring this into the hands of the community.” Charles Hoskinson amplified the development with a tongue-in-cheek meme—“Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen”—a line that underscored how closely the Cardano founder has tied Midgard to the network’s broader scaling narrative this cycle. While lighthearted in tone, the post signals executive-level attention on progress that, if sustained, could materially change Cardano’s throughput profile. What Is Cardano L2 Midgard? At a technical level, DiSarro’s note points to three pillars that matter for any rollup-style L2: settlement, commitments, and inclusion. “State settlement on the L1” refers to the process by which the L2’s canonical state is anchored to Cardano’s base layer, ensuring that, even though transactions execute off-chain, ultimate security and finality derive from the L1. “State commitment finalization” describes recording cryptographic commitments to L2 state so that disputes can be resolved and the correct state can be proven against the L1. The mention of a forthcoming “forced transaction inclusion mechanism” is equally significant, as such mechanisms are widely used in rollup ecosystems to mitigate sequencer censorship by giving users an escape hatch that compels inclusion via the base chain when necessary. DiSarro did not publish specs in this update, but these terms map cleanly to the rollup design goals Midgard has articulated publicly since its unveiling. Midgard’s positioning has consistently been that of a Cardano-native optimistic rollup that is “tokenless,” avoids cross-chain bridges, and aims to let developers redeploy existing dApps without rewriting for a new execution environment. The project’s X profile describes it as “a tokenless Layer 2 using optimistic rollups to bring throughput and efficiency to Cardano. No bridges. No chain switching. Just ADA, smart contracts, and …” a framing that aligns with the practical focus on developer ergonomics and minimizing surface area for trust. Beyond social updates, Midgard has been tracked through Cardano’s community treasury process. In Fund12 of Project Catalyst, Anastasia Labs secured ₳500,000 for an open-source build-out, publishing milestone plans that ranged from architecture specifications to an L2 node MVP. The public Catalyst page, last updated in mid-2025, lists the workstreams and partial disbursements and emphasizes isomorphism with Cardano’s eUTxO model —meaning dApps should be able to redeploy to Midgard using the same code and tooling. While a Catalyst milestone plan is not a launch schedule, it provides additional documentary evidence that Midgard’s engineering artifacts have been progressing under a transparent grant framework.

Chainalysis found that these two segments reshape the intersection of traditional finance and crypto markets in the country. Merging TradFi and Crypto Tokenized real-world assets, particularly money market funds backed by US Treasuries, have emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments in the past year. According to Chainalysis’ data shared with CryptoPotato , assets under management (AUM) in tokenized money market funds nearly quadrupled, after climbing from around $2 billion in August 2024 to over $7 billion in August 2025. While this figure remains small compared to the $27 trillion-plus US Treasury market, the sharp growth points to investor appetite for regulated, on-chain, yield-bearing products that combine the liquidity of crypto with the safety of government-backed debt. These tokenized assets have become especially compelling in a high-interest-rate environment, as they offer crypto-native investors and institutions stable returns and provide collateral for DeFi protocols and fintech platforms. Tokenized US Treasury AUM Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs have also established themselves as the leading gateway for institutional exposure to digital assets. By mid-July 2025, global AUM for Bitcoin ETFs surged to roughly $179.5 billion, and the US-listed products accounted for more than $120 billion. This is a clear demonstration of the United States’ outsized role in driving this trend. The appeal lies in providing mainstream investors with BTC price exposure without requiring them to manage private keys or hold the asset directly, which lowers entry barriers while boosting liquidity. At the same time, the growth of Bitcoin ETFs ties demand more closely to US monetary policy and equity market cycles, thereby intensifying correlations with broader risk assets. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs, though smaller at $24 billion in AUM, are also gaining traction, and potential approval of Solana ETFs could expand this momentum further. Beyond institutional adoption, retail participation also remains strong. In fact, centralized exchanges saw $2.7 trillion worth of Bitcoin purchases in USD, followed by $1.5 trillion in ETH and $454 billion in USDT. To top that, Bitcoin’s dominance in fiat trading has been remarkably steady at around 42% since 2022. North America – World’s Most Volatile Crypto Market The United States has secured the number two spot in the Chainalysis 2025 Adoption Index, catapulting North America as a crucial aspect in global crypto markets. The region accounted for 26% of all transaction activity between July 2024 and June 2025, and total inflows reached $2.3 trillion. Monthly Percentage Growth in Transaction Value December 2024 saw a historic peak, as $244 billion was received in a single month, driven by record-breaking stablecoin transfers. The blockchain data platform explained that the US presidential election in November 2024 was a catalyst for this surge. North America stands out not only for scale but also for volatility, with transaction growth swinging from a 35% drop in September to an 84% jump in November. Much of this is attributed to institutional strategies and trading patterns that amplify market movements.

Accordingly, live broadcast and e-commerce company GD Culture Group announced a $787.5 million Bitcoin purchase agreement. According to the official statement, GD Culture Group announced that they have entered into an equity agreement to acquire assets worth $875 million, including 7,500 Bitcoins, from Pallas Capital Holding, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. GD Culture will issue approximately 39.2 million shares of common stock in exchange for all of Pallas Capital's assets, including $875.4 million worth of Bitcoin. GD Culture CEO Xiaojian Wang said the acquisition deal will directly support the company's plan to build a strong and diversified crypto asset reserve while capitalizing on the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a reserve asset and store of value. With this acquisition, GD Culture is expected to become the 14th largest publicly traded Bitcoin holding company. The number of companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies has increased significantly, exceeding 190 by 2025. Immediately after the deal was announced, GD Culture shares fell 28.16% to $6.99, their biggest drop in a year. As you may also recall, GD Culture announced in May that it would create a cryptocurrency reserve. At this point, the company announced that they plan to invest in Bitcoin and President Donald Trump's official meme coin, TRUMP token, through the issuance of up to $300 million in stock. *This is not investment advice.

Trump wrote on TruthSocial on Tuesday that he had a “wonderful” conversation with the Indian leader and wished him a happy birthday. “He is doing a tremendous job,” he added. “Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine!” The timing of the call coincided with the two governments resuming work on a trade pact , which both described as positive, as they seek to repair relations after the president last month raised duties to 50% on Indian exports. That action doubled the previous 25% import levy on Indian products, a move the administration said responded to India’s trade barriers and also sought to penalize New Delhi for continuing to buy Russian energy. Modi, in a separate post on X, said India supported Trump’s “initiatives towards a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.” Unresolved oil dispute may impact future deals Ukraine and several partner nations argue that energy purchases from Russia by India and China blunt the effect of sanctions meant to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. Indian officials have said they will keep importing Russian crude so long as it remains economically sensible. The United States and India had earlier targeted completion of a bilateral deal this fall, but talks stalled. In recent months, Trump has adopted a tougher posture toward New Delhi as he seeks more leverage over its links with Moscow. Modi also said India is “fully committed to taking the India-US Comprehensive and Global Partnership to new heights.” How the two sides will bridge their differences over oil buying is still uncertain as addressed in a Cryptopolitan’s report. In recent weeks, Trump has urged other partners, including the Group of Seven, to step up sanctions on India and China, the largest buyers of Russian energy. Such measures could make it harder to clinch a trade agreement with New Delhi and could also unsettle a fragile trade truce with Beijing. Seven‑hour talks pursued trade progress as former trade allies reconnect On Tuesday, India and the United States said they would intensify efforts to reach an early conclusion of a “mutually beneficial” trade agreement, putting aside recent strains in ties. According to New Delhi, the announcement followed a seven-hour session at Vanijya Bhawan between the lead negotiators. The U.S. side was headed by Brendan Lynch, assistant U.S. trade representative for South and Central Asia, while India’s team was led by Rajesh Agrawal, special secretary in the commerce department. “Acknowledging the enduring importance of bilateral trade between India and the U.S., the discussions were positive and forward looking, covering various aspects of the trade deal. It was decided to intensify efforts to achieve early conclusion of a mutually beneficial trade agreement,” the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a statement. This was Lynch’s third trip to India and the first formal session between the negotiating teams since the U.S. administration last month introduced relatively steep duties, a 50% tariff on most Indian goods, alongside a 25% punitive levy tied to New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The meeting also reopened the path to a sixth negotiating round that had been slated for August 25 in New Delhi but was postponed when tensions rose. Neither side set a fresh date. Both described the latest engagement as a stock-taking exercise rather than a formal round, following a pause of about one and a half months. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

SWIFT Embraces ISO 20022 With No Plan to Launch Native Token,https://timestabloid.com/swift-avoids-competing-with-xrp-swift-embraces-iso-20022-with-no-plan-to-launch-native-token/,"SWIFT has made clear it will not create a proprietary digital currency. Instead, the global financial messaging giant is focusing on enabling third-party digital assets through ISO 20022. In a recent X post, John Squire shared a video in which a SWIFT executive described the organization’s “biggest new opportunity” as integrating with various networks and digital platforms under a single, transparent framework. By choosing interoperability over a native token, SWIFT avoids direct competition with established blockchain networks such as Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL). BREAKING: SWIFT embraces ISO 20022 with third-party digital currencies — no native token planned. Why? To avoid competing with networks like Ripple’s XRPL. $XRP The future is interoperability, not monopoly. pic.twitter.com/1NasTCUlBL — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 16, 2025 The Power of ISO 20022 ISO 20022 is more than a simple messaging upgrade. It introduces a rich, structured data standard that streamlines cross-border payments, minimizes exceptions, and reduces costly investigations. According to SWIFT’s updates, the shift enables banks to provide enhanced products and services while improving speed and accuracy. These benefits are crucial as financial institutions face pressure to deliver faster, frictionless payments and compete with new digital entrants. Building an Orchestration Layer, Not a Token Rather than issuing its own currency, SWIFT is constructing an orchestration platform that coordinates transactions across multiple payment systems. Standardized ISO 20022 messaging enables SWIFT to oversee settlement rules, transparency, and interoperability across traditional banking systems, instant payment networks, digital wallets, and distributed ledger platforms, circumventing the regulatory and commercial challenges associated with introducing a proprietary cryptocurrency. Implications for Ripple and XRP For Ripple and the XRP ecosystem, SWIFT’s stance removes a potential institutional rival. XRP already aligns with ISO 20022 standards , which could allow for easier integration with banks seeking efficient cross-border liquidity solutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Still, compatibility does not equal adoption. Any significant use of XRP will depend on the results of SWIFT’s ongoing digital-asset trials, regulatory approvals, and the willingness of banks to leverage XRP as a liquidity bridge. Market Impact and Competitive Landscape SWIFT’s decision underscores a broader industry trend: competition is shifting from token ownership to service orchestration. SWIFT enhances its role as a central component of global finance by standardizing data and prioritizing interoperability, enabling member banks to select digital networks that suit their requirements. This neutral stance fosters cooperation with blockchain platforms, promoting collaborative efforts rather than direct competition. Looking Ahead SWIFT plans to complete key ISO 20022 migration milestones and expand live digital-asset trials through 2025. The success of these pilots will determine how quickly banks adopt tokenized settlement solutions and whether networks like Ripple’s XRPL gain traction. As John Squire highlighted, the future of cross-border payments is not about monopolies but about seamless integration across diverse systems.

Among these, some token presales stand out because of their design, culture, or real community engagement. BullZilla has drawn hype with its staged pricing and lore-driven appeal, but another contender is quickly gaining traction. Based Eggman ($GGs) is building its presence on Base, merging meme energy with a social gaming ecosystem. Both projects highlight how pre sale cryptocurrency launches can shape community-driven experiences, but one has managed to capture the spotlight in unexpected ways. What Defines a Strong Token Presale? When investors assess a presale crypto, they look for more than a catchy name. The best crypto presale to buy right now usually combines strong utility, engaged communities, and a roadmap that balances ambition with delivery. Projects on the crypto presale list that gain traction often attract whales. Their presence signals both liquidity and trust. If seasoned investors are committing large sums, it demonstrates confidence in the presale cryptocurrency’s structure and potential stability. Benefit highlights: Early entry into promising ecosystems Larger allocation at a lower cost Growing liquidity backed by whale participation Presale crypto tokens that attract whales often transition more smoothly to exchanges. For many retail participants, this backing reassures them that the presale token has market depth when listings arrive. Based Eggman ($GGs): Culture Meets Utility Based Eggman has taken a different approach in the crowded market of cryptocurrency presales. Instead of focusing solely on scarcity mechanics, it is building an ecosystem rooted in gaming, streaming, and culture. The project operates on Base, Coinbase’s layer 2, which provides lower fees and faster transactions for those entering token presales. At its core, the $GGs token fuels games, streams, and trading tools inside a social community. Players can compete, stream live content, and even monetize their gameplay, all while earning presale crypto tokens. This integration of entertainment and utility makes Based Eggman ($GGs) more than a meme—it acts as a Web3 hub. The community aspect is equally strong. $GGs lives across Telegram, Discord, and X, keeping momentum alive through constant interaction. By combining memes, retro-gaming inspiration, and accessible onboarding with social logins, the project removes barriers for new participants joining a new crypto token presale. Currently, Based Eggman ($GGs) has raised over $130,000 USDT, with each $GGs priced at $0.008692. Early buyers using the bonus code GGS-30 receive 30% more presale tokens, a move designed to reward the first wave of participants. In a growing landscape of crypto presale projects , this mix of culture, accessibility, and incentives makes $GGs stand out. Based Eggman Takes the Presale Spotlight in 2025 While BullZilla captures short-term excitement, Based Eggman has positioned itself as one of the best crypto presale to buy right now by blending memes with real Web3 engagement. Its gaming-first ecosystem, streaming layer, and trading tools create an experience where presale crypto tokens are not only bought but also actively used within the community. This direction gives Based Eggman a stronger foothold in the evolving market of top crypto presales. Rather than relying only on token burns or price cycles, it integrates gameplay and social connection into the presale coin experience. That focus on participation has helped $GGs climb the new crypto presale rankings in 2025. Conclusion: The Changing Face of Token Presales The surge of pre sale cryptocurrency launches in 2025 shows that token presales are no longer just about speculation. Projects like BullZilla bring attention through staged burns and lore, appealing to fast-moving traders. Based Eggman , on the other hand, merges memes with gaming, streaming, and community-driven interaction. Its presence among top presale crypto coins illustrates how web3 crypto presale projects can connect entertainment with utility. The result is a new token presale that highlights how presale crypto tokens can act as more than an entry point—they can be the backbone of shared culture. As the market grows, the best crypto presale options are often those that combine innovation with engagement. Based Eggman ($GGs) shows how a presale token can capture attention by making participation part of the experience.

Key Takeaways: One in four public Bitcoin treasury firms now trade below the value of their BTC holdings, signaling weakening market confidence. K33 warns that trading below NAV limits capital raising, with dilution risks hurting smaller firms like NAKA and others. BTC accumulation is slowing, while spot ETFs and retail flows are emerging as the dominant drivers of demand. The drop reflects a growing disconnect between market confidence and the value of corporate Bitcoin treasuries, signaling that the once-booming trend may be cooling. K33: BTC NAV Gap Limits Capital Raising for Treasury Firms K33’s Head of Research, Vetle Lunde, warned that this gap is already limiting the ability of some firms to raise capital. “Issuing shares below NAV is dilutive,” he said, explaining that companies trading under the value of their Bitcoin effectively give away more ownership than they receive in return. The most dramatic case is NAKA, the merger vehicle of KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings, which has lost 96% of its market value from peak and now trades at just 0.7x NAV, down from 75x. Other firms currently below their NAV include Tether-backed Twenty One, Semler Scientific, and The Smarter Web Company. K33 notes that while the average NAV multiple across treasury firms remains at 2.8, that’s down from 3.76 in April, and the spread is widening. Larger players like MicroStrategy still enjoy premiums, while smaller firms are slipping below water. BTC accumulation is also slowing. In September, treasury firms added just 1,428 BTC per day, the weakest pace since May. BTC Treasury stocks just went through a full-blown 4 year Bitcoin cycle in 5 months lol. First up 5x, then down 70%. It's not only ""amplified Bitcoin"" in terms of price, but also in terms of time. Anyone who survives this can literally survive anything. pic.twitter.com/ceO1K5Ai24 — Ragnar (@RoaringRagnar) September 17, 2025 Lunde called the declining premiums “rational,” noting that many of these companies face high advisory fees, insider incentives, and complicated capital structures. Exceptions, he added, exist when firms can leverage their BTC holdings in other business areas. Public companies now hold over 1 million BTC, but K33 suggests that spot ETFs and retail flows are taking over as the main drivers of demand. On the derivatives front, CME bitcoin futures have returned to modest premiums over offshore perpetuals, suggesting a more balanced market. Still, funding rates remain elevated, with leveraged traders maintaining a strong long bias, a setup that could lead to a squeeze if momentum shifts. GD Culture Stock Sinks 28% After $875M Bitcoin Acquisition Deal GD Culture Group shares plummeted 28% after announcing an $875 million share-based acquisition of 7,500 Bitcoin from Pallas Capital Holding. The livestreaming and e-commerce firm will issue 39.2 million new shares to complete the deal, shifting its focus toward building a diversified crypto asset reserve. CEO Xiaojian Wang framed the move as a strategic pivot to tap into rising institutional interest in Bitcoin. Investors, however, responded with caution. The stock drop reflects concerns over significant share dilution and the risks of speculative crypto exposure. G DC’s market cap now sits at $117.4 million, down 97% from its 2021 peak. Analysts, including VanEck, have previously warned that funding crypto purchases with stock offerings can erode shareholder value if the shares trade below the asset value. Michael Saylor’s Strategy now holds 636,505 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder by a wide margin. Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings remains in second with 52,477 BTC, after adding 705 BTC in August. But new entrants are gaining ground. XXI, founded by Strike CEO Jack Mallers, has amassed 43,514 BTC , while the Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company holds 30,021 BTC.

The spotlight is on Steve Witkoff, a key US envoy, whose ongoing stake in WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI) and other cryptocurrencies is raising serious questions. This situation underscores the complexities that arise when public service intersects with personal financial interests in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Unpacking the Core Crypto Conflict of Interest Steve Witkoff, known for his role as the Donald Trump administration’s Middle East envoy, also co-founded WLFI. Recent reports from Bloomberg indicate that he still maintains holdings in WLFI and various other cryptocurrencies. This dual role immediately brings forward concerns about a potential crypto conflict of interest , especially given his influential position in critical peace negotiations. WLFI, the cryptocurrency company in question, is actively expanding its business operations, particularly within the Middle East. This expansion directly overlaps with the geographic region where Witkoff holds significant diplomatic responsibilities. Such circumstances naturally lead to scrutiny regarding impartiality and ethical conduct. Why Are These WLFI Holdings Raising Concerns? The situation becomes even more intricate with past events involving WLFI. An investment fund established by the Abu Dhabi government, MGX, reportedly utilized WLFI’s stablecoin, USD1, to make a substantial $2 billion investment in Binance. This connection suggests a significant financial footprint for WLFI within the region, amplifying the ethical spotlight on Witkoff. As a central figure in sensitive discussions, including peace negotiations for the Middle East and efforts related to the Russia-Ukraine war, Witkoff’s personal financial ties to a burgeoning crypto entity in the same region present a clear challenge. Critics suggest that this entanglement could lead to both legal and ethical issues, creating an undeniable crypto conflict of interest . Navigating the Ethical Minefield: Transparency in Public Service The White House has acknowledged these concerns. An official statement clarified that Witkoff has already disclosed his assets. Furthermore, he is reportedly undergoing necessary legal procedures to ensure full compliance, guided by legal counsel. This step is crucial for maintaining public trust and adhering to government ethics standards. However, the mere existence of such holdings, regardless of disclosure, sparks a broader conversation about how public officials manage personal investments in volatile and often opaque markets like cryptocurrency. Preventing even the appearance of a crypto conflict of interest is paramount for the integrity of international diplomacy. Ensuring Trust and Accountability in Digital Finance This incident serves as a vital reminder of the need for robust ethical frameworks that can keep pace with technological advancements. As cryptocurrencies become more integrated into the global financial system, the potential for conflicts of interest involving public servants will likely grow. It highlights the challenge of balancing personal financial freedom with the immense responsibility of public office. For individuals in positions of power, especially those involved in sensitive international relations, strict adherence to disclosure rules and, often, divestment from assets that could create a perceived crypto conflict of interest are essential. This ensures that decisions are made solely in the public’s best interest, free from any personal financial influence. In conclusion, the situation surrounding US envoy Steve Witkoff’s WLFI holdings brings to light a critical discussion about ethical boundaries in modern governance. As cryptocurrency markets continue to expand globally, particularly in geopolitically sensitive areas like the Middle East, vigilance and transparency are more important than ever. Addressing these potential conflicts proactively is vital to uphold the integrity of both diplomacy and public service. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is WLFI and its significance in this context? WLFI, or WorldLibertyFinancial, is a cryptocurrency company co-founded by Steve Witkoff. Its significance lies in its active expansion in the Middle East, the same region where Witkoff serves as a US envoy, creating a direct link for a potential crypto conflict of interest.

According to reporting from the International Energy Agency on Tuesday, oil producers are now forced to spend $500 billion every year just to keep existing fields from collapsing. That’s just to stop production from falling apart. And the losses are accelerating faster than anyone expected. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said the agency analyzed data from 15,000 oil and gas fields worldwide and found an increasing reliance on shale drilling is making global supply more unstable. “The situation means that the industry has to run much faster just to stand still,” Fatih said. Shale falls, OPEC+ tightens grip as drilling gap widens The IEA warned that if companies stop spending entirely, global oil output will drop by 5.5 million barrels per day, which is the same amount Brazil and Norway combined produce. The biggest shock would hit U.S. shale, where production would fall by 35% in the first year if drilling were paused. Unlike traditional fields, shale wells dry up fast and need constant drilling to stay alive. This new assessment comes after the IEA spent the past few years warning of oversupply . In 2023, the agency had cautioned producers to “look at their business plans,” citing fears of a “staggering glut.” Now, that tone has reversed. And the change isn’t happening in a vacuum. The Trump administration, now back in the White House, had previously criticized the IEA for undermining investment in fossil fuels with forecasts about peak oil demand arriving by the end of the decade. Fatih and his team are now warning about a different kind of peak: peak stability. As oilfields in the U.S. and other non-OPEC regions decline faster, the IEA says the global balance of oil production is moving toward the Middle East and Russia, where massive oilfields deplete more slowly. Right now, OPEC and Russia hold about 43% of the global market. That could rise to over 65% by 2050 if current trends continue. Ukraine drone attacks knock out Russian ports, limit exports At the same time, Russian oil infrastructure is under direct attack. On Tuesday, three people familiar with the situation said that Transneft, which operates over 80% of Russia’s pipeline system, warned oil producers that output cuts may be needed if Ukraine’s drone strikes continue damaging key terminals. Since August, Ukrainian drones have hit at least 10 Russian refineries, cutting total refining capacity by nearly 20% at one point. They’ve also targeted two of Russia’s most important export ports, Ust-Luga and Primorsk, both on the Baltic Sea. Russian officials have not confirmed the scale of the damage, but people close to the situation said Transneft has limited how much oil companies can store in its system. The company also said it might have to reject excess supply if more damage happens. In a public statement, Transneft dismissed the reports as false, calling them part of the West’s “information war” and saying, “The appearance of such fake news with reference to some unnamed sources in the Russian fuel and energy complex causes damage to the image of PAO Transneft.” The company added: “It can only be caused by the attempts to destabilize the situation within the framework of the information war unleashed by the West against the Russian Federation.” Despite the denial, Primorsk was hit directly for the first time last week since Russia invaded Ukraine, causing operations to get temporarily suspended at the port, which handles over 1 million barrels per day, more than 10% of Russia’s total production. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy claimed the attack “inflicted significant damage” and called these strikes “the sanctions that work the fastest.” Russia’s storage problem makes these attacks worse. Unlike Saudi Arabia, Moscow doesn’t have the capacity to hold large volumes of oil while ports are down. That means when infrastructure gets hit, output must slow. Primorsk resumed limited operations on Saturday, but there’s no clear timeline for full repairs. This wasn’t the first hit. A drone strike in August already damaged the Ust-Luga terminal, further straining Russia’s export system. And while Moscow has rerouted much of its oil to India and China since the West imposed sanctions, the damage to infrastructure is a growing threat. Meanwhile, OPEC+ has raised Russia’s output quota again. Under the latest agreement, Moscow is allowed to produce 9.449 million barrels per day in September, up from 9.344 million in August. Whether Russia can actually meet that quota while ports are being bombed is unclear.

The world of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with new contenders emerging to challenge established giants. Among these, Sui has carved out a niche, captivating investors and enthusiasts alike with its innovative approach to blockchain technology. As we look towards the future, a critical question arises: what does the Sui price prediction hold for the coming years? Many are wondering if SUI crypto is poised for significant growth, potentially reaching the coveted $5 mark. This comprehensive article delves into the factors driving Sui’s potential, offering detailed predictions for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030, alongside an in-depth crypto market analysis to help you navigate this exciting landscape. Understanding the Sui Blockchain: A Foundation for Future Growth Before we delve into price predictions, it’s crucial to understand what makes the Sui blockchain unique and why it garners so much attention. Sui is a layer-1 blockchain designed for high performance, low latency, and an excellent user experience. Developed by Mysten Labs, a team with significant experience from Meta’s Diem project, Sui aims to address the scalability and usability issues that often plague existing blockchain networks. Key features that set Sui apart include: Move Programming Language: Sui utilizes a modified version of the Move programming language, originally developed for Diem. Move is a secure and robust language designed for digital asset ownership, which helps prevent common smart contract vulnerabilities. Parallel Execution: Unlike many traditional blockchains that process transactions sequentially, Sui’s architecture allows for parallel execution of independent transactions. This significantly boosts throughput and reduces latency, making it ideal for high-volume applications like gaming and DeFi. Object-Centric Model: Sui’s data model is object-centric, meaning assets are treated as independent objects that can be directly owned and manipulated. This simplifies development and enhances security for complex applications. Dynamic Scalability: The network is designed to scale horizontally, meaning its capacity can increase by adding more validators. This ensures that as demand grows, the Sui blockchain can keep pace without compromising performance. These technological advancements form the bedrock of Sui’s potential, positioning it as a formidable player in the competitive blockchain space. The ability to handle a large number of transactions quickly and securely is a significant draw for developers and users, directly influencing the long-term viability and value of the SUI token . SUI Tokenomics and Its Role in the Ecosystem The native cryptocurrency of the Sui network is the SUI token . It plays several vital roles within the ecosystem, underpinning its functionality and economic model. Understanding these roles is essential for any accurate Sui price prediction . The primary utilities of the SUI token include: Gas Fees: SUI is used to pay for transaction fees and execute smart contracts on the Sui blockchain. This ensures network security and prevents spam. Staking: Token holders can stake their SUI with validators to secure the network and participate in its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. In return, stakers earn rewards, incentivizing participation and decentralization. Governance: SUI token holders have the right to participate in network governance, voting on important proposals and upgrades that shape the future direction of the Sui blockchain. Storage Fund: A portion of SUI tokens contributes to a storage fund, which is used to pay for the storage of on-chain data. This mechanism ensures that storage costs are paid upfront, providing a sustainable model for data persistence. The total supply of SUI is capped at 10 billion tokens. The distribution and vesting schedules play a crucial role in its market dynamics, influencing supply and demand. As more applications are built on Sui and user adoption grows, the demand for SUI for gas fees, staking, and governance is expected to increase, potentially driving up its value. This intrinsic utility is a fundamental aspect of our Sui price prediction model. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis: What Drives SUI’s Value?

MARA's new ventures include AI-driven power management with PADO, a major stake in Exaion for HPC/cloud services, and a wind-powered data center in Texas. MARA faces stiff competition from established players like Siemens and GE Vernova in power orchestration and HPE for private data center hosting. Given these risks and uncertainties, I recommend a Hold rating on MARA, as future performance hinges on successful execution in new verticals. MARA Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ), is aiming to diversify its business in data center hosting and power orchestration through a number of strategic partnerships and equity acquisitions, diversifying its operations beyond bitcoin mining. With roughly $6b in digital asset value on hand, MARA has substantial capacity to grow the organization into new verticals that may drive future operational performance. Given the crowded markets, MARA’s opportunity may face some challenges, particularly given the embedded technology expertise of competing platforms. Given the risks involved, I am recommending MARA shares with a Hold rating. MARA Holdings Operations MARA has been furthering its strategy in acting as a component for power load management through its partnerships with TAE Power Solutions and Pado AI Orchestration . With TAE Power Solutions, MARA is developing a high-frequency, real-time responsive load management system that can be deployed across energy-intensive industries, particularly with hyperscale data centers. The platform TAE and MARA developed involves a 10MW energy storage network that can be utilized for load balancing. As part of the power orchestration strategy, MARA is intending on leveraging underutilized or stranded energy resources to support the blockchain ledger, essentially backfilling power demand to match the amount of power supplied. Taking the platform further, MARA’s partnership with PADO is intended to develop this load-balancing feature to be sold as a service. Accordingly, PADO’s platform utilizes AI/ML to orchestrate power, grid services, and distributed energy resources to help organizations better understand their power utilization. The partnership’s goal is to improve power utilization efficiency for data centers by optimizing grid services. Though this is a newer field for MARA, advanced grid orchestration solutions isn’t a barren market. Large competitors like GE Vernova ( GEV ), Siemens Energy ( OTCPK:SMNEY ), and Emerson Electric ( EMR ) may have substantially more depth in the market, potentially creating a higher barrier to entry for MARA. As part of a total package, grid orchestration may be more tied to regional data center services as part of its investment in Exaion. MARA invested $168mm in cash for a 64% stake in Exaion from EDF Pulse Ventures in August 2025 . Exaion’s primary operations involve hosting high-performance computing infrastructure in a private cloud environment for customers, similar to Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) GreenLake. The rationale behind MARA’s investment in Exaion was to expand its operations deeper into AI/HPC infrastructure development, potentially diversifying its capabilities to become a cloud services provider (CSP). This may play into MARA’s strategy with its newly constructed data center in Hansford County, Texas, that will be utilizing MARA’s 114MW wind farm that was acquired at the end of 2024. Given the intermittency of wind power, MARA will likely integrate its co-developed grid solutions platform to create stability at its behind-the-meter data center facility. MARA Holdings Financial Position Corporate Filings As of Q2’25, MARA had 49,951 BTC in reserves, growing by 2.7x when compared to the previous year’s quarter. Subsequent to the close of Q2’25, MARA grew its bitcoin reserve to 52,477 BTC, as reported in its August 2025 production update. Corporate Filings In Q2’25, MARA raised $950mm through a 0% 2032 convertible issuance, providing substantial liquidity to bolster the balance sheet. MARA intends on using the cash raised for a variety of purposes, which may include adding more bitcoin to its treasury through open market purchases, funding M&A, or paying down debt. At the close of Q2’25, MARA had $2.6b in debt and $112mm in cash & equivalents and current digital assets on the balance sheet for a leverage position of 1.58x net debt/aEBITDA. At the current bitcoin spot price of $116,701/BTC, MARA has over $6b in digital assets held. Management indicated some uncertainty related to the future price of bitcoin relative to the current economic conditions. With the expectation of a potential pullback, management is becoming more prudent in actively managing its bitcoin position, allocating 2,004 BTC to an SMA through Two Prime while actively employing internal risk management methods by employing derivative instruments as a hedge. TradingView Risks Related to MARA Holdings Bull Case MARA is exploring additional opportunities to utilize the company’s expertise in data center and power management, aiming to deliver a power orchestration software solution that may transform how the organization does business. Diversifying into a new operating platform, I believe MARA shares may reflect incremental milestones as the organization brings its SaaS platform to market. Bear Case MARA is aiming to compete in a crowded market, dominated by larger, traditional players like HPE, Siemens, and GE Vernova, potentially making market penetration an uphill battle. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Filings MARA shares have largely decoupled from the price of bitcoin in the last year, underperforming the digital asset by roughly -80% when comparing 1-year performance. TradingView This may be the result of a number of possibilities, including the growing popularity of Bitcoin ETF trusts by asset managers like iShares ( IBIT ), ARK Invest ( ARKB ), and CoinShares ( BRRR ). BTC ETF Fund Flows With the growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs, I believe bitcoin mining companies will be valued more as an operating company rather than a proxy for bitcoin, creating some uncertainty relative to future equity performance. MARA shares currently trade at 1.67x EV/bitcoin (total value of bitcoin holdings as of September 2025). Given the business transformation into power distribution, I believe MARA shares may be valued based on incremental developments over financial performance, making performance more qualitative-based over quantitative. Given the risks and uncertainties related to its ability to compete in power orchestration, particularly given the competitors in the market, I am recommending MARA with a Hold rating.",MARA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-17 12:20:48

A recent development that has caught the attention of institutional investors and professional traders alike is Bullish’s acquisition of the highly sought-after Bullish BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This isn’t just another license; it represents a crucial step for Bullish and the broader crypto market, particularly within the demanding financial hub of New York. What Exactly is the Bullish BitLicense and Why is it So Significant? For those unfamiliar, a BitLicense is a specific regulatory framework for businesses dealing with virtual currencies in New York State. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) issues this license, and it is widely recognized as one of the strictest and most comprehensive regulatory approvals in the United States. Obtaining a Bullish BitLicense signifies that Bullish has met rigorous standards for: Consumer Protection: Ensuring safeguards for user funds and data. Cybersecurity: Implementing robust security measures to protect against breaches. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Adhering to strict protocols to prevent illicit financial activities. Capital Requirements: Demonstrating financial stability and sufficient reserves. This stringent vetting process makes the Bullish BitLicense a badge of trust and legitimacy within the highly regulated New York financial landscape. Unlocking New Avenues: Institutional Crypto Trading with the Bullish BitLicense With its new Bullish BitLicense , Bullish is now authorized to offer a range of vital services to institutional investors and professional traders directly within New York. This includes spot trading and custody services. What does this mean for the market? Enhanced Access: Institutions in New York can now engage with Bullish for regulated crypto trading. Secure Custody: The ability to securely store digital assets under a regulated entity is paramount for large-scale investors.

Compliance Built In: Backed by its VARA-regulated VASP license, MANTRA offers institutions and developers a secure, compliant, and scalable path to tokenization. DUBAI, UAE and HONG KONG, Sept. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — MANTRA, the Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for real world assets (RWAs), today announced that its latest mainnet upgrades are now live. With this release, MANTRA has become the first blockchain to support both EVM and CosmWasm smart contracts natively, thereby making it the first true MultiVM layer 1 built specifically for real world assets (RWAs). Coupled with MANTRA Finance’s Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the upgrade further strengthens MANTRA’s position to compliantly capitalize upon the expanding tokenization market. This milestone reflects not just a technical achievement in MANTRA’s roadmap, but a strategic evolution. The MultiVM design allows developers and institutions to build with familiar tools, while gaining the security and scalability of MANTRA Chain. The upgrades also prepare the network for future enhancements such as permissioned liquidity pools, institutional compliance frameworks, and deeper interoperability with other blockchains. These changes make it easier for developers, investors and asset owners to bring traditional assets onchain and for global investors to access them in a secure, transparent way. As the $16 trillion tokenization opportunity accelerates, institutional adoption has converged on EVM infrastructure. MANTRA has responded by fully embracing EVM compatibility to meet developers and institutions where they are. “MANTRA Chain is at the heart of the MANTRA ecosystem,” said John Patrick Mullin, Founder and CEO of MANTRA. “With this EVM upgrade, we’re not just improving performance, we’re further embedding compliance into the protocol, opening the door to a new era of accessibility, trust, and regulatory clarity when tokenizing real world assets. It’s another important step toward making the future of finance more open and efficient for everyone.” “This evolution of MANTRA Chain will further our position to meet the market where it is, and where we believe it is headed. Two critical factors that distinguish MANTRA from the competition are our Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), and our compliance-driven infrastructure. When combined with full EVM interoperability, these will give investors, developers and asset owners what they seek – a powerful and compliant chain.” Unlike most blockchains, which add compliance via smart contracts, MANTRA enforces regulatory requirements at the protocol level, which provides a significantly higher level of confidence as to compliance versus smart contracts . As a result, institutions no longer have to choose between regulatory clarity and EVM accessibility – they can have both. For developers, it couples the full set of EVM opcodes and precompiles, with low fees, and infrastructure that’s been truly optimized for RWA applications. Immediate benefits include: Developers can now deploy Solidity-based dApps directly on MANTRA Chain with no changes required. They can also fork and customize DeFi protocols for RWAs. Soon after they’ll be able to bridge funds seamlessly from other EVM chains. Institutions gain access to a chain that is both EVM compatible and self-sovereign, coupled with MANTRA Finance’s VASP license from VARA in Dubai – covering exchange, broker-dealer, and investment services. The mainnet upgrade builds upon a period of rapid momentum for MANTRA. In recent weeks, MANTRA announced a strategic partnership with Inveniam to build a global institutional RWA ecosystem anchored in the UAE and United States, and a buyback of its $OM token to reinforce long-term ecosystem growth. MANTRA has made significant improvements to governance and decentralization, onboarding both Binance, Nansen and Inveniam as validators, while winding down internal ones. On 21 and 22 October, MANTRA will host Agentic ., a two-day summit in Abu Dhabi – the ‘capital of capital’ – designed for leaders driving the next wave of markets, trading, tokenization, and deep financial innovation. With these critical foundations now in place, MANTRA is entering its next chapter, focusing on scaling adoption, onboarding new asset issuers, and demonstrating how tokenized finance can operate in a secure, transparent, and compliant way.

The world of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, and Polkadot, with its innovative multi-chain framework, stands out as a significant player. Many investors are keenly watching the Polkadot price prediction , eager to understand if this promising asset can truly break past the $10 mark and what its journey might look like through 2025, 2026, and even up to 2030. This comprehensive guide delves into the factors influencing DOT’s value, offering insights and a detailed Polkadot forecast to help you navigate the potential ups and downs of this intriguing digital asset. Understanding Polkadot: A Brief Overview of the Web3 Ecosystem Before we dive into price forecasts, it’s crucial to grasp what makes Polkadot unique. Polkadot is not just another blockchain; it’s a revolutionary protocol designed to connect multiple specialized blockchains into a single, unified network. This concept is often referred to as a ‘blockchain of blockchains’ or a ‘multi-chain network.’ Its primary goal is to enable seamless interoperability between different blockchains, fostering a truly decentralized Web3 ecosystem where data and assets can flow freely and securely. Key components of the Polkadot network include: Relay Chain: The central chain responsible for Polkadot’s shared security, consensus, and cross-chain interoperability. Parachains: Independent blockchains that connect to the Relay Chain, each optimized for specific use cases (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, gaming). Parathreads: Similar to parachains but with a pay-as-you-go model, offering more flexibility for projects with less consistent network usage. Bridges: Enable Polkadot to connect with external blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The native token of the Polkadot network is DOT. This token serves several vital functions: Governance: DOT holders have a say in the network’s future, including protocol upgrades and network parameters. Staking: DOT can be staked to secure the network and earn rewards. Bonding: New parachains are added by bonding DOT tokens, which are locked for the duration of the parachain slot. Historical Polkadot Price Analysis: What Has DOT Done So Far? To make informed decisions about future price movements, it’s always beneficial to look back at past performance. Polkadot launched with its mainnet in 2020 and quickly gained traction. The DOT price has experienced significant volatility, characteristic of the broader cryptocurrency market. After an initial period of discovery, DOT saw a remarkable surge during the 2021 bull run, reaching its all-time high of over $50. However, like many cryptocurrencies, DOT faced a substantial correction in the bear market of 2022 and beyond, seeing its price drop considerably from its peak. This historical context is vital because it demonstrates both the immense potential for growth and the inherent risks associated with investing in digital assets. Understanding these cycles helps temper expectations and provides a more realistic perspective for any cryptocurrency price analysis . Factors that have historically influenced DOT’s price include: Overall crypto market sentiment (Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone). Major technological milestones and upgrades within the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g., parachain launches, XCM implementation). New project deployments and adoption on Polkadot parachains. Macroeconomic factors and regulatory news. What Drives Polkadot’s Value? Key Factors for Our Polkadot Price Prediction Predicting the future price of any cryptocurrency, including Polkadot, involves considering a multitude of factors. These range from technological advancements to market dynamics and broader economic trends. Here are some crucial elements that will shape our Polkadot price prediction : Technological Development and Innovation: Polkadot’s core strength lies in its ability to facilitate cross-chain communication and shared security. Continuous development of its parachain ecosystem, implementation of advanced features like XCM (Cross-Consensus Message Format), and successful upgrades will enhance its utility and attract more projects. Ecosystem Growth and Adoption: The number and quality of projects building on Polkadot’s parachains are critical. A thriving ecosystem with popular DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, gaming platforms, and enterprise solutions will drive demand for DOT. Increased user adoption directly correlates with the network’s value. Interoperability and Web3 Vision: Polkadot’s role as a foundational layer for the decentralized internet is paramount. As the vision of a connected Web3 ecosystem gains momentum, Polkadot’s ability to bridge disparate blockchains will become even more valuable, positioning it as a key infrastructure provider. Market Sentiment and Macroeconomic Conditions: The broader cryptocurrency market often moves in tandem with Bitcoin. A general bull market can lift all boats, while bear markets can depress prices across the board. Global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical events also play a significant role. Regulatory Environment: Clarity or uncertainty in cryptocurrency regulations can profoundly impact investor confidence and institutional adoption. Favorable regulations could provide a significant boost, while restrictive measures could create headwinds. Tokenomics: The supply and demand dynamics of DOT tokens. While Polkadot has an inflationary model, the bonding of DOT for parachain slots and staking mechanisms help manage the circulating supply. Polkadot Price Prediction 2025: Will DOT See Significant Growth? Looking ahead to 2025, several factors suggest a potentially bullish outlook for Polkadot. The crypto market is cyclical, and many analysts anticipate a recovery and potentially a new bull run following Bitcoin’s halving events. For Polkadot, 2025 could be a year where its established infrastructure truly begins to bear fruit. By 2025, we expect the Polkadot ecosystem to be more mature, with a greater number of fully operational parachains hosting a diverse range of applications. The ongoing development of its cross-chain messaging capabilities (XCM) will likely solidify its position as a leading interoperability solution, making it a crucial component of the wider Web3 ecosystem . Institutional interest could also pick up, driving further capital into the network. Our Polkadot price prediction for 2025 suggests that DOT could realistically see significant appreciation. While hitting its all-time high might be ambitious, a return to higher double-digit values is plausible if market conditions are favorable and Polkadot continues to innovate. Based on current trends and expert analysis: Year Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) 2025 $8.50 $12.00 $18.00 These figures are speculative and depend heavily on market sentiment and Polkadot’s developmental progress. A successful rollout of new features and increased utility for the DOT price will be crucial. Polkadot Price Prediction 2026 – 2027: Sustained Momentum or Consolidation? Moving into 2026 and 2027, the trajectory of Polkadot will likely depend on its ability to maintain relevance and innovation in a competitive landscape. By this time, the broader crypto market might enter a phase of consolidation or a mid-cycle correction after a potential bull run. However, Polkadot’s fundamental value proposition as an interoperable network should continue to attract developers and users. The strength of Polkadot’s community and its governance model will be tested during these years. The ability to adapt to new technological demands and effectively manage network upgrades will be paramount. If Polkadot can demonstrate sustained growth in its user base and transaction volume, the DOT price could hold strong. For 2026, we might see: Year Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) 2026 $10.00 $15.00 $25.00 For 2027, assuming continued development and market stability: Year Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) 2027 $12.00 $18.00 $30.00 These projections factor in the possibility of market corrections but also acknowledge Polkadot’s strong technological foundation. A robust cryptocurrency price analysis must always consider both bullish and bearish scenarios. Polkadot Price Prediction 2028 – 2030: Will DOT Price Cross $10 and Beyond? The long-term outlook for Polkadot, stretching to 2028, 2029, and 2030, is where its true potential as a foundational layer for the decentralized internet could be realized. By this point, the Web3 ecosystem is expected to be significantly more mature and integrated into everyday life. Polkadot’s early focus on interoperability and scalability positions it well to be a dominant force in this future. The question, “Will DOT price cross $10?” becomes less about ‘if’ and more about ‘how far beyond’ by this stage, assuming the project continues its development trajectory and market adoption. For DOT to reach and sustain prices significantly above $10, it will need to achieve widespread institutional adoption, foster a truly vibrant and diverse parachain ecosystem, and demonstrate superior security and efficiency compared to competitors. Long-term cryptocurrency price analysis involves significant speculation, but if Polkadot fulfills its vision, its value proposition will be immense.

51876313,583251,1758115818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51876313.jpeg,Solana Takes The Crown As Leader In App Revenue Generation – Here’s How Much,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-app-revenue-surges/,"Solana has been nothing but bullish in the past few days, as the leading asset rides the wave of renewed momentum, which has pushed its price above the $230 threshold. While SOL’s price has been trending upward, activity on the blockchain seems to be sharply rising, suggesting that the current rally is on-chain-driven. App Economy Thrives On The Solana Blockchain In the pursuit of blockchain dominance, the Solana network appears to be demonstrating its position as a leader in the ever-dynamic sector. A recent report from SolanaFloor on the X platform reveals that SOL’s on-chain activity is growing at a notable rate, surpassing other major chains such as Ethereum . According to the report, Solana has experienced a massive growth in app revenue generation, making it one of the most commercially active ecosystems in the blockchain sector. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, this suggests an increasing number of developers , users, and projects that are now generating a noticeable amount of revenue. Data shared by SolanaFloor shows that the blockchain is leading the charge in app revenue generated, reaching approximately $10.17 million in a 24-hour timeframe. Interestingly, by reaching $10.17 million, SOL generated more revenue within the time frame than the next 10 largest chains combined. This significant achievement clearly demonstrates SOL blockchain ’s technological superiority in the cryptocurrency space. It also signals its growing influence in shaping Web3 economies and Decentralized Apps (dApps) in the future. Following SOL in app revenue generated within a 24-hour timeframe is Hyperliquid Layer 1 and Ethereum, with over $3.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively. When comparing these figures to SOL’s, it shows that the network’s revenue was roughly three times higher than that of the two major chains. It is worth noting that app revenues generated in August alone reached $193 million, representing about 126% in Year-Over-Year (YoY). The substantial figure in app revenue in August highlights both strong year-over-year and shifting leadership across categories. In the meantime, Solana’s app economy shows accelerating adoption, but there are frequent changes in industry leadership. SOL Is Dominating The Broader Capital Market With its strong performance, Solana is gaining notable adoption and support from prominent figures and companies. Dan Morehead, the founder of Pantera, has dropped a bombshell on SOL , declaring it the best-performing blockchain in the sector. The founder’s bold statement solely hinges on SOL’s unmatched transaction efficiency and robust adoption. In the interview on the CNBC Squawk Box, Morehead highlighted that handles more transactions than all capital markets combined, with over 9 billion transfers executed per day. Morehead’s comments demonstrate the rising trust that institutions and consumers have in Solana ‘s capacity to maintain pace and possibly raise the standard for blockchain utility and scalability.",Solana|CNBC Squawk Box|Dan Morehead|DApps|decentralized apps|Ethereum|Hyperliquid Layer 1|Pantera|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana Blockchain|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT|Year-Over-Year|YoY,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 13:30:18
51876314,583584,1758115851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51876314.jpeg,UK and US Move to Align Crypto Regulations as the Best Crypto Presales Heat Up,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-presales-to-buy-as-uk-and-us-start-crypto-cooperation/,"With Donald Trump in the United Kingdom for a state visit, the UK and the US are poised to forge closer regulatory ties on key issues. One of those issues is crypto regulations – in particular, stablecoins. The move could reshape the landscape for stablecoins, investor protection, and cross-border financial innovation. Along the way, it could also send a handful of the best crypto to buy into the stratosphere as markets heat up. A Shift Towards Cooperation High-level talks between UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent formed the starting point for the whole discussion. Trump himself may get involved later in the week. Major crypto firms like Coinbase, Circle, and Ripple, as well as leading banks, were part of discussions aimed at synchronizing oversight of the digital-asset sector. What’s driving the sudden shared interest? In a word, stablecoins. Stablecoins, pegged to traditional currencies, have emerged as popular payment instruments and stores of value. For now, they currently exist under varying regulatory regimes in different countries– and that’s why the UK is keen to align more closely with US regulation. What Alignment Might Look Like Several areas are expected to be part of the UK-US regulatory alignment: Stablecoin regulation: Clearer rules governing issuance, backing, and oversight. Combatting financial crime: Unifying anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards. Market conduct: Strengthened supervision of digital asset markets to ensure fair practices and consumer protection. Joint innovation sandboxes: Regulatory test environments where firms can trial blockchain-based solutions or new financial products in both jurisdictions under regulatory oversight. Why It Matters The UK has publicly acknowledged a risk of being left behind in global crypto regulatory advance. Former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne warned in an op-ed that on stablecoins and broader digital asset policy, other countries are passing the UK by. And there’s a strong desire on the part of both countries to use regulatory clarity to attract business investment, maintain competitiveness, and support innovation in the financial sector. Additionally, the timing of these moves is significant. Talks coincide with heightened diplomatic and trade conversations, including the US-UK relationship under President Trump’s pro-crypto bent and the UK’s efforts to position itself as a global hub in digital finance. With alignment on the horizon, the crypto presales could be among the best projects to buy. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Fastest and Cheapest Bitcoin Layer 2 Enables Everyday Bitcoin Transactions Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve a couple of long-standing Bitcoin problems. Sure, Bitcoin has a $2.2T market cap, and may not look like it has many weaknesses at all. But the Bitcoin Layer 1 blockchain emphasizes simple smart contracts for security and reliability, rather than speed or scalability. To achieve the latter, Bitcoin Hyper integrates the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) through the use of a Canonical Bridge. Deposit $BTC on the canonical bridge, mint wrapped $BTC on the Hyper Layer 2. On Hyper, investors can leverage the SVM’s speed to transact $BTC at Solana’s speeds – several thousand transactions per second. That utility explains why our $HYPER price prediction shows the token price reaching $0.32 by the end of this year. Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper is and jump into the presale at the official website . PepeNode ($PEPENODE) – Mine-to-Earn Gamifies Meme Coin Yield What if you could meme and game at the same time? PepeNode ($PEPENODE) makes it possible with an innovative Mine-to-Earn mechanic. Buy $PEPENODE and use the token to upgrade your virtual mining server room. The more nodes you purchase and the more you upgrade your rig, the more $PEPENODE you’ll earn. You can earn rewards in other tokens, including $PEPE, $FARTCOIN, and more. There’s also a leaderboard where miners can see whose rig is performing the best. The $PEPENODE presale has passed $1.2M, with tokens priced at $0.0010617 — but our price prediction sees the token climbing to $0.0023 by the end of the year. Check out the presale page for the latest info. BlockDag ($BDAG) – Massive Crypto Presale Offers Endless Blockchain Interconnectivity BlockDag has an incredibly ambitious vision – a proof-of-work consensus with Directed Acrylic Graph (DAG) technology. If BlockDag finds the success it hopes for, it could be the foundation for an entirely new standard for blockchain networks. BlockDag wants to build a more transparent blockchain with full DeFi capabilities, including: Stablecoins Staking Lending & borrowing Swaps Cross-chain bridging The solidity and reliability of a proof-of-work blockchain would back all of those features. And with over $400M raised in a massive presale so far, BlockDag is well-positioned to succeed. While US-UK regulatory alignment promises benefits, there are obstacles to overcome. Regulatory systems differ in structure, legal tradition, and risk tolerance. The UK and US may diverge in consumer protection standards, enforcement priorities, or industry oversight. Ensuring alignment without stifling innovation will be a delicate balancing act. But if negotiators can pull it off, look for hot crypto presales like $HYPER , $PEPENODE , and $BDAG to explode into the newly defined space.

51876353,https://finbold.com/?p=253469,1758115886,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Flare’s FLR token begins spot trading on Hyperliquid via LayerZero’s OFT,https://finbold.com/flares-flr-token-begins-spot-trading-on-hyperliquid-via-layerzeros-oft/,"Flare ( FLR ) has been listed for spot trading on Hyperliquid, enabled through LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard, as per the reports shared with Finbold on September 17. The integration allows users to deposit FLR via Stargate and trade it directly on the decentralized exchange, with the aim of simplifying access and improving efficiency. A more efficient and simpler trading experience Unlike wrapped assets, Hyperliquid has listed native FLR, removing the need for unwrapping and reducing transaction complexity for deposits and withdrawals. The listing was permissionlessly enabled after Flare secured the FLR ticker, and bridging is facilitated through LayerZero, linking FLR to Hyperliquid’s HyperEVM and subsequently to the HIP-1 asset on HyperCore for spot trading. Hyperliquid’s on-chain order book is designed to provide tight spreads, strong liquidity, and lower implicit costs for traders. “Hyperliquid trading volumes have soared over the recent months, rendering it a high-priority exchange listing with compelling prospects for the FLR token,” said Hugo Philion, CEO and co-founder of Flare. “Harnessing LayerZero’s native OFT standard and Hyperliquid’s decentralized listing flow, users can now access a permissionless bridge-in, trade, bridge-out experience for FLR.” How does it work? FLR has been deployed as a HIP-1 asset on HyperCore, with an FLR/USDC market registered. As Hyperliquid expands, the market is expected to migrate to include additional stablecoin pairs such as USDT0 and USDH. Users can deposit FLR via Stargate, place orders on Hyperliquid’s on-chain orderbook, and withdraw back to the Flare mainnet at any time. “The OFT standard is turning FLR into a first-class omnichain asset,” said Filip Koprivec, Chief Product Officer at Flare. “Combine that with Hyperliquid’s on-chain market structure and you get speed, transparency, and strong price discovery for everyday traders. Utilizing LayerZero, the default bridging solution on the Flare network allows us to enable a seamless user experience while keeping true to our ethos: no compromise on security that our blockchain offers.” Funding and settlement options Funding accounts can be done using USDT0 or FLR bridged from Flare, with assets transferred through Stargate to HyperCore or HyperEVM before being traded or returned to the Flare mainnet. Once bridged back, users regain access to staking, delegation, and FlareDrops. Furthermore, assets can be moved across Hyperliquid and withdrawn at any time. Featured image via Shutterstock.

The activity marks the first movement from the address in 12 years, according to blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain. According to crypto transactions monitor Lookonchain, the address 1NzHXRDizgEGaJZfBG46k66QXpRzDrtpZo had held its Bitcoin since 2013. At that time, the whale acquired the coins for an average of about $847 each, paying roughly $847,000 in total. At current market prices, the same stack is worth about 137 times more. Blockchain explorer data shows that the whale executed four transactions between late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, dispersing the 1,000 BTC to four fresh addresses. Bitcoin whale transfers holdings to four new addresses The movement began on Tuesday at 23:37 UTC, when they transferred 99 BTC worth roughly $11.5 million to a new address bc1q0…hla9d. Ten minutes later, another 500 BTC transfer was logged, carrying an approximate value of $58.1 million. Bitcoin whale activity. Source: Blockchain explorer At the stroke of midnight, the account initiated a 400 BTC transfer valued at $46.5 million. Fees for the larger transfers were minimal, with the 500 BTC and 400 BTC moves each costing just 470 satoshis, about 55 cents at current rates, while the 99 BTC transfer incurred less than $2.20 in network fees. Per market analysts, the Bitcoin whale is preparing for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision later today. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, 96% of traders anticipate a 25 basis point cut. The expectation has been high all along, but it has grown from 85% just one month earlier. Economists are divided on how many cuts could follow. Bank of America analysts see the Fed making two reductions, one in September and another in November, while Goldman Sachs projects three 25 basis point cuts before year-end. An analyst using the pseudonym The Count of Monte Crypto on X, believes there is “an 80% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates three times this year.” He also mentioned the reductions could take place during the central bank’s upcoming meetings scheduled for September 17, October 29, and December 10. According to the commentator, markets are already pricing in the possibility of several cuts because both gold and altcoins are rising. He quoted his regular video updates, saying: “We may experience an altcoin season in October and November.” Traders prepare for short-term volatility Despite optimism around easing monetary conditions, most crypto market participants appear to be hedging against more price downturns. Blockchain data platform CoinAnk reports that more than 57% of Bitcoin traders across exchanges have shorted the asset, compared with 42% taking long positions. According to Coinglass data , over 100,000 traders have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, with the amount totalling $214 million. Long positions took the biggest part of the red cake with $121 million, while those who shorted coin values lost about $93 million. Bitcoin itself has been in a consolidation phase ahead of the Fed’s meeting, rebounding from $111,000 support last Tuesday, climbing to $116,800 over the weekend. Bulls briefly pushed the asset above $117,200 earlier today, marking a four-week high, before a pullback to $116,000. Open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has fallen by over $2 billion in the past five days, which could mean traders are reducing their exposure ahead of the Fed’s announcement.

Fresh from the meme oven, Layer Brett is capturing the attention of traders, thanks to its magical presale , insane rewards, and offering practical blockchain use. Layer Brett: The Presale With Bite Some projects slip quietly into the market. Layer Brett is not one of them. Currently available for $0.0058 in presale , it’s already being hyped as the next big move, with traders calling for potential 100x gains before the cycle peaks. The formula is bold. On the tech side, Layer Brett runs on Layer 2 power — rapid-fire transactions, gas fees so tiny they feel unreal, and scalability designed for serious adoption. Analysts expect Layer 2 networks to process over $10 trillion annually by 2027, and Layer Brett is positioning itself right in the middle of that wave. But this isn’t a dry, corporate-style project. It’s laced with meme culture, giving it the energy and community pull that many “serious” tokens never manage to capture. That mix of utility and meme magic is what’s making it impossible to ignore. For early believers, the rewards are stacked. Staking kicks off with up to 700% APY, though yields shrink fast as more wallets pile in. A $1M giveaway adds even more fuel to the fire, pulling new investors into the presale frenzy. Layer Brett isn’t playing safe. It’s here to dominate. PEPE’s Path to a New All-Time High PEPE is demonstrating why it’s a top-tier meme coin, with a powerful community and a compelling narrative. The latest on-chain data shows a significant surge in trading volume, indicating that smart money is getting in before the next rally. Based on this momentum, a new PEPE price prediction from analysts is now targeting a retest of its previous all-time high by the end of 2025. The technicals are now confirming the long-term bullish outlook. After a period of consolidation, PEPE has formed a “golden cross” on the daily charts—a powerful signal that a long-term uptrend is underway. The token’s price is now trading above its key moving averages, a sign that the PEPE bulls are in control. Dogewifhat: The Hat that Stays On WIF continues to prove that in the world of meme coins, a strong cultural brand is more valuable than utility. While recent price dips reflect a minor period of profit-taking after the highly successful hat auction, the WIF’s core narrative remains stronger than ever. The technicals are now showing clear signs of a bullish reversal with a significant increase in on-chain buying volume.

The Hang Seng Tech Index rose 4.2% to its strongest close since November 2021. Baidu Inc. led the advance with a 16% gain, while Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ., Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., and JD.com Inc. also climbed sharply. The index has marked the 7th straight week in gains due to easing tensions between China and the United States along with rising confidence that large AI investments will begin to pay off. So far this year, the gauge has risen 42% according to Bloomberg. “China tech leaders are visibly re-accelerating AI spend and product rollouts, models, robotaxis, in-house chips, while also proving they can monetize AI faster than many expected,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “With valuations lagging the U.S., investors are starting to pay attention again.” Valuations still below U.S. counterparts On valuation, the Hang Seng Tech Index trades at about 21 times projected earnings, below its five-year average of 23.3 times and under the Nasdaq 100’s multiple of 27 times, Bloomberg data show. If gains persist, capital could flow back to China after years of volatility from regulation and a weak post-pandemic economy. Interest in the sector has also been lifted by the surprise rollout of a DeepSeek AI model early this year, which spotlighted China’s push to compete in the global AI race. Brokerage calls added fuel. Goldman Sachs increased its Alibaba price target, citing an improved outlook for the company’s cloud business. Arete Research moved Baidu’s ADRs to buy from sell, highlighting the promise of its internal chip program. Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. advanced this week after JPMorgan raised its rating on the stock. Wednesday’s jump left the Hang Seng Tech Index ahead of other key Asian gauges, while traders elsewhere kept risk in check before the Federal Reserve meeting . An MSCI barometer of regional stocks was nearly flat late in Asia. Even with recent strength, the Hong Kong tech gauge would still need to rise about 70% to revisit its record from February 2021. China’s largest internet and tech firms are in the midst of a heavy investment cycle for AI, racing both one another and U.S. rivals in a market expected to reshape daily life and work. AI capital expenditures set to exceed $30 billion Total capital spending by major companies such as Alibaba, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu, and JD.com may reach $32 billion in 2025. It’s a big jump from 2023’s $13 billion spent, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That drive has set off active fundraising across equity and bond markets. Alibaba collected $3.2 billion last week through a sizable convertible bond sale. Tencent tapped the offshore yuan market on Tuesday, issuing 9 billion yuan ($1.27 billion) in so-called dim sum bonds, its first bond deal in four years. As Cryptopolitan reported, China Unicom’s Sanjiangyuan data center signed agreements to deploy AI chips from domestic suppliers, including T-Head, Alibaba’s chip unit. CCTV said the update was shown to Premier Li Qiang during his visit to Qinghai earlier this week, the northwestern province that hosts the Sanjiangyuan site. Separately, SMIC shares gained over 7% after a report said the firm is trialing China’s first domestically made advanced chipmaking equipment. Hints of progress in U.S.-China ties added to the upbeat tone. President Donald Trump said he will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday, and officials from both countries have set a framework to keep TikTok operating in the United States. Attention now turns to an Alibaba Cloud event later this month, where investors hope to hear new details on the company’s AI development and commercial plans.

The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced Tuesday that it had sanctioned more than a dozen individuals and companies linked to Iran. OFAC tracks money to oil sales, crypto trade The US Treasury Department office said the money was funneled for the benefit of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), both affiliated with the country’s weapons programs. “These Iranian shadow banking networks, run by trusted illicit financial facilitators, abuse the international financial system and launder money through overseas front companies and cryptocurrency,” the department wrote. According to OFAC’s findings , Derakhshan and Alivand received payments through front companies registered in Hong Kong and the UAE. Those named in the investigations were Alpa Trading in Dubai and Alpa Hong Kong Limited, shell firms that the department claimed were disguising cash flows from oil sales. The network’s operation was also linked to Hezbollah-affiliated financial facilitators and Syria’s Al-Qatirji Company, a firm previously sanctioned for aiding the IRGC-QF. Al-Qatirji was identified as an accomplice in the smuggling of Iranian oil to regional markets. US officials claimed Alivand was part of the multimillion-dollar transactions with Tawfiq Muhammad Sa’id al-Law, a Hezbollah-linked money launderer. Al-Law allegedly provided Hezbollah with access to digital wallets to receive funds from IRGC-QF commodity sales. US vows to continue disrupting illegal oil sales According to OFAC, the Al-Qatirji Company was sanctioned under Executive Order 13224 in November 2024 for supporting the IRGC-QF. Al-Law was sanctioned under the same executive order seven months prior for assisting Hezbollah financially. Despite earlier sanctions, the Treasury said members of the network were still active to date. Derakhshan has reportedly been communicating with Ramin Jalalian, a sanctioned Iranian currency exchanger designated in June last year for aiding MODAFL. Jalalian reportedly manages Powell Raw Materials Trading LLC and Powell International FZE, both based in the UAE. While not formally tied to these companies, OFAC said he oversees daily operations, manages accounts and transactions for the front firms. John K. Hurley, Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the administration of President Donald Trump will continue cutting off Iran’s access to hard currency. Washington’s campaign against Tehran continued earlier this month, when the US sanctioned Iranian-linked oil tankers . Around the same time, Israel blacklisted 187 crypto wallets allegedly connected to the IRGC. Previous sanctions on Iranian crypto networks OFAC sanctioned eight TRON blockchain wallet addresses in April, all under the name of Sa’id al-Jamal, a supposed financial handler for Yemen’s Houthi movement. The wallets collectively received nearly $900 million in stablecoins between November 2023 and November 2024, and were linked to the IRGC-QF. According to US officials, the funds were used to buy weapons from Russia, which were shipped to Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. Security analysis firm Elliptic confirmed all transactions were routed through exchanges, wallets, and virtual asset service providers. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Dogecoin has long stood as a cultural icon, but its recent performance has caused some traders to explore alternatives. Whale wallets, in particular, are looking toward presale crypto tokens that offer fresh narratives and structured tokenomics. Among these, Based Eggman ($GGs) has emerged as a contender within the list of top crypto presales . By combining gaming infrastructure with meme culture, it positions itself as a unique presale cryptocurrency project. This shift reflects how investors balance legacy value with new token presale opportunities. Based Eggman ($GGs): Building Value Beyond Memes Based Eggman presents itself as a utility-based memecoin constructed on the Base network. Its $GGs token operates as both the central asset and liquidity provider within its ecosystem, ensuring that participants are directly tied to its growth. The project is influenced by Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, signaling a mindset that blends cultural relevance with infrastructure. So far, the Based Eggman presale has raised over 130,350 USDT, with more than 19 million tokens sold at a price of $0.008692. This performance underscores why it is often mentioned among the best crypto presale opportunities to buy right now. Unlike meme tokens that thrive only on speculation, Based Eggman incorporates gaming features that align with broader Web3 trends. By integrating culture with utility, it establishes itself as a project with depth, making it a recognizable name in the wider conversation about new crypto token presale projects. Dogecoin: Holding Its Place While Others Advance Dogecoin continues to draw attention as one of the most recognizable coins in the market. It recently surged to $0.2409 following a 13 percent increase over the past week, reminding investors of its lasting influence. For many, Dogecoin remains a cultural touchstone and an asset that reflects the origins of meme-driven investing. Despite its strong recognition, Dogecoin differs from new presale crypto tokens that now emphasize structured tokenomics and clear roadmaps. While Dogecoin maintains momentum, its reliance on community energy highlights the contrast between older meme coins and newer cryptocurrency presales that aim to blend culture with broader functionality. Based Eggman ($GGs): Presale Structure With Long-Term Focus The presale structure of Based Eggman is designed with early participants in mind. The starting price of $0.006389 is set to rise toward a planned launch value of $0.0589, which builds incentives for long-term holding. This design reflects the growing maturity in token presales, where early entry is rewarded through balanced and transparent mechanics. By focusing on tokenomics alongside community and gaming infrastructure, Based Eggman shows how crypto presale projects can grow beyond short-lived hype. It demonstrates why some investors now see it as one of the top crypto presales and a strong addition to the 2025 crypto presale list. Conclusion: A Market Balancing Legacy and New Presale Crypto Dogecoin remains a vital part of crypto history, carrying its position as one of the earliest and most enduring meme tokens. Its consistent presence in the market shows the staying power of community-driven projects. At the same time, Based Eggman highlights how new token presales are introducing functionality into meme culture. Its gaming ecosystem, structured presale, and liquidity design illustrate how the market is adapting to investor demand for projects with both identity and utility. This balance between legacy and innovation marks an important trend. For traders watching cryptocurrency presales in 2025, both Dogecoin and Based Eggman represent different but connected parts of the evolving crypto story.

In an overview of its expected development, the regulator indicated it intends to boost crypto oversight and combat anonymous trading. Russia’s central bank sees crypto as a threat Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins will be a major risk for the Russian financial sector in the next few years, according to the monetary authority in Moscow. The conclusion comes from a report titled “Key Directions for the Development of the Financial Market of the Russian Federation” which covers the 2026 – 2028 period. The document, which has been prepared for the executive power and the Kremlin, highlights the rapid spread of “money surrogates” around the world. Russia’s main financial regulator uses the term to describe digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and foreign fiat-pegged coins like Tether (USDT). It elaborates: “Given the payment function of some of these digital assets, there are risks of using these instruments, including by Russian citizens, as an alternative means of payment (money surrogate) to national currencies.” The CBR further points to the potential loss of entire investments in crypto, stemming from the absence of an obligated party or collateral. It also notes the increased risk of using coins in illegal activities, due to the anonymous and decentralized nature of some of them. Monetary authority to double down on crypto monitoring What’s new in the draft strategy , quoted by the news outlets Bits.media and RBC Crypto, is the particular emphasis on improving the monitoring of crypto-related activities. From 2026, the regulator plans to obtain detailed information on the operations of entities involved in cryptocurrency mining, which Russia legalized in 2024. The central bank also intends to carefully examine risks that accompany investments in financial instruments based on the value of cryptocurrencies. These include crypto derivatives, which it permitted in May, other digital financial assets ( DFAs ), and some securities. All of them can be acquired only by “ highly qualified ” investors at this point. Bank of Russia also reminded that only licensed market participants are allowed to offer such products and stressed that it will continue to expose financial pyramids and fraud. According to its own data, over 80% of pyramid schemes identified in the first half of 2025 accepted cryptocurrency payments from their victims. CBR to go after anonymous crypto exchange The Russian central bank has listed what it calls “anonymous online crypto exchanges” among “shadow businesses,” alongside illegal online casinos and drug dealers. It announced it’s preparing to launch a new system to identify individuals involved in such undertakings, which will provide commercial banks with quick access to their personal details. The new platform called “Antidrop,” is expected to flag money mules, commonly called “drops” or “ droppers ” in Russian, and their money flows. The latter are often exploited by fraudsters and criminals who use bank accounts and cards registered under their names to process illicit transactions and launder dirty money. However, a package of legislative changes and other measures, introduced to deal with the phenomenon, have been criticized as affecting crypto trading as well, particularly peer-to-peer exchange. Some suspicious transactions, such as multiple transfers between different accounts of the same holder and atypical ATM cash withdrawals exceeding a certain limit, can now result in the blocking of bank accounts. Members of the Russian crypto space already raised the alarm that law enforcement agencies have started questioning traders that somehow got in contact with illicit money. The Central Bank of Russia admitted in its report to an increase in complaints, not only about fraud cases, but also frozen bank accounts of people involved in what it views as illegal cryptocurrency exchange.

However, while Bitcoin's recent recovery to $117,000 has fueled bullish rhetoric, many investors are wondering how BTC will perform, especially after recent price movements. Analyst Rekt Capital, one of the leading figures in the crypto community, has made an impressive prediction. We're in the Final Stage of the Bitcoin Bull Run! At this point, Rekt Capital claimed in its latest video that Bitcoin has entered the final phase of the bull market. The analyst said that BTC is currently holding at the $114,000 support level, which signals the end of the correction phase and a final uptrend towards a new all-time high. However, after reaching a new high, a gradual transition to a bear market may begin in the fourth quarter, according to the analyst. “We are in the final stages of this bull market. But first, we will slowly exit this correction period and gradually transition into the recent uptrend towards all-time highs. Then it looks like we'll slowly but surely descend into a bear market.” What is the Latest Situation in Ethereum and Solana? Apart from Bitcoin, Rekt Capital also shared its predictions for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Accordingly, the analyst noted that Ethereum needs to turn the resistance at $4,613 into support for it to reach the new ATH. Rekt Capital recently noted that Solana is holding its key support levels and showing bullish signals. The analyst added that historically, breaking above key resistance levels for SOL has typically led to a price increase for SOL. *This is not investment advice.

An analysis from CryptoQuant showed Bitcoin investors have been moving their assets away from crypto exchanges in anticipation of the gains that could follow the FOMC meeting. Binance Sees Massive BTC Outflows One exchange that has recorded massive bitcoin (BTC) outflows is Binance. Typically, coins leaving exchanges signal a rise in buying pressure. On the other hand, selling pressure spikes when coins enter crypto trading platforms. Since BTC hit a low of $107,500 two weeks ago, it has recovered and reclaimed the $117,000 level. CryptoQuant analysts claim that the movement of coins to and from exchanges has played a significant role in influencing bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Binance alone has experienced outflows for nine consecutive days, from September 6 to 14. Bitcoin inflows to all exchanges hit a one-year low of 25,000, with the average deposit reducing by 50% compared to July figures. Since increased buying pressure is often a good catalyst for rallies, analysts believe the trend of outflows has significantly contributed to bitcoin’s bounce from $108,000. Will The Fed Cut Rates? As investors continue to position themselves, market experts anticipate that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates during the FOMC meeting. The blockchain prediction market Polymarket shows a 91% chance that the Fed will implement a 25-basis-point cut and 8% odds of the rates being slashed by 50 basis points or more. This month’s FOMC meeting could shape the price trajectory of cryptocurrencies and other risk assets in the coming months. If interest rates are cut as expected, borrowing becomes cheaper, and American consumers have access to more liquidity. This credit usually flows into risk assets like BTC, equities, and precious metals like gold and silver. Although September has a reputation for bearing negative returns for BTC in the past, the outcome of the FOMC meeting could change that. If September does not experience a surge, October, which marks the beginning of the fourth quarter, has historically been seasonally positive for BTC. In fact, analysts predict that BTC will experience its final leg of this bull run over the next three to four months.

Bitcoin is now holding firm above $114,000, and the leading cryptocurrency has regained momentum over the past week that shows signs of renewed bullish strength. According to technical analysis, a hidden bullish divergence is forming with the recent price action this week, and this could be the setup that pushes Bitcoin to new price highs. Bitcoin Revealing Hidden Bullish Divergence Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s weekly candlestick timeframe chart, which was posted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst CrypFlow, shows that Bitcoin could be on track to resume its journey of new all-time highs. Related Reading: Here’s How The Bitcoin Price Macro Correction Could Play Out Next Last week’s close means that Bitcoin has confirmed a higher price low in the weekly timeframe following the pullback that began after its August all-time high. As shown in the weekly candlestick chart below, this low is a higher low compared to June’s low below $100,000. On the other hand, while the price printed a higher low, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) posted a lower low in the same time frame. This mismatch between price and momentum creates what is called a hidden bullish divergence, which is a technical pattern that suggests bullish continuation. The weekly candlestick chart shared by CrypFlow shows Bitcoin defending an important support level around $114,000 and is now on two bullish weekly candlesticks. According to the analyst, if this divergence is confirmed as expected, it could provide the foundation for Bitcoin to push to new highs again. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading 5.7% below its current all-time high of $124,128. Stochastic RSI Flips Bullish The stochastic RSI indicator on the weekly timeframe has just flipped bullish, though confirmation will depend on how Bitcoin closes in the coming sessions. The last time such a bullish flip occurred on the weekly timeframe was in April, just before Bitcoin kickstarted a run that saw it close at bullish prices for seven consecutive weeks. A similar playout could see Bitcoin register at least five more bullish weekly closes in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes ‘Rarest Signal’ Ever, Is A 100% Rally Possible? The upcoming macroeconomic events could introduce volatility into the crypto industry, and this is worth keeping an eye on. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to meet on Wednesday, and expectations are running high that policymakers will announce an interest rate cut of 25 basis points or possibly even 50 basis points. An interest rate cut could have different effects, and history has shown that this could shift investor sentiment toward Bitcoin and other large-cap cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,040, already playing out bullish continuation by being up by 9% from its September open.

In his post on X, Remi urged investors to move XRP, XLM, and HBAR into cold wallets for maximum security. He reinforced his long-held view by declaring, “Ripple XRP is The New Fed/Treasury,” hinting that the token could become a cornerstone of global finance. As of report time, XRP trades near $3 with a circulating supply of about 59.7 billion coins. The token’s steady climb this year reflects growing adoption in cross-border payments and institutional liquidity solutions. $1000 XRP Incoming Faster Than You Think…Especially If We Keep Following The 2017-2018 Run I’ve been telling you to secure your XRP & XLM on a cold wallet at all costs. Those two specifically… As of today I’m adding a third MUST secure on a cold wallet crypto. That… — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) September 17, 2025 Expanding Institutional Interest Institutional engagement with XRP continues to grow . Ripple’s acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road has broadened its reach among banks, payment providers, and large-scale liquidity players. These moves position XRP as a key bridge asset for high-volume transactions, reinforcing its reputation as a practical tool for global value transfer and bolstering confidence among professional investors. The $1,000 Question Despite the enthusiasm, the math behind a $1,000 XRP is daunting . With nearly 60 billion tokens in circulation, such a price would mean a market capitalization approaching $60 trillion—far greater than the combined worth of the world’s largest companies and the entire cryptocurrency market today. Achieving that level would require either a massive reduction in circulating supply, unprecedented worldwide adoption as a reserve currency, or both. It would signal not just another crypto bull run but a profound transformation of the global financial system.

His insistence on moving XRP, XLM, and HBAR to cold storage reflects a growing emphasis on protecting assets from exchange failures and regulatory uncertainty. While his $1,000 target stretches current economic logic, the advice to safeguard key holdings remains sound for any serious investor. Bottom Line The Real Remi Relief’s forecast captures the excitement powering today’s crypto markets and highlights XRP’s expanding ecosystem. Yet a four-figure price would require changes on a scale that goes far beyond past market cycles. For investors, the takeaway is clear: treat such predictions as speculative opinion, stay informed, and pair optimism with thorough research and prudent risk management.

Weather, sports calendars, holidays, school terms – they all change when we pick up a phone, how long we stay, and what feels fun. Seasonal design treats those shifts as a feature, turning mood and timing into lightweight events, mini-goals, and art that keeps a live product fresh without tearing up the core. Why seasons matter to short, round-based play Round-based apps live on rhythm. In spring, players often return after a winter break and want quick wins and gentle learning curves. By late summer, attention spans can shrink in heatwaves, so shorter loops with clearer feedback are more effective. If you want to see how a lean, event-driven loop feels in practice, a clean demo sits here – watch how the interface keeps decisions compact while leaving room for seasonal skins, streaks, and tiny side quests. Spring – re-entry, discovery, and soft streaks Spring is a natural reboot. People sample new titles and re-install old favourites. That’s a good window for “returning player” arcs: three-day streaks with gentle targets, tutorials that act like mini-events, and cosmetics inspired by first tournaments or local derbies. Keep friction low – two taps to join, one tap to claim – and let the art carry the theme rather than burying screens in pop-ups. Think blossom colours, lighter sound palettes, and badges that feel like a fresh start. Summer – heat, short sessions, and mobile-first UX Heat changes behaviour. Sessions get shorter, thumbs get sweatier, phones run hotter. Design for speed and comfort: larger hit areas, high-contrast UI, and fewer full-screen modals. Content works best in bite-sized – 45- to 90-second runs, quick “cool box” challenges, and objectives that can be finished while waiting for iced coffee. Push any heavy stats to optional panels and let the default view stay airy. Seasonal art can lean into beach nights or festival lights without bloating assets that raise device temperature. Autumn – tournaments, mastery, and deeper arcs Autumn brings league schedules, playoffs, and a craving for mastery. This is the time for ladders, weekend cups, and multi-step quests that reward consistent play across weeks. Keep the maths stable while swapping the wrapper: darker palettes, stadium or campus motifs, and soundsets that feel like floodlights coming on. A good autumn arc respects time – flexible checkpoints rather than brittle daily streaks – so a missed evening doesn’t scrap a month of progress. Winter holidays – gifts, generosity, and calmer pacing Holiday design isn’t just snowflakes. People host family, share screens, and lean toward co-op or spectator-friendly moments. Offer party-safe modes with softer audio, clearer captions, and “pass the phone” prompts. Gift tracks work well when they’re transparent – one clean timeline with visible milestones, a toggle to hide spendy bundles, and a clear end date so no one feels chased in January. Seasonal playbook – quick wins you can ship: Reskin without rewiring – swap art, sound cues, and micro-copy while keeping rules and payouts the same. Short tasks in hot months – fewer taps and faster confirmation reduce drop-offs. Flexible quests in busy months – checkpoints over streak-breakers keep people relaxed. One change, one message – each seasonal pop-up should state what changed and what to do next. Economy and rewards – keep value clear, keep effort fair Seasonal bonuses work when the exchange is obvious: do X, receive Y, by date Z. Limit stacking so people don’t need a spreadsheet. Cosmetic sets and harmless flourishes make better “daily gifts” than high-impact multipliers. If you run leaderboards, band them by tier so newcomers see a fair slice rather than page 17 of an endless chart. Clarity beats hype – every time. Live-ops guardrails that prevent fatigue Seasonality can drift into noise if every week shouts. Use a calendar with breathing room between beats, and send fewer, more effective messages. Inside the client, keep a quiet state line – “Double XP ends Sunday 23:00” – instead of interrupting the round with banners. Provide an always-on “mute seasonal effects” switch for players who want a plain skin during exams or deadlines. Respect leads to longer loyalty. Testing without guesswork You don’t need a lab to sanity-check a theme. A simple A/B helps: control art vs seasonal art, identical rules, and measure three things – session starts, average time in round, and completion of the first seasonal task. If art starts to lag but tasks are completed, consider trimming animations or simplifying wording. If time in round creeps up on older phones, compress assets and lighten shaders. Seasonal polish should feel quick on a budget device, not just on a flagship. The wrap-up Good seasonal design treats time of year like a creative constraint. Spring invites re-entry, summer wants speed, autumn rewards mastery, and winter asks for social comfort. Keep the core loop steady, let the wrapper breathe with the calendar, and be upfront about rewards. Do that and themes will lift engagement without wearing people out – the product feels alive, and players leave each session a little brighter than they arrived.

The FOMC is widely expected to trim rates by 25 basis points, bringing the target down to 4.25%. That move — and Powell’s comments right after — could be the spark that decides whether BTC rips toward $130K or slips back toward $114K. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technicals: Rising Wedge and Key Levels Bitcoin is testing a critical zone as price action consolidates just below $117,300. On the 30-minute chart, the structure has formed a rising wedge, a pattern that often means fading momentum in uptrends. The rejection at point D of the wedge shows sellers are in control, especially with the RSI below 50, indicating weakening bullish strength. The focus is now on the $115,800–$114,900 zone, anchored by the 200-MA and the lower boundary of the channel. A break below this area could extend losses to $114,400 and $113,200, areas that have been buy zones. Above $115,800, bulls can retest $117,300. Clearing that would open up $118,500 and $119,350 on the chart. Bitcoin is consolidating near $116.2K inside a rising wedge. $115.8K = key support (200 MA) Break below → $114.4K / $113.2K Hold + reclaim $117.3K → $118.5K / $119.35K Next move hinges on Fed cut today. pic.twitter.com/P9trT80uwr — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 17, 2025 Momentum indicators are neutral. The 50-MA is above price, bearish short-term, but a bullish engulfing or hammer near support could trigger a reversal. Momentum remains balanced, but higher lows keep the broader uptrend intact. If Fed delivers a dovish cut today, BTC could reclaim $117.3K and set its path toward $130K in the coming months. — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 17, 2025 For traders, $115,800 is the line in the sand: above that and we can go long into $118K–$119K, below that and we risk a deeper pullback. In the bigger picture, higher lows across the structure still favor a push to $130,000 in the next few months. Rate Cut, Politics and Market The rate cut comes at a politically charged time. Trump has been pushing for faster easing and installed former White House adviser Stephen Miran to the Fed board this week. His failed bid to remove Governor Lisa Cook however shows ongoing tension over the central bank’s independence. Trump has repeatedly called Jerome Powell “too late” on cuts, adding pressure to act now.The dot plot will be key, showing where policymakers see rates going for the rest of 2025. In June, they saw two cuts, but now traders are pricing in three if the labor market weakens more. For Bitcoin, today could be the trigger. A dovish tone will boost risk and send BTC to resistance and potentially $130,000 by year end. A cautious Fed will have crypto consolidating near current levels until buyers get back in.

The proposals aim to set minimum requirements while considering exemptions for the unique aspects of the crypto sector. The consultation paper CP25/25, published today, explores how existing FCA Handbook rules could apply to cryptoasset activities. The regulator said its goal is to build a competitive and sustainable market that supports innovation while strengthening consumer trust. FCA Unveils Major UK Crypto Rules Overhaul for Investors The FCA consultation seeks to align crypto oversight with standards already in place for banks and other financial institutions. These include governance obligations, systems and controls to combat financial crime, and measures to ensure operational resilience. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) requirements may also be introduced. A central point of discussion is whether the FCA’s Consumer Duty should apply to crypto. The principle requires firms to act in ways that deliver good outcomes for customers. The regulator is also seeking input on how complaints should be handled, including whether customers should be able to refer disputes to the Financial Ombudsman Service. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance, said the aim is to help firms meet common standards without removing the risks inherent in crypto investing. “Our proposals won’t remove the risks of investing in crypto, but they will help build trust in the sector,” he said. Currently, FCA oversight of crypto is limited to financial promotions and measures to prevent financial crime. The consultation marks an intent to expand its remit under the government’s broader plan to integrate crypto into the financial services regulatory regime. In August, Binance UK director Nish Patel said Britain is nearing a comprehensive crypto framework , with stricter rules for retail investors and more flexibility for professionals expected within a year. From the FCA to @Binance , Nish Patel on why Britain is moving from patchwork rules to a full crypto regime. #UKCrypto #Binance https://t.co/GXAnG101lD — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 20, 2025 Notably, the FCA has now set two deadlines for feedback. Stakeholders have until Oct. 15, 2025, to comment on discussion topics such as consumer duty and complaints handling. Responses to the wider consultation proposals must be submitted by Nov. 12, 2025. The regulator said it will review all input and publish final rules in 2026. Furthermore, the FCA announced its plans to hold a series of in-person and virtual events to support industry engagement, and feedback is expected from crypto firms, trade groups, law firms, auditors, and consumer advocacy groups, as well as policymakers and academics. UK Crypto Regulation: FCA Lifts Ban, Crackdown Looms The FCA’s proposals come as it seeks to bring crypto markets under tighter supervision. Notably, the Bank of England plans to limit UK banks’ crypto exposure by 2026, following Basel rules that cap holdings at 1% and require standardized disclosures. Earlier this year in April, the HM Treasury’s draft legislation was published, setting out the legal framework for new regulated cryptoasset activities. Once finalized, firms and individuals conducting such activities in the UK will be required to apply for FCA authorization before operating. Notably, this development follows the FCA lifting its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors starting October 8, ending more than four years of restrictions. This move allows access to ETNs listed on FCA-recognized UK exchanges under strict promotion rules. The UK FCA will allow retail investors to access crypto ETNs starting Oct 8—reversing a 4+ year ban. #FCA #ETNs https://t.co/aK2NkOS0Md — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 1, 2025 Despite this, the UK and US are currently exploring closer collaboration on digital assets, with sources saying Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent held talks involving crypto firms as well as major banks. Similarly, the FCA is advancing plans for a 2026 “gateway regime” that will authorize crypto firms while finalizing rules for stablecoins and custody. The push comes as European banks cautiously expand into crypto, with BBVA offering services to wealthy clients despite ESMA data showing 95% of EU banks remain uninvolved. Meanwhile, the European Union has already advanced its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, while the United States continues to debate federal oversight. The UK framework could set a benchmark for how jurisdictions balance innovation with consumer protection.

Meanwhile, stablecoin deposits, particularly USDT, have risen sharply, showing that investors are building dry powder for potential buying opportunities following the Fed’s announcement, according to the latest CryptoQuant Market insight . On-chain data reveals that exchange inflows have fallen to a 7-day moving average of 25K BTC, the lowest level in over a year, and down substantially from 51K BTC in July. Markets await Fed cuts. BTC inflows hit 25K, a 1-year low, with avg. deposit size halved since July. USDT deposits climb while altcoin inflows signal rotation. pic.twitter.com/dhDLFXeYwV — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) September 16, 2025 Bitcoin & Ethereum Inflows Crash 50% As Largest Holders Stop Selling The average BTC deposit per transaction has also halved from 1.14 BTC in mid-July to 0.57 BTC in September, indicating reduced sell pressure from larger holders. Ethereum inflows into exchanges mirror this trend, sitting at a two-month low with the 7-day average down to 783K ETH , from 1.8 million ETH on August 15. Source: CryptoQuant The average ETH deposit size has similarly declined from 40–45 ETH per transaction at previous peaks to just 30 ETH today, reflecting the same low sell-side activity observed in BTC. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, noted that stablecoin net deposits, particularly for USDT, have surged, reaching $379 million on August 31, the highest level year-to-date. He describes this rising inflow as growing “dry powder” that investors are accumulating to deploy into the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, if the expected 25bps rate cut materializes today. Moreno also revealed that the Bitcoin Bull Score has shifted from “bearish” to “neutral” ahead of the Fed meeting. Source: CryptoQuant The index has climbed from 20 to 50 over the past four days. Two weeks ago, Bitcoin hit a low of around $108,000; since then, it has recovered to $115,000. One key factor in this recovery is the movement of coins to and from exchanges. As a basic principle, outflows signal buying pressure (coins leaving exchanges), while inflows indicate selling pressure (coins moving onto exchanges). Over the past nine days, Binance has recorded only outflows . This trend appears to be a major catalyst behind Bitcoin’s recent bounce from $108k to $116k. The pattern is coming at a crucial time, given that the FOMC meeting occurs today. Most analysts, including BitMEX Co-founder Arthur Hayes, expect the Fed to cut rates, with prediction markets like Polymarket showing a 91% probability of a rate cut. With Fed board member Miran now confirmed, the MSM is preparing the world for the Fed's ""third mandate"" which is essentially yield curve control. LFG! YCC -> $BTC = $1m pic.twitter.com/jlPQZJ0cHm — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) September 16, 2025 The consistent outflows from Binance also reflect investors’ early positioning ahead of this event, which is fueling the bull case for Bitcoin to finally break the $120k psychological resistance. BTC is now posting its best September performance in 13 years. Historically, whenever Bitcoin has closed September in green, October and November have been extremely bullish, with an average combined gain of 35% . Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Lower Channel Breakout Targets $128K-$132K Crypto analyst Rekt Capital shared that Bitcoin needs just one daily close and successful post-reclaim retest of ~$117,200 to confirm a return into the blue daily range at $120k and resume another leg of the bull run. #BTC Bitcoin just needs one Daily Close and successful post-reclaim retest of ~$117200 (green circle) to confirm a return into this blue-blue Daily range $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/ycGcDcdrCK — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) September 16, 2025 On the technical front, the Bitcoin daily chart shows several key patterns converging to suggest a bullish outlook. Bitcoin is currently trading at $116,465, positioned within a well-defined ascending channel that has guided price action since May. The chart shows Bitcoin has successfully tested and held the lower boundary of this channel multiple times, demonstrating strong institutional support around the $108,000-$111,000 zone. After hitting resistance near the first resistance target around $125,000 in August, Bitcoin consolidated and pulled back to retest support, typical healthy price action in a bull market. The recent bounce from the channel’s lower boundary suggests this pullback may be complete. The upper channel boundary points toward the $128,000-$132,000 area, matching the marked “Next target” on the chart. This target zone represents a logical extension of the current bull trend and suggests Bitcoin could see a 12-15% rally from current levels if it can break through the initial resistance cluster.

Alongside this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing buyers as the next meme coin pick with traders looking for diversification. GameStop’s Bitcoin treasury boost GameStop has officially joined the list of major firms holding Bitcoin as part of its corporate balance sheet. The company reported that it bought $500 million worth of Bitcoin in Q2, which by the end of the period had grown to $528.6 million in value. That $28.6 million unrealized gain helped offset some of its net losses. The gaming retailer also revealed it is measuring its holdings using Coinbase pricing, aligning with industry standards. This puts GameStop among a handful of well-known public companies using Bitcoin as a hedge against weak sales and slowing console demand. Net sales fell to $674 million in the same period, but cost cuts and its collectibles division supported the balance sheet. GameStop’s decision to keep Bitcoin on its books signals a treasury approach similar to firms like MicroStrategy and shows how BTC is shaping corporate finance strategies. Bitcoin pushes GameStop’s stock The market reacted quickly after GameStop disclosed its Bitcoin holdings. Shares rose 1.5% in regular hours and surged as much as 7% in after-hours trading to $25.29. With a market capitalization now at $10.55 billion, the boost in confidence is clear. The stock, however, has remained mostly flat across the past year, dropping by 1.38% and holding a high short interest. That volatility keeps GME on watchlists for traders. Still, the Bitcoin position has been seen as a positive step that could set the stage for future support if the crypto market trends higher. The move also places GameStop alongside a rising number of companies adding Bitcoin to their reserves. Bitcoin market outlook While Bitcoin has traded sideways between $110,055 and $116,083 this week, experts suggest a possible surge later this year. Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz highlighted that corporate treasuries are also exploring altcoins, with some firms like BitMine and Forward Industries piling into Ethereum and Solana. Still, Novogratz expects Bitcoin to see renewed energy once the U.S. Federal Reserve begins rate cuts. He also pointed to new regulatory signals, such as Nasdaq filing to allow tokenized versions of stocks and ETFs, as another positive trigger. Bitcoin’s role as a store of value continues to be reinforced while altcoins create additional use cases. MAGACOIN FINANCE: best meme coin to watch For traders watching where capital rotates next, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as one of the best meme coins to buy right now. With thousands already jumping in, buyers see it as a fresh hedge alongside Bitcoin and altcoins. Many meme tokens have surged 50x in past cycles, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early, leaving room for growth as listings on decentralized exchanges approach. Audits and verification add a layer of trust, while its smaller size compared to older tokens makes it easier for new buyers to enter. With activity growing by the hour and FOMO building, this altcoin is drawing serious curiosity from retail traders. What traders should do next GameStop’s Bitcoin bet shows how crypto is becoming part of mainstream strategies. For individual traders, the same principle applies: balancing Bitcoin with altcoins can open new opportunities.

The digital asset world is constantly evolving, and now, a major player is set to transform how we access property markets. Mavryk Network has successfully raised a substantial $10 million , signaling a massive leap forward in its ambitious plan to Mavryk tokenizes UAE real estate . This significant investment is poised to open up the lucrative United Arab Emirates property market to a broader global audience, leveraging the power of blockchain technology. How is Mavryk Tokenizing UAE Real Estate with this Investment? The recent funding round, spearheaded by Mavryk’s strategic partner, Multibank Group, highlights strong confidence in this innovative venture. Mavryk and Multibank Group previously forged a powerful alliance with the goal of tokenizing an astonishing $10 billion worth of real estate assets across the UAE. This latest capital injection will accelerate their efforts, allowing them to expand operations and solidify the infrastructure needed for such a large-scale undertaking. Tokenization involves converting real-world assets, like property, into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents a fractional ownership share of the asset. Consequently, this process breaks down traditional barriers to entry, making high-value assets more accessible and liquid for everyday investors. What are the Benefits of Tokenizing UAE Real Estate? The concept of tokenized real estate brings a host of advantages for both investors and property owners alike. Firstly, it dramatically increases market liquidity . Historically, real estate has been an illiquid asset, difficult to buy and sell quickly. Tokenization changes this by enabling instant trading of fractional shares on secondary markets. Fractional Ownership: Investors can own a piece of a high-value property without needing to purchase the entire asset. This lowers the entry barrier significantly. Global Accessibility: Blockchain technology transcends geographical boundaries, allowing international investors to participate in the UAE’s booming real estate market with ease. Enhanced Transparency: All transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, providing unparalleled transparency and reducing the risk of fraud. Lower Transaction Costs: By streamlining processes and reducing intermediaries, tokenization can lead to lower fees compared to traditional real estate transactions. Ultimately, this approach empowers a new generation of investors to diversify their portfolios with real estate assets, previously only available to institutional players or high-net-worth individuals. The vision for how Mavryk tokenizes UAE real estate is about democratizing wealth creation. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Mavryk in UAE Real Estate Tokenization While the potential is immense, venturing into real estate tokenization in a dynamic market like the UAE also presents unique challenges. Regulatory frameworks for digital assets are still evolving globally, and ensuring compliance across jurisdictions is crucial. Furthermore, educating traditional real estate stakeholders about the benefits and security of blockchain technology requires considerable effort. However, the opportunities far outweigh the obstacles. The UAE has consistently shown a forward-thinking approach to innovation, actively promoting blockchain adoption across various sectors. This supportive environment, combined with the region’s robust real estate market, positions Mavryk for significant growth. As Mavryk tokenizes UAE real estate , it stands to become a pioneer, setting new standards for digital asset integration in property markets worldwide. The partnership with Multibank Group, a financial services giant, also provides a strong foundation for navigating these complexities and building trust. In conclusion, Mavryk Network’s successful $10 million funding round marks a pivotal moment for the intersection of blockchain and real estate. By focusing on the vibrant UAE market, Mavryk is not just raising capital; it is building a new paradigm for property investment. The ability to own a fraction of a luxurious Dubai apartment or a bustling commercial space is no longer a distant dream but an imminent reality. This initiative promises to make real estate investment more democratic, efficient, and accessible than ever before, truly revolutionizing how we perceive and interact with property assets in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is real estate tokenization? A1: Real estate tokenization is the process of converting property rights into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents a fractional share of ownership, making it easier to buy, sell, and trade parts of a property. Q2: How does Mavryk Network plan to tokenize $10 billion in UAE real estate? A2: Mavryk Network, in partnership with Multibank Group, plans to identify and onboard high-value properties in the UAE, converting their ownership into digital tokens.

After nearly a year of sitting still, the U.S. central bank is expected to lower its federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the end of its September meeting. According to CME’s FedWatch Tool, there’s a 96% chance of a quarter-point cut and only a 4% chance of a 50bps cut. This is the first rate cut after a 10-month pause since December 2024. That matters. When the Fed cuts after long breaks like this, small-cap returns have historically outperformed. Michael Graham, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said this setup has only happened four times since 1980 (excluding June 1989), and every time the Russell 2000 outpaced the S&P 500. Average returns were 35% for small caps versus 23% for large caps in the following 12 months. Small caps benefit more when the Fed cuts after a long pause Graham noted the unique nature of this cycle. “One somewhat unique characteristic of this easing cycle has been the elongated nature, with a long pause since the last rate cut in December 2024,” he said. “Returns following rate cuts that have come after a pause of at least 126 trading days are encouraging.” Small companies tend to carry more debt and rely more on bank loans. So when the Fed makes borrowing cheaper, they feel the relief faster. Canaccord’s report earlier this month pointed out that easier monetary policy boosts smaller firms more than large ones because of their higher leverage and tighter cash positions. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, backed that up. He told CNBC’s Squawk on the Street that the Fed’s approach is bullish for small-cap performance. “I think it means we have a dovish Fed again,” Tom said. “That’s kind of a green light for small caps.” The Russell 2000, which tracks 2,000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell 3000, has already been showing signs of investor interest, especially through the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). Rate cut expected but market split on short-term reaction Not everyone is convinced this cut is the right call. Ed Yardeni, longtime market watcher, said in a note Tuesday that cutting rates now is like “throwing gasoline on a fire.” He said the action isn’t necessary given that the U.S. economy is still growing and there’s no financial crisis. “More often than not in the past, monetary easing cycles started when the previous tightening of monetary policy triggered a financial crisis,” Ed wrote. “But the Fed cut the fed funds rate by 100bps at the end of last year even though there was no credit crunch and no recession.” He warned that continued cuts could push inflation above the Fed’s target and fuel more risky speculation in stocks. And speculation is definitely in play. The S&P 500 is already up 12.3% in 2025. High-flyers like Paramount Skydance and Palantir Technologies have surged 67% and 125% year-to-date. Historical trends also show the stock market tends to rally when the Fed cuts while the S&P 500 is within 1% of its record high. But that rally might not last. Some analysts expect a “sell the news” reaction. Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said Wednesday might bring a short-term drop. “Many feel there will be a ‘sell the news’ response to this outcome since the narrative has already swung aggressively toward the dovish end of the spectrum,” Adam wrote. JPMorgan’s trading desk thinks the same, as it warned that investors could pull back as they weigh several moving parts, like the broader macro outlook, future Fed policy decisions, thin corporate buybacks, weaker retail trader activity, and quarter-end portfolio reshuffling.

In a post on X, he commented on what he sees as the constant chase for the next news story. He stated, “The crypto degenerates are addicted to chasing future news,” adding that the cycle of “breaking this, breaking that” creates an environment where “no one really knows what they are buying, really.” In contrast to this environment, Van Code emphasized his own approach. He explained that he purchases XRP because of his daily work with the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which he says allows him to see “its value and merits.” His comments highlight a distinction between speculation-driven trading and utility-driven engagement with blockchain technology. One thing is clear: The crypto degenerates are addicted to chasing future news. Breaking this, breaking that. It's a disaster, no one really knows what they are buying, really… I buy XRP cos I work with the XRPL daily, I see it's value and merits. — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) September 16, 2025 Views on XRPL and the Crypto Space The discussion extended further in responses where Van Code addressed broader questions about the XRPL and the unpredictable nature of the crypto sector. One commenter asked about the potential for debt issuance on the XRPL and how it might affect liquidity. Van Code replied that “it’s not impossible, improbable maybe,” while describing the wider crypto space as a “wild West” that remains in a state of formation. He added that it is important to expect anything to happen, concluding with the observation that “one thing for sure, it’s entertaining.” While his own interest in XRP stems from working directly with the technology, he acknowledged the unpredictability that remains part of the environment. However, the market is changing, as the U.S. is now working to advance crypto regulation , and proper regulation could build trust in the market and increase institutional participation, which products like ETFs are already doing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 More Community Perspectives Several community members responded with their own views on the issues Van Code raised. One participant expressed frustration at what they saw as constant noise in the sector, suggesting that companies should be allowed to focus on building rather than dealing with hype. Questions also came up regarding the usage of the XRPL. One user asked how he responds to claims that the network has little activity. Van Code answered that he cannot take financial advice from a homeless person, and in this case, will not take technology advice from someone he described as “intellectually broke.” XRP has set activity records in 2025 , and another commenter pointed out that observing the XRPL in action daily demonstrates more activity than headlines might suggest.

According to the company’s latest notice, Metaplanet Income Corp will be based in Miami, Florida, with an initial capital of $15 million. The new subsidiary will focus on Bitcoin income generation strategies, such as investing in BTC-related derivatives. The Japanese treasury firm began its Bitcoin treasury strategy in late 2024, generating revenue and income and emerging as a key growth driver. The latest expansion will strengthen its position by expanding to Bitcoin derivatives and income products, while operating parallel to the Bitcoin accumulation business. Miami subsidiary to balance risk management for Metaplanet According to the latest notice , the goal of the launch of the U.S. subsidiary is to balance risk management for the Japanese firm’s core business by operating separately from the crypto treasury holdings business. Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet CEO, will lead the Florida team alongside Dylan LeClair and Darren Winia as directors. In a statement , he described the business as the company’s growth engine and highlighted the profitable nature of diversifying Bitcoin value generation beyond the core accumulation strategy. *Notice of Expansion of Bitcoin Income Generation Business through Establishment of New US Subsidiary, “Metaplanet Income Corp.”* pic.twitter.com/fpzXZ3g25T — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) September 17, 2025 The Japanese treasury firm acknowledged in its statement that monetary value is not expected for the remaining period of the year. However, the company said it would promptly disclose any information to align with the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) requirements. The firm’s expansion to the U.S. follows a series of fundraising from both local and overseas. Metaplanet raised approximately $1.4 billion by issuing 385 million shares to overseas investors, surpassing its original target of $880 million. Approximately $1.2B of the proceeds will support BTC acquisitions, and approximately $139 million will accelerate the expansion of the U.S. subsidiary. The Tokyo-based treasury firm’s latest U.S. front is to balance Bitcoin’s long-term value with the need for diversifying and generating stable income. The company statement revealed that Metaplanet Income Corp will utilize derivatives and other income-generating strategies to provide recurring revenue streams. Gerovich emphasized that the combination is central to its goal of strengthening shareholder value while positioning the firm as a global leader in corporate Bitcoin accumulation. Gerovich says Miami expansion marks the next phase of Bitcoin income growth Gerovich described the participation from international hedge funds and mutual funds as an endorsement of the firm’s Bitcoin strategy and a foundation for the next phase. Metaplanet’s current holdings stand at 20,136 BTC, valued at approximately $2.3 billion, with Bitcoin’s average price of $116,288. The firm is ranked sixth amongst other BTC treasuries, with the Michael Saylors Strategy leading with 638,985 BTC holdings. Two days ago, Cryptopolitan reported that Strategy had acquired 525 BTC in the latest purchase round, driving its accumulation to 638,985 BTC but showing a slowdown in corporate treasury Bitcoin accumulation. Other recent accumulations captured in the report include Capital B adding 48 BTC and H100 accumulating 21 BTC in the past week. BTC Treasuries currently hold a total accumulation of 3.7 million BTC. Some analysts noted that Miami has established itself as a central hub for cryptocurrency operations with aligned regulatory frameworks to support the adoption of digital assets. The creation of Metaplanet Income Corp provides the framework to build on the momentum of a business that has already proved resilient in different market conditions. Metaplanet’s CEO framed the expansion to the U.S. as part of Metaplanet’s long-term vision, showing his confidence in the company’s strategy. He described the Miami subsidiary as a continuation of a trajectory that enables the firm to institutionalize a profitable business line and strengthen its capacity to deliver value. The firm has highlighted that the financial impact for this year may be limited, but pledged to update investors regularly as it continues to expand.

This event marks one of the year’s most substantial single-day inflows, signaling growing confidence among dedicated long-term investors. Understanding This Massive Bitcoin Accumulation Surge CryptoQuant contributor Burak Kesmeci reported a staggering 29,685 BTC flowing into these dedicated addresses. Valued at roughly $3.4 billion, this transaction is the second-largest single-day inflow this year. Notably, it was executed over-the-counter (OTC), a method favored by larger institutional or high-net-worth investors. Accumulation addresses are wallets consistently acquiring assets for long-term holding, crucially, without any history of selling. They act as digital vaults, reflecting strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future value. Why Does Bitcoin Accumulation Matter for the Market? Such substantial inflows into accumulation addresses are often a bullish signal. When significant Bitcoin moves off exchanges into long-term wallets, it reduces the readily available supply for trading. This reduced supply, combined with demand, can potentially exert upward pressure on prices over time. Reduced Selling Pressure: Assets in accumulation addresses are less likely to be sold, enhancing market stability. Strong Conviction: Signals large players believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Market Confidence: Can inspire broader investor confidence. Identifying These Bitcoin Accumulators While identities remain private, the OTC nature of the transaction points to sophisticated participants. These likely include: Institutional Investors: Funds or corporations adding Bitcoin to balance sheets. High-Net-Worth Individuals: Wealthy individuals diversifying portfolios with crypto. Long-Term Believers: Entities with strong conviction in Bitcoin’s role as digital gold. Their collective action in this massive Bitcoin accumulation event speaks volumes about their long-term expectations for the asset. What Are the Broader Implications of This Bitcoin Accumulation Trend? This trend suggests a maturing market where investors focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value and scarcity. It highlights a shift towards a more strategic, long-term investment approach. As more Bitcoin is locked away in these accumulation addresses, the available supply for daily trading dwindles, potentially making each unit more valuable. These significant inflows demonstrate resilient investor sentiment, even amidst market volatility. It indicates that price dips are seen as buying opportunities by those with a long-term vision, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a robust store of value. The recent inflow of nearly 30,000 BTC into accumulation addresses is a powerful indicator of enduring confidence in Bitcoin. It reflects a strategic long-term outlook from a significant market segment, signaling a commitment to holding through various cycles. This trend underscores the unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s future, reinforcing its position as a premier digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Bitcoin accumulation addresses? A1: Wallets consistently acquiring BTC for long-term holding, with no selling history. They reflect strong investor conviction. Q2: How significant was the 29,685 BTC inflow? A2: Second-largest single-day inflow this year, valued at ~3.4 billion, indicating substantial confidence. Q3: Why is an OTC transaction important? A3: Used by large investors to buy/sell significant Bitcoin without causing public exchange price volatility. Q4: What does this trend mean for Bitcoin’s price? A4: Reduces circulating supply, potentially exerting upward pressure on prices long-term, combined with demand. Found this analysis insightful?

However, the token will reach $18.59 by the end of 2026. Why is NEO down? NEO has dropped recently due to several key factors. Negative market sentiment and decreased investor confidence have driven selling activity, pushing the current NEO price lower this week. Unfavorable technical indicators, such as bearish signals from moving averages and an unstable RSI score below 50, have contributed to the downward momentum. Will NEO reach $25?

This exciting expansion, however, brings new challenges, particularly in safeguarding against illicit financial activities. To address this, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has issued a significant directive: banks must now integrate blockchain analytics into their compliance programs. This move marks a pivotal moment, underscoring the critical need for advanced technological tools to maintain financial integrity in the digital age. What Exactly Did the NYDFS Mandate Regarding Blockchain Analytics ? The NYDFS directive is clear and forward-thinking. It emphasizes that as banks broaden their services to include virtual currency operations, their existing compliance frameworks must adapt. This adaptation specifically involves adopting new technologies and tools, with a strong focus on blockchain analytics . The regulator’s aim is to ensure that banks are adequately equipped to identify, monitor, and prevent a diverse range of risks associated with virtual assets, including money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud. It’s about proactive defense in a rapidly changing landscape. Why is Blockchain Analytics Crucial for Modern Banking Compliance? Traditional anti-money laundering (AML) tools, while effective for conventional finance, often fall short when dealing with the unique characteristics of blockchain transactions. This is where blockchain analytics steps in, offering unparalleled advantages: Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain, by its nature, is a public ledger. Analytics tools can parse this data, revealing transaction origins, destinations, and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. Risk Identification: These tools can flag suspicious activities, identify high-risk wallets, and detect connections to known illicit entities or sanctioned addresses. Regulatory Adherence: By using blockchain analytics , banks can demonstrate a robust commitment to regulatory requirements, ensuring they meet the stringent standards set by bodies like the NYDFS. Operational Efficiency: Automating the monitoring of virtual currency transactions reduces manual effort and allows compliance teams to focus on more complex investigations. This technology is not just a regulatory burden; it’s a strategic asset for banks navigating the virtual currency space. Overcoming Challenges in Implementing Blockchain Analytics While the benefits are substantial, integrating blockchain analytics isn’t without its hurdles. Banks may face challenges such as: Data Volume and Complexity: The sheer volume of blockchain data can be overwhelming. Specialized analytics platforms are needed to process and make sense of this information efficiently. Talent Gap: There’s a growing need for compliance professionals who understand both traditional finance and blockchain technology. Training and upskilling existing teams are vital. Integration with Legacy Systems: Seamlessly incorporating new analytics tools into established banking IT infrastructures requires careful planning and execution. Evolving Threat Landscape: Illicit actors constantly find new ways to exploit vulnerabilities. Blockchain analytics solutions must be continually updated to stay ahead. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive strategy that combines technological investment with human capital development and continuous adaptation. Actionable Insights for Banks: Embracing Blockchain Analytics Effectively For banks looking to meet the NYDFS mandate and strengthen their virtual currency compliance, here are some actionable insights: Invest in Reputable Solutions: Partner with established blockchain analytics providers known for their accuracy, comprehensive data coverage, and regular updates. Develop Internal Expertise: Provide specialized training for compliance, risk management, and IT teams on blockchain technology and analytics tools. Integrate Holistically: Ensure that blockchain analytics is not an isolated function but is integrated into the broader AML and fraud prevention frameworks. Stay Informed: Regularly review regulatory guidance and industry best practices to adapt compliance programs as the virtual currency ecosystem evolves. By proactively embracing these measures, banks can transform regulatory compliance from a mere obligation into a competitive advantage. Conclusion: The NYDFS’s directive for banks to adopt blockchain analytics marks a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and the virtual currency world. It underscores a crucial recognition: effective financial oversight in the digital age demands advanced, specialized tools. By leveraging the power of blockchain analytics , financial institutions can not only meet regulatory expectations but also proactively safeguard their operations, protect their customers, and foster trust in the burgeoning virtual asset market. This mandate is a clear signal that robust, technologically driven compliance is no longer optional—it’s essential for a secure and thriving financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is blockchain analytics? Blockchain analytics refers to the process of examining, identifying, and tracking transactions on a blockchain ledger. These tools help identify patterns, sources, and destinations of funds, which is crucial for compliance and preventing illicit activities. 2. Why did NYDFS mandate blockchain analytics for banks?

According to the announcement , submitted on September 17, 2025, the offering would allow the company to sell shares flexibly through Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to raise capital for its Solana-focused strategy, working capital, and future business expansion. Forward Industries Positions as Leading Solana Treasury With $4B Plan The ATM program, filed under an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC, will allow Cantor Fitzgerald to sell shares “at the market” under mutually agreed terms. Notably, it was noted that the funds raised will not be held in escrow or trust, with proceeds directed to general corporate purposes and Solana acquisitions. The move comes shortly after the company closed a $1.65 billion private placement earlier this month , which funded the purchase of 6.8 million Solana (SOL) tokens valued at approximately $1.58 billion. Forward Industries announces a $1.65B PIPE led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto & Multicoin Capital to back its Solana-focused treasury strategy. #Solana $SOL https://t.co/3C0YVSMWmu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 8, 2025 That transaction, led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, marked the largest Solana-focused digital asset treasury raise to date. Forward Industries’ stock rose 15% following the closure of the deal, underscoring investor interest in the company’s pivot toward blockchain assets. According to the latest filing, proceeds from the new $4 billion ATM program would be deployed to expand its Solana treasury holdings, strengthen its balance sheet, and support income-generating investments. The company said the program provides a “flexible and efficient mechanism” to scale its Solana position and pursue long-term growth opportunities. Kyle Samani, co-founder of Multicoin Capital, who was recently appointed Chairman of Forward Industries’ Board, said the new program builds on momentum from the initial financing. “Having recently completed the largest Solana-focused treasury raise to date and initial purchases of more than 6.8 million SOL, the ATM Program enhances our ability to continue scaling that position,” Samani said in a press release. The company’s governance has also undergone changes alongside its financing push. Interim Chief Executive Officer Michael Pruitt has joined the Board, while Galaxy’s Chris Ferraro and Jump Crypto’s Saurabh Sharma have been named observers. Samani’s appointment as chairman signals closer alignment with Solana’s institutional backers and the company’s stated vision of building the world’s largest Solana treasury. Forward Industries’ growing focus on Solana reflects rising institutional confidence in the blockchain. Investors in its $1.65 billion private placement included a broad mix of global firms, asset managers, and angel investors across the digital asset space. The company said this broad participation highlighted the appeal of its role as a publicly traded vehicle for exposure to Solana’s growth. Forward Industries now positions itself as a leading Solana treasury company, aiming to expand beyond its recent multibillion-dollar purchases and further cement its role at the center of institutional investment in the Solana ecosystem. Solana Treasuries Surge Past $4B as Corporate Accumulation Accelerates Corporate demand for Solana continues to escalate, with new disclosures showing reserves climbing past $4 billion. According to data from the Strategic Solana Reserve, 17 companies now hold a combined 17.11 million SOL, valued at $4.03 billion at current prices, equal to nearly 3% of the token’s circulating supply. The surge follows a series of high-profile acquisitions. On September 12, blockchain data revealed Galaxy Digital purchased 2.31 million SOL worth $536 million , transferring tokens from Binance, Bybit, and Coinbase wallets. @GalaxyDigital has reportedly acquired 2.31 million Solana (SOL) tokens, valued at nearly $536 million, according to blockchain data. #Solana #Galaxy https://t.co/5L1ltcaqJE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 12, 2025 Days later, Galaxy executed another $306 million buy involving 1.2 million SOL , bringing its five-day total to 6.5 million tokens valued around $1.55 billion. While the firm has not confirmed the moves, the scale has fueled speculation over its role in shaping Solana’s emerging treasury market. Other firms are also expanding aggressively. On September 10, Canada’s SOL Strategies debuted on Nasdaq under the ticker STKE , listing with $94 million in Solana holdings and marking the first Solana-focused public company on a U.S. exchange. Canadian digital asset firm @solstrategies_ has filed for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market amid its US market expansion strategy. #Sol #Solana https://t.co/DUGDvhmzaK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 Meanwhile, Upexi Inc. has become one of the largest corporate holders, reporting 2,018,419 SOL worth $447 million, most of which is staked to generate roughly $105,000 in daily rewards. BIT Mining Limited, preparing to rebrand as SOLAI, has steadily added to its reserves, now totaling more than 44,000 SOL . Chairman Bo Yu said validator operations would remain central to the firm’s strategy of securing the network while capturing staking yields. BIT Mining plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million to build a sol treasury as part of a broader expansion into the blockchain. #Bitcoin #Solana https://t.co/QLcqN52npw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 10, 2025 The momentum has also drawn new entrants. Helius Medical Technologies announced a $500 million private placement led by Pantera Capital, with stapled warrants that could lift its Solana treasury to $1.25 billion. While Solana treasuries are growing rapidly, they remain modest compared to corporate reserves of Bitcoin and Ether, which are valued at $428 billion and $22 billion, respectively.

In a significant move, the prominent U.S.-based exchange has officially opened deposits for MEW, a popular Solana-based, cat-themed memecoin. This MEW coin listing on Binance.US marks a pivotal moment, offering U.S. traders direct access to a token that has captured considerable attention within the vibrant memecoin landscape. For many enthusiasts, this development signifies increased liquidity and broader market exposure for the innovative digital asset. What Exactly is MEW and Why is its Binance.US Listing Important?

According to a recent announcement , the company received both the Virtual Currency Business Activity License and Money Transmission License from NYDFS, which will allow the exchange to serve institutions and advanced traders across New York State. “New York is widely recognized as being at the forefront of virtual currency regulation,” said Tom Farley, CEO of Bullish and former President of the New York Stock Exchange. This regulatory breakthrough builds on Bullish’s recent $1.15 billion record IPO entirely through blockchain-based stablecoins and its MiCAR license uplift with Germany’s BaFin for European Union operations. 1/2 We are proud to announce that Bullish has been granted a BitLicense and Money Transmission License by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

The BitLicense approval will enable the company to tap into institutional demand for regulated crypto services using resources from its August IPO debut on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker BLSH. In August, Bullish became the first U.S.-listed company to raise over $1 billion entirely in stablecoins, with backing from billionaire Peter Thiel and settlements processed across multiple blockchain networks, including Solana. Earlier this month, the company also completed its MiCAR license uplift through German regulator BaFin, which provides the foundation for serving institutional clients across the 27-member European Union. The company’s Frankfurt-based European headquarters puts it under ongoing supervision by BaFin, a regulator trusted by institutional investors and major financial authorities globally. “We believe that clear regulation drives responsible market evolution and institutional engagement,” said Chris Tyrer, President of Bullish Exchange. Supporting this institutional focus, prospective institutional customers and advanced traders in New York State can now contact Bullish relationship managers to begin the onboarding process for spot trading and custody services. The exchange operates a high-performance central limit order book matching engine integrated with automated market making to provide institutional-grade liquidity. Beyond its trading platform, Bullish’s broader ecosystem includes CoinDesk Indices for digital asset benchmarking, CoinDesk Data for market analytics, and CoinDesk Insights for media and events. U.S. Becomes Magnet for Global Crypto Firms as Regulatory Clarity Emerges Bullish’s New York license positions the exchange within a broader wave of blockchain companies establishing or returning to U.S. operations as regulatory frameworks solidify. Recent data shows over 5,000 blockchain firms now operate in the United States , with more expected as the Trump administration seeks to position America as a global digital asset hub. Just last week, prediction market Polymarket is targeting a $10 billion valuation as it prepares to relaunch U.S. operations after securing CFTC clearance through its acquisition of Florida-based derivatives exchange QCX. Similarly, the TON Foundation is establishing a U.S. hub as part of its global expansion beyond Telegram’s reach, while Netherlands-based Deribit and London’s Wintermute have also entered American markets. “The signal from US capital markets is unmistakable: institutional demand and clearer rules are well underway,” a Nexo spokesperson previously told Cryptonews as the crypto lending platform announced its return to the U.S. market. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has recently called on the U.S. to “ reshore the crypto businesses that fled ,” while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declared America has entered the “ golden age of crypto .” However, the competitive landscape has intensified as crypto companies rush IPO timelines to capitalize on favorable market conditions, with Wall Street banks revealing a $15 billion pipeline before September.

However, analysts still see upside potential, with chart signals hinting at a push above $5K this month if momentum holds. Taking Profits Ethereum’s (ETH) price has been hovering around $4,500 in the past two days, or performing better than at the beginning of September when it briefly dipped below $4,300. Large investors (known as whales) seem to have seized the opportunity and sold some of their holdings within that period. The X user Ali Martinez revealed that these market participants dumped 90,000 ETH, worth over $400 million. The collective possessions of that investor group have lessened to 15.4 million tokens, representing 12.7% of the asset’s circulating supply. Selling efforts of that type are generally considered bearish since they increase the amount of coins on the open market and could trigger a price decline (assuming demand stays the same or heads south). Furthermore, smaller players may mimic the whales’ actions and also exit the ecosystem. It is important to note that the upcoming FOMC meeting (during which interest rates in the US are expected to be lowered ) might have prompted big investors to reduce their exposure. T he event, scheduled for today, is interpreted as bullish in the long term for the crypto market, but may result in a short-term correction (as some X users suggested ). Price Targets Despite the offloading by whales, numerous analysts remain optimistic that ETH can post additional gains in the near future and even hit a new all-time high as early as this month. X user ZYN spotted the formation of a bullish cross on the asset’s price chart, reminding that double-digit pumps followed such setups in the summer. “If a bullish cross plays out again, ETH will trade above $5,000 this month,” they predicted. Ted chipped in, too, making a more modest prediction. He noted that ETH has recently bounced back from its $4,500 support zone, envisioning an ascent to $4,700 if this level holds. “In case of a breakdown, ETH will revisit the $4,000-$4,200 region,” he added.

The new markets will open on October 13, after regulatory approval. CME Group will expand its crypto products with options on the futures markets of Solana (SOL) and XRP. The futures market will start on October 13, after regulatory review and approval. The options will allow the trading of MicroSol, XRP, and MicroXRP futures, with expiry dates available every business day, monthly, and quarterly. The new products will be added to the existing BTC and ETH options markets . ‘ The launch of these options contracts builds on the significant growth and increasing liquidity we have seen across our suite of Solana and XRP futures, ’ said Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products. The options contracts will have two main sizes, tracking the futures contracts. The new market will be suitable for sophisticated institutional traders, as well as active individual traders. The addition of options markets singles out XRP and SOL as liquid enough to offer the potential to bet on a market direction. The options on futures arrive a few months after the launch of SOL futures. Both SOL and XRP had peak volumes in August, though XRP activity has slowed down in September. XRP and SOL options to tap both institutions and active traders Crypto options are one of the indicators of market attitudes, with XRP and SOL receiving a new way to gauge sentiment. The contracts will be supported by the Cumberland team. ‘ As one of the biggest liquidity providers in the ecosystem, the Cumberland team is excited to support CME Group’s continued expansion of crypto offerings, ’ said Roman Makarov, Head of Cumberland Options Trading at DRW. ‘ The launch of options on Solana and XRP futures is the latest example of the move beyond the staples of bitcoin and ether and demonstrates continued demand from the market to have exposure to a broader set of products. ’ FalconX, another leading crypto prime brokerage, will also assist in market efficiency and liquidity. According to FalconX, the emergence of treasuries and ETFs has increased the need for hedging tools through options positions. XRP and SOL are among the most probable assets to add new ETFs in the coming months, and SOL has started growing its list of treasury companies. CME to offer trading at settlement (TAS) mechanism The SOL and XRP futures markets will offer another regulated feature, offering more predictable orders. CME announced plans to launch trading at settlement (TAS) mechanisms, which will allow traders to place orders at the day’s settlement price. CME futures settle daily at 4 A.M. Eastern time, offering a predictable hour to fulfill orders. TAS mechanisms allow the purchase of assets at a more predictable price, avoiding time constraints and daily fluctuations. Crypto trading has stronger and weaker periods, but TAS orders will allow traders to track the underlying asset indexes, which take into account the settlement price. Don’t just read crypto news.

Notably, some assets have strong backing from institutional investment products and scaling upgrades, making the ambitious target of a $50 billion market cap increasingly attainable. To this end, below are two assets with notable potential to reach this milestone: Dogecoin (DOGE) Despite its origins as a meme coin, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has steadily gained traction as an investable asset with growing appeal to mainstream investors. The launch of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust this year opened the door for institutional participation, a major shift from the retail-driven rallies of the past. At the same time, the asset could see further capital inflows, given the rising odds of a spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) for DOGE being approved in the United States. As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.26 with a market capitalization of $40.08 billion. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s ( ADA ) potential to reach a $50 billion market cap lies in its expanding network development. Following the Vasil upgrade and ongoing work on the Hydra scaling solution, the network is attracting more developers, dApps, and DeFi projects. Key metrics show steady growth in total value locked (TVL) and smart contract activity, critical indicators of long-term demand for ADA. Meanwhile, partnerships with institutions and governments continue to strengthen Cardano’s reputation as a blockchain built for real-world applications. At press time, ADA had a market cap of about $31 billion, meaning it requires only about 60% growth to hit the $50 billion mark. The asset was valued at $0.80. ADA seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite their potential to rally and attract more capital inflows, both assets face risks that could hinder their path to the $50 billion milestone. For instance, Dogecoin remains heavily dependent on sentiment, leaving it vulnerable to hype cycles, while Cardano must demonstrate that its technology can drive sustained adoption.

Based on the idea of decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, Mutuum Finance is gaining popularity for offering real-world utility within a space that is prone to be fueled by hype and short-term thinking. Mutuum Finance’s presale is already at Phase 6 at $0.035. The project has raised over $15.85 million in total and more than 16,340 token holders. While Ripple (XRP) holding on to its top 3 rank, Mutuum Finance is being recognized increasingly as a disruptor in the crypto market. XRP Hangs Near $3.03 as Markets Rebalance XRP is priced at $3.03. The token has seen minimal price swings over the last 24 hours, trading between $2.98 and $3.05. Participants in markets are tracking XRP in the broader context of payments-driven adoption and general liquidity currents, but price action is at present range-bound. Investors are instead applying focus to Mutuum Finance, with many believing it possesses greater early-stage percentage upside potential due to its novel approach to DeFi lending. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 6 Momentum MUTM is being snapped up at $0.035 by Stage 6 presale investors. Over 16,340 investors have already purchased tokens and the project has amassed over $15.85 million in funding, a positive indication of positive market interest and growing launch anticipation. Accuracy in Price Discovery Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles to provide collateral in lending, trading and liquidation trades in USD-denominated values of assets and token values of assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds and time-weighted averages of decentralized exchanges are used to reduce errors. Usage in multi-layered form guarantees data price can be as accurate as possible even during the market’s high-stress periods. Volatility of the market is the primary reason for protocol collateral management. Asset stability is utilized to decouple LTV and liquidation. Depending on whether the tokens are riskier or stable, equivalent lower and higher quotas are assigned to them. Utilization of reserve multiplier in proportion to it is being done from 10% of the less significant assets to 35% of the riskier assets, in a way not sacrificing diversification. Mutuum Finance is building a protocol for passive borrowing and lending of money, with the goal to leverage active capital management with the possibility to enable users to borrow against securitised stacks of assets. It runs the platform under the stability algorithm and an interest rate optimisation algorithm based on the efficiency and resilience forces of long-term capital utilisation. Risk and Liquidity Protection The protocol actively manages liquidity and volatility in a way that it can hedge illiquid positions on the best possible basis. The risk exposure is very low, and the liquidation points are very well constrained. Stablecoins and ETH have additional LTV levels of riskier assets collateralized by less risky assets. There is a reserve factor that is proportionally allocated to asset classes and allows optimization of the security of the protocol reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Ripple (XRP) are presenting a strong case for 2025 with assured innovation and stability in the market to investors. XRP is trading around $3.03, whereas experts prefer growth through adoption. MUTM’s Stage 6 presale, however, is continuing at $0.035 with $15.85M already raised from 16,340+ investors, demonstrating strong momentum. With Chainlink oracles, risk management, and a real-world lending and borrowing DeFi emphasis, Mutuum Finance paces the pack in early-stage upside and utility-inspired opportunity.

In the dynamic world of finance, movements in traditional markets often ripple across the entire investment landscape, including cryptocurrencies. Today, a wave of optimism has swept through Wall Street as the major US stock indexes opened higher, signaling a robust start to the trading day. This positive momentum in conventional markets can sometimes influence broader investor sentiment, impacting how capital flows into various asset classes, including digital assets. What’s Powering the Rise in US Stock Indexes ? The trading day commenced with significant upward movement across the board. The S&P 500 saw a modest gain of +0.02%, while the Nasdaq Composite edged up by +0.01%. Not to be outdone, the Dow Jones Industrial Average led the charge, rising by +0.04%. These early gains suggest a positive outlook among investors. Several factors could be contributing to this upbeat sentiment. Market participants are closely watching recent economic data, which may indicate resilience in the economy. Furthermore, anticipation surrounding upcoming corporate earnings reports often fuels early market movements. Positive investor sentiment, driven by confidence in economic recovery or favorable monetary policy expectations, also plays a crucial role. Understanding the Impact of Rising US Stock Indexes When US stock indexes climb, it typically reflects a broader sense of economic health and investor confidence. For those in the cryptocurrency space, a strong stock market can present a mixed bag. On one hand, increased overall market liquidity and risk appetite might spill over into digital assets. On the other hand, some investors might reallocate funds from perceived ‘riskier’ assets like crypto back into traditional equities, especially during periods of sustained stock market strength. It is essential for investors to observe these interconnected market dynamics. A thriving stock market can sometimes indicate a ‘risk-on’ environment, where investors are more willing to take on higher-risk investments. Conversely, a cautious approach might prevail if traditional markets show signs of weakness. Therefore, understanding the underlying drivers of stock market performance is key for any investor. Navigating Market Trends: What to Watch After US Stock Indexes Open Higher As the day progresses, market watchers will be keen to see if these initial gains hold. Key indicators to monitor include further economic reports, statements from central bank officials, and company-specific news. A sustained rally in US stock indexes could signify a period of prolonged investor optimism. Here are some key aspects to consider: Economic Data: Keep an eye on inflation reports and employment figures. Corporate Earnings: Strong earnings often provide a solid foundation for market growth. Federal Reserve Policy: The Fed’s stance on interest rates can significantly influence market direction. Global Events: Geopolitical developments can always introduce volatility. Understanding these factors helps investors make informed decisions across all asset classes. Ultimately, market dynamics are complex, and continuous learning is vital for success. The higher opening of the major US stock indexes today certainly sets a positive tone for the financial markets. While these are early movements, they underscore a prevailing sense of optimism among investors. Whether you’re tracking traditional stocks or the volatile crypto market, understanding these broader economic currents is paramount. This initial rally could be a harbinger of continued positive sentiment, or it could simply be a momentary surge; vigilance remains key. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why do US stock indexes opening higher matter to crypto investors? A1: Movements in US stock indexes often reflect broader investor sentiment and economic health. A strong stock market can indicate a ‘risk-on’ environment, potentially increasing overall market liquidity and risk appetite, which might spill over into digital assets. However, it could also lead some investors to reallocate funds from crypto to traditional equities. Q2: What factors typically drive US stock indexes up? A2: Several factors can contribute to rising US stock indexes , including positive economic data (e.g., strong employment figures, controlled inflation), robust corporate earnings reports, favorable monetary policy expectations (like anticipated interest rate cuts), and generally high investor confidence in the economy’s future.

Sustainability depends on ongoing economic developments, corporate performance, and central bank policies.

In this blog post, I will explore why Liquity Protocol’s v2 stablecoin, BOLD, would serve as the ideal stablecoin of choice for AI agents built on Ethereum. It’s apparent that the advancement of AI agents on Ethereum is expanding in light of its underlying decentralization as a settlement and coordination layer. “Eventually, this artificial internet money may also become the preferred medium of exchange for artificial intelligence agents as well, and I personally think the broader market has not yet priced in such a paradigm shift.” — syncubate, The Calm Before the Storm, published on 9/26/23 Nearly two years ago, I highlighted what is now increasingly evident: the potential synergy between artificial intelligence [AI] agents and Ethereum. Today, Google announced the launch of the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) “to securely initiate and transact agent-led payments across platforms.” As further noted, “AP2 is designed as a universal protocol, providing security and trust for a variety of payments like stablecoins and cryptocurrencies.” Notably, contributors to the development of AP2 include leading crypto related organizations, such as Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation [EF]. Coincidentally, EF recently announced the start of its own AI team as well (known as the dAI team). Relatedly, the September 2025 issue of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] Finance and Development Magazine was just recently published, and therein stablecoin innovation was an overarching focus. In light of these accelerating developments, a critical question arises: how do we ensure AI agents can transact in a way that is aligned with Ethereum’s credibly neutral ethos? In this blog post, I will explore why Liquity Protocol’s v2 stablecoin, BOLD , would serve as the ideal stablecoin of choice for AI agents built on Ethereum. The Ethereum Dollar “Ethereum makes AI more trustworthy, and AI makes Ethereum more useful. The more intelligent agents transact, the more they need a neutral base layer for value and reputation. Ethereum benefits by becoming that layer and AI benefits by escaping lock-in to a few centralized platforms...Neutral, verifiable, censorship-resistant infrastructure means AI works for the people, all of us.” — Davide Crapis, AI Lead at the Ethereum Foundation, in a tweet posted on 9/15/25 It’s apparent that the advancement of AI agents on Ethereum is expanding in light of its underlying decentralization as a settlement and coordination layer . If such qualities are fundamentally necessary for the onchain foundation upon which AI agents are built, then it’s similarly vital for AI agents to be able to transact in a censorship-resistant manner as well. Accordingly, if we consider stablecoins in particular, then BOLD is especially befitting for AI agents on Ethereum to use. In being marketed as the Ethereum Dollar , BOLD stands out for its immutable design and the absence of any reliance on human-coordinated governance, and its onchain analytics are verifiable in real time. Distinctively, BOLD users can set their own borrowing costs or delegate their management to automated services. Furthermore, BOLD’s onchain yield opportunities are plentiful on both Ethereum mainnet and associated L2s, offering crypto-native yield that’s not reliant on offchain entities. AI meets BOLD: An Early Case Study Considering the above, AI agents on Ethereum could be designed to borrow and exchange with BOLD under different circumstances and through a variety of DeFi-related use cases . While the development of AI agents as such is still in its preliminary phases, an early case study showcasing the potential for BOLD in this regard is its recent integration with Botto , the first decentralized AI artist built on Ethereum. As detailed by The DeFi Collective, its engagement with Botto DAO on launching a BOLD liquidity pool with Botto’s core protocol token, BOTTO , was driven by its belief that, “The future of DeFi lies not in isolated protocols, but in thoughtful collaboration between projects that share common values and complementary strengths, as this partnership hopes to exemplify.” “As you have this AI assistant...you’re going to want it to be able to manage money...The system [Ethereum] is really kind of perfect for this. It’s permissionless, global, transparent, with Layer 2s it becomes fast and cheap, and it’s entirely digital native.” — Jordan McKinney, ""GPT4 & Ethereum: Autonomous AI Agents & the World Financial Computer"" on YouTube, 4/13/23 While the launch of such a liquidity pool may rightfully be considered a basic step in initiating a collaboration, it’s nevertheless a starting point from which future explorations of the potential synergies between AI and DeFi can be made. For example, BOLD could be incorporated into the development of Botto’s agent framework , with such agents perhaps prioritizing the use of BOLD for stablecoin payments if they’re ultimately enabled to transact freely . Conclusion Prioritizing AI agent development on Ethereum as a credibly neutral base layer similarly necessitates emphasizing the use of truly decentralized stablecoins by onchain AI agents and protocols, too. Designed and positioned as the Ethereum Dollar, BOLD is particularly suited for a variety of integrations in this manner, and the BOLD + BOTTO liquidity pool launch is a representative initiative in its early stages. “We must keep an open mind about stablecoins and financial innovation. Clearly, there is a lot of room for improvement in payment systems and financial markets in general...Who knows what new possibilities such innovations will unlock along the way?” — Gita Bhatt, ""How Stablecoins and Other Financial Innovations May Reshape the Global Economy,"" IMF Blog, 9/5/25 As the BOLD + BOTTO liquidity pool was deployed on Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum L2, then we may extrapolate from Coinbase’s involvement in Google’s AP2 launch that it would therefore be opportune for Botto DAO and The DeFi Collective to prioritize their support of the pool over the long term, considering AP2’s noted focus on AI agentic stablecoin uses and the IMF’s recent spotlight on stablecoin innovations. Ultimately, monitoring the lessons learned from this collaboration over time will serve as an example for broader consideration of AI-oriented stablecoin integrations. BOLD aligned frontends and friendly forks on various Ethereum L2s may similarly consider exploring AI synergies in their respective capacities and ecosystems as well.

The comment arrives as XRP trades near crucial technical thresholds, and overall market momentum remains fragile. Technical Setup XRP is currently moving within a classic ascending triangle pattern , a structure that often signals a potential breakout when the price closes decisively above the upper trendline. Analysts are closely monitoring XRP’s price action, with key resistance levels identified between $3.20 and $3.35. $XRP – All I want is to break Ascending Triangle so my next TP levels can fill before the RUG PULL CRASH! Lets RETIRE our FAM by taking CALCULATED PROFITS from those who ""Know What You Hold"". They (Dumb Money) will be our EXIT LIQUIDITY! RT for UPDATES every week! #XRPArmy … pic.twitter.com/X3GrzUPW8M — JD (@jaydee_757) September 16, 2025 On the downside, support is near $3.00, with additional buffers at $2.80 and $2.50, suggesting potential areas where the price might stabilize or bounce. A breakout on strong volume could propel XRP toward fresh highs, but a failure to hold key support might trigger the sharp pullback JD warns about. Liquidity Dynamics and Whale Activity JD’s reference to “exit liquidity” reflects a dynamic that has been visible across recent on-chain data. September trading activity has shown large XRP holders quietly moving significant amounts of tokens to exchanges, a pattern often preceding periods of heightened volatility. Analysts note that when whales distribute holdings while retail traders buy breakouts, price moves can become exaggerated, creating opportunities for big players to exit while late entrants absorb the risk. Targets and Risk Management Several market strategists see potential near-term upside targets between $4 and $5 if XRP breaks through resistance. Yet the same liquidity that can drive a surge can also reverse quickly, exposing over-leveraged traders to losses if the triangle resolves downward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 JD’s emphasis on “calculated profits” underscores a strategy of taking gains incrementally, locking in returns before volatility accelerates. Signals to Watch Volume confirmation remains critical . A sustained daily close above $3.35, accompanied by a noticeable increase in trading volume, would strengthen the case for a bullish breakout. Conversely, a drop below the $2.70 to $2.80 zone, especially if paired with renewed whale selling, would support JD’s bearish outlook and could spark the swift decline he predicts. Navigating the Next Move For traders, JD’s comments serve as a reminder to combine chart analysis with real-time market intelligence. Monitoring on-chain whale transfers, order-book depth, and derivatives positioning can provide early clues of either a genuine breakout or a looming reversal. Staggering take-profit levels across resistance bands, reducing leverage during periods of heightened uncertainty, and setting disciplined stop-losses can help avoid becoming the “exit liquidity” JD warns against. By emphasizing both the potential for upside and the risk of a sudden downturn, JD’s post captures the precarious balance facing XRP traders today: opportunity remains, but only those who manage risk carefully may avoid being caught in the kind of crash he foresees.

According to recent Bitcoin World market monitoring, this sudden dip has sent ripples across the investor community, with BTC currently trading at $115,991.28 on the Binance USDT market. This unexpected turn of events prompts a closer look into what might be driving this decline and what it signifies for the broader crypto landscape. What Triggered This Alarming BTC Price Fall? Understanding the catalysts behind market movements is crucial. While a single reason is often elusive, several factors could contribute to this BTC price fall . Large sell-offs by institutional investors or “whales” can quickly impact sentiment. Moreover, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation data or interest rate changes, frequently influence risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Furthermore, liquidations of leveraged positions on derivatives exchanges can create a cascading effect, pushing prices down rapidly. Negative news cycles or regulatory uncertainties, even minor ones, can also trigger selling pressure. This complex interplay of market dynamics often dictates short-term price action, demanding investor vigilance. Decoding the Current BTC Price Landscape Bitcoin falling below $116,000, specifically trading at $115,991.28, is a key indicator for many. This level might have been a psychological support, and breaching it can signal further downward momentum. However, it’s vital to view this within Bitcoin’s historical context of extreme volatility. BTC is known for dramatic price swings, often recovering strongly after significant dips. Consider these aspects of the current market: Binance USDT Market: The reported price on Binance, a major exchange, reflects broad market sentiment. Support and Resistance: Traders watch these levels; a break below support can lead to tests of lower levels. Market Sentiment: Fear often dominates during a sharp BTC price fall , but savvy investors seek opportunities. This current trading range highlights the ongoing battle between buyers and sellers, shaping Bitcoin’s immediate trajectory. What Does This BTC Price Drop Mean for Investors? A sudden BTC price drop can be unsettling. However, it presents different implications based on an investor’s strategy. Long-term holders (HODLers) might see this as a temporary setback or a buying opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. Their focus remains on Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value. Short-term traders face immediate challenges. They need to manage risk carefully, adjusting stop-loss orders or considering short positions. This period demands a disciplined approach to avoid emotional decisions. Remember, market corrections are a natural part of any asset class, including cryptocurrencies. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights During significant price fluctuations, a clear strategy is paramount. Here are actionable insights to consider in light of the recent BTC price fall : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Base decisions on thorough research, not just market FUD. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly to mitigate volatility. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, but avoid impulsive decisions. Focus on reliable sources. Long-Term Perspective: For those believing in Bitcoin’s fundamental value, short-term dips are often just noise. These strategies help investors navigate turbulent crypto markets, transforming potential challenges into calculated opportunities. In conclusion, the recent BTC price fall below $116,000 is a stark reminder of crypto market volatility. While such dips cause concern, they are normal market cycles. By understanding triggers, maintaining a long-term perspective, and employing sound risk management, investors can better navigate these fluctuations. The crypto journey is rarely a straight line, but with informed decisions, it can still lead to rewarding outcomes. Stay calm, stay informed, and make strategic choices. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the recent BTC price fall below $116,000? The recent BTC price fall is likely due to a mix of large institutional sell-offs, broader macroeconomic concerns like inflation, and cascading liquidations of leveraged positions. Negative market sentiment or regulatory news can also play a role. Is this BTC price drop a buying opportunity? For long-term investors, a BTC price drop can be an opportunity to accumulate at lower prices. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and assess your risk tolerance. Strategies like dollar-cost averaging are effective during volatile periods. How should short-term traders react to this volatility? Short-term traders should prioritize risk management, including setting stop-loss orders and avoiding emotional decisions. A clear trading strategy and market analysis are key to navigating volatility, which presents both risks and rewards. What is dollar-cost averaging (DCA)? DCA involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. During a BTC price fall, DCA allows buying more Bitcoin when prices are low, lowering your average purchase price over time and mitigating short-term volatility. What are key takeaways for investors from this market movement? Stay informed, avoid impulsive decisions, and maintain a long-term perspective. Employing sound risk management, diversifying your portfolio, and continuous education about market dynamics are crucial for navigating a significant BTC price fall.

The decision came this week as the asset manager adjusted its entire model suite, increasing its equity allocation and dumping exposure to international developed markets. The firm now sits 2% overweight on stocks, after money moved between several of its biggest exchange-traded funds. This wasn’t a slow shuffle. Billions flowed across multiple ETFs on Tuesday as BlackRock executed the realignment. The iShares S&P 100 ETF (OEF) alone brought in $3.4 billion, the largest single-day haul in its history. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) collected $2.3 billion, while the iShares US Equity Factor Rotation Active ETF (DYNF) added nearly $2 billion. The rebalancing triggered swift inflows and outflows that realigned investor exposure on the back of performance data and macroeconomic outlooks. BlackRock raises equities on strong US earnings The model updates come as BlackRock backs the rally in American stocks, fueled by strong earnings and optimism around rate cuts. In an investment letter obtained by Bloomberg, the firm said US companies have delivered 11% earnings growth since the third quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, earnings across other developed markets barely touched 2%. That gap helped push the decision to drop international holdings in favor of American ones. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, said the US market is the only one showing consistency in sales growth, profit delivery, and revisions in analyst forecasts. “The US equity market continues to stand alone in terms of earnings delivery, sales growth and sustainable trends in analyst estimates and revisions,” Michael wrote. He added that non-US developed markets lagged far behind, especially when it came to sales. This week’s changes reflect that position. The move was made ahead of the Federal Reserve’s expected interest rate cuts, which many expect to begin on Wednesday. The S&P 500 is already sitting at all-time highs, with artificial intelligence spending driving momentum and investors preparing for a cheaper money environment. BlackRock’s reweighting puts its models in line with those expectations, using updated data to pull money out of low-performing regions and place it where growth looks more sustainable. Model portfolios like these are built for financial advisers who want pre-packaged asset allocations. When BlackRock updates its allocations, it shakes up flows across multiple funds. The models have grown fast. Earlier this year, they managed $150 billion. Now that number sits at $185 billion. BlackRock’s model team is also “leaning in” to the AI build-out, and is shifting from offering exposure to its broad-based US tech ETF to an AI-focused fund, according to the commentary. Nearly $1.4 billion flowed into the iShares AI Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI) on Tuesday, while the iShares US Technology ETF (IYW) lost $2.7 billion. “We view AI as both a defensive hedge and a growth catalyst,” Michael wrote. Every ETF involved in the shift reflected a part of the broader decision. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF took in over $2 billion as money moved to large caps. Factor rotation gained almost $2 billion too, showing that BlackRock isn’t just buying the index, it’s actively betting on sector changes within US stocks. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This isn’t just a number; it represents a notable influx of capital into the digital asset ecosystem. What does such a large minting event truly signify for stablecoins and the wider market? What Does a 250 Million USDC Minted Event Mean? The news, first reported by Whale Alert, confirmed that a staggering 250 million USDC minted . This means that new units of USD Coin (USDC), a popular stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, have been created and added to circulation. Think of it like a central bank printing new currency, but in the digital realm. This process is typically driven by demand. When more people want to buy USDC, the issuer, Circle, mints new tokens to meet that demand. This ensures that the peg to the US dollar remains stable and that there’s enough liquidity for traders and investors. Why Is There Such High Demand for USDC Minted ? The minting of a quarter-billion USDC isn’t a random occurrence; it’s a direct response to market needs. Several factors contribute to this heightened demand: Increased Market Liquidity: A larger supply of USDC often indicates that more capital is flowing into the crypto market, ready to be deployed into various assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins. DeFi Expansion: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms heavily rely on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. New USDC provides more fuel for these activities. Institutional Interest: Large institutions and high-net-worth individuals often use stablecoins to enter and exit crypto positions without incurring significant volatility risks. A large minting event can suggest growing institutional participation. Global Remittances and Payments: USDC offers a fast and cost-effective way to transfer value across borders, driving demand for its utility in payments. Essentially, when we see such a large amount of USDC minted , it often points to a period of heightened activity and potential growth within the broader crypto landscape. Understanding USDC: The Digital Dollar To fully grasp the significance of USDC minted , it’s crucial to understand what USDC is. USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin, meaning its value is designed to remain stable relative to a reserve asset, in this case, the US dollar. It is co-founded by Circle and Coinbase through the Centre Consortium. Each USDC token is backed by a combination of cash and short-duration U.S. government bonds held in segregated accounts. This backing is regularly attested by independent auditors, aiming to provide transparency and trust in its 1:1 peg to the dollar. This reliability makes USDC a cornerstone of the crypto economy, serving as a safe haven during market volatility and a primary medium for transactions. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? The creation of 250 million new USDC tokens has ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Here’s how: Enhanced Trading Opportunities: With more stablecoin liquidity, traders have greater flexibility to move between volatile assets and stable ones, facilitating more active trading. DeFi Growth: The increased supply can lead to lower borrowing rates and higher lending yields on DeFi protocols, attracting more participants to the decentralized finance space. Market Stability: The presence of a robust, well-backed stablecoin like USDC helps in maintaining market stability, offering a reliable alternative to traditional fiat currencies for digital transactions. Gateway for New Investors: For new investors, USDC acts as an accessible entry point into crypto, allowing them to hold digital assets without immediately diving into volatile cryptocurrencies. This event underscores the growing maturity and integration of stablecoins into the global financial infrastructure. The continuous demand for USDC minted reflects its critical role. What Are the Challenges and Future Outlook for Stablecoins? While the minting of 250 million USDC minted is largely positive, it also brings attention to ongoing discussions around stablecoins. Regulators worldwide are scrutinizing stablecoins more closely, focusing on transparency, reserves, and consumer protection. Ensuring that stablecoins like USDC maintain their reserves and operate under clear regulatory frameworks is vital for their long-term success and broader adoption. Looking ahead, the role of stablecoins is only set to expand. They are bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world, facilitating everything from cross-border payments to complex financial instruments. As the digital economy evolves, stablecoins like USDC will undoubtedly remain at the forefront, continuing to drive innovation and liquidity. The recent 250 million USDC minted event is more than just a large transaction; it’s a strong indicator of robust demand and confidence in the stablecoin market. It highlights the growing utility of USDC within DeFi, institutional trading, and global payments. As the crypto landscape matures, such events will continue to shape the flow of capital and the evolution of digital finance, solidifying stablecoins as an indispensable part of our financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? A1: USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, meaning one USDC is always intended to be worth one US dollar. It is backed by reserves of cash and short-duration U.S. government bonds. Q2: Why was 250 million USDC minted? A2: USDC is minted in response to market demand. When more people want to buy or use USDC, the issuer (Circle) creates new tokens to maintain the 1:1 peg and ensure sufficient liquidity in the market. Q3: Who reported this minting event?

Q5: Are stablecoins regulated? A5: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is evolving.

This week, OpenVPP (OVPP) announced what it presented as a significant collaboration with the U.S. government in the innovative field of energy tokenization. However, this claim quickly drew the sharp eye of on-chain analyst ZachXBT, who highlighted a swift and official rebuttal that has sent ripples through the digital asset community. What Sparked the OpenVPP Partnership Claim Controversy? The core of the issue revolves around OpenVPP’s assertion of a U.S. government partnership. This kind of collaboration would typically be a monumental endorsement for any private cryptocurrency project, especially given the current regulatory climate. Such a partnership could signify a new era of mainstream adoption and legitimacy for energy tokenization initiatives. OpenVPP initially claimed cooperation with the U.S. government. This alleged partnership was said to be in the domain of energy tokenization. The announcement generated considerable interest and discussion online. ZachXBT, known for his diligent on-chain investigations, was quick to flag the development. He brought attention to the fact that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce had directly addressed the OpenVPP partnership claim . Her response, delivered within hours, was unequivocal and starkly contradicted OpenVPP’s narrative. How Did Regulatory Authorities Respond to the OpenVPP Partnership Claim? Commissioner Hester Peirce’s statement was a crucial turning point in this unfolding story. She clearly stated that the SEC, as an agency, does not engage in partnerships with private cryptocurrency projects. This response effectively dismantled the credibility of OpenVPP’s initial announcement regarding their supposed government collaboration. Peirce’s swift clarification underscores a fundamental principle of regulatory bodies: maintaining impartiality and avoiding endorsements of private entities. Her statement serves as a vital reminder to the crypto community about the official stance of government agencies concerning private ventures. Moreover, ZachXBT’s analysis didn’t stop there. He also observed that the social media accounts actively promoting OpenVPP were predominantly those of various influencers. This pattern often raises red flags, suggesting a potentially coordinated promotional effort rather than organic community enthusiasm. What Was OpenVPP’s Explanation for the Discrepancy? Following the rapid debunking by Commissioner Peirce and the subsequent scrutiny from ZachXBT, the OpenVPP team issued an official statement. Their explanation for the glaring contradiction was, to many, rather unconventional. They claimed that an intern had ""accidentally hidden"" Peirce’s reply. This explanation immediately sparked further skepticism and debate. The idea of a critical regulatory response being ""accidentally hidden"" by an intern, especially one that directly refutes a major project announcement, struck many as improbable. Such an incident, if true, would point to significant internal communication issues or a lack of oversight within the OpenVPP team. This incident surrounding the OpenVPP partnership claim highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in the fast-evolving crypto space. Projects aiming for legitimacy must ensure their public communications are accurate and verifiable, especially when involving government entities. Why Does Trust Matter in the Crypto Space? The entire episode serves as a powerful reminder of the fragile nature of trust within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For investors, the integrity of project claims is paramount. A false OpenVPP partnership claim can severely erode confidence, not just in the project itself, but potentially in the broader market. Investor Due Diligence: This situation emphasizes the critical need for individuals to conduct thorough research before committing funds to any project. Project Accountability: Crypto projects must uphold the highest standards of truthfulness in their public statements to build and maintain credibility. Market Integrity: Misleading claims can distort market perceptions and potentially lead to uninformed investment decisions. The swift reaction from both an on-chain analyst and a high-ranking SEC official demonstrates the growing vigilance against potentially misleading information in the crypto sector. It’s a clear signal that claims, particularly those involving government backing, will be met with intense scrutiny. Crucial Lessons from the OpenVPP Controversy This unfolding drama offers several crucial takeaways for both crypto projects and potential investors. For projects, it’s a stark warning about the consequences of making unsubstantiated claims, especially those involving regulatory bodies. The reputational damage from such an incident can be long-lasting and difficult to overcome. For investors, it reinforces the timeless advice: ""Do Your Own Research"" (DYOR) . Always verify claims, especially those that seem too good to be true or involve high-profile partnerships. Relying solely on influencer promotions, as noted by ZachXBT in the context of the OpenVPP partnership claim , can be a risky strategy. In conclusion, the controversy surrounding OpenVPP’s U.S. government partnership claim serves as a potent case study in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. The rapid debunking by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, coupled with ZachXBT’s investigative insights, highlights the critical need for transparency, accuracy, and rigorous due diligence. As the digital asset landscape continues to mature, verifiable information and trustworthy communication will remain the cornerstones of sustainable growth and investor protection. This incident underscores the ongoing challenges and the increasing scrutiny projects face, urging all participants to prioritize integrity above all else. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

As a widely accepted trading pair, USDT provides immense liquidity across countless exchanges, enabling smooth and efficient transactions for millions of users. When market volatility strikes, many investors often convert their holdings into stablecoins like USDT to preserve capital, viewing it as a temporary safe haven. This behavior, however, also concentrates a large portion of market value within one asset, leading to discussions about systemic risk. Moreover, Tether’s transparency regarding its reserves, which back the USDT in circulation, remains a frequent topic of debate and scrutiny within the industry. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of a Massive Tether USDT Supply? The impressive scale of Tether USDT supply brings both distinct advantages and inherent challenges. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone engaging with the crypto ecosystem.

Trading Efficiency: It serves as a ubiquitous base pair, simplifying trading across thousands of cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The immense size attracts significant attention from global regulators, who demand greater transparency and oversight. Centralization Concerns: As a centralized entity, Tether faces criticism regarding the potential for single points of failure and control over the issuance of its stablecoin. Reserve Transparency: Ongoing questions about the composition and auditing of Tether’s reserves continue to be a challenge, though the company regularly publishes attestations. Addressing these challenges will be key to Tether’s sustained long-term success and broader acceptance. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Tether USDT Supply?

Continued innovation in DeFi, combined with growing demand from emerging markets for stable digital currencies, could fuel further expansion. However, the evolving global regulatory landscape will undoubtedly play a critical role. Jurisdictions worldwide are developing frameworks for stablecoins, which could either legitimize or restrict their operations. Tether’s commitment to transparency, robust auditing, and diversification of its reserve assets will be paramount in maintaining user trust and satisfying regulatory demands.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share an exciting update. He posted a screenshot of the ASTER trading screen, specifically the ASTER/USDT pair, signaling his positive outlook on the project. This public endorsement from one of the industry’s most influential figures immediately caught the attention of traders and enthusiasts alike, highlighting a potentially significant moment for the ASTER project. What Sparked CZ’s Enthusiasm for ASTER Trading? CZ’s post was concise yet impactful. The screenshot itself showcased the ASTER trading interface, hinting at active market participation. More importantly, his accompanying comment praised the project, declaring it a “good start” and offering encouragement to the team to “continue building.” This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a direct nod from a seasoned industry leader, suggesting that ASTER has demonstrated foundational strengths that resonate with his vision for promising crypto ventures. Direct Endorsement: CZ’s public praise offers a strong signal to the market. Building Momentum: His words can inspire confidence among potential investors and users. Visibility Boost: The exposure on X brings ASTER to a massive global audience. Why Does a CZ Endorsement Impact ASTER Trading? When Changpeng Zhao speaks, the crypto market often listens. His comments carry substantial weight due to his role as the founder of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. An endorsement from CZ can act as a powerful catalyst, potentially leading to increased trading volume, heightened investor interest, and greater community engagement for any project, including those involved in ASTER trading . It’s a form of validation that few projects ever receive so early in their journey. This kind of spotlight can be a double-edged sword, however. While it brings immense opportunity, it also places a greater expectation on the project to deliver on its promises. The team behind ASTER will undoubtedly feel the pressure to live up to this early recognition and maintain the positive momentum generated by CZ’s post. What Does This Mean for the Future of ASTER Trading? CZ’s encouragement to “continue building” is a clear directive. It emphasizes the importance of sustained development, innovation, and community engagement. For the ASTER trading ecosystem, this means focusing on long-term value creation rather than short-term hype. Projects that consistently deliver on their roadmap, enhance their technology, and foster a strong user base are the ones that truly thrive in the competitive crypto landscape. The screenshot and praise serve as a public acknowledgment of ASTER’s initial progress. It’s a call to action for the ASTER team to: Innovate Continuously: Keep developing new features and improving existing ones. Engage the Community: Foster a vibrant and supportive user base. Ensure Security and Stability: Maintain robust infrastructure for secure ASTER trading . Navigating the Spotlight: Challenges and Opportunities for ASTER The increased visibility from CZ’s post presents both challenges and unparalleled opportunities for ASTER. On one hand, it can attract significant capital and talent, accelerating its development. On the other hand, it also invites intense scrutiny from the market, analysts, and competitors. The ASTER team must be prepared to handle increased user traffic, scale their infrastructure, and effectively communicate their progress and vision to a larger audience. Successful navigation of this spotlight will require transparency, strong execution, and a clear strategic direction. Projects that fail to capitalize on such endorsements often fade, while those that embrace the challenge can cement their position as key players. The initial positive sentiment around ASTER trading needs to be nurtured with tangible progress and a commitment to their mission. In conclusion, Changpeng Zhao’s public commendation of ASTER, showcased by his ASTER trading screenshot, marks a significant moment for the project. It’s an exciting validation that underscores a promising start and places a clear emphasis on continued development. As the ASTER team moves forward, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how they leverage this powerful endorsement to build a robust and lasting ecosystem. This “good start” sets a high bar, but also provides an incredible foundation for future growth in the dynamic world of decentralized finance.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to cut interest rates by 25 bps after concerning labor market data. Some market watchers believe Powell could cut interest rates by 50 bps. The Fed had kept interest rates steady for five consecutive meetings, but a slowing economy could see the first rate cut of 2025 as Powell looks to address fiscal concerns. Bitcoin (BTC) Defies Historical September Bearishness BTC has gained nearly 6% this month, defying expectations of a bearish September. According to options data, bullish sentiment outweighs bearish positions, with traders positioning themselves for higher prices in Q4. According to Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive, the crypto market is only halfway through its fourth-quarter upswing. Dawson cited supportive macroeconomic trends and options flows. He also dismissed speculation that the current bull cycle had peaked. “I’ve seen a lot of FUD that the music is about to stop. Some nasty drawdowns may indeed hit us in the next few weeks. However, I believe the market is bright for the rest of Q4. This is, by no means, ‘it’ for the bull cycle; there’s plenty of gas left in the tank.” Another Bitcoin (BTC) Whale Awakens Before Fed Decision A dormant Bitcoin whale has moved $116 million worth of BTC after 12 years, making the transfer just before the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. The whale transferred 1,000 BTC , initially acquired for $847 per coin, to new wallets, according to a post on X by blockchain data platform Lookonchain. “A whale transferred all 1,000 BTC ($116.88 million) to new wallets after 12 years of dormancy. The whale received 1,000 BTC ($847,000 at the time) 12 years ago, when the price was $847.” Analysts and traders believe the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates will be the most significant of the year, with nearly all participants expecting a 25-bps rate cut. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen stated in a post on X, “Tomorrow is the most important FOMC of our lives …until the next one.” Despite the optimism surrounding a potential rate cut, most traders are positioning themselves for a drop in prices in the short term. According to blockchain data from CoinAnk, 57% of Bitcoin holders across major exchanges are short, meaning they are betting on a price decline. Meanwhile, only 42% are long. Bitcoin futures open interest has also dropped by over $2 billion over the past five days, indicating more de-risking among futures traders. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is down nearly 1% during the ongoing session as selling pressure around the asset intensifies. The flagship cryptocurrency faced considerable volatility this week after ending the weekend in the red. The price reached an intraday high of $116,802 on Monday before settling at $115,381. Bullish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as BTC rose 1.26% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,832. However, selling pressure has returned during the ongoing session, with the price trading below $116,000. While the market is preparing for a short-term drop, some analysts believe BTC could reach $120,000 on Wednesday. The flagship cryptocurrency’s price strength is supported by centralized exchange withdrawals, ETF inflows, and growing institutional interest. However, the immediate impact of a rate cut is up for debate. The sharp drop in Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges is crucial for short-term price action. According to Glassnode, 44,000 BTC were withdrawn from exchanges in September alone, reversing high deposit activity a month prior. Bitcoin ETF inflows also support an increase in the short term. ETF inflows have helped restore investor confidence, with US-listed ETFs registering over $2 billion in net inflows between Wednesday and Monday. Bond markets are pricing in a 96% chance of a 0.25 bps rate cut, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could react modestly to Wednesday’s press conference. According to analysts at Bitfinex, BTC established a new resistance around $116,000. The analysts stated that this level would remain as resistance until decisively claimed by a new rally. “ BTC now trades at the upper edge of the range near $116,000, which remains resistance until decisively reclaimed.” BTC’s momentum has waned since it hit a new all-time high in August, with the price struggling to reclaim lost levels. However, the price has rebounded this week as markets expect an interest rate cut following the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Analysts are divided about how BTC will react to a rate cut. According to Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, an interest rate cut could help the flagship cryptocurrency make a monster move in the next three months. However, others remain skeptical, with one analyst stating BTC could dip below $104,000 before recovering. BTC faced volatility over the past weekend as it reached an intraday high of $113,390 on Friday (September 5). However, it failed to stay at this level and settled at $110,670, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.41%. BTC recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 1% to end the weekend at $111,129. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, rising 0.85% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,072. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping 0.47% to $111,547. Positive sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $113,000 and settle at $113,983. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC rose 1.37%, crossing $115,000 and settling at $115,540. The price continued pushing higher on Friday, rising 0.49% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,106. Despite the positive sentiment, price action turned negative over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday and fell 0.56% on Sunday, ending the day at $115,314. BTC faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase. BTC registered a sharp increase on Tuesday, rising over 1% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,382. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with the price down over 1%, trading below the $116,000 mark. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

51885192,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=811634,1758130085,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51885192.jpeg,YouTube introduces fresh AI tools to boost Shorts creation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/youtube-new-ai-tools-youtube-shorts-creators/,"YouTube is releasing a new set of artificial intelligence tools for Shorts content creators. The company revealed the AI tools during its Made on YouTube live event. The company will add a customized version of Google’s Veo 3 video creation AI model. In addition, a new AI editing feature and a remixing tool will be added among other AI tools. Veo 3 merges with YouTube Shorts According to a blog post from YouTube, the video-sharing platform has partnered with Google’s DeepMind to create a custom version of Veo 3. The new version of the popular video generation model, which will merge with YouTube, is called Veo 3 Fast. The fast version of Veo 3 will generate videos using text. The videos will have a resolution of 480p and lower latency, making it easier for creators to make clips. YouTube announced that adding sounds to such clips will be possible for the first time ever. Veo 3 Fast will make it possible to animate images using a video. For example, creators can animate an image of a person to make athletic movements or even dance. This is done by extracting the movements from a real video. Short creators can also add objects to the AI-generated video, like a character, prop, or even a specific effect, only through text. YouTube said this feature will open up “even more creative possibilities for what you can make next.” A good example is adding a “add a rubber ducky to your morning coffee.” Moreover, the AI tools will enable content creators to transform a video by adding new styles like pop art or origami, giving the video a new and fresh look. The new set of AI tools will be available for YouTube Shorts creators in the upcoming months. Remix speech into new soundtracks Another exciting tool is the Speech to Song remixing tool. Adding a quote, a funny dialogue, or a unique sound to a video is possible through this tool, making content more fun and engaging. Content creators get to choose their favorite sound from eligible videos and turn it into a soundtrack. Dina Berrada, the Director of Product, Shorts and Generative AI Creation at YouTube, said, “As the world’s largest creative playground, YouTube is where trends are born and where you can draw inspiration from. Imagine hearing a line of dialogue that sparks an idea—a funny phrase, a memorable quote, or a one-of-a-kind sound—and you want to remix it into a new sound.” Speech to Song remixing tool is powered by Lyria 2, Google DeepMind’s most advanced AI music model. Lyria 2 will use the dialogue from a video and turn it into a song. Users get to choose from several sound styles like “chill, danceable, or fun.” YouTube will start testing the remixing tool soon and will begin rolling it out in the United States within weeks. here's @colinandsamir with all you need to know about YouTube's new tools to connect, create and grow 👇 #MadeOnYouTube pic.twitter.com/yQ8yCGQfDC — YouTube (@YouTube) September 16, 2025 Edit with AI transforms raw footage Another feature to be released soon is Edit with AI. This feature will transform raw footage into a first draft by looking for the moments and arranging them. The tool will add music, transitions, and “even a playful voiceover that can react to what’s happening in the video.” The voice-over will be in English and Hindi. YouTube clarified that it’s still in the experimenting stage. Edit with AI will be available on Shorts and in the YouTube Create app within the upcoming weeks.

The blockchain witnessed a remarkable growth in the past months, hitting fresh all-time highs in key metrics, according to Messari’s report . Most notably, Sei recorded the first-ever positive staking yield during the second quarter. At the same time, the market cap surged 86.1% to $1.57 billion as prices gained 63.5%. The report signals confidence in the Layer 1 network, which remains a go-to platform for decentralized applications. Commenting on the Q2, 2025 breakthrough, the Sei team said: With activity and transactions accelerating across multiple timeframes, the signal is clear: Sei is emerging as the preferred settlement layer for global financial markets.

($/acc) 7:49 PM · Sep 17, 2025 332 Reply Copy link Read 25 replies Sei staking makes a comeback One of the most crucial milestones in the second quarter was Sei’s staking yield turning positive for the first time, closing Q2 at 0.6% annualized. That’s vital since it signals a maturing economic model. Yield resurgence means delegators and validators are finally making returns after accounting for SEI’s inflation. Messari’s researchers noted: Annualized inflation decreased from 5.5% to 4.85%. Combined with a 6.3% QoQ decrease in the amount of staked SEI, annualized staking APY increased from 5.1% to 5.4%, resulting in the first time Sei stakers experienced a positive annualized real yield of 0.6%. Positive returns could enrich Sei’s staking participation as it attracts long-term players. Canary’s Sei ETF filing, which gained the SEC’s acknowledgement this month, adds to this narrative. Market cap and price rebound Sei’s native token recorded an impressive recovery in Q2, with a 63.5% QoQ surge to $0.28. The rallies saw its market cap soar 86.1% to $1.57 billion. The bounce-back signals reinvigorated confidence in Sei Network as a top settlement platform for international financial markets. Slowed token vesting reduces sell pressure The report added that Sei’s monthly vesting rate reduced to 113 million from 219 million tokens starting August 2025. That reduces new supply by nearly 50%. Notably, the change comes as Sei Foundation fully vests its SEI allocation. Furthermore, Sei’s ecosystem reserve allocation saw its monthly vesting decrease to 15.2 million from 92.7 million coins. Such modifications could substantially reduce selling pressure and stabilize SEI’s price action in the upcoming times. Native SEI trades at $0.3104 after losing over 2% in the past 24 hours. The alt mirrors prevailing broader dips ahead of the key Fed rate decision. A hawkish move would see cryptocurrencies plunging in the near term. Meanwhile, experts predict a 25 basis-point reduction, which will likely fuel bullish sentiments in risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

Recently, Eric Trump, a prominent figure in real estate and business, made a notable statement that has captured significant attention: he believes a crypto real estate hedge is the perfect solution for protecting property assets. This perspective opens up a fascinating discussion about the evolving relationship between traditional investments and the burgeoning digital asset space. What Exactly is a Crypto Real Estate Hedge? When we talk about a crypto real estate hedge , we are referring to the strategy of using cryptocurrency investments to offset potential risks or volatility in a real estate portfolio. Think of it as diversifying your financial safety net. Historically, investors have used various assets like gold, bonds, or different market sectors to hedge against downturns in other areas. Cryptocurrency, with its unique characteristics, presents a fresh option for this strategy. Its often uncorrelated price movements relative to traditional markets can provide a valuable counterweight during economic shifts. This approach isn’t about replacing real estate, but rather enhancing its resilience through strategic digital asset allocation. Why Consider Crypto for Your Property Portfolio? The idea of integrating cryptocurrency into a real estate strategy might seem unconventional at first, but several compelling reasons support it: Diversification: Cryptocurrencies often operate independently of traditional financial markets. This lack of correlation can reduce overall portfolio risk, making it a strong diversification tool. Inflation Protection: Some cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are seen by many as a hedge against inflation due to their finite supply. As fiat currencies lose purchasing power, a strong digital asset might retain or even increase in value. Liquidity: While real estate is a long-term, illiquid asset, cryptocurrencies offer high liquidity. You can convert them to cash relatively quickly, providing access to funds when needed. Accessibility: Digital assets are globally accessible, allowing investors to participate in a market that transcends geographical boundaries and traditional banking hours. Eric Trump’s endorsement underscores a growing recognition of these benefits among seasoned investors. He sees it as a forward-thinking move to secure wealth in an unpredictable economic climate. Navigating the Challenges of a Crypto Real Estate Hedge While the potential benefits are clear, adopting a crypto real estate hedge strategy is not without its challenges. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with prices often experiencing dramatic swings. This inherent risk requires a cautious and informed approach. Moreover, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Different countries and jurisdictions have varying rules, which can impact how digital assets are taxed and managed. Investors must also contend with the technical aspects of securely storing and managing their crypto holdings. Understanding wallet security, exchange reliability, and potential cyber threats is paramount. Therefore, thorough research and a clear understanding of your risk tolerance are essential before integrating crypto into your investment strategy. Actionable Insights for Property Investors For real estate investors considering a crypto real estate hedge , here are some actionable steps: Start Small: Begin with a modest allocation to cryptocurrencies that aligns with your overall investment goals and risk profile. You do not need to commit a large portion of your assets initially. Educate Yourself: Learn about different cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and market dynamics. Understanding the fundamentals is key to making informed decisions. Choose Wisely: Focus on established cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and a proven track record, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, rather than highly speculative altcoins. Prioritize Security: Use reputable exchanges and secure storage solutions (like hardware wallets) for your digital assets. Two-factor authentication is a must. Consult Experts: Speak with financial advisors who understand both real estate and cryptocurrency markets. They can help tailor a strategy that suits your individual needs. This strategic integration can provide a robust layer of protection, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. It represents a modern approach to asset management, blending traditional stability with digital innovation. The Future of Asset Protection: A Compelling Summary Eric Trump’s statement about cryptocurrency being a perfect hedge for real estate assets highlights a significant shift in investment thinking. The concept of a crypto real estate hedge is gaining traction as investors seek resilient strategies in an increasingly interconnected and volatile global economy. While challenges exist, the potential for diversification, inflation protection, and enhanced liquidity makes cryptocurrency a compelling consideration for safeguarding and growing wealth. As the digital asset landscape matures, its role in traditional investment portfolios is likely to expand, offering innovative solutions for asset protection and growth. Embracing this forward-thinking approach could be a key differentiator for investors looking to future-proof their wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does ‘hedge’ mean in the context of a crypto real estate hedge? A hedge is an investment made to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. In this case, a crypto real estate hedge uses cryptocurrency to protect against potential declines or volatility in real estate values. 2. Is cryptocurrency a stable investment for hedging? Cryptocurrency is known for its volatility. However, its often uncorrelated price movements with traditional assets like real estate can make it an effective hedge, providing diversification even with its inherent risks. The key is strategic allocation and understanding. 3. Which cryptocurrencies are best for a real estate hedge? While any cryptocurrency could theoretically be used, investors typically consider larger, more established assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) due to their higher liquidity and broader adoption. These are generally considered less volatile than newer, smaller altcoins. 4. How much crypto should I allocate for a real estate hedge? The ideal allocation depends on your individual risk tolerance, overall portfolio size, and financial goals. Many financial advisors suggest starting with a small percentage, perhaps 1-5% of your total portfolio, and adjusting as you gain more understanding and comfort with the asset class. 5. What are the tax implications of using crypto as a hedge? Tax implications for cryptocurrency vary significantly by jurisdiction. Generally, capital gains from selling crypto are taxable, and some countries also tax crypto income or even certain transactions. It is crucial to consult with a tax professional familiar with cryptocurrency regulations in your region. Did you find this article insightful?

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $90.31 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $268.90 by 2031. The Ethereum Name Service is a network that enables crypto enthusiasts to rename their cryptocurrency addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031.

The price is now around $23.30, just above the middle Bollinger Band at $23.10. This suggests that this area is short-term support. Resistance stands at $24.87, aligned with the upper band. A 46.13 RSI shows weak momentum, which keeps ENS slightly bearish but not oversold. MACD is still negative, which shows that selling pressure is still there. If bulls can keep the price above $23.10, it could go back up to $24.80. But if this level isn’t protected, it could fall to the $21.34 support level. In general, ENS is trading with a cautious sense of neutrality.

The price is close to the lower Bollinger Band at $22.59, which could be a support zone. The price is also close to the upper Bollinger Band at $23.92, which could be a resistance zone. The MACD histogram shows that bearish momentum is fading, but the signals are still negative, which means that there isn’t much upside pressure right now. Balance of Power at -0.62 shows that bears are in charge. If $22.59 holds, ENS might try to bounce back toward $23.26 and $23.92 resistance. But if you don’t defend support, you could be at risk of going down to $22.00. Sentiment in the short term is still weak, but it could improve near support.

The 1-day chart shows that ENS is holding steady around $23.30 after a recent drop. Support is near $23.10 and resistance is at $24.87. The RSI at 46 shows that the market is moving in a neutral direction, but the MACD shows that bearish pressure is still there. The price is hovering around $23.05 on the 4-hour chart, which is close to the lower Bollinger Band at $22.59. This shows that this is an important support zone. The MACD histogram shows that bearish strength is fading, but sellers are still in charge because the Balance of Power is weak. A bounce back to $23.92 is possible if $22.59 holds. But if it fails, it could go down even more, to $22. Traders should take caution in the short term due to potential range-bound action. Is ENS a good investment?

This astonishing development, first reported by Whale Alert, saw a substantial portion of PYUSD removed from circulation from an unknown wallet. Such an event naturally sparks curiosity and raises questions about its implications for the stablecoin’s stability and future trajectory. What does it mean when such a large sum simply vanishes? What Exactly is a PYUSD Token Burn ? Before diving into the specifics of this event, it is crucial to understand what a token burn entails. In simple terms, a token burn is the permanent removal of cryptocurrency tokens from circulation. This is achieved by sending tokens to an unspendable wallet address, often referred to as a “burner” address, where they can never be retrieved or used again. This process effectively reduces the total supply of the cryptocurrency. Why Burn Tokens? Token burns are often executed for several reasons: To reduce supply and potentially increase scarcity, which could lead to an increase in value if demand remains constant. To stabilize a cryptocurrency’s price, particularly for stablecoins. As part of a deflationary mechanism or to implement specific tokenomics strategies. To signal commitment to the project’s long-term health and value. The 600 Million PYUSD Token Burn : What Happened? Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker, recently flagged a colossal transaction: 600 million PYUSD being transferred to an unknown wallet, which was subsequently identified as a burn address. The details surrounding the origin and specific intent behind this particular burn remain somewhat mysterious. However, the outcome is clear: these 600 million PYUSD tokens are now permanently out of circulation. This scale of a PYUSD token burn is not an everyday occurrence. It represents a substantial reduction in the overall supply of the stablecoin. While the exact reasoning from the entity initiating the burn is not public, such large-scale actions are typically strategic, aimed at influencing market dynamics or fulfilling predefined tokenomic policies. Why Does This PYUSD Token Burn Matter for the Stablecoin? A burn of this magnitude carries significant weight, especially for a stablecoin like PYUSD. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Reducing the supply can have several implications: Scarcity and Value: By decreasing the total available supply, the burn could theoretically enhance the scarcity of PYUSD. For a stablecoin, this often means reinforcing its peg rather than driving up its price above the peg. Peg Stability: A controlled burn can be a mechanism to help maintain the stablecoin’s peg to its underlying asset. If the stablecoin’s market price deviates below its peg, reducing supply can help bring it back into line. Market Confidence: Large, well-communicated burns can sometimes boost investor confidence, signaling that the issuers are actively managing the token’s supply to ensure its stability and health. However, an ‘unknown wallet’ aspect adds a layer of intrigue. What Are the Potential Impacts of Such a Large PYUSD Token Burn ? The immediate impact of the 600 million PYUSD token burn is a reduction in the total circulating supply. This action, while seemingly straightforward, can ripple through the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. For PYUSD holders and potential investors, understanding these potential impacts is key. One primary effect is on the supply-demand equilibrium. With fewer tokens available, if demand for PYUSD remains consistent or grows, the stablecoin’s peg could be strengthened. Moreover, such a substantial burn might also be part of a larger strategy to comply with regulatory requirements or to adjust the stablecoin’s backing reserves. It is important to consider the transparency surrounding such events. While the act of burning is verifiable on the blockchain, the ‘unknown wallet’ aspect of this particular burn leaves room for speculation about its origins and ultimate goals. Transparency in such large-scale operations often builds greater trust within the community. In conclusion, the recent 600 million PYUSD token burn is a remarkable event that underscores the dynamic nature of the stablecoin market. While the exact motivations behind this specific burn from an unknown wallet remain to be fully clarified, its immediate effect is a significant reduction in PYUSD’s circulating supply. This move has the potential to influence the stablecoin’s scarcity, strengthen its peg, and shape market perceptions, ultimately contributing to the ongoing evolution of the digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions About the PYUSD Token Burn Here are some common questions regarding token burns and the recent PYUSD event: Q1: What is a cryptocurrency token burn? A1: A token burn is the process of permanently removing cryptocurrency tokens from circulation by sending them to an unspendable wallet address. This reduces the total supply of the token. Q2: Why do projects conduct token burns? A2: Projects burn tokens for various reasons, including reducing supply to potentially increase scarcity, maintaining a stable price (especially for stablecoins), implementing deflationary tokenomics, or signaling commitment to the project’s long-term health. Q3: How does a PYUSD token burn affect its value? A3: For a stablecoin like PYUSD, a token burn is typically used to help maintain its peg to the US dollar by adjusting supply. While it reduces scarcity, its primary goal is usually to reinforce stability rather than to increase its price above the peg. Q4: Is the 600 million PYUSD burn a positive or negative event? A4: Generally, a controlled token burn is considered a positive mechanism for managing supply and potentially strengthening a stablecoin’s peg. The specific details, like the ‘unknown wallet’ in this case, might raise questions about transparency, but the act of burning itself is a common strategy. Q5: How can I verify a token burn? A5: Token burns are recorded on the blockchain. You can typically verify a burn by looking up the transaction on a blockchain explorer, where you will see tokens sent to a known burn address (an address with no private key, making the funds irretrievable). The world of stablecoins is constantly evolving, and events like this PYUSD token burn are crucial to understanding its dynamics.

Or at least it has crossed institutional players. With Ethereum ETFs bleeding, investors are worried about the Ethereum price slipping. They are increasingly seeing presale tokens like Layer Brett that can hedge their money. Why? The presale comes with several rewards (high APY staking, giveaways), and an innovation not seen before: a meme merged with mechanism. Layer Brett: Presale Rocket Fuel ETH holders, frustrated with the Ethereum price slipping, are seeing Layer Brett as a viable solution to their problem. At just $0.0058, $LBRETT is already lighting up the space with calls for a 100x surge. Early entries are moving fast, knowing hesitation could be the costliest play of all. Layer Brett’s foundation is built for scale. Running on Layer 2 tech, it delivers instant transactions, gas fees that barely exist, and the kind of throughput needed for mass adoption. Analysts expect Layer 2 networks to handle more than $10 trillion a year by 2027, and Layer Brett is planting itself right at the heart of that growth. But speed and savings aren’t the whole story. Layer Brett is dripping with meme culture, designed to thrive on hype, humor, and relentless community drive. That mix of utility and chaos is what gives it real staying power. Then come the rewards. Staking starts at an eye-watering 700% APY for early movers, though yields tighten as more wallets flood in. On top of that, the team is throwing a $1M giveaway into the mix, a move guaranteed to crank FOMO through the roof. At $0.0058, the upside is insane, the entry price is still dirt cheap, and the momentum is building by the hour. Layer Brett isn’t just another launch — it’s a chance for ETH holders to hedge their investments and make gains beyond their dreams. 100x plays don’t announce themselves twice. Layer Brett just did. The ETH ETF Outflow Conundrum Spot ETH ETFs have experienced a significant reversal of fortune. After strong inflows in early August, the funds have now recorded a multi-day streak of net outflows, totaling nearly $1 billion. This trend has created visible unease among ETH holders, with many questioning whether the institutional interest has stalled and raising concerns about the immediate Ethereum price trajectory. The fear is that these outflows signal a retreat from a key source of demand, potentially leading to further downward pressure. Despite the recent bearish sentiment, Ethereum’s core fundamentals remain incredibly strong. While ETFs are seeing outflows, major corporate treasuries and whales are still in a heavy accumulation phase, buying up hundreds of millions in ETH. While this is a temporary headwind for the Ethereum price, its dominance in DeFi, its deflationary tokenomics, and its continued role as the backbone for Web3 applications suggest that this dip is a temporary setback, not a long-term failure. Jittery ETH, Boom for $LBRETT Despite all assurances of ETH being too big to fail, traders are concerned. Their holdings are dwindling, and they need to move to better avenues. For them, Layer Brett is the likely answer. Built on ETH L2 tech, $LBRETT fuses meme and mechanism, offering early entry for $0.0058 with massive staking rewards and a giveaway to further increase their holdings. Plus, the estimated 100x gain is compelling over ETH. Do you hold ETH and are worried about the Ethereum price? Join the Layer Brett presale and not only hedge your money, but increase it!

The RSI has cooled to 60 after breaching the oversold threshold at 70, which typically marks local tops. However, the correction may not be over yet as the MACD line has yet to resume its uptrend, closing in on a potential death cross. A decisive bounce from $0.26 will prove crucial as the launchpad for the next move higher, targeting a 40% move for a full breakout to $0.38. With ETFs attracting new TradFi demand, this DOGE breakout could extend to $1 for a potential 270% gain.

This 90-minute closed-door session marks a crucial step in bridging the gap between innovative digital asset companies and the lawmakers tasked with overseeing them. The discussions aim to refine and improve proposed legislation, laying the groundwork for a more defined regulatory landscape. Why is This US Crypto Regulation Roundtable So Significant? The conclusion of the roundtable meeting, as reported by Eleanor Terrett of Crypto in America, signals a deepening engagement between Washington D.C. and the rapidly evolving crypto sector. This isn’t just another meeting; it represents a direct line of communication between policymakers and those actively building and innovating within the digital asset space. For effective US crypto regulation to emerge, such dialogues are absolutely essential. The committee’s leadership engaged directly with a diverse group of industry heavyweights, ensuring a broad spectrum of perspectives were heard. This direct interaction is vital for crafting legislation that is both effective in protecting consumers and fostering innovation. Attendees at this landmark event included: Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson: A leading voice in blockchain development. Officials from Ripple: Key players in cross-border payments. Representatives from a16z, Kraken, Coinbase, Multicoin Capital, Paradigm, and Circle: A powerful mix of venture capital, exchanges, and stablecoin providers. This comprehensive representation underscores the committee’s intent to gather well-rounded input on the complexities of the digital asset market. What Key Topics Were Discussed for Improving US Crypto Regulation? The primary focus of the intensive 90-minute discussion was to improve the proposed digital asset market structure legislation. This involves a deep dive into various aspects of how cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology should be governed in the United States.

These coins have all inched upwards over the past week, as investors become increasingly confident that the Fed will cut rates for the first time since December. By reducing rates and effectively boosting the money supply, cryptocurrency prices are likely to increase, as investors become more interested in risk-on assets. In turn, this could see XRP, Cardano and Dogecoin pushing to new highs for the year, and potentially setting new ATHs. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Ripple Growth and ETF Approvals Could Send Altcoin to New Highs in Q4 XRP has risen to $3.02 today, making for a 2% increase in a week and a 7% rise in the past fortnight. The altcoin has also turned positive for the month, with a 1.5% increase, providing a turnaround that should help launch it further in the event of rate cut today. And in the longer term, there are numerous reasons why the XRP price is likely to continue rising, given Ripple’s encouraging growth as a company. It has made acquisitions, signed partnerships and expanded into new geographical areas in recent weeks, boosting its business and stoking greater demand for XRP. Source: TradingView On top of this, the SEC is likely to approve multiple XRP ETFs a little later in the year, something which could resulting in a flood of institutional money entering the XRP market. All of this coincides with XRP entering a position where it’s ready to rebound strongly, with its indicators recently beginning to recover from oversold levels. As such, the XRP price could reach $3.50 by the end of the month, before passing $5 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Layer-One Network Growth and ETF Hopes Will Push Alt to New Highs ADA has crept to $0.8751 today, with the altcoin – the 11th-biggest coin in the market – suffering a slight dip in the past week but a 5.5% gain in a fortnight. It’s also down by 4.5% in a month, which arguably puts it in a prime position to make a strong comeback in the coming weeks, especially if the Fed does cut rates. If we look at its chart, we see that it’s about to break free of a bullish pennant, while its indicators are also threatening to rise from disappointing positions. It’s MACD (orange, blue), for example, spent the last half of August (and early September) declining, and now it has begun rising again. Source: TradingView This would suggest a gradual renewal of buying pressure, with transfer data suggesting that whales are accumulating ADA again . This is bullish for ADA, and in the coming months Cardano’s fundamentals as a platform is also likely to boost its price. Cardano continues to grow as a network and roll out new updates , improving its utility as a layer-one network over time. And it’s also waiting on Grayscale’s application for a Cardano ETF, which Bloomberg has given a 90% chance of approval . This will only feed into demand for ADA, which could rise to $1 in a few weeks and then top $2 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Dogecoin ($DOGE) – Next Big Milestone is $1 Dogecoin has also risen very modestly today, with its current price of $0.2669 representing a 10% gain in the past week and a 20% gain in a month. This makes DOGE one of the best-performing top-20 tokens over this period, giving it some strong momentum as we enter what may be a very bullish period for the market. As with the other coins in this article, the crypto price prediction for DOGE is bullish because we could see the approval of several Dogecoin ETFs soon (from Grayscale, Bitwise and 21Shares). If so, the Dogecoin price could rocket, with its chart today showing that it has already broken out from a pennant. Source: TradingView The conditions are therefore rip for further gains, with DOGE’s RSI (yellow) and MACD both in elevated positions. Yet what’s encouraging here is that they’re still some way from peaking, meaning that more gains should be coming this week. Dogecoin could therefore reach $0.35 by the end of September, while ETF approvals could send DOGE to $1 by the final month of the year . Why Smart Traders Are Watching Presales – Not Just the Big Names It’s not only established tokens which are enjoying a bullish crypto price prediction today, but also newer, up-and-coming tokens. If we do get a rate cut today, and if the SEC does approve most outstanding ETF applications, then the market could enjoy a bull rally until the end of the year (or beyond). In such a context, traders may also want to consider diversifying into presale coins, since when these launch they can often rally big. One example with a good chance of doing this is ERC-20 token PEPENODE (PEPENODE) , which opened its sale a few weeks ago. It has now raised more than $1.2 million in its ongoing presale, with this figure providing a promising indication of how big it could become once it launches. The PEPENODE presale is live.

Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 And what’s driving interest in PEPENODE is that it’s going to be the market’s first ‘mine-to-earn’ crypto. What this means is that PEPENODE will make use of a novel staking system, one which gamifies staking in order to drive more engagement. Instead of passive staking, PEPENODE enables users to build a virtual mining rig, which they can grow by buying more nodes with the PEPENODE token. More nodes mean greater staking yields, implying that participants will be incentivized to buy and stake more PEPENODE in order to increase their earnings. This is a novel concept, and it could result in a massive demand for PEPENODE going forwards. Investors can buy join the coin’s presale by going to the PEPENODE website , where the token currently costs $0.0010617. This price will rise again tomorrow, so newbies should act quickly if they want to lock in the biggest potential gains.

This recent move by one of the world’s largest asset managers has once again highlighted the growing integration of traditional finance with digital assets. When a financial titan like BlackRock makes such a visible transaction, it sends ripples across the market, prompting many to consider the broader implications for Ethereum and the wider crypto ecosystem. What Does the BlackRock ETH Deposit Signify? Recently, on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain reported a notable transaction: BlackRock deposited 4,538 ETH to Coinbase Prime. This substantial BlackRock ETH deposit isn’t just a simple transfer; it’s a strategic maneuver by an institutional giant. Simultaneously, BlackRock also withdrew 293.6 BTC, indicating a dynamic approach to their digital asset portfolio management. Strategic Asset Management: Such deposits and withdrawals often reflect rebalancing strategies or preparations for new investment products. Coinbase Prime’s Role: Utilizing Coinbase Prime underscores the preference for secure, regulated platforms for large-scale institutional transactions. Market Confidence: BlackRock’s active participation can bolster confidence in the institutional viability of cryptocurrencies. Why Are BlackRock’s Crypto Transactions So Important? BlackRock’s involvement in the crypto space extends beyond a single BlackRock ETH deposit . The firm has been a vocal proponent of digital assets, launching spot Bitcoin ETFs and exploring other avenues for crypto exposure. Their actions are closely watched because they represent a significant bridge between traditional financial markets and the nascent digital asset economy. Moreover, their moves often precede or influence broader institutional adoption trends. This engagement by such a powerful player brings several key aspects into focus: Legitimization: BlackRock’s endorsement adds a layer of legitimacy to cryptocurrencies, making them more palatable to mainstream investors. Liquidity: Increased institutional participation, like this BlackRock ETH deposit , contributes to greater market liquidity and depth. Regulatory Scrutiny: With large institutions entering the space, regulatory bodies often pay closer attention, potentially leading to clearer guidelines and frameworks. How Does This BlackRock ETH Deposit Impact the Market? The immediate impact of a BlackRock ETH deposit or withdrawal might seem minor in the grand scheme of daily trading volumes. However, the long-term implications are profound. For Ethereum, an institutional accumulation or even movement of ETH signals sustained interest in the network’s utility and potential. Similarly, the Bitcoin withdrawal suggests active portfolio management, potentially optimizing for different market conditions or investment mandates. Consider these potential ripple effects: Investor Sentiment: News of institutional activity can positively influence retail investor sentiment, encouraging further participation. Price Action: While not a direct pump, sustained institutional interest can contribute to long-term price stability and growth for assets like ETH. Ecosystem Development: More institutional capital can spur further development and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. What’s Next for Institutional Crypto Adoption After This BlackRock ETH Deposit? The recent BlackRock ETH deposit is likely just another chapter in the ongoing story of institutional crypto adoption. As the digital asset landscape matures, we can anticipate more sophisticated strategies from major players. This includes not only direct investments but also the development of new financial products tailored to institutional needs, further integrating crypto into global finance. The path forward will involve: Diversification: Institutions may increasingly diversify their crypto holdings beyond just Bitcoin, exploring assets like Ethereum for its smart contract capabilities. Infrastructure Development: Continued investment in secure and compliant infrastructure for institutional-grade crypto services. Education and Awareness: A greater understanding of digital assets within traditional finance, leading to more informed investment decisions. In conclusion, BlackRock’s recent activities, particularly the notable BlackRock ETH deposit , serve as a powerful reminder of the accelerating institutional embrace of cryptocurrencies. These moves are not isolated events but rather part of a larger trend that is reshaping the future of finance. As more traditional giants step into the digital asset arena, the crypto market continues to mature, offering new opportunities and challenges for all participants.

Since its launch, the Pi Network price has crashed by about 88%, which has left many early supporters and holders worried about its future. Recent market data shows that the decline can be attributed to massive token unlocks and weak liquidity on crypto exchanges. Furthermore, new developments show that unless market dynamics improve, Pi Network may face even more declines in the coming months. Heavy Selling Pressure Pi Due To Token Unlocks Pi’s price action has been full of downtrends, with data showing the cryptocurrency down across multiple timeframes. At the time of writing, the token is currently moving between $0.353 and $0.3606 with poor liquidity and continued unlocking of the tokens. The unlocks have done nothing to help with the situation of things. Related Reading: Pi Network Price Crashes To All-Time Low After Latest Announcement — Details One of the biggest influences behind Pi Network’s downtrend is the continuous release of unlocked tokens into the market. Pi was created with a max supply of 100 billion tokens, but only 8 billion of those are currently in circulation. Its tokenomics are set up such that tokens are unlocked into circulation every day. According to data from PiScan, there are about 5 billion Pi Network tokens locked right now, and 135.7 million of those are set to be unlocked in the next 30 days. Notably, one unlock event added around 163 million PI tokens worth about $60 million into circulation, a move that contributed further to the cryptocurrency’s price decline. More token unlocks are expected in the near future, and the increase in circulating supply has far outpaced demand. Data from PiScan shows that about 4.5 million Pi worth $1.614 million are released every day. This oversupply problem could leave the price of Pi Network vulnerable, and each token release could further weaken the value of those in circulation. Furthermore, the current order books for Pi Network across several exchanges are extremely thin, leaving too few buyers in the market to absorb the wave of selling pressure. Project Delays: Calls For Bold Action Pi Network’s own development delays have contributed to skepticism among many investors. The long-promised KYC rollout, the V23 upgrade, and full mainnet decentralization have created frustration among users who had anticipated faster progress. Related Reading: Pi Network Faces Obstacles As Price Wobbles Below $1, What’s Happening? In a lengthy post on the social media platform X, prominent community member Mr Spock urged the Pi Core Team to take what he described as bold economic steps to restore stability and build a valuable and sustainable economy. He called for a comprehensive buyback and burn program, noting that aggressive deflationary measures are the only way to protect Pi’s value. According to him, the Core Team should buy back Pi from the open market, permanently burn all transaction fees instead of recycling them, and stop flooding the market with excess supply. He further suggested that Pi’s mining model must be reconsidered either by ending it completely to lock the supply or by introducing utility-based mining that rewards only those who contribute real value to the ecosystem. At the time of writing, Pi Network is trading at $0.3552, down by 1% in the past 24 hours. A drop below $0.350 could guarantee further declines to $0.34.

On-chain data shows that BTC’s current upward trend has notably reignited positive sentiment among short-term holders once again. Short-Term Bitcoin Whales Are Back In The Profit Zone In the midst of the renewed bullish action of Bitcoin, Darkfost, a market expert, has outlined a positive development in profitability. This rise in profits following the recent upsurge in BTC’s price is spotted among Bitcoin short-term holder whales. After surviving a tumultuous period of volatility, Bitcoin’s short-term holder whales are now sitting in the green, as the key cohorts returned to unrealized profit. The move highlights how quickly mood may alter when prices start to move in their favor and suggests a fresh wave of confidence among the market’s more recent major players. It is worth noting that this development is crucial to BTC’s price trajectory as short-term whales usually play a critical role in bolstering momentum and impacting broader market direction. According to the market expert, short-term holders were put under pressure after the minor downturn at the start of September pushed their unrealized price zone. However, these investors are still defending this area for the time being, which ranges from $108,000 to $109,000 levels. During similar corrections that occurred in the past, Darkfost highlighted that the short-term holder whales were pushed into realized losses. Nonetheless, this wave of bearish activity was short-lived and also well-defended by the cohorts, allowing BTC to quickly return to its upward trend. Given that these investors have moved back into unrealized profit and past occurrences, BTC’s ongoing rally is likely to extend, with analysts foreseeing a surge to its current all-time high. BTC’s Persistent Respect Of The STH Cost Basis Bands After examining the Risk Indicator: Realized Price By Short-Term Age Cohorts, on-chain platform Glassnode highlighted that Bitcoin continues to respect the STH cost basis bands. This constant alignment with this metric, which often serves as a gauge of market sentiment and support levels, implies that short-term players continue to have a big impact on market structure. While respecting STH cost basis bands , the leading data analytics platform noted that failure to maintain the 1-month and 3-month realized level would validate a lack of momentum in the market. On the other hand, staying above them indicates that there is still hope regarding the FOMC statement and its impact on liquidity remains intact. At the time of writing, BTC is showing strong upward performance, with a nearly 2% increase in the last 24 hours, pushing its price to $117,257. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BTC’s price today is rising in a gradually bearish investor sentiment, as evidenced by a 10% decline in trading volume in the past day.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|Darkfost|FOMC|Glassnode|Risk Indicator: Realized Price By Short-Term Age Cohorts,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 18:00:17

Solana is the asset. STSS is the vehicle. View full PR here: https://t.co/FRY6odslx9 — STSSsol (@stsssol) September 16, 2025 Sharps Technology currently holds 2 million SOL tokens, worth over $400 million at the time of writing. By converting a portion of these into bonkSOL, the firm will begin earning passive staking rewards on its treasury. “We are proud that STSS continues to support the most productive and dynamic teams and communities within the Solana ecosystem,” said James Zhang, the company’s strategic advisor. bonkSOL enables liquid staking, meaning token holders can earn yield while retaining full control of their staked assets – allowing them to trade or deploy the tokens across Solana-based dApps without missing out on rewards. According to Solana Compass, 218,472 SOL are currently staked via bonkSOL, which is offering an attractive 6.93% APY at press time. Bonk Price Prediction: $BONK Targets 400%+ Gain as Bullish Momentum Builds Bonk has posted a modest 1% gain in the past 24 hours, but the bigger signal lies in trading volumes — up 12%, now accounting for nearly 20% of the token’s circulating supply. Institutional adoption is starting to play a key role in the Bonk ecosystem. Sharps Technology’s decision to stake through bonkSOL has not only boosted credibility, but could spark a wave of treasury moves that increase demand for BONK. As interest in Solana continues to surge, Bonk is well-positioned for a major leg up. The chart shows a clean descending triangle breakout. If momentum holds, BONK could first retest its recent swing high at $0.000040. A breakout from there opens the door to $0.00012 — a 421% move from current levels. While a $1 BONK target remains out of reach for now, these near-term upside levels make the token one of the most promising Solana-based bets of the year. While BONK may offer impressive gains, the biggest returns often come from getting in before the breakout, which is why savvy investors are now turning their attention to early-stage presales . Maxi Doge ($MAXI): The Next Dogecoin? Presale Surges Past $2.25M Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme coin engineered for full-send degens who believe charts only move one way – up. Think Shiba Inu on a caffeine binge, laser-focused on green candles, screaming “buy the dip” into a bullhorn. That’s the MAXI mindset. But it’s not just about memes. Maxi Doge brings real firepower through the Maxi Fund , which deploys up to 25% of presale capital into the cycle’s most explosive tokens. With 1000X leverage and zero interest in stop losses, the goal is simple – go big or go bigger. Every dollar in the fund is aimed at compounding gains and funneling that energy back into Maxi Doge. To buy $MAXI, head to the Maxi Doge website and hook up your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap crypto for $MAXI or use a bank card to complete the transaction.

The president also appointed his own economic advisor, Stephen Miran, to the Fed's powerful Board of Governors, enabling him to take office through a fast-track Republican confirmation process. Speaking at the August 26th Cabinet meeting, Trump stated that they would soon have a majority on the ED Board of Directors, saying, “We will have a majority very soon. This will be great. When we have a majority, the housing market will revive and everything will go very well.” Trump's moves have reignited debate about the Fed's independence, with markets closely watching the president's efforts to shape the agency's top management. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-to-xrp-investors-i-believe-xrps-rsi-will-indeed-go-parabolic-heres-why/,"Prominent XRP analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has issued a bold forecast, arguing that the cryptocurrency’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the verge of a parabolic surge. In a recent post on X, accompanied by a detailed TradingView chart, Egrag highlighted a steepening RSI “curvature” that he believes mirrors the final explosive phases of past XRP market cycles. Why RSI Curvature Matters The RSI is a widely used momentum indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes. When its slope steepens, it often signals accelerating buying pressure—an early warning that prices could rally sharply. Market technicians watch for these changes in curvature because a rapid climb in RSI can precede the kind of blow-off moves that define the final stage of a bullish cycle. #XRP – Steepening #RSI Shape Historical data suggests a #Bullish setup! When the curvature of the #XRP RSI starts to steepen in the last leg of its push, we often see a parabolic rise. In the last phase of each cycle, this pattern has held true, 2 out of 2 times! Will it… pic.twitter.com/NFEEPEoAPh — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 17, 2025 Historical Patterns: Two for Two Egrag’s analysis draws on XRP’s performance in 2017 and 2021, the last two major bull markets. In both cases, the RSI’s upward curvature intensified just before XRP posted dramatic, near-vertical gains. His chart identifies three phases in each cycle: an initial breakout, a corrective dip, and a final parabolic advance. According to Egrag, the current market structure is tracing the same pattern , making this the third potential cycle to follow the script. XRP’s Current Setup XRP is currently trading at $3.02, with its monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) rising into the 70s, indicating the asset might be approaching overbought territory. This climb suggests XRP’s recent performance has been strong, but traders often watch RSI levels above 70 as potential signs of overheating, though this can persist during robust bull markets. That reading reflects strong momentum and places the indicator in the zone traders associate with powerful bullish trends. Egrag believes the combination of rising prices and a sharply steepening RSI suggests that the market is entering the last leg of a historic rally . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Parabolic RSI Drives Price A parabolic RSI means momentum is compounding. As the indicator accelerates, it often sparks short covering and fresh buying, which in turn propels prices higher—a feedback loop that can create the near-vertical moves seen in past crypto bull runs. Technical analysts often highlight this dynamic as a primary reason the Relative Strength Index (RSI) curvature receives close attention during the latter stages of market rallies, as it can signal potential shifts in momentum. Managing the Risks Despite the striking parallels to past cycles, Egrag cautions that no technical pattern guarantees a specific outcome. RSI can remain elevated for extended periods, and unexpected events—such as macroeconomic shocks or sudden liquidity shifts—can disrupt the setup. Traders buying into this narrative still require rigorous risk management strategies, including well-defined entry and exit points, to navigate potential market volatility and protect their positions. The Bottom Line Egrag Crypto’s message to XRP investors is direct: the steepening RSI pattern has twice preceded massive gains, and current market signals look strikingly similar. If the pattern holds, XRP could be on the brink of a powerful move that catches bearish traders off guard. For those following the charts, the coming weeks may reveal whether this third cycle delivers the parabolic surge that history suggests.

Most market commentators believed crypto and the rest of the financial markets had already priced in this cut, so it would be interesting to follow how BTC will react in the following hours and days. Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 25bps. pic.twitter.com/JQ9KAvIloX — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) September 17, 2025 Recall that the primary cryptocurrency exploded in late August during and after Jerome Powell’s speech from Jackson Hole, when the Fed chair hinted that the US central bank would finally cut the rates. Experts anticipated a 25 bps rate reduction during the subsequent FOMC meeting, which took place yesterday and today. BTC had climbed in the past several days in anticipation of the Fed’s announcement and even jumped to a four-week peak of $117,200 earlier today. However, it slumped in the following hours by almost two grand. So far, its reaction to the actual interest rate reduction has been rather muted, as it continues to trade at around $116,000, where it was minutes before the announcement. If that continues to be the case in the following few days, it would prove the theory that the markets had already priced in this rate cut. BTCUSD.

The regulator has suggested that its structure will not be similar to the traditional financial regulations because digital assets are not similar to traditional markets. Rather, the FCA will forgo a number of requirements and increase a number of others with the aim of developing a system that would fit the divergent risks of crypto trading. Lighter Rules for Crypto Firms by 2026 Banks and investment houses will be facing different standards under the draft scheme regarding crypto platforms. Senior management responsibility, operational controls and internal system requirements are some of the areas which are likely to be light. FCA claimed that crypto companies pose no systemic risk comparable to that posed by established financial institutions. The regulator also intends to lift off cooling-off periods in the purchase of crypto. Such safeguards are usually necessary in traditional financial products, but the FCA thinks they would not provide any meaningful protection in the context of the dramatic volatility in the prices of digital assets. Likewise, some of the commitments concerning outsourcing management will not be applicable in the blockchain-based solutions, where transactions can be frequently conducted without middlemen. This change is aimed at making firms more flexible and keeping the transparency levels in a regulated structure. FCA Prioritizes Cybersecurity in New Crypto Rules Some of the obligations will be lightened, whereas others will be tightened. Cybersecurity was pointed out by the FCA as one of its priorities, and it was emphasized that companies need to improve their infrastructure to resist attacks. New cases such as the $1.5 billion theft of Bybit wallet makeup the urgency of enhanced digital security. In order to comply, businesses will have to exhibit resilience to breaches, continuity in operations and prevent prolonged service disruptions. Due to the continuous process of crypto trading, the regulator has focused on the fact that it is imperative to remain 24/7 available. The failure of businesses to deliver on these expectations may result in compliance problems when the new structure is established. Together with the technical standards, the FCA is exploring the option of extending the consumer duty through crypto platforms. The rules would compel firms to treat customers fairly, offer value money, as well as give users options to resolve through the Financial Ombudsman Service in case they are introduced.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-17 18:06:35

This seemingly innocuous phrase has become a significant indicator, hinting at a potentially hawkish stance from the central bank. For investors, particularly those in the volatile cryptocurrency markets, understanding these subtle signals from the Powell FOMC is crucial. A hawkish tone from the Fed can ripple through global finance, influencing everything from interest rates to investor sentiment. Decoding the Powell FOMC Greeting: A Historical Trend Why does a simple greeting carry so much weight? Market observers have meticulously tracked a fascinating trend in past press conferences. The phrase ""good afternoon"" has historically preceded a more hawkish position from the Fed. Conversely, ""hello everyone"" has often signaled a more dovish outlook. These patterns are not mere coincidences; they reflect the careful calibration of language used by central bank officials to communicate their policy intentions. What exactly do these terms mean? Hawkish: This refers to a stance that favors tighter monetary policy, often involving higher interest rates, to combat inflation. It generally signals a less accommodative financial environment. Dovish: This stance favors looser monetary policy, such as lower interest rates or quantitative easing, to stimulate economic growth. It suggests a more supportive financial environment. The Fed is set to announce its interest rate decision at 6:00 p.m. UTC on September 17, followed closely by Powell’s highly anticipated press conference. All eyes will be on his opening words, seeking confirmation of the prediction market’s forecast for the Powell FOMC meeting. Understanding Prediction Markets and the Powell FOMC Prediction markets are platforms where participants can bet on the outcome of future events. These markets aggregate the collective wisdom (and sometimes speculation) of many individuals, often providing surprisingly accurate forecasts. In this case, the market is pricing in a near-certainty of a specific opening remark, which, given historical context, strongly implies a hawkish lean. This isn’t just about the words themselves; it’s about what those words represent in the broader context of monetary policy. The accuracy of these markets stems from participants putting real money on their beliefs, incentivizing thorough research and informed opinions. Therefore, the 96% odds for the Powell FOMC greeting should not be dismissed lightly. What Does a Hawkish Powell FOMC Mean for You? If Chair Powell does indeed adopt a hawkish tone, it carries significant implications across various asset classes: Interest Rates: A hawkish stance typically means the Fed is prepared to raise interest rates further or maintain them at higher levels for longer. This impacts borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Inflation: The primary goal of a hawkish policy is to curb inflation. Higher rates make borrowing more expensive, slowing down economic activity and theoretically reducing price pressures. Traditional Markets: Stocks may react negatively to higher interest rates, as borrowing costs increase for companies and future earnings are discounted more heavily. Bonds, particularly short-term government bonds, might see yields rise. Cryptocurrency Markets: Crypto assets, often perceived as riskier investments, can be particularly sensitive to shifts in monetary policy. A hawkish Fed can lead to reduced liquidity and a ""risk-off"" sentiment, potentially putting downward pressure on prices. Investors might move away from speculative assets towards safer havens. Understanding these potential impacts helps investors prepare for volatility and adjust their strategies in response to the Powell FOMC outcomes. Navigating the Uncertainty of the Powell FOMC While prediction markets offer valuable insights, it’s essential to remember they are not infallible. The actual content of Powell’s speech and the Fed’s statement will provide the definitive direction. However, the strong signal from the prediction market serves as an important heads-up for what could be a significant policy announcement. Investors should: Stay Informed: Monitor the live press conference and official Fed statements closely. Diversify: Ensure your portfolio is diversified to mitigate risks associated with sudden market shifts. Plan Ahead: Consider potential scenarios and how they might affect your investments, especially in the crypto space. The Powell FOMC meeting is a pivotal moment that could set the tone for market sentiment in the coming weeks. Being prepared for a hawkish outlook can help you make more informed decisions. Summary: The financial world is on high alert as a prediction market indicates a 96% chance of a hawkish ""good afternoon"" greeting from Jerome Powell at today’s FOMC press conference. This signal, based on historical trends, suggests a strong likelihood of tighter monetary policy. Investors, particularly in the crypto sector, must understand the potential implications of a hawkish Powell FOMC for interest rates, inflation, and market sentiment. While prediction markets offer valuable foresight, prudent investors will also await the official announcements and plan their strategies accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)? The FOMC is the monetary policymaking body of the Federal Reserve System. It sets the federal funds rate, which influences other interest rates, and decides on open market operations to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. What does ""hawkish"" mean in the context of central banking? A ""hawkish"" stance indicates that a central bank is concerned about inflation and is inclined to implement tighter monetary policy, such as raising interest rates or reducing the money supply, to cool down the economy and control rising prices. How reliable are prediction markets for economic events like the Powell FOMC? Prediction markets can be surprisingly accurate because they incentivize participants with financial rewards to forecast outcomes correctly. While not foolproof, their aggregated intelligence often provides a robust indicator of public and expert sentiment regarding future events. How might a hawkish Powell FOMC affect cryptocurrency prices? A hawkish Powell FOMC typically signals higher interest rates and a ""risk-off"" environment. This can make traditional assets like bonds more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies and leading to downward price pressure. When is the next major Federal Reserve announcement after this one? The Federal Reserve typically holds eight scheduled FOMC meetings per year. The exact dates for future meetings are published on the Federal Reserve’s official website well in advance, allowing market participants to prepare for upcoming announcements.

Here are all the current highlights from Powell's speech: The unemployment rate remained low but increased. Inflation has risen recently and remains at slightly elevated levels. Job growth has slowed and downside risks to employment have increased. Economic growth has slowed. The unemployment rate has not changed much compared to last year. The slowdown in GDP growth mainly reflects a slowdown in consumer spending. Employment growth has slowed significantly due to reduced immigration and falling labor force participation. Employment growth appears to be below breakeven. The labor market is not as active as before and is somewhat weak. Commodity inflation has accelerated and services inflation continues to decline. After next year, most indicators of inflation expectations are aligned with the 2% target. The overall impact of customs duties on inflation is not yet clear. The baseline scenario is that the impact of customs duties on inflation will be short-lived. The risk of persistent inflation must be managed. Inflation risks tend to be on the upside. We have the ability to intervene in time. Politics is not on a fixed course. The change in risks suggests that today's interest rate cut is appropriate. We are firmly committed to the independence of the FED. The Committee continues to consistently pursue its dual mandate objectives. Some tariffs do indeed impact the labor market. Price increases due to customs duties are expected to continue this year and next year. Revised employment data suggest that the labor market is no longer robust. There is no broad support for a 50 basis point rate cut today. We can think of today's discount as a risk management discount. The landscape of labor market risks has changed significantly since the last Fed meeting. The labor market is cooling, which means this needs to be taken into account in policymaking. Wage data is just one factor suggesting the labor market is cooling. We must continue to work to regain 2% inflation. The risk of inflation rising is lower than in April. In their Summary of Economic Forecasts, policymakers outlined an interest rate roadmap that aims to reduce inflation to 2% over time. Inflation is expected to rise this year due to higher commodity prices as a result of customs duties, but this is expected to be a one-time increase. There is less evidence that inflation will rise sustainably. If layoffs begin to occur, the unemployment rate could rise quickly because hiring rates are lower. The Fed makes decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis. We will focus on the data. The Fed will not debate forecasts or attempt to reach consensus. Under current circumstances, it is normal for there to be major differences of opinion. It would be inappropriate to comment on Fed Member Cook's case. I don't think a 25 basis point interest rate cut will have a significant impact. The entire trajectory of interest rates and expectations should be taken into account.

Related News: HOT MOMENTS: FOMC Statement Released Following the Fed Interest Rate Decision - Here Are All the Details of the Full Text After nine months, the Fed lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4%-4.25%. This was the first rate cut since late 2024, and economists expect at least one more cut to follow this year. The Federal Reserve (FEDER) typically raises or holds interest rates steady to curb inflation and cuts them to support economic growth. However, after long treading cautiously due to inflation concerns, the institution recently took the step of cutting rates following weak employment data. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariffs are starting to affect consumer prices, but said this would be a one-time price impact rather than creating lasting inflationary pressure. At the meeting, newly appointed Fed member Stephen Miran opposed the decision, stating that he favored a more aggressive 50 basis point cut. Miran was attending the meeting for the first time as President Donald Trump's nominee, who was narrowly confirmed on September 15th. Meanwhile, Fed member Lisa Cook, whom Trump attempted to dismiss, also attended the meeting after receiving permission from the appeals court to continue her duties. *This is not investment advice.

Layer Brett: The Presale Built for Degens The controversial Cardano price prediction has the market worried. The big and mighty ADA can fail is a realization that is making everyone nervous. But the market is buzzing, and Layer Brett is right at the center of it. In presale for a mere $0.0058 , $LBRETT is being called one of the hottest early entries of the cycle. With predictions of 100x gains floating around, it’s no wonder ADA wallets are moving fast to get in. Layer Brett doesn’t play by half measures. On the tech side, it’s powered by Layer 2 infrastructure, meaning near-instant transactions, gas fees that are practically invisible, and scalability designed for the massive wave ahead. Experts are already forecasting that Layer 2 networks will process more than $10 trillion annually by 2027 — and Layer Brett is positioning itself to be part of that flow. But utility is only half of the formula. Layer Brett is loaded with meme energy, the chaotic community-driven force that keeps tokens alive long after launch. It’s loud, it’s fun, and it’s designed to build hype while delivering performance. The presale comes stacked with rewards for early movers. Instant staking with returns up to 700% APY is live, though those numbers shrink as more buyers pile in. Add in a $1M giveaway, and the dash to get it is off the charts. At $0.0058, Layer Brett offers an entry price that could look tiny in hindsight. The window is open, but it won’t stay that way forever. This is Layer Brett’s moment — and it’s built for 100x. Cardano Price Prediction: The Tortoise and the Rabbit ADA has built its reputation on a methodical, secure, and peer-reviewed approach. This academic rigor has produced a robust and secure foundation, with a highly decentralized network and a fiercely loyal community. However, its deliberate pace has often put it at a disadvantage in a market that prioritizes speed and agility over caution. While ADA has been working on multi-layered scaling solutions, it has often been a step behind. This is where the “rabbit” comes in. With blazing-fast transaction speeds and a rapid development cycle, L2 networks like Layer Brett have captured the market’s imagination and chipped away at its capital. The Cardano price prediction of zero may seem over exaggerated, but ask traders today how slow ADA is, and they will say it is like a tortoise. Compared to this, L2 networks like Layer Brett are winning over ADA holders. In this high-stakes race, the swift and nimble are taking the lead. This time, the rabbit will take over the tortoise. Layer Brett Presale: The Rabbit Winning Layer Brett, where it offers speed, cheap gas fees, and explosive rewards, is also changing the game. ADA is slow and boring, $LBRETT is nimble, cheaper, and full of meme energy. Cardano price prediction got you worried? Move to Layer Brett and enjoy the stakes and price jumps!

The company has also added $6.4 billion in market value. The AI tech firm’s price has also increased by more than 49% in the past month and roughly 57.7% in the past twelve months. Optimism about the company’s core search and AI ambitions has gained traction in the market and pushed its stock price higher. Baidu’s AI ambition gains traction Baidu's going vertical now. Chinese tech shares surge 4% on Wednesday pic.twitter.com/aqAoCd6l1b — David Ingles (@DavidInglesTV) September 17, 2025 Baidu’s options bets also soared, with roughly 170,000 contracts changing hands on Wednesday, more than triple the 20-day average. The firm’s derivatives have surged in recent days, reaching a record number of trades last week. The increased growth stems from Arete Research Services LLP’s lifting its rating on Baidu’s American depositary receipts to buy from sell. The company had only held the sell recommendation on the stock since it downgraded it last May. Arete analysts Shawn Yang and Richard Kramer argued that Baidu’s chip venture has the potential to more than offset the drag from its struggling online advertising business. The brokerage currently prices Baidu’s target at $143, suggesting a potential upside of 17.45% from its current price. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group analysts also published bullish views on Baidu on Wednesday, noting its growth potential in the Cloud business and its latest reasoning model update. On Monday, the company also partnered with China Merchants Group to achieve resource sharing and common development in AI technologies. Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap acknowledged that the initiative could be a multi-year contract to boost Baidu’s cloud revenue. The chief executive officer of the Kunlun unit, Robin Li, said on Tuesday that its latest chip version has achieved mass production. Li also mentioned in August that the AI-focused firm had secured orders from China Mobile to power its servers. He also revealed that the value of Baidu’s contracts is larger than that of its rivals. The tech executive argued that the company had gone through a few funding rounds in recent years to power its development of AI chips. According to Goldman Sachs analysts, Baidu’s latest AI model, Ernie X1.1, showed huge improvements surpassing a DeepSeek model. Baidu launches pricing of its notes offering The Chinese tech company also launched the pricing of its offering of CNY4.4 billion with an aggregate principal amount of 1.90% senior unsecured notes. The notes were sold to non-U.S. persons and will be due by 2029. The AI company said it will use the revenue from the notes for general corporate purposes, such as repaying certain debts, paying interest, and general corporate purposes. Baidu also limits the offering and selling of the notes to any U.S. citizen due to Regulation S under the Securities Act. U.S. persons can be exempted from a transaction that’s not subject to the regulation. The notes will also be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As Cryptopolitan reported , Baidu released positive Q2 results, with total revenues surging by 4% YoY to $4.56 billion. The firm’s non-online marketing revenue also rose by 34% year-over-year and exceeded RMB 10 billion for the first time. “In the second quarter, our AI Cloud business continued to deliver robust and healthy revenue growth, supported by our strengthening full-stack AI capabilities and comprehensive end-to-end AI products and solutions.” – Robin Li , Co-founder and CEO of Baidu.

The team has unveiled W 2.0 Tokenomics, an upgrade set to reward loyal participants, strengthen W’s market stability, and better align ecosystem incentives. It has introduced three innovative upgrades: The Wormhole Reserve, 4% base staking yield, and replacing yearly cliffs with bi-weekly token unlocks. Wormhole @wormhole · Follow 🟣 🟣 Wormhole is announcing the next major chapter for the $W token with the release of upgraded W 2.0 Tokenomics, including:– The Wormhole Reserve– 4% Base Yield on W– Unlock OptimizationRead more ⤵️ 6:44 PM · Sep 17, 2025 455 Reply Copy link Read 129 replies The official announcement highlighted: This milestone represents a significant evolution in how Wormhole aligns incentives, distributes value, and empowers the people who help the ecosystem of Wormhole users, integrators, and contributors win. The market reacted positively to the upgrade news. Native coin W saw a sharp uptick after the news, now up 9% on its daily price chart. Prevailing sentiments signal investor trust in Wormhole’s transition to satisfy the demand of a fast-paced blockchain world. The team emphasized that W 2.0 Tokenomics transforms how value flows back to ecosystem partners, contributors, and users. Let’s explore details about the latest upgrades and their potential impact on the Wormhole ecosystem in the coming times. The Wormhole Reserve The Wormhole Strategic Reserve is at the core of the latest upgrade. The strategic tool will accumulate protocol revenue, including fees collected from ecosystem applications, the Wormhole Portal, and other on-chain undertakings, over time. That translates to gradually locking some W tokens away to capture long-term value. The team commented on the soon-to-launch product, saying: Upon launch, this will be a strategic reserve of W where on-chain and off-chain protocol value will accumulate to support the growth of the Wormhole ecosystem. That approach ties W’s value directly to the platform’s growth, possibly offering holders stable incentives to stay active within the network. 4% yield for active stakers The upgrade also introduces a 4% base yield for individuals who stake W coins and partake in governance activities. Wormhole @wormhole · Follow Replying to @wormhole 🟣 4% Base Yield on W 🟣Wormhole 2.0 is redefining yield with a 4% base reward (variable and not guaranteed) for W holders who stake for governance. This means every staker will have a clear, predictable way to earn rewards for contributing to the network’s growth and 6:44 PM · Sep 17, 2025 80 Reply Copy link Read 4 replies The project will use protocol revenues and existing token allocations to fund the yield without extra inflation as W’s total supply remains at the $10 billion cap. W 2.0 aims to reward activity instead of passive holding. Individuals can leverage the “Portal Earn” to boost their staking returns. That further aligns incentives between community engagement and network growth. Predictable token unlocks Wormhole has introduced unlock optimization to replace existing yearly cliffs with bi-weekly unlocks from next month, October 3. Annual unlocks often trigger sudden sell-offs as massive amounts of assets flood the market at once. Investors can enjoy greater predictability with linear, organized unlock schedules. W price outlook The altcoin traded in the green after a significant jump following the upgrade announcement. W is trading at $0.09578 after an over 9% surge on its 24-hour price chart. The 300% surge in daily trading volume signals renewed interest in the digital token. Chart by Coinmarketcap Nonetheless, today’s rate decision by the Fed will shape W’s performance in the upcoming sessions. A dovish stance would mean extended gains, while disappointments can trigger notable dips.

Scalability, cross-layer compatibility, privacy, and security were the prominent topics in Buterin's speech. Buterin stated that the short-term focus will be on increasing gas limits on the Ethereum mainnet (L1). He said that tools such as block-level access lists, ZK-EVMs, gas price restructuring, and slot optimization will be used in this context. The goal is to maintain the network's decentralization while increasing scalability. The medium-term goal is to enable trustless asset transfers between Layer-2 (L2) networks and achieve faster transaction finality. In this context, “Stage 2 Rollup” solutions, proof-of-conduct combinations, and optimizations for reading data from L1 are on the agenda. Furthermore, network optimizations such as shortening slot times, fast finality protocols, and erasure coding are planned to improve user experience and security. Buterin emphasized that privacy is a priority for both the short and medium term. Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, anonymous pools, encrypted voting, and scrambling network solutions are highlighted to protect the privacy of users' on-chain payments, voting, DeFi transactions, and account changes. Furthermore, secure execution environments, secret query techniques, and the ability to conceal fraudulent requests and data access patterns are also targeted when reading data from the chain. Related News: The Big Day for XRP and Solana (SOL) May Have Been Set: CME Group Announces Buterin's long-term vision highlights a minimalist, secure, and simple Ethereum. This roadmap includes resistance to the risks posed by quantum computers, securing the protocol with mathematical methods (formal verification), and transitioning to ideal cryptographic solutions. Buterin stated that these strategic steps will transform Ethereum into a more scalable, user-friendly, and secure infrastructure. With the strengthening of L2 networks, more users will be able to use Ethereum with less trust assumptions. The ultimate goal is for Ethereum to become a reliable foundational infrastructure for global financial and technological systems. *This is not investment advice.

Binance Bitcoin Netflow Has Been Negative Recently As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a Quicktake post, BTC has been flowing out of Binance recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which keeps track of the net amount of Bitcoin that’s entering into or exiting out of the wallets connected to a given centralized exchange. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the inflows are overwhelming the outflows on the platform. Generally, one of the main reasons why investors deposit their coins in exchanges is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can be a bearish sign for the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trend Constructive As Long As This Metric Holds, Glassnode Says On the other hand, the indicator having a value under zero implies the holders are taking a net number of tokens out of the custody of the exchange. Such a trend may be a sign that the investors are accumulating, which is naturally something that can be bullish for BTC. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow for Binance, the largest exchange in terms of trading volume, over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Binance Exchange Netflow has been negative for the last nine days, indicating that investors have constantly been pulling supply out of the platform. In the same period as these outflows, BTC has seen a recovery run toward the $117,000 level, so it would appear possible that the withdrawals have had a role to play in it. The outflows are also interesting in the context of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which kicked off on Tuesday and will conclude on Wednesday with a speech from US Fed Chair Jerome Powell. “Most analysts expect the Fed to cut rates this week, with prediction markets like Polymarket showing a 92% probability of a rate cut,” notes Maartunn. “The steady outflows from Binance may reflect early positioning ahead of this event.” It now remains to be seen how the market will react when Powell delivers the Fed decision, and whether the streak of Bitcoin net outflows from Binance will continue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Score Sees Sharp Jump, No Longer Signals Bear Phase Bitcoin outflows aren’t the only thing that has occurred on Binance ahead of the FOMC meeting. As CryptoQuant author Darkfrost has pointed out in a Quicktake post, the exchange has also seen massive stablecoin inflows. From the chart, it’s visible that Binance has seen a large stablecoin netflow spike corresponding to the deposit of nearly $2 billion worth of stablecoins. Investors transfer their fiat-tied tokens to exchanges when they want to buy into an asset like Bitcoin, so this could be another indication of investors repositioning in anticipation of the Fed decision. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $116,400, up around 3.6% over the last week.

Reports say the proposal, if cleared, would mark one of the first US products directly tracking both sectors under one umbrella. Two Sleeves, Equal Weight The filing describes a product split into two equal parts. One half would hold shares of publicly traded companies involved in stablecoins or tokenization, such as issuers, payment firms, or exchanges. The other half would gain exposure to digital assets through regulated exchange-traded products covering Bitcoin, Ethereum, oracles, and blockchain infrastructure. Limits are built into the structure. No single crypto holding would account for more than 22.5% of that sleeve. On the equity side, companies are sorted into tiers based on how closely their business ties to stablecoins or tokenization. Each tier has its own cap to prevent heavy concentration in one firm. Regulatory Shift Paves The Way This move follows the passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025, a law that brought stablecoin rules into clearer view. That piece of legislation is being credited with opening doors for funds like Bitwise’s, which could arrive on the market as early as November 2025 if approved.

Stablecoin circulation has ballooned into the hundreds of billions of dollars this year, while tokenized real-world assets are climbing into the tens of billions. Bitwise appears to be betting that investor demand for a regulated entry point into both categories is growing too large to ignore. Balancing Risk And Demand The ETF would be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the same law covering most mutual funds. Rebalancing would take place four times a year, giving the fund a chance to adjust as prices shift or new players enter the market. Bitwise’s move signals more than just another ETF bid. It reflects a push to bring stablecoins and tokenization directly into Wall Street’s reach, placing traditional equities side by side with regulated crypto exposure. Whether regulators give it the green light or not, the filing underscores how quickly digital assets are becoming part of mainstream financial products.

The project’s explosive momentum has sparked bold predictions from analysts, with some forecasting a staggering 9,900% ROI. This has positioned Ruvi AI as a top bet for this cycle, drawing capital from investors who might otherwise consider established but slower-moving projects like Avalanche (AVAX). This bullish outlook is backed by hard numbers. The Ruvi AI presale has officially flown past the $3.7 million fundraising milestone, with an incredible 270 million tokens already sold. This surge in demand comes from a rapidly growing global community that now exceeds 3,600 holders , all eager to secure a ground-floor position in what is shaping up to be a major AI-powered breakout. Why Ruvi AI is Considered a Top Bet Over Avalanche (AVAX) While Avalanche delivered a legendary performance in the past, its massive market capitalization today means that the opportunity for similar exponential gains is limited. Smart investors seeking the next 100x return are now focusing on early-stage projects that combine strong fundamentals with a much higher growth ceiling. Ruvi AI is quickly becoming the top choice. Unlike AVAX’s focus on DeFi, Ruvi AI is targeting one of the fastest-growing sectors in the digital economy: the $104 billion creator market . This strategic focus on a tangible, underserved industry provides a clearer path to mass adoption and sustained demand. This strong foundation is reinforced by key credibility markers, including a successful smart contract audit by CyberScope and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , which establish Ruvi AI as a secure and transparent investment. The Super App Fueling the 9,900% ROI Forecast The engine driving the 9,900% ROI predictions is Ruvi AI’s revolutionary super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, which will create a powerful and sustainable cycle of user adoption and token demand. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content creation. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. The Final Window Before a Guaranteed 40% Price Surge The presale has now entered Phase 3 , offering the RUVI token at the low price of $0.020 . However, with tokens being snapped up at a record pace, this window of opportunity is closing fast. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to turn the 9,900% ROI forecast into a reality: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards the community, adding to the project’s unstoppable momentum. The Top Bet of This Cycle is Here As the presale accelerates toward another rapid sell-out, it’s clear why analysts are calling Ruvi AI a top bet over established coins. For investors seeking to position themselves for this cycle’s most explosive gains, the time to act is now.

The Brussels-based group known as the International Confederation of Music Publishers (ICMP) comprises major record labels and other music industry professionals. Their voice adds to many others within the arts industry that have expressed displeasure at AI firms for using their creative work to train their systems without permission. ICMP accuses AI firms of deliberate copyright infringement ICMP director general John Phelan told AFP that big tech firms and AI-specific companies were involved in what he termed “the largest copyright infringement exercise that has been seen.” He cited the likes of OpenAI, Suno, Udio, and Mistral as some of the culprits. The ICMP carried out an investigation for nearly two years to ascertain how generative AI firms were using material by creatives to enrich themselves. The Brussels-based group is one of a number of industry bodies that span across news media and publishing to target the fast-growing AI sector over its use of content without paying any royalties. Suno and Udio, who are AI music generators, can produce tracks with voices, melodies, and musical styles that echo those of the original artists such as the Beatles, Depeche Mode, Mariah Carey, and the Beach boys. “What is legal or illegal is how the technologies are used. That means the corporate decisions made by the chief executives of companies matter immensely and should comply with the law,” Phelan told AFP . “What we see is they are engaged in wilful, commercial-scale copyright infringement.” Phelan. In June last year, a US trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America, filed a lawsuit against Suno and Udio. However, an exception is Eleven Music, another AI-generated music service provider, which, according to Phelan, signed a deal with the Kobalt record label in August. According to AFP, tech firms normally invoke “fair use,” which is a copyright exception that allows the use of creative works without permission under certain circumstances. Tech firms OpenAI, Google, Mistral, Suno, and Udio did not comment on the matter. Research done by the ICMP revealed that AI firms had done widespread “scraping,” which is a practice that uses programs that are known as “crawlers” that explore the internet for content. The research was first published in music outlet Billboard earlier this month. With these programs, AI firms can harvest lyrics for their models, which then utilize them to recreate them without permission from the original artist, according to the ICMP. Artists want enhanced transparency To ensure there is transparency, rights holders want tougher regulation, which can be achieved through the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act. “It is essential to understand the scale of the threat facing authors, composers and publishers,” warned Juliette Metz, president of the French music publishers’ association and also an ICMP member. “There can be no use of copyright-protected music without a licence.” Metz. The battle between AI firms and the arts industry has intensified as the AI industry continues to grow. In the US, Anthropic agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion into a compensation fund for authors, rights holders, and publishers after they sued the AI startup for illegally downloading millions of books to train its systems. Universal, Warner, and Sony, US-based music majors, are negotiating with Suno and Udio with the hope of striking a licensing deal. This comes as AI-generated music is already finding its way into streaming platforms. According to AFP, AI-generated music accounts for 28% of music that is uploaded on the French music platform known as Deezer, and it has reportedly ballooned over the past year in uploads. A study carried out by the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC) an industry body that represents more than five million creators worldwide, warned about the adverse impacts of AI-generated music. It argues that artists’ income may shrink by as much as 20% in the next four years due to growing AI-made music. In the UK, top artists have also expressed concerns about the growing use of their work by AI firms. They have called on the government to protect their work from AI exploitation. This came after the government indicated plans to permit AI developers to train systems on books, lyrics, scripts, and music without prior permission, which were condemned by artists. Top British musician Elton John said such a policy leaves the door wide open for an artist’s life’s work to be stolen. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Verifying the Claim SMQKE’s statement is specific. Ripple is already recognized within Europe’s alternative payments market. The industry report Key Players in the EU Payments Landscape: 2025 Edition lists Ripple Payments alongside leading providers such as Revolut, Western Union Payment Services, Skrill, Payoneer, Transfermate, and Moneycorp Technologies. According to the report, Ripple Payments operates with one employee, earns €2.81 million in revenue, and posts a net income of €0.13 million. This recognition indicates Ripple is viewed as a viable alternative payment solution, despite the absence of a formal regulatory classification or explicit endorsement from EU authorities. JUST IN: RIPPLE PAYMENTS DESIGNATED AS AN ALTERNATIVE BLOCKCHAIN PAYMENT METHOD, EXPECTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE EU BY OCTOBER 2025 This is documented below. pic.twitter.com/eDDXTH66U4 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 17, 2025 Europe’s Changing Payments Framework The European Union is undergoing significant payment reforms aimed at modernizing its financial landscape. These changes are designed to enhance security, promote innovation, and improve consumer protection within the EU’s payment services sector. The SEPA Instant Credit Transfer mandate, which requires banks to enable 24/7 euro transfers, will become fully operational by October 2025. At the same time, the ECB continues to advance its digital euro initiative, while new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations are set to enhance security, prevent fraud, and drive competition. Deloitte has highlighted these trends, noting that Payment Service Providers (PSPs) are “poised to leverage blockchain technology, the digital euro, and instant payment rails to deliver innovative payment solutions.” This environment provides fertile ground for blockchain-based networks such as Ripple to expand their role in European payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Market Position Ripple already maintains a strong foothold in Europe through its cross-border payment and liquidity solutions. Its Ripple Payments network is used by banks and fintech companies seeking fast, low-cost international transfers. Being listed alongside industry leaders such as Revolut—4,534 employees, €1.57 billion in revenue, €271 million in net income—and Western Union Payment Services—280 employees, €506.94 million in revenue, €15.51 million in net income—confirms that Ripple is part of the continent’s core group of alternative payment providers. Yet, commercial presence is not the same as regulatory approval. A formal EU designation would require explicit confirmation from bodies such as the ECB or the EPC, and no such statement has been issued. Outlook The combination of instant payments, the digital euro, and growing blockchain adoption positions Ripple as a credible candidate for deeper EU integration. For now, the most accurate assessment is that Ripple Payments is recognized as a key alternative payment method in Europe’s 2025 market landscape. However, official EU regulatory confirmation of implementation by October 2025 has not been granted. SMQKE’s report remains a noteworthy lead, and the coming months will determine whether European regulators move toward a formal endorsement.

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a notable decline, dropping below the $115,000 threshold shortly after the announcement. Expert Predicts Crypto Rally Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the current economic landscape, noting that while inflation has eased significantly from its mid-2022 highs, it still remains elevated compared to the Fed’s long-term target of 2%. He also pointed out that there are increasing downside risks to employment in what he described as a less dynamic labor market. Looking ahead, Powell indicated that the Fed anticipates interest rates will settle between 3.5% and 3.75% by the end of 2025, a reduction of 0.50% from current levels. Additionally, he mentioned that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plans to implement two more rate cuts within this year. Market expert Lark Davis took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share his thoughts on the implications of the rate cuts. He stated that the easing of interest rates suggests that “the money printer is getting turned ON,” forecasting that cheaper capital would soon flow into the crypto market. Although Davis acknowledged the possibility of short-term dips, as evidenced by Bitcoin’s performance following the rate cut decision, he remains optimistic about a medium- to long-term rally for cryptocurrencies. Will Rate Cuts Propel Bitcoin And Ethereum To New Heights Again? Analysts at The Bull Theory supported this outlook in a previous analysis, explaining how lower interest rates enhance liquidity. They noted that reduced borrowing costs encourage both businesses and consumers to spend more, ultimately boosting economic activity. Drawing parallels to late 2024, after the Fed had begun its rate cuts, they highlighted how Bitcoin reached new all-time highs while Ethereum (ETH) surged past $4,000. This previous rally lasted approximately two months, suggesting that the current environment might lead to similar outcomes. Despite the immediate volatility in the crypto markets, the analysts predict that smart money and market whales may attempt to shake out retail investors in the short term. However, they remain confident that, within a three- to six-month window, Bitcoin and other altcoins are likely to trade at much higher levels.

The past few years have shown that when memes collide with blockchain, the results can be seismic. From Dogecoin’s cult status to Shiba Inu’s meteoric run, meme coins have captured global attention by blending internet culture, speculation, and financial engineering.

Compared to the usual meme coin launches, BullZilla feels like a spectacle. It’s already in Stage 3A, attracting whales, roaring past $440K raised, and counting over 1,500 holders. Few projects manage to create both hype and structure, but BullZilla does both while framing itself as the top cryptos to join in September 2025.

Launched as the governance and utility token for the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem, APE carries the prestige of one of the world’s most recognized NFT brands. Backed by Yuga Labs, its integration spans gaming, metaverse experiences, and decentralized governance. What makes Apecoin fascinating is its bridging of culture and finance.

Why APE makes this list: It blends meme energy with cultural clout, ensuring its place among the top presale tokens 2025. 3.

Its community thrives on the novelty of “AI-made,” giving it a distinct edge in crypto storytelling. Turbo has managed to generate real volume and listings, proving that AI-assisted creation can compete with traditional meme mechanics. It leans into staking, burns, and token scarcity while embracing its unconventional origin story. Why TURBO makes this list: It’s the first meme coin engineered by AI hype, aligning it with the best crypto presales 2025 narrative. 6. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): The Underdog Cat MEW thrives on contrast : positioning itself as a cat-themed meme coin in a landscape dominated by dogs.

By emphasizing narrative originality, MEW continues to claw its way into the meme market. Why MEW makes this list: It stands as one of the best new crypto launches, proving creativity still matters in meme coin warfare. 7.

The coin embraces this absurdity while attaching financial stakes, creating a loop where virality drives trading. POPCAT’s strength lies in its community, particularly across Asia, where meme enthusiasm has supercharged volume. Its tokenomics are straightforward, but its narrative is timeless. Why POPCAT makes this list: It demonstrates the staying power of internet memes, positioning it as one of the best crypto presales 2025 candidates. 8. Cheems (CHEEMS): The OG Meme Resurgence Cheems represents the golden age of dog memes. Rooted in the “doge but different” format, CHEEMS has nostalgic power. It leans into ERC-20 staking, burns, and community-led liquidity pools. While newer coins flood the market, Cheems holds OG credibility. Its value is cultural as much as financial. For investors, it’s both a meme relic and a potential resurgence story. As 2025 approaches, nostalgia may prove just as lucrative as novelty. Why CHEEMS makes this list: It bridges meme history with modern speculation, making it a top cryptos to join in September 2025 for cultural investors. 9. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): The Wild Card PNUT is quirky, strange, and bold : exactly what meme coins thrive on. With a squirrel mascot and playful branding, it leans into unpredictability. It’s a low-cap ERC-20 token, but its upside comes from originality and virality. The token embraces progressive burns and staking mechanics, adding seriousness beneath its playful veneer. While still niche, its narrative potential is massive. Why PNUT makes this list: It’s unpredictable and fun, embodying the spirit of best new crypto launches. 10. Pudgy Penguins: NFTs Turning Into a Global Brand Pudgy Penguins started as one of the early blue-chip NFT collections on Ethereum, but by 2025 it has grown into something far bigger than a profile picture project. Known for its cute and approachable penguin characters, the brand has expanded into toys, merchandise, licensing, and social media storytelling, bridging Web3 culture with mainstream audiences. What sets Pudgy Penguins apart is its ability to build emotional connection and community loyalty while also experimenting with digital identity, metaverse integrations, and brand partnerships.

The Fed lowered its benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.00%–4.25%, a move widely anticipated after months of slowing job growth and sticky inflation. Chair Powell said it was a “risk management cut,” so the Fed is moving to a data dependent approach. FOMC Statement – Source: Federal Reserve The new projections show US GDP 1.6% in 2025, unemployment 4.5% and inflation easing to 2% by 2028. Powell’s comments calmed some investors but markets got volatile as his press conference started, showing the tension between easing and uncertainty. BREAKING: FED cut rates by 25bps, bringing the target range to 4% – 4.25%. “F*ck your puts. F*ck your calls. J Powell has you by the balls. God bless my money printer.” – Jerome Powell, FOMC 17th Sept, LIVE. pic.twitter.com/6RH291atDS — Carl ₿ MENGER (@CarlBMenger) September 17, 2025 For Bitcoin, which is both a risk asset and an inflation hedge, the path forward depends on how the Fed’s dovish tilt intersects with the chart. Rising Wedge Signals Pressure on Bulls On the technical front , Bitcoin has formed a rising wedge, a bearish continuation pattern that tends to appear when upside momentum begins to fade. After failing to hold above the $117,300 resistance, BTC is now testing the $115,800 support area, reinforced by the 50-period SMA and the wedge’s lower boundary. The RSI has slipped below 50, reflecting weakening momentum, while recent candles show signs of hesitation, with small-bodied formations hinting at indecision. #Bitcoin is trading near $115.9K after the Fed’s first 2025 rate cut. On the 2H chart, a rising wedge is tightening. $115.8K = key support. Lose it → slide toward $114.4K / $113.2K. pic.twitter.com/5vjrmvKvCl — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 17, 2025 If sellers gain control, the TradingView path projection points to a drop toward $114,400, with a deeper slide possible to $113,200, where the 200-SMA aligns with a prior demand zone. A three black crows candlestick pattern beneath support would confirm this bearish continuation. Still, bulls are not out of the picture. Should Bitcoin hold $115,800 and print a bullish engulfing candle or hammer at support, a rebound could follow. A breakout above $117,300 would invalidate near-term downside pressure, opening the way to $118,500 and $119,350. Outlook: Can Bitcoin Break Higher? For traders the $115,800 level is the line in the sand. Above it is accumulation and fresh longs to $118K-$119K. Below it is a deeper correction but the bigger picture of higher lows across the cycle still supports the long term bull case. RSI — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 17, 2025 If the Fed’s rate-cut cycle unfolds in line with 2020, when looser monetary policy helped fuel one of Bitcoin’s strongest bull runs, a new wave of institutional demand could emerge. In that scenario, BTC’s next breakout could extend beyond short-term resistance and build momentum toward the $130,000 region in the months ahead. For investors, today’s volatility is less about short-term noise and more about positioning for Bitcoin’s potential role in the next expansion phase of global liquidity. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $16.5 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012935—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

Traders Eye $239 as Must-Break Level,https://cryptopotato.com/solana-rally-paused-traders-eye-239-as-must-break-level/,"TL;DR $239 acts as a major resistance, with heavy holder concentration seen between $230 and $240 levels. Solana trades in an ascending channel; failure to break $239 could trigger a correction to $220–$200. On-chain data reveals strong whale backing near $232, but profit-taking pressure is building fast. Key Resistance Near $239 Solana (SOL) was trading at $234 at press time, with a 24-hour trading volume of $8 billion. The asset has eased slightly in the past day but remains 6% higher over the week. Market focus is now on the $239 area, where analysts see a clear resistance barrier. Analyst Ali Martinez said, $239 is now the most important resistance wall ahead of Solana $SOL ! pic.twitter.com/0TI0G5XcW0 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 17, 2025 Data from the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart shows a heavy cluster of holdings between $230 and $240, with a concentration at $239. Such levels often act as supply zones, as many holders who bought in that range may look to sell once prices revisit it. Trading Structure and Channel Outlook IncomeSharks shared a chart showing Solana trading inside an ascending channel that has guided the price since early summer. The channel has produced steadily higher highs and higher lows, but the dotted line drawn at $239–$240 remains the key level to watch. Source: IncomeSharks/X IncomeSharks commented, “A close above the dotted line and I’ll call it invalidated,” referring to the possible corrective path marked on the chart. That scenario suggests price could slip back toward $220 or even $200 before finding support. Both areas line up with mid- and lower-channel boundaries and would preserve the overall trend . In addition, Mags noted similarities between Solana and Binance Coin (BNB). The analyst described the cycle as pump, re-accumulation, and then a move to new highs. BNB has already broken into a fresh all-time high, while Solana is lagging. Charts shared by Mags show Solana’s strong rally in 2023–2024, followed by a re-accumulation phase. Price action now suggests the token could be preparing for another leg higher. “Chances are Solana catches up soon,” Mags wrote, pointing to the structural resemblance to BNB. Profit Taking and Large Holders Greg Miller said, $SOL holders have been locking in big profits as price pushes near $250. Chart shows realized gains averaging $1B/day in mid Sept, clear signs of heavy profit taking into the ETF & treasury hype rally. Short term selling pressure is real, but the bigger trend for Solana still… pic.twitter.com/pOvW4t5acQ — Greg Miller (@greg_miller05) September 17, 2025 Realized gains averaged about $1 billion per day in mid-September, pointing to heavy profit-taking during the recent rally tied to ETF and treasury headlines. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Lookonchain shows six strategic entities each holding more than one million SOL. Forward Industries has the largest position with 6.82 million SOL, valued at $1.58 billion, at an average cost of $232.

It's unusual for Zhao to make this kind of comment about cryptocurrency projects other than BNB. The Binance founder shared an image showing the performance of the Aster (ASTER) token, along with the message, “Well done, good start, keep improving.” The image was taken from Aster’s own platform, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.

Given that Zhao still holds significant influence on Binance, it seems likely that the token will be listed on Binance in the coming days. Aster, on the other hand, is notable for being a cryptocurrency project running on the BNB Chain network. It's also backed by YZi Labs, formerly Binance's investment arm and led by Zhao.

51889421,583712,1758137854,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51889421.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper získava 16 miliónov USD: Skutočný BitcoinFi boom sa začína s HYPER,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-raises-16m-bitcoinfi-boom-with-hyper-vn/,"Pondelok 15. septembra 2025 – Hoci je Bitcoin (BTC) najhodnotnejšou kryptomenou na svete, jeho finančná vrstva (BitcoinFi) výrazne zaostáva za druhým najväčším blockchainom Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum má uzamknutú celkovú hodnotu (TVL) 64,6 miliardy USD, zatiaľ čo Bitcoin len 7,39 miliardy USD. Tento rozdiel poukazuje na obrovský nevyužitý potenciál v ekosystéme BitcoinFi. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) vznikol s cieľom preklenúť túto medzeru – ide o najrýchlejšie vybudovanú Bitcoin Layer-2 sieť. Spája efektivitu Solany (SOL) s bezpečnosťou Bitcoinu, čím otvára priestor pre programovateľnosť a škálovateľné aplikácie priamo na Bitcoine. Projekt už získal 16 miliónov USD počas predpredaja za pouhé tri mesiace. Radí sa tak medzi najväčšie tokenové spustenia roka 2025 a ukazuje silnú dôveru investorov v jeho budúcnosť.V aktuálnom kole predpredaja je cena tokenu HYPER stanovená na 0,012925 USD, pričom zostáva sedem hodín, kým sa cena zvýši v ďalšej fáze. BitcoinFi report Q2: rastúci TVL a preteky o programovateľný Bitcoin Dátová platforma Maestro minulý mesiac zverejnila správu State of BitcoinFi , ktorá prináša kľúčové štatistiky o rozvoji BitcoinFi – v podstate DeFi riešení na Bitcoine. Podľa reportu staking dosiahol 7,39 miliardy USD v TVL. Hoci ide o významné číslo, stále je výrazne nižšie ako rozsah Etherea a dokonca len približne polovica oproti Solane, ktorá má 14,37 miliardy USD. Stablecoiny naberajú pôdu pod nohami v Bitcoin ekosystéme V súčasnosti je v stablecoinoch uzamknutých už 860 miliónov USD. Najväčší rast vedie Avalon’s USDa, stablecoin založený na CDP mechanizme, ktorý umožňuje používateľom uzamknúť BTC ako kolaterál a vytvárať USDa. Ďalším silným hráčom je Hermetica, ktorá ponúka syntetický dolár krytý bitcoinovými rezervami a hedgingovými stratégiami. Kľúčovým trendom je aj nástup programovateľnosti – až 5,52 miliardy USD (približne 52 000 BTC) sa už nachádza v prostrediach, kde sa dá využiť na DeFi, pôžičky, vydávanie stablecoinov, tvorbu tokenov a iné aplikácie smart kontraktov. Stacks v druhom kvartáli 2025 viac než zdvojnásobil svoj TVL, keď pridal približne 2 000 BTC, zatiaľ čo sidechainy si naďalej udržujú najväčší podiel BTC. Zároveň sa objavujú a diverzifikujú nové riešenia ako zk-rollupy či architektúry založené na SVM. Tieto čísla jasne ukazujú, že inštitucionálni investori aj vývojári tlačia na to, aby sa Bitcoin stal viac než len statickým rezervným aktívom. A záujem neprichádza iba z inštitucionálnej sféry – kultúrny boom BRC-20 tokenov dokazuje, že aj retailoví používatelia sú pripravení experimentovať s programovateľnosťou Bitcoinu, hoci menej efektívnymi spôsobmi. Problém s BRC-20 a ako ho rieši Bitcoin Hyper Nič nedokazuje túžbu používateľov po väčšej funkčnosti Bitcoinu viac ako vzostup BRC-20 tokenov.Spustený ako jednoduchý štandard zápisu nad Ordinals, BRC-20 nikdy nebol navrhnutý ako plnohodnotná finančná vrstva. Napriek tomu zažil explozívny rast – podľa správy Maestro dosahovali denné objemy až 128 miliónov USD. Meme tokeny ako ORDI a SATS rozprúdili úplne nový trhový segment. Problém s BRC-20 a riešenie cez Bitcoin Hyper Hlavný problém BRC-20 spočíva v tom, že ide skôr o obchádzku než o skutočnú inováciu. Zostatky sa spoliehajú na off-chain indexery namiesto natívnej validácie, čo robí vlastníctvo nejednoznačným. Každý transfer navyše zaťažuje Bitcoinovú základnú sieť, zvyšuje poplatky a vyvoláva kontroverziu. A bez smart kontraktov zostávajú tokeny obmedzené iba na špekulácie, namiesto toho, aby poháňali pôžičky, stablecoiny či komplexné aplikácie. To je presne priestor, kde sa ukazuje príležitosť pre ďalšiu vlnu projektov BitcoinFi. BRC-20 dokazuje nespochybniteľný dopyt po tokenoch a programovateľnosti na Bitcoine, ale zároveň odhaľuje limity budovania bez škálovateľného základu. Bitcoin Hyper je navrhnutý tak, aby poskytol tento základ. Ako najrýchlejšia Bitcoin Layer-2 sieť v histórii spája výkon Solany s bezpečnosťou Bitcoinu, čo umožňuje fungovanie smart kontraktov, DeFi a celých tokenových ekosystémov vo veľkom meradle. Prečo je Bitcoin Hyper lepším základom Bitcoin Hyper je budovaný okolo kanonického mosta, ktorý umožňuje priamy presun BTC do prostredia Layer-2. Po premostení získa Bitcoin plnú programovateľnosť. Model je podobný tomu, ako používatelia mintujú USDa na Avalone uzamknutím BTC ako kolaterálu, no v tomto prípade je výsledné aktívum omnoho univerzálnejšie. Tento dizajn prináša základ, ktorý predchádzajúce projekty nedokázali vybudovať. Kanonický most je zabezpečený zero-knowledge dôkazmi, ktoré kotvia transakcie späť na Bitcoinovu základnú vrstvu, zatiaľ čo škálovateľnosť zabezpečuje Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). $HYPER Update Hyper runs on Solana VM, mapping its parallel model to Bitcoin settlement—delivering faster dApps, validated flows, and stronger performance than EVM, with Solana’s runtime + Bitcoin’s security. Read the full update https://t.co/A5aTv7XfX3 pic.twitter.com/gqs2dnaCWz — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 12, 2025 Vývojári získajú prístup k prostrediu v Ruste s nástrojmi ako Anchor, čo výrazne uľahčuje tvorbu bezpečných a výkonných aplikácií. Používatelia profitujú z paralelného spracovania, nízkych poplatkov a potvrdení v rámci sekúnd – a to všetko pri zachovaní bezpečnosti garantovanej Bitcoinom. Kľúčové je, že Bitcoin Hyper je transparentný vo svojom vývoji. Tím pravidelne zverejňuje aktualizácie na X, vrátane prebiehajúceho výskumu v oblasti execution layer. Namiesto toho, aby sa uspokojil s Ethereum Virtual Machine a jej sériovými obmedzeniami, Hyper ukazuje, ako je možné preniesť paralelné spracovanie transakcií na Bitcoinové zúčtovanie bez narušenia dôvery. Tento záväzok k otvorenému vývoju ostro kontrastuje s projektmi ako Fractal Bitcoin či SatoshiVM, ktoré sľubovali inovácie, no nikdy nevybudovali bezpečnú a udržateľnú infraštruktúru. Výsledok: moderné aplikácie s Bitcoinom ako základom Výsledkom je prostredie pre exekúciu transakcií, v ktorom môžu moderné, paralelne spracované aplikácie naplno fungovať – pričom Bitcoin ostáva konečnou zúčtovacou vrstvou. Táto kombinácia rýchlosti, bezpečnosti a pripravenosti pre vývojárov robí z Bitcoin Hyper najdôveryhodnejší základ pre ďalšiu fázu rastu BitcoinFi. Účel tokenu HYPER a ako ho získať Natívny token HYPER poháňa celý ekosystém Bitcoin Hyper. Slúži ako: gas token pre transakcie v sieti, staking aktívum, ktoré zabezpečuje reťaz, governance token, ktorý držiteľom umožňuje spolurozhodovať o ďalšom vývoji. Mnohí analytici – vrátane popredného krypto edukačného portálu 99Bitcoins – označujú HYPER za potenciálny 100× token, pretože každá aplikácia postavená na Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2 funguje práve na ňom. Bitcoin Hyper už vyzbieral viac než 15,5 milióna USD v predpredaji a je označovaný za jeden z najväčších Layer-2 projektov na Bitcoine v roku 2025. Ak ho chcete získať, navštívte oficiálnu webstránku Bitcoin Hyper a nakúpte tokeny počas prebiehajúceho predpredaja. Platby sú možné pomocou SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB alebo dokonca platobnej karty. Projekt odporúča peňaženku Best Wallet , kde je HYPER už zaradený v nástroji Upcoming Tokens . Ten umožňuje jednoducho sledovať, nakupovať a neskôr si tokeny nárokovať po spustení projektu.

But they are taking a back seat as newcomer Layer Brett is dominating every social media platform. Connect your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, choose your preferred payment in ETH, USDT, or BNB, and buy $LBRETT during its presale for just $0.0058 . This simple action unlocks access to Layer Brett, a cutting-edge Layer 2 meme coin that’s rapidly gaining traction and capturing social media attention. Layer Brett: The $0.0058 Ticket to 100x Presales don’t usually make this kind of noise, but Layer Brett is built differently. At just $0.0058 per token , $LBRETT is sparking serious FOMO, with traders already calling for 100x gains. Layer Brett’s backbone is pure Layer 2 strength. Transactions are fast, gas fees are microscopic, and scalability is built for adoption on a massive scale. Layer Brett thrives on meme culture, blending humor, hype, and community energy with cutting-edge tech. That fusion makes it more than just functional — it makes it exciting, addictive, and impossible to ignore. Rewards are equally wild. Early stakers can lock in up to 700% APY, though the rate drops as more wallets rush in. On top of that, the $1M giveaway adds fuel to the presale frenzy, turning FOMO into a full-blown firestorm. XRP’s Resurgent Momentum XRP is regaining the market as a top contender, with a clear focus on real-world utility that distinguishes it from its peers. While the crypto world has been focused on ETF speculation, XRP has been quietly building. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is also gaining traction, with a flurry of new projects centered on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) and launching stablecoins, positioning Ripple as a core piece of future financial infrastructure. Ripple charts are now aligning with this fundamental strength. After a period of quiet consolidation, on-chain data shows a decisive breakout above key moving averages, with a technical rating of “Strong Buy” from several analysts. This bullish XRP momentum, combined with its rock-solid utility and ongoing network expansion, suggests that XRP is ready for a major price surge. Analysts are now forecasting a move toward $5 by the end of 2025, and this is just the beginning of its long-term rally. The Solana Supernova SOL is entering a new era of institutional and technological dominance. A wave of Nasdaq-listed firms, including Helius and Forward Industries, have recently announced massive digital asset treasury (DAT) strategies. This influx of capital is a direct result of SOL’s groundbreaking speed and efficiency. The charts reflect this shift. Analysts now predict a massive price surge toward the $300-$340 range, fueled by this institutional demand and the growing speculation of a spot SOL ETF. With its technology continually improving and its ecosystem growing at an unprecedented rate, SOL is positioned for a powerful rally that could solidify its place as the top performer in this bull cycle. Conclusion Layer Brett represents a significant step forward, combining viral meme culture with powerful Layer 2 utility. Early participants in the $LBRETT presale can gain early entry and benefit from amplified staking rewards. The social media dominance shows that traders are serious about Layer Brett, leaving Solana and Ripple’s XRP in the dust.

According to the company's statement today, thanks to the reserve, different income channels in the ecosystem, namely the Wormhole protocol, the Wormhole Portal that provides multi-chain connectivity, and other applications, will be gathered in one center. The new plan will not only preserve staking rewards but also offer additional return opportunities to investors who participate in management and actively use the applications. Wormhole Portal users, in particular, will be able to earn points to increase their staking returns. The targeted base return rate is set at 4%. Related News: HOT MOMENTS: FOMC Statement Released Following the Fed Interest Rate Decision - Here Are All the Details of the Full Text The team argued that returns will be generated from the existing token supply and protocol revenues, without inflation. The total supply will be capped at 10 billion W tokens, as is currently the case. Under W 2.0 Tokenomics, which will take effect in October, the annual “annual cliff” unlocks, which previously led to a large volume of token releases, will be eliminated. Instead, small, regular token releases will be held every two weeks to reduce market pressure. The new distribution model includes guardian nodes, community investors, and strategic network participants, while the Wormhole Foundation treasury will continue its four-year plan. Furthermore, core developer tokens will remain locked under contractual guarantees. *This is not investment advice.

This strength underscores growing buyer confidence and highlights a market structure tilted in favor of further gains. With support levels holding and momentum indicators flashing strength, SOL appears to be building the foundation for its next leg higher in the ongoing bull run. Solana Holds Above Key Moving Averages, Reinforcing Bullish Bias Gemxbt, in a recent post, pointed out that SOL is displaying a strong bullish market structure, with its price action now trading above the 5, 10, and 20-period moving averages. Such alignment of short-term moving averages reflects sustained upward momentum, as buyers continue to maintain control over the market direction. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Pushes Higher – Is More Upside Still Ahead? The analyst noted that Solana has established key technical levels, with support forming around $237.5 and immediate resistance situated near $245. These levels will likely serve as pivotal points in the short term, guiding whether the market consolidates further or pushes higher. A break above resistance could reinforce the bullish momentum, while defending support remains essential to preserving the uptrend. Further strengthening the outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending upward. This indicator points toward growing market confidence, as traders continue to lean toward accumulation rather than distribution, reinforcing the bullish tone in SOL’s price action. Adding to the confluence, the MACD has recorded a bullish crossover, with the MACD line moving above the signal line, supporting the bullish sentiment. Combined with the alignment of moving averages and supportive RSI trends, the overall setup suggests that Solana is well-positioned to sustain its rally if buyers maintain their presence in the market. Technical Pattern Confirms Renewed Buyer Strength BitGuru, in a recent update on X, highlighted that SOL has staged a remarkable rally, driven by a strong double bottom breakout and a clean bullish setup. The formation of these patterns has provided momentum for Solana’s price to push all the way up to $249.60, signaling renewed strength in the market.

Following this impressive surge, the price action has entered a cooling phase, with the market now undergoing a pullback. Despite the retracement, the overall structure remains intact as SOL is consolidating near the key $235 support level. In the meantime, this pause in price movement could be a healthy step for the market, allowing buyers to regain strength before attempting another push higher. As long as $235 holds firm, the setup continues to favor bulls, with Solana potentially eyeing a fresh move back toward resistance levels in the sessions ahead.

The agency announced that it will extend the review period and invited the public to provide comments on the application. SEC Opens Public Commenting The proposal was filed in June 2025 by NYSE Arca on behalf of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). However, the SEC placed the application under extended review in late July, and on September 16, updated its docket to allow for public feedback. If given the green light, the fund would be a commodity-based trust under Rule 8.201-E. It would also hold BTC directly and track the crypto asset’s price minus fees and expenses. Yorkville America Digital, LLC is listed as the sponsor, and the ETF would trade on NYSE Arca. Trump Media has also submitted applications for other crypto products. These include the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, lodged in July 2025, which proposes a basket of five digital assets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, CRO, and XRP, and a separate fund designed to provide exposure to BTC and ETH. The SEC has so far acknowledged the two proposals, putting them under active evaluation. It moved its decision on the BTC & ETH funds to October 8, while no formal delay has been announced for the Blue Chip ETF. Over 92 ETF Applications Await Resolution The regulator’s Truth Social decision marks the latest in a series of postponements under its new Chair, Paul Atkins. More than 92 crypto ETF applications remain pending, with the financial watchdog expected to issue a wave of decisions in October once a generic listing framework is finalized. Among the delayed filings are Franklin Templeton’s SOL and XRP ETFs, pushed to November 14 after the SEC used its full 60-day extension. BlackRock’s iShares ETH Trust has been rescheduled to October 30 following a 45-day stretch. The 21Shares SOL and XRP ETFs now face new deadlines of October 16 and 19, while WisdomTree’s XRP Fund, filed through Cboe BZX, has been moved to the 24 under prolonged review. Other altcoin and meme-based products that have been rescheduled include Grayscale’s HBAR Trust and Bitwise’s DOGE ETF, whose decision dates were changed to November 12. However, the new leadership under the Trump administration raises the chances of a potential green light for these investment products. Analysts like Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, have also predicted an imminent surge in approvals for altcoin ETFs in the next two months.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-this-xrp-breakout-has-just-started-heres-why/,"STEPH IS CRYPTO’s recent X post spotlights a classic chart pattern that has traders watching XRP closely. The TradingView snapshot he shared shows two well-defined descending channels—periods of consolidation where price made lower highs and lower lows—followed by sharp upward thrusts. Each previous channel acted as a “spring,” storing energy before a powerful release. The latest price movement mirrors this exact structure, with XRP breaking decisively above the upper boundary of the second channel. This repetition of pattern lends credibility to his assertion that the breakout is only just beginning. Strong Momentum and Supportive Volume A breakout gains significance only when it is backed by convincing trading activity. Recent market data confirms a surge in XRP’s daily trading volumes as the price pushed through the critical $3.00 level. Higher-than-average volume during an upside breach is a textbook confirmation that buyers, not short-term speculators, are in control. Analysts note the former channel’s midline now serves as support, establishing a robust technical base that diminishes the chances of a quick turnaround. THIS #XRP BREAKOUT HAS ONLY JUST STARTED. pic.twitter.com/PCezUVXRFs — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 17, 2025 Institutional Inflows Fueling Demand Behind the charts lies growing institutional interest . Market trackers and crypto analytics platforms have recorded steady inflows into XRP-related investment products over the past several weeks. Such institutional participation adds weight to the bullish case, signaling that larger players are positioning for long-term exposure rather than chasing short-term momentum. When deep-pocketed investors accumulate during consolidation phases, it often sets the stage for sustained price appreciation. Macro Environment Adds Tailwinds XRP’s technical resilience is bolstered by the prevailing bullish sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market, suggesting a supportive environment for its price performance. Renewed optimism around digital assets and improving global liquidity has created favorable conditions for risk assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 With Bitcoin and other major coins also trending higher, XRP benefits from the positive sentiment sweeping through the market. This macro backdrop provides additional fuel for the rally, suggesting that XRP’s move is not occurring in isolation but within a wider tide of crypto demand. Measured Targets and Risk Considerations From a technical perspective, measured-move projections derived from the height of the breakout channels point to initial targets in the mid-$3 range , with more ambitious analysts eyeing higher levels if momentum persists. Still, seasoned traders stress the importance of caution. A daily close back below former resistance or a sharp drop in trading volume could signal a weakening trend. Managing exposure and monitoring key support zones remain critical as XRP advances. Outlook STEPH IS CRYPTO’s analysis underscores a compelling narrative: repeated bullish structures, rising institutional inflows, and strong volume suggest that XRP’s current surge is far from over. While no rally is without risk, the convergence of technical and fundamental factors supports his view that “this breakout has only just started.” For traders and investors alike, XRP now stands at the center of one of the market’s most closely watched upward moves, with the next chapters likely to unfold in the weeks ahead.
