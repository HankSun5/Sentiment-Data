The $4 trillion digital asset space has grown little over the last few months, although the original crypto Bitcoin did hit a record peak of $124,128 last month. Beyond Bitcoin, major capital inflows are finding their way into both blue-chip altcoins and the best meme coins . Numerous projects have marked fresh all-time highs over the past year, showing the growing enthusiasm surrounding the sector. Adding momentum to this sentiment are two pivotal moves from Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, America’s inaugural comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins. Second, the SEC announced Project Crypto, a program aimed at updating and clarifying the application of securities laws to the digital asset industry. With confidence in the market climbing, let’s take a closer look at how the best altcoins like XRP, Cardano, and Shiba Inu could be positioning themselves for further gains. Ripple ($XRP): The Cross-Border Payments Leader and Best Performer among Altcoins in 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) hit a new peak of $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act became law, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40. It has since pulled back to about $3.05, down roughly 16% from that high. The appeal of XRP lies in its speed and affordability for cross-border transfers, often bypassing legacy payment systems like SWIFT. Its legitimacy is bolstered by endorsements from global bodies such as the UN Capital Development Fund and even acknowledgment from the White House. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also took part in a high-level presidential roundtable on crypto earlier this year. XRP gained renewed momentum in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled its retail sales were not securities violations, effectively ending a prolonged clash with the SEC. Over the past year, XRP has surged 429%, leaving Bitcoin’s 96% gains trailing behind. A mid-July breakout has kept the token around the psychologically significant $3 support level. While prices have dipped here and there, XRP has remained relatively stable throughout adverse market movements. With a relative strength index (RSI) around 54, the token is showing neutral momentum, suggesting traders are cautiously reentering following a temporary scare from softer U.S. inflation numbers. In mid-November, the US SEC will deliver verdicts on whether spot XRP ETFs will be approved for trading. If the verdicts are possible, we may see new momentum that could carry XRP to $4 or higher that same month. Cardano ($ADA): Eco-Friendly Ethereum Rival Prepping for 2026 Run-Up Cardano ($ADA) has ranked as one of the best altcoins for many years, and 2025 is no different. In the past 365 days, ADA climbed 159%, outpacing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Created in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is a smart contract platform that emphasizes sustainability through its Proof-of-Stake model and an academic, peer-reviewed development process, both of which later influenced Ethereum’s own direction. Currently valued at over $39.1 billion, ADA would need to triple its market cap to match Solana and begin challenging Ethereum for the number-two spot. ADA is trading at about $0.8701, reflecting a 1.1% rise over the last day, falling just short of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which rose 2.2% and 3.6% respectively. However, positive political and macroeconomic catalysts could push ADA toward $1.50 by autumn and potentially set the stage to retest its all-time high of $3.09 by year-end, a 255% increase from current levels. From a technical standpoint, ADA formed a bullish flag between December and March, hinting at more upside. Its RSI is downtrending from 52, which indicates its price is consolidating around current levels, with plenty of headroom for further growth in the near term. For now, resistance is near $1.15, while support remains firm around $0.85–$0.90. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Dogecoin Challenger with Real-World Utility and Huge Upside Potential Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in August 2020, has solidified its role as the second-largest meme coin, boasting a market cap of over $7.7 billion. In the past 24 hours, SHIB remains virtually unchanged despite a 4% drop on average across crypto’s $86.2 billion meme coin sector. Considering the fact that the collective $4.11 trillion crypto market actually grew 0.5% overnight, this is a strong signal that Shiba Inu is behaving more like a regular cryptocurrency. HIB currently trades around $0.00001311. Chart analysis points to possible further gains. In the past year, SHIB has shown two bullish formations: a descending wedge pattern from November through March and a flag formation emerging since mid-May. If SHIB breaks its primary resistance at $0.000022, a strong market rally could put it somewhere around $0.00003 before October ends. In a bull market, forecasts suggest a move between $0.00006 and $0.00009 by year’s end. Unlike most meme coins, SHIB offers tangible use cases through enhanced privacy features and Shibarium, its Ethereum-based Layer-2 scaling solution that lowers transaction fees and improves speed. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): First Bitcoin Layer 2 and One of 2025’s Hottest Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one of this year’s most talked-about presales, aiming to become the first Bitcoin Layer 2 that blends viral meme culture with scalability and community-driven development. The project’s goal is to enhance Bitcoin with faster transactions, smart contract capability, and community governance. So far, the presale has raised more than $16.2 million, with experts predicting potential post-launch gains exceeding 10×. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER supports ultra-fast smart contracts while keeping costs minimal. Its standout feature, the Canonical Bridge, enables near-instant BTC transfers while supporting dApps, meme tokens, and low-fee payments. A Coinsult audit confirmed the platform is free of vulnerabilities, further boosting confidence. The $HYPER token powers staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early presale participants can earn staking rewards of up to 70% APY, along with voting rights on future ecosystem updates.

51843473,https://cryptonews.com/?p=423782,1758061800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51843473.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 16 September – XRP, Solana, Pepe",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-16-september-xrp-solana-pepe/,"Major tokens have mounted a modest recovery today, with the crypto price prediction for XRP, Solana, and Pepe improving as we get closer to the FOMC’s much-anticipated meeting this week . The crypto market as a whole has seen its total cap rise by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, reaching $4.11 trillion as investors become more bullish in anticipation of a likely rate cut from the Fed. It’s in this context that we take a closer look at XRP, Solana and Pepe, which are now in a position where they could surge in the event of a rate cut tomorrow. We examine their fundamentals and technicals, and we offer predictions as to where they could be in the near and more distant future. Crypto Price Prediction Today 16 September XRP ($XRP): Incoming ETF Approval Could Push Alt to New ATH by October XRP has risen to $3.03 today, marking a 1.5% gain in 24 hours and a decent 8% increase in a fortnight. What’s also bullish is that the altcoin is still down by 3% in a month, implying that it still has plenty of space to rally further this week before entering an overbought position. There are numerous reasons to be optimistic about XRP right now, with the most immediate being the fact that we could see upwards of ten XRP ETFs gain SEC approval in the coming months. In fact, Bloomberg analysts have suggested that one XRP ETF – the REX-Osprey XRP ETF – could begin trading as early as this week, which could be massive for the coin’s price. This coincides with XRP reaching a very opportune position in its chart, which is showing a steady increase in momentum, just in time for bullish news (from the Fed and/or SEC). Source: TradingView XRP’s RSI (yellow) has climbed above 50 in recent days and looks ready to climb further, while its MACD (orange, blue) has also recently turned positive. When you combine these technicals with Ripple’s recent growth and expansion as a cross-border transfer business , they point to a rising XRP price. It could reach $3.50 by the end of the month, while a bull rally could see it top $5 in December. Solana ($SOL): Treasury Firms Can Push Token to New Highs Within Weeks Trading at the $235 level, Solana has risen by 7.5% in a week and by 22% in a month. This gives the altcoin plenty of momentum as we enter a key period for the crypto market, with Solana having benefited from lots of positive news recently. On the one hand, more institutions and/or public companies have announced SOL treasury strategies, including the Galaxy Digital-backed Forward Industries and Helius Medical . On the other hand, Solana continues to grow as a layer-one platform, as evidenced by Pump.fun’s ongoing growth in revenue , for example. This arguably makes SOL the most bullish alt in the market right now, with its chart today showing that it’s getting closer to a peak. Source: TradingView As such, we could see the Solana price rise strongly towards the end of the week, following the FOMC’s rate decision, before correcting a little over the weekend. Longer term, the prospect of SOL ETFs means that the crypto price prediction for Solana is very bullish, with the coin set to reach new all-time highs in Q4. It could potentially pass $300 by November, before crossing $400 by the New Year. Pepe ($PEPE): Whale Buys Indicate Incoming Pump for Meme Token As with several other coins, Pepe has moved sideways today, with its current price of $0.00001076 representing a very slight drop in 24 hours. However, PEPE remains up by 11% in a fortnight, and while it is down by 4% in a month, this presents an opportunity for further gains in the very near future. Its chart supports the view that the meme token remains in an oversold position and that a rebound is on its way. As we can see below, its indicators have only recently turned positive, having spent pretty much all of August in negative territory. Source: TradingView And it seems that whales have been stocking up on PEPE in recent days , in expectation of big rises in the weeks and/or months to come. This is an encouraging development as far as the crypto price prediction for PEPE goes, and it testifies to the meme token’s enduring popularity. We could therefore see the PEPE price reach $0.0000160 in the next few weeks, before climbing to $0.000030 by Xmas. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-to-Earn Token Raises $1.1 Million in Viral Presale The tokens above all have a good chance of rallying strongly as and when the crypto market enters a bull rally, yet traders may also wish to diversify into newer tokens. That’s because new and recently launched tokens can often outperform market averages, particularly when they gain exchange listings for the first time. This is something that happens to presale coins, which can generate lots of momentum during their sales, and they rally upon launch. The world’s first Mine-to-Earn meme coin is here. Yep you read that right. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/3j6C8mqmjW — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 16, 2025 One of the more interesting presale tokens around right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 coin that is offering a novel take on staking. PEPENODE has already raised $1.17 million in its presale, which it opened last month, and it’s quickly attracting new supporters. What’s exciting about PEPENODE is that it’s launching with a ‘mine-to-earn’ staking system, in which holders can build their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to buy more virtual nodes, users can earn bigger staking yields. This dynamic is likely to incentivize greater PEPENODE accumulation, which in turn could see the coin’s price rising steadily over time. Investors can join its presale and but it early by visiting the PEPENODE website , where the coin currently costs $0.0010617.

With its hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin was designed to be resistant to inflation and independent of central bank policy. Yet even after fifteen years, its claim to “digital gold” status remains unproven. Recent market action highlights the contrast: while traditional safe-haven assets climb steadily during uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to behave like a risk asset, rising and falling with liquidity cycles rather than shielding portfolios in times of stress. At the same time, the conversation about where true value lies in crypto is being reframed. While Bitcoin struggles to live up to its nickname, new projects are capturing attention in other ways. MAGACOIN FINANCE , a presale smashing fundraising records, is demonstrating that scarcity, cultural energy, and legitimacy can create value every bit as compelling as the “digital gold” narrative once promised. Institutional adoption, but lingering volatility The arrival of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 marked a milestone, drawing billions in institutional inflows. Pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers finally had an accessible vehicle for exposure. But with inflows came a reality check: volatility hasn’t disappeared. Instead of behaving like a hedge in times of economic stress, Bitcoin’s price action still mirrors risk assets such as high-growth tech stocks. This unresolved identity keeps Bitcoin from fully stepping into the “digital gold” role. Institutions may recognize its scarcity and network security, but many still hesitate to treat it as a true safe-haven asset. Until Bitcoin can consistently offer stability through crises, its crown remains aspirational rather than proven. A new definition of value Bitcoin’s volatility raises an important question: what defines value in the crypto world? If scarcity and institutional inflows aren’t enough, what else matters? Increasingly, analysts point to cultural relevance, community engagement, and the ability to capture imagination. These are elements gold doesn’t have and Bitcoin hasn’t mastered, but they are at the heart of new breakout projects. This is where the story shifts. Instead of chasing “digital gold” status, some tokens are redefining value entirely. They thrive not by replicating traditional assets but by offering something uniquely digital, built around scarcity, branding, and cultural firepower. The clearest current example is MAGACOIN FINANCE. In just weeks, the project has already raised more than $14 million , with presale rounds selling out at unprecedented speed. Thousands of investors are joining Telegram groups, stacking allocations, and amplifying buzz across social platforms. Whale inflows are complementing grassroots enthusiasm, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of momentum. What makes this story different is legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE has completed major audits , giving it structural credibility rarely seen in early presales. Combined with scarcity-driven tokenomics and bold cultural branding, the project has broken records not simply by hype, but by delivering the ingredients investors increasingly demand. According to many analysts MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a staggering 9,300% ROI, positioning it alongside the fastest-growing meme-driven altcoins of the last decade. Why the timing matters The timing of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise is no accident. With Bitcoin still searching for its identity as digital gold, traders are eager for assets that can combine scarcity with excitement. Presales thrive in this environment, offering both early access and the potential for asymmetric returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the embodiment of that trend: a project not weighed down by debates about hedging or institutional status, but celebrated for its real-time traction. By breaking fundraising records, it shows that crypto’s next stars may not come from mimicking gold, but from building entirely new definitions of value. The broader message for crypto markets Crypto’s evolution has always depended on dual narratives. On one side, Bitcoin pushes toward institutional legitimacy, battling to prove itself as a safe-haven asset. On the other, cultural projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE rise rapidly, powered by community energy and scarcity. This dynamic balance keeps the sector vibrant, attracting both cautious institutions and passionate retail investors. For the market, this coexistence is critical. Bitcoin’s quest for legitimacy provides the anchor regulators can engage with, while projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE keep the industry fresh, relevant, and fast-moving. Together, they ensure crypto remains one of the most dynamic asset classes in global finance. Conclusion Bitcoin has not yet earned its crown as “digital gold.” Despite ETFs and institutional inflows, its volatility keeps it tethered to risk-on assets rather than serving as a true hedge. But crypto doesn’t need to replicate gold to thrive. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving that value can also be defined by scarcity, community, and legitimacy. With more than $14 million raised , audits completed, and social momentum accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking records and rewriting what investors expect from presales. Where Bitcoin still seeks proof of concept, this project is already demonstrating traction. Together, they show that the future of crypto won’t be defined by a single narrative, but by multiple paths to value.

A truly remarkable event just unfolded, as a long-dormant Bitcoin whale , inactive for over a decade, suddenly sprang to life. This mysterious entity, holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin, executed a significant transfer that has caught the attention of market watchers globally. What could this sudden movement signify? Unveiling the Mysterious Bitcoin Whale’s Significant Transfer According to data from Whale Alert, a service tracking large cryptocurrency transactions, a Bitcoin whale that had been dormant for a remarkable 12 years recently moved 98.99 BTC. This transfer occurred just an hour ago, sending the funds to an anonymous address. For context, this whale originally held 1,000 BTC, making this latest move a substantial portion of its long-held stash. Such a lengthy period of inactivity for a wallet of this size is highly unusual. The sudden awakening of this particular Bitcoin whale naturally sparks numerous questions about its owner’s intentions and the potential ripple effects on the broader crypto market. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Whale and Why Do They Matter? In the world of cryptocurrency, a Bitcoin whale refers to an individual or entity that holds an exceptionally large amount of Bitcoin. While there isn’t an official threshold, holdings typically ranging from hundreds to thousands of BTC are often considered ‘whale’ status. These large holders play a crucial role in the market for several reasons: Market Influence: Their large transactions can significantly impact Bitcoin’s price and market sentiment. Liquidity: Whales often provide or withdraw significant liquidity from exchanges. Early Adopters: Many dormant whales are early adopters of Bitcoin, holding coins from its nascent days. Tracking the movements of these powerful players provides valuable insights into potential market shifts and trends. Their actions can often precede significant price movements, making their activity a key indicator for many investors. Why Did This Dormant Bitcoin Whale Finally Stir? The reasons behind this particular Bitcoin whale ‘s sudden activity after 12 years are purely speculative, given the anonymity of blockchain transactions. However, several common theories emerge when such dormant wallets awaken: Profit-Taking: The whale might be looking to realize substantial gains from their long-term investment, given Bitcoin’s incredible price appreciation over the past decade. Portfolio Rebalancing: The owner could be moving funds to diversify their holdings, perhaps into other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets. Security Upgrade: Transferring funds to a newer, more secure wallet or a different cold storage solution. Exchange Deposit: The funds might be moving to an exchange, potentially signaling an intent to sell. Lost Keys Found: In rare cases, owners who had lost access to their private keys might have finally recovered them. Without more information, the exact motivation remains a captivating mystery. However, the sheer duration of dormancy makes this event particularly intriguing. The Broader Implications for the Bitcoin Market The movement of nearly 99 BTC by a long-dormant Bitcoin whale can have several implications for the wider market. While 99 BTC might not be enough to crash the market, it’s the symbolism and potential for further action that creates interest. If the funds were moved to an exchange, it could signal an impending sell-off, potentially adding selling pressure. Conversely, if moved to a new cold storage address, it could indicate a long-term holding strategy, which is often seen as a bullish sign. On-chain analytics tools allow experts to trace these movements, providing a degree of transparency even with anonymous addresses. The crypto community will be closely watching for any subsequent transactions from this address or the remaining 901 BTC held by the original whale. What Can We Learn from This Bitcoin Whale’s Awakening? This event offers several valuable lessons for both seasoned and new crypto investors. Firstly, it underscores the incredible long-term holding power of some early Bitcoin adopters. Holding through multiple market cycles, including significant bear markets, demonstrates immense conviction. Secondly, it highlights the importance of staying informed about significant on-chain movements. While not always predictive, large transfers can act as indicators of shifts in sentiment or supply dynamics. For investors, understanding the behavior of a Bitcoin whale can offer a unique perspective on market trends and potential future price action. It encourages a deeper dive into market analytics beyond just price charts. In conclusion, the awakening of this 12-year dormant Bitcoin whale and its subsequent transfer of 99 BTC is a fascinating development. It serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic, often unpredictable, and always intriguing nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. While the ultimate intentions of this mysterious whale remain unknown, its actions provide valuable data points for those seeking to understand the complex forces shaping the future of Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically hundreds or thousands of BTC, whose transactions can significantly influence market prices and sentiment. Why do Bitcoin whale transfers matter? Their transfers matter because they can signal potential buying or selling pressure, affect market liquidity, and provide insights into the confidence or intentions of major holders, impacting overall market psychology. What does ‘dormant’ mean in the context of a crypto wallet? A dormant crypto wallet refers to a wallet address that has shown no outgoing transactions for a very long period, often several years, indicating that the funds have been untouched by their owner. Can these large Bitcoin transfers affect Bitcoin’s price? Yes, significant transfers, especially if moved to exchanges, can lead to increased selling pressure and potentially cause short-term price volatility. Conversely, movements to cold storage might be interpreted as a bullish long-term hold signal. How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track Bitcoin whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms and services like Whale Alert, which provide real-time notifications of large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. What are the typical reasons for a dormant Bitcoin whale to become active? Common reasons include profit-taking, rebalancing portfolios, moving funds to more secure wallets, preparing to sell on an exchange, or, in some cases, regaining access to lost private keys.

Lawmakers are actively considering a proposal to integrate the Anti-CBDC act into a broader, comprehensive digital asset market structure bill. This move could have profound implications for the future of digital currencies in America. This development, initially reported by Cointelegraph, signals a critical juncture for cryptocurrency regulation. If this measure passes, the combined legislation would then advance to the Senate for further deliberation. What is the Anti-CBDC Act and Why is it Crucial? At its core, the Anti-CBDC act aims to prevent the U.S. government from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is essentially a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Proponents of the Anti-CBDC act express significant concerns. They often highlight issues related to privacy, potential government surveillance, and the risk of increased financial control over citizens. The act seeks to safeguard individual financial freedom and limit government overreach in digital transactions. Many believe that a government-issued digital currency could pave the way for a ‘surveillance state,’ where every transaction is monitored. This perspective drives the urgent push for this protective legislation. A Pivotal Moment for Crypto Market Structure The proposed inclusion of the Anti-CBDC act is not happening in isolation. It is being considered as part of a larger digital asset market structure bill. This overarching legislation aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Establishing clear rules is vital for the growth and stability of the crypto market. Without proper guidelines, businesses and investors face uncertainty, which can hinder innovation and adoption. The market structure bill intends to address these regulatory gaps. Integrating the Anti-CBDC act into this bill means that the debate over central bank digital currencies is now firmly linked to the broader conversation about how digital assets will be regulated in the U.S. This connection elevates the importance of both legislative efforts. Past Battles and Future Prospects for the Anti-CBDC Act This isn’t the first time Republican lawmakers have attempted to ban the issuance of a central bank digital currency. Previously, they sought to include an anti-CBDC measure during a vote on the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill. While that specific attempt did not succeed within the stablecoin bill, the commitment to the cause remained strong. Subsequently, the Anti-CBDC act successfully passed the House as a standalone bill. This earlier success demonstrates significant support for the measure. Now, by attempting to attach it to a broader digital asset bill, lawmakers are looking for a more direct path to enactment. This strategy could increase its chances of becoming law, as it would be part of a larger package deemed essential for the crypto industry. What are the Core Concerns Surrounding CBDCs? The opposition to CBDCs stems from several key concerns: Privacy: Critics fear that a CBDC could eliminate financial privacy, allowing governments to track every transaction. Surveillance: There’s a worry that a CBDC could enable a ‘surveillance state,’ giving authorities unprecedented insight into citizens’ spending habits. Control: Some argue that a CBDC could give governments the power to freeze funds, implement negative interest rates, or even program spending, limiting individual economic freedom. Disintermediation: There are concerns that CBDCs could bypass commercial banks, fundamentally altering the financial system. These points form the bedrock of the arguments in favor of the Anti-CBDC act , emphasizing the need for safeguards against potential governmental overreach. The Road Ahead: From House to Senate If the U.S. House of Representatives successfully incorporates the Anti-CBDC act into the digital asset market structure bill, the journey is far from over. The comprehensive legislation would then be sent to the Senate for its own round of deliberations, debates, and votes. The Senate process can be complex and time-consuming, with potential amendments and further negotiations. The outcome in the Senate is not guaranteed, and strong advocacy from both sides of the CBDC debate is expected. Ultimately, for the Anti-CBDC act to become law as part of this broader bill, it must pass both chambers of Congress and receive presidential assent. This legislative path highlights the critical nature of the current discussions in the House. The ongoing debate in the U.S. House over the inclusion of the Anti-CBDC act in the digital asset market structure bill marks a truly pivotal moment for the future of finance and individual liberties. This legislative effort underscores a growing concern among lawmakers about the potential implications of central bank digital currencies. The outcome of these discussions will not only shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies but also determine the extent of government involvement in digital money. It’s a debate that touches upon fundamental questions of privacy, control, and the very nature of money in the digital age. Keeping an eye on these developments is essential for anyone interested in the evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)? A1: A CBDC is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are decentralized, a CBDC is centralized and controlled by the government. Q2: What is the primary goal of the Anti-CBDC act? A2: The primary goal of the Anti-CBDC act is to prevent the U.S. government from issuing a central bank digital currency, citing concerns about privacy, surveillance, and potential government control over individual finances. Q3: How does the Anti-CBDC act relate to the broader crypto market structure bill? A3: The Anti-CBDC act is being considered for inclusion in a larger bill designed to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. This means the debate over CBDCs is now tied to the overall regulation of the crypto industry. Q4: What are the main concerns opponents have about CBDCs? A4: Opponents primarily worry about the erosion of financial privacy, the potential for government surveillance of transactions, and the risk of governments gaining excessive control over citizens’ spending and financial activities. Q5: What happens if the Anti-CBDC act is included in the market structure bill and passes the House? A5: If included and passed by the House, the combined legislation, including the Anti-CBDC act , would then proceed to the Senate for further deliberation, debate, and a vote before potentially becoming law. Q6: Has the Anti-CBDC act been debated before? A6: Yes, Republican lawmakers previously attempted to include an anti-CBDC measure in a stablecoin regulation bill. The Anti-CBDC act also passed the House as a standalone bill prior to this current consideration.

Resistance at around $0.29 is being watched closely, and a breakout here could trigger further upside. Meanwhile, Remittix(RTX) is rising fast as the best crypto presale pick in 2025. Its team is now verified by CertiK, and its wallet beta is live with community testers. Compare Doge’s speculative momentum with Remittix’s foundational upgrades and the presale path looks increasingly attractive. Dogecoin’s Path To $0.50 Looks Possible Dogecoin is trading at around $0.26, with a resistance zone between $0.27 and $0.29. If DOGE holds support around $0.23 and volume picks up, this breakout could materialize perhaps by late Q4. Market volatility and weak macro signals might dampen momentum. Also, meme coin saturation and lack of new utility could limit upside. Still, many believe the risk-reward looks favorable if DOGE can clear the resistance and maintain bullish indicators. Why Remittix has Become the Best Crypto Presale Right Now Dogecoin’s possible rally is powered by sentiment and technicals, but Remittix is offering structural utility, verified security and strong community incentives. The project is fully verified by CertiK and is officially ranked #1 on CertiK for Pre-Launch tokens, which raises confidence among security-conscious investors. The wallet beta is live, and community users are actively testing, helping to uncover usability feedback and speed up product readiness. These updates give Remittix something more than charts; they give it substance. Demand metrics for Remittix underline its growing strength. It has sold over 664 million tokens. It is priced at $0.1080 per token. It has raised over $25,8 million. Those numbers show strong momentum, early adoption and that investors are backing the presale in size. Add the 15% USDT referral rewards and $250,000 giveaway and Remittix offers more utility-oriented upside for those seeking a presale opportunity. Here are features that boost Remittix’s case: Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries Global payout rails are integrated already and expanding The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency Early believers are already calling it “XRP 2.0” It is built for adoption, not speculation These factors contrast sharply with DOGE’s reliance on community sentiment and potential, but less on product rollout. With BitMart listing secured once over $20 million was raised, LBANK listing secured upon passing $22 million and a third CEX listing in view, Remittix is building real market access. Remittix Is Standing Out While Dogecoin Eyes Technical Upside Dogecoin has a path to $0.50 if it breaks well above $0.29 and holds support near $0.23. Technicals and sentiment favor the possibility. Yet Remittix is delivering verified security with CertiK, a live wallet beta under community test, strong metrics and incentive programs working now. For those asking, “What is the best crypto presale?” Remittix is looking like the strongest pick, offering both structural strength and upside that many DOGE bulls are hoping for but may not have in hand yet.

51844537,582600,1758063629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51844537.jpeg,American Express Turns Travel Memories Into NFT Passport Stamps,https://bitcoinist.com/american-express-turns-travel-memories-into-nft-passport-stamps/,"American Express has rolled out a new way for cardholders to collect travel memories: blockchain-backed passport stamps that live on a public ledger. The stamps are meant to be keepsakes, not investments, and they are tied to in-person spending while traveling. American Express Launches Passport Stamps According to company information and reports, the feature — called Amex Passport — issues NFT-style stamps as ERC-721 tokens on Base, an Ethereum layer-two network. Eligible cardholders must be US consumer cardholders with their cards linked to their online Amex account. Stamps are earned when a linked card is used in person in any of 130+ qualifying countries and regions, and past trips can be stamped retroactively for up to two years based on purchase records. What The Stamps Show Reports have disclosed that each stamp records simple details: the country or region visited, a date, and a short note such as a favorite meal or a memorable sight. The stamps can be viewed in the Amex Travel app’s Passport section and can be shared to social media or saved to a camera roll. They are non-transferable, which means users cannot sell or move them to other wallets; they are intended strictly as personal mementos. How Travelers Can Earn Stamps American Express Cardholders who pay with their Amex card, or via Apple Pay or Google Pay tied to that card, should trigger the stamp when they make qualifying purchases abroad. Based on reports, the smart contract implementing the program was deployed roughly 25 days before the public announcement, and more than 20,000 stamps had been issued soon after launch. That early uptake suggests some interest among frequent travelers who already use Amex while abroad. American Express: Privacy And Technical Notes According to published coverage, American Express aims to limit what goes on chain. Stamps avoid putting personal information such as names or exact purchase details into the public ledger. Still, the fact that entries live on a public blockchain means there are tradeoffs — some data about visits will be visible to anyone who inspects the contract. The company says privacy safeguards are in place, but users who are cautious about on-chain traces should be aware of those limits. What The Numbers Show A customer survey cited around 73% of respondents saying they want more digital ways to mark trips , while about 56% said they miss getting physical passport stamps. The initial list of eligible places covers 130+ countries and regions, and retroactive stamping reaches back two years. At launch the program applies only to US consumer cards; corporate accounts are not included.

As it stands, record stock valuations, resilient GDP growth, sticky inflation, and cracks are forming in the labor market, leaving the stage open for volatility in traditional markets that could spill over into the next explosive altcoin season. Fed Rate Cuts At Record Valuations Expectations are also high that the Fed will keep lowering rates at the next interest rate decision on Wednesday, September 17, 2025 and through the end of this year. According to a lengthy thread that was posted on the social media platform X, this could have long-term bullish effects on the crypto industry. Related Reading: Altcoin Market Completes Highest Monthly Close Ever: What This Means For Alt Season The Federal Reserve usually cuts rates in the face of economic weakness and depressed equity markets, but this time is different. As noted by The Kobeissi Letter, valuation metrics tracked by Bloomberg show US stocks are more expensive than ever, having surpassed even the 1929 pre-Depression peak and the dot-com bubble. Furthermore, the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio hit 5.3x in late August, its record level. Despite these extremes, policymakers are expected to cut by at least 25 basis points this week based on weakness in the labor market. History shows that when rate cuts occurred with stocks within 2% of all-time highs, as shown in 2019 and 2024, the S&P 500 delivered strong gains over the following year. This unusual mix could once again amplify capital flows into high-growth assets, including cryptocurrencies, in the last quarter of 2025. A Perfect Time For Altcoins Cutting rates into hot inflation adds liquidity fuel just as investors chase risk assets. That backdrop has always caused powerful surges for Gold, Bitcoin, and other major cryptocurrencies, as the return of these assets thrives when fiat returns come under question. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Index Sets New 2025 High, What This Means For The Crypto Market As The Kobeissi Letter framed it, the time has come. The Fed’s decision to cut rates with stocks at record highs, amid a 3% GDP growth and hot inflation 110 bps above the Fed’s long-term target, could be the driver of the next altcoin season. Gold and Bitcoin have already been priced in this new era of liquidity, as both are now up by 450% and 105%, respectively, since 2023. The setup is even better for altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Chainlink, and most especially cryptocurrencies involved in the growing AI niche. There could be more immediate-term volatility, but long-term asset owners will benefit the most from the rate cut. However, if the Federal Reserve opts for a slower pace of cuts than markets are currently pricing in, the disappointment could ripple through both equities and cryptocurrencies and cause short-term declines this week.

Fundamentals supported by Aptos expansion and Kraken Ink partnership. By Jainam Mehta Aave ( AAVE-USD ) is currently trading at $296.30, showing weakness after failing to defend the $300 psychological level and slipping below its short-term moving averages. The 20-day EMA sits at $303.0, the 50-day EMA at $305.9, the 100-day EMA at $307.5, and the 200-day EMA at $308.2, all clustering overhead as resistance. The immediate support is at $295.0–$292.0, with a deeper floor around $276.0 if bearish momentum persists. To shift sentiment, AAVE must reclaim the $300–$305 zone, which now acts as resistance. The RSI at 35.4 indicates oversold conditions, hinting at short-term exhaustion in selling pressure. Technical and on-chain picture On-chain flows reflect mixed signals. Netflows on September 16 recorded +$0.98M inflows, suggesting renewed deposits into exchanges. While this may point to profit-taking or near-term sell pressure, whale accumulation near the $290–$295 region has historically provided local support. AAVE’s market cap remains near $4.2B, securing its status as a top DeFi lending protocol, though it lags behind competitors in recent momentum. Aave price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technically, the loss of the rising channel structure and rejection from the EMA cluster confirm bearish momentum. Holding $295 support is now critical, as a break lower could expose the $276 zone, last defended in July. Conversely, reclaiming $300–$305 would restore confidence, with follow-through targets at $325–$330 if momentum builds. Fundamental positioning and outlook From a fundamentals standpoint, Aave continues to expand its ecosystem. The Aptos integration earlier this year marked its first non-EVM deployment, broadening the reach beyond Ethereum and its L2s. At the same time, the partnership with Kraken Ink is designed to channel institutional liquidity into regulated Aave-powered lending markets, positioning the protocol for long-term adoption. On the downside, regulatory risks tied to stablecoin yields and phishing campaigns targeting Aave users highlight short-term sentiment headwinds. Institutional engagement remains supportive, but retail appetite has weakened as staking yields declined. The V4 Liquidity Hub and Horizon RWA markets provide longer-term tailwinds by bridging DeFi and traditional finance, yet near-term market structure suggests Aave will remain dependent on Bitcoin-led flows. Short-term outlook Looking ahead, AAVE sits at a fragile juncture. If $295 holds, oversold RSI could spark a relief rally back into $305–$310, aligning with EMA resistances. A decisive break above $310–$315 would be needed to unlock medium-term targets at $325–$330. Conversely, failure to defend $295 risks further downside into the $276–$278 demand area. Broader altcoin weakness, fueled by rising Bitcoin dominance at 57.3%, will remain a key external driver. In earlier analysis, the $300–$305 zone was highlighted as the critical pivot. Current price action confirms its role as the key battleground for AAVE’s next directional move.

Whales staked more than $1.5 billion in SOL, reducing circulating supply. A breakout above $240 could accelerate gains toward $260 and $280. By Parshwa Turakhiya ​Solana ( SOL-USD ) is trading around $235.87, consolidating after briefly touching $237 earlier in the session. The token remains in a rising channel that has defined its uptrend since June, supported by strong inflows and whale accumulation that continue to underpin its structure. Technical barriers emerge at $240 The daily chart shows Solana holding comfortably above its 20-day EMA at $219 and 50-day EMA at $201. Broader support rests near the 200-day EMA at $176. The immediate challenge is the $240–$245 resistance zone, where the upper channel trendline aligns with a key Fibonacci cluster. A clean break above this barrier would likely expose the $260 and $280 levels, while a failure to defend $219 risks a slide toward $201 and $187. SOLUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Momentum indicators remain constructive. The RSI prints near 65, reflecting controlled consolidation rather than exhaustion. If RSI reclaims 70 while price sustains above $240, momentum buyers could trigger the next leg higher. Whale accumulation supports conviction On-chain flows highlight growing institutional involvement. Net inflows of $39.7 million entered exchanges on September 16, extending a trend of positive flows through September after months of stagnation. This suggests accumulation pressure is building, aligning with the price recovery. Whale wallets have been particularly active. More than $1.5 billion worth of SOL shifted through Coinbase Prime and Forward Industries staking accounts over the past week. Large tranches of nearly 987,000 SOL, worth about $237 million each, were staked, with additional transfers of 439,000 SOL (~$99 million each) sent into custody. These movements reduce circulating supply and signal long-term commitment rather than speculative rotation. Outlook hinges on breakout Solana’s near-term trajectory depends on whether it can overcome resistance at $240–$245. A confirmed close above this level could open a run toward $260 and $280, while rejection would likely send the token back to the $219 support cluster. Institutional staking and whale inflows provide a strong structural base, reinforcing conviction that Solana remains a leading candidate for outperformance in the current cycle. The scale of accumulation has also fueled speculation that SOL could reach far higher levels if momentum persists, though traders remain cautious near technical resistance. Previously, we noted that Solana’s outperformance against Ethereum was being reinforced by positive inflows and retail rotation into high-beta altcoins. The latest data on whale staking further validates this trend, suggesting that both institutional and retail forces are aligning to sustain the rally.

The strategic move by Chiliz OG Esports , a groundbreaking development, sees Chiliz (CHZ) making a significant foray into the competitive gaming landscape. This pivotal moment involves the acquisition of a 51% stake in the renowned esports organization OG Esports, as reported by Decrypt. It’s a clear signal that the convergence of blockchain technology and professional gaming is accelerating, promising exciting new opportunities for fans and stakeholders alike. What Does the Chiliz OG Esports Acquisition Mean for Fan Tokens? This isn’t Chiliz’s first interaction with OG Esports. Back in 2020, OG Esports was a pioneer, becoming the very first esports team to launch its fan token on the Socios platform. This early partnership laid the groundwork for the deeper integration we see today. The OG fan token has already demonstrated impressive growth, recently hitting an all-time high in market capitalization, soaring past the $100 million mark. Currently, the OG fan token is trading robustly. According to CoinMarketCap, it sits at $16.83, reflecting a healthy 10.23% increase. This strong performance underscores the inherent value and appeal of fan tokens, especially when backed by a popular and successful team like OG Esports. The Chiliz OG Esports acquisition will likely amplify this trend, potentially driving further engagement and utility for these innovative digital assets. How Will Chiliz’s Investment Shape the Esports Landscape? Chiliz, through its Socios.com platform, has been at the forefront of fan engagement in sports and esports globally. Acquiring a majority stake in OG Esports is a strategic move designed to deepen its roots within the dynamic esports ecosystem. This isn’t just about a financial investment; it’s about integrating Web3 technologies more intimately into team operations and enhancing fan experiences. Enhanced Fan Engagement: Expect more innovative ways for fans to interact with OG Esports, from voting on minor team decisions to gaining exclusive access and earning unique rewards. New Revenue Streams: The acquisition could unlock novel monetization strategies for OG Esports, leveraging blockchain’s transparency and efficiency. This provides sustainable growth opportunities. Broader Web3 Adoption: This significant move could serve as a blueprint for other esports organizations, encouraging wider adoption of fan tokens and comprehensive blockchain solutions across the industry. The vision behind the Chiliz OG Esports deal extends beyond simple ownership. It aims to create a more immersive and rewarding experience for the global fanbase, solidifying the role of digital assets in modern sports entertainment and community building. What Are the Future Prospects for Fan Tokens in Esports? The success of the OG fan token and the subsequent Chiliz acquisition paint a clear picture: fan tokens are here to stay and poised for significant growth. This development suggests a future where fan tokens are not just collectibles but integral tools for community governance, loyalty programs, and direct, meaningful interaction between teams and their ardent supporters. Consider the compelling potential benefits: Direct Influence: Token holders gain a tangible voice in minor team decisions, fostering a stronger sense of belonging and ownership. Exclusive Perks: Access to VIP events, limited-edition merchandise, and unique digital content can be directly tied to token ownership, rewarding loyalty. Community Building: Fan tokens facilitate a decentralized community where supporters have a shared stake in the team’s success, creating a powerful collective identity. The Chiliz OG Esports partnership is a testament to the evolving dynamics of sports and entertainment, where digital ownership and active community participation are becoming increasingly vital components of the fan experience. Driving Innovation: The Road Ahead for Chiliz and OG Esports This strategic alliance is set to drive significant innovation within both the blockchain and esports sectors. Chiliz’s established expertise in Web3 technology, particularly with fan tokens, combined with OG Esports’ competitive prowess and dedicated global fanbase, creates a powerful synergy. We can anticipate not only new product offerings and enhanced platform features but also potentially groundbreaking integrations that push the boundaries of what’s possible in fan engagement and digital ownership. However, this journey isn’t without its considerations. Integrating blockchain solutions into a traditional esports organization requires careful planning and execution. Ensuring user-friendliness for fans who might be new to crypto, managing tokenomics effectively, and navigating regulatory landscapes will be key challenges. Despite these, the potential for growth and the creation of a truly interactive fan ecosystem is immense. The Chiliz OG Esports partnership aims to overcome these hurdles, setting new industry standards. This is more than just a business transaction; it’s a statement about the future. It highlights the growing importance of decentralized technologies in mainstream industries. The partnership will undoubtedly inspire other teams and organizations to explore similar ventures, further legitimizing fan tokens and blockchain applications in the broader sports entertainment industry. The goal is to create a more direct, transparent, and rewarding relationship between teams and their most passionate supporters.

The drama will air on MBC, one of South Korea’s biggest terrestrial broadcast networks, in the prime-time 10 pm Friday and Saturday slot. The first episode will air on September 19, and the drama is based on a hit novel by Jang Ryu-jin. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the production team behind the drama explained that the three main characters, played by Lee, Jo (formerly of the K-pop group gugudan), and Ra, all share a common goal: To find wealth through crypto investment. A trailer for the upcoming Korean drama series To The Moon. Korean Drama To The Moon ‘Does Not Encourage Crypto Speculation’ The drama’s producers were keen to emphasize that “although the three main characters have a common interest in cryptocurrency investment, the drama does not encourage speculation.” At a media event on September 16, Oh Da-young, the drama’s chief producer, said: “We are not trying to tell viewers that they can make a lot of money from [crypto investment]. We aren’t trying to stoke speculation.” WATCH: #LeeSunBin , #RaMiRan , #JoAram , And #KimYoungDae Prepare To Board The Cryptocurrency Train In "" #ToTheMoon "" Teaser https://t.co/KEoy2W1A26 pic.twitter.com/K3KYTlPXZr — Soompi (@soompi) September 10, 2025 However, it appears that the drama’s cast members are no strangers to crypto. Ra said that she holds a small amount of Ethereum (ETH) . The veteran actress explained: “I actually have 500,000 won [$362] worth of Ethereum. Sometimes its value goes up to 600,000 won, and sometimes it goes down to 400,000 won. But I don’t know how to withdraw my money, so I just leave it alone. I’ll hold on to it until the day it reaches 500 million won [$361,721]!” The official poster for the South Korean drama series To The Moon. (Image: MBC/X) Drama’s Backdrop Is 2017-2018 Bitcoin Bull Market The drama is set in 2017-2018, at the time of the crypto bull market. At the time, crypto investment was entirely unregulated in South Korea, and media outlets were full of news stories about pensioners and schoolchildren investing their money in little-known altcoins. The action centers around three women from poor families who have grand dreams. However, they are frustrated by their low-salary office jobs at a large confectionery retailer. When one of the trio starts to see positive results from investing in crypto, she shares her experience with the other two, who also follow suit. A trailer for the series appears to show that the three women’s investment experience yields decidedly mixed results. “This is a story that will resonate very well with female office workers,” Oh said. 조아람-이선빈-라미란 '달까지 가자'[엑's HD포토] #달까지가자 #ToTheMoon #이선빈 #LeeSunbin #라미란 #RaMiran #조아람 #JOARAM https://t.co/nqcoCjgfvO — 엑스포츠뉴스 (@xportsnews) September 16, 2025 South Korean Scriptwriters’ Crypto Inspiration Crypto has proved a rich source of subject matter for South Korean drama producers and movie script writers in recent years. This appears to reflect the continuing rise of retail crypto investment in the country, as the domestic stock market remains stagnant and real estate prices remain prohibitively high. South Korean companies are still unable to buy crypto with their balance sheets. And this means that the country’s vibrant crypto scene remains purely retail-based.

(Source: CoinGecko) Earlier this year, the film Crypto Man, starring the late Song Jae-rim , proved a box office smash in South Korea. The movie, based loosely on the story of the Terra-LUNA/LUNC crash, told the tale of a man who exploited loopholes in government grant programs to fund his cryptocurrency project.

While there are several factors from analysts why the price prediction is changing, the rise of new competition is showing more strength. This is because a new pre-launch token has taken center stage lately as a threat to the XRP price prediction, with outlook seeing top analysts calling the new altcoin “XRP 2.0.” However, here is a quick look at why the XRP price prediction could keep changing in the coming weeks as the pre-launch token makes new progress. Analysis Of XRP Price Prediction In The Face Of Rising Competition Checking through the current XRP price predictions, these last few days show a decline in analysts’ sentiment. This is with the price projection seeing a downturn following rising competition in the payment and remittance sector of the crypto market. Furthermore, while the Ripple project has made landmark progress in cross-border partnerships for payment and remittance, the price remains on a slow climb. The price analysis with data from the last few days might give better insight into why the XRP price prediction is getting dull lately. According to the technical analysis of the price, there has been a struggle for the coin to beat the $3.08 resistance since mid-August. As this zone continues to pose a threat to a significant breakout, analysts are divided about what will be the main story this year for XRP. The XRP price prediction now stands between the coin breaking the $3.08 this year and making a new high. Remittix Launches First Live Product In Its Ecosystem The story around the Remittix project as an XRP competitor just got even more interesting today as it launches its first live product. This is with the launch of its much-anticipated wallet for beta testing, giving users a first-hand feel of the finished product. According to the projection from top analysts, this could see the Remittix coin gain another 5x from its current $0.1 as accumulation spikes. Following the project’s comparison to the Ripple coin, here are some features making Remittix the talk of the town right now: It has a low cap, which could fuel an instant doubling effect and upward move. The Remittix solution is introducing a new approach that could change cross-border payment with its over 30 fiat currencies payment to bank accounts using crypto assets New solution to crypto to fiat conversion with a faster, cheaper and easier transaction Furthermore, the introduction of the referral program is another eye-catching approach for users to earn more with Remittix.

The new fund is designed to provide business people with an alternative way to invest in two of the fastest-growing areas of crypto markets, stablecoins and tokenized assets, via a single product. If approved, it would be the first-ever US ETF focused on these themes, providing exposure through a dual-structured product that includes traditional equity investments alongside crypto-linked assets. The move reflects Bitwise’s desire to remain at the cutting edge of crypto investment innovation and leverage recent regulatory clarity and growing market demand for stablecoin- and tokenization-centric products. Bitwise builds a dual exposure model The fund is split evenly into two, one equities and the other crypto assets, according to a filing. The equity sleeve will zero in on businesses that have a direct play around stablecoins and tokenization. These include stablecoin creators, blockchain infrastructure companies, payment processors, exchanges, and even merchants that dabble with digital currencies. Bitwise has also established exposure limits to help control concentration risks. Tier 1 companies identified as having higher exposure could make up to 15% of the fund, Tier 2 companies 8%, and Tier 3 companies up to 3%. Bitwise anticipates selecting about 20 companies for the portfolio across Tier 1 and Tier 2, with as many as up to an additional 10 from Tier 3. The crypto asset sleeve will monitor exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to blockchain infrastructure and tokenization. To be eligible, the asset should make up at least 1% of the entire stablecoin or tokenization market. About 5% of the sleeve will be devoted to oracle tokens, cryptocurrencies that pull in data about the world from outside the blockchain to make smart contracts work. To prevent undue risk, the fund’s single largest crypto holding would be capped at 22.5%. The ETF is also scheduled to be rebalanced each quarter based on market movement. Bitwise’s decision to file the fund under the Investment Company Act could mean a less onerous SEC review path than what would be required for other fund structures. Analysts say this improves the chances of approval of the ETF. Regulation shapes market dynamics and launch timeline The filing is submitted at a time when the US is increasingly embracing stablecoins and tokenization. The draft bill to regulate stablecoins reduces the uncertainty and increases investor confidence that the GENIUS Act, passed in July, created. Meanwhile, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), including bonds and credit instruments, minted on blockchains have exploded in 2025, according to data from Chainalysis, reaching nearly $76 billion. Even stablecoins have experienced a surge. The stablecoin supply went from roughly $205 billion to $268 billion between January and August, a 23% increase. The market has since hit higher highs, and this week surged to nearly $290 billion, according to DefiLlama. These trends have contributed to institutional and retail demand for products with diversified exposure to stablecoins and tokenization. Bitwise already oversees more than $15 billion in its lineup of crypto funds and ETFs. The firm has stated that it sees itself as a leader in plans for crypto investment products, and this latest filing is part of its approach to combining traditional financial mechanisms with new blockchain offerings. Although Bitwise hasn’t revealed management fees for the proposed fund, analysts anticipate they’ll be competitive with so many rival products to choose from. There are already competitors, like Nicholas Wealth’s Crypto Income ETF (BLOX), that use equities for their crypto exposure. Still, Bitwise’s unusual two-sleeve structure could make it stand out in the market. Industry observers have said the SEC may rule on the filing this October or November. If approved, the fund is likely to come to market near Thanksgiving 2025, according to Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst with Bloomberg. That would place Bitwise ahead of competitors scrambling to roll out new products in a regulatory landscape that has evolved rapidly in digital assets’ favor since the start of the year.

Recently, a significant development emerged from South Korea that has caught the attention of investors globally. Parataxis Korea, a dedicated treasury platform for institutional investors, has made its historic first Bitcoin purchase of 50 BTC. This isn’t just another transaction; it marks a pivotal moment, showcasing the company’s commitment to providing robust, institutional-grade solutions for digital asset management. Why is Parataxis Korea’s Bitcoin Purchase a Game Changer? On August 7th, Parataxis Korea officially completed its initial acquisition of 50 BTC. This strategic move highlights a growing trend: traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring digital assets as part of their treasury management. For many institutional players, entering the crypto market can be complex due to concerns around security, compliance, and execution. Parataxis Korea aims to bridge this gap. Their decision to make a substantial Bitcoin purchase demonstrates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its potential as a legitimate treasury asset. It’s a clear signal that the demand for professional-grade crypto services is not just theoretical; it’s becoming a tangible reality for serious investors. Unveiling an Institutional-Grade BTC Treasury Platform: What Does It Offer? Beyond the actual Bitcoin purchase , Parataxis Korea announced a crucial achievement: the successful development of an institutional-grade BTC treasury platform. This platform is designed from the ground up to meet the stringent requirements of large-scale investors. What makes this platform stand out? It boasts: Proven Execution Capabilities: Ensuring large transactions are processed smoothly and efficiently. Robust Security Protocols: Protecting digital assets with advanced cryptographic measures and secure storage solutions. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to South Korean financial regulations, offering peace of mind to institutional clients. Dedicated Support: Providing specialized services tailored to the unique needs of corporate treasuries. This infrastructure is vital. It allows institutions to manage their digital assets with the same level of professionalism and security they expect from traditional financial markets. The development underscores a methodical approach to crypto adoption, focusing on reliability and trust. What’s the Broader Impact of Parataxis Korea’s Bitcoin Purchase? The ripple effects of Parataxis Korea’s Bitcoin purchase are likely to extend beyond the company itself. This move could inspire other institutional investors in South Korea and across Asia to seriously consider integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios. As more credible platforms emerge, the perceived risk of engaging with cryptocurrencies diminishes for established financial entities. However, challenges remain. Regulatory landscapes are still evolving, and market volatility is an inherent characteristic of digital assets. Despite these factors, the benefits are compelling: Increased Legitimacy: Institutional involvement helps solidify Bitcoin’s status as a serious asset class. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater participation from large players can lead to deeper and more stable markets. Innovation in Finance: Pushing the boundaries of traditional treasury management and investment strategies. This development marks a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of digital currencies, particularly for those managing substantial capital. In conclusion, Parataxis Korea’s inaugural Bitcoin purchase and the launch of its institutional-grade treasury platform represent a landmark achievement in the cryptocurrency space. It not only demonstrates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s potential but also provides the necessary infrastructure for other institutional investors to confidently enter the market. This strategic move is poised to accelerate the institutional adoption of digital assets, shaping the future of finance in South Korea and beyond. Keep an eye on how this pioneering step influences the broader crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Parataxis Korea?

New players earn a 200% match-up bonus of up to 10 ETH, 50 free spins, and a $5 sports bet. On the downside, the bonus has to be wagered 35 times to be withdrawable. TG casino also offers its gambling services on the social messaging platform Telegram. It is also unique because of its native token $TGC. Players receive 25% back on all net losses of bets made in $TGC. In addition, $TGC holders earn a percentage of platform profits, i.e., 60% of all profits are distributed to $TGC holders who have staked over 5,000 tokens. The profit is paid in ETH. Other promotions include a $7,000 weekend tournament, a highest odds tournament, and 40% extra for combo bets on sports.

Other than cryptocurrencies, TG casino also allows players to make payments in fiat using a crypto on-ramp feature that supports VISA and MasterCard.

However, this claim has a caveat: new accounts must meet a minimum wagering threshold of $69 to unlock withdrawals. This requirement also helps prevent money mixing, which is illegal. The sign-up process is straightforward. You can sign up with an email address and password or with the Telegram sign-in option. It’s hassle-free, and you can get your account up and running in minutes. The casino operated under a Curacao eGaming license. Initially launched as a single game platform, ToshiBet has quickly evolved and now hosts a variety of casino games, slots, and sports betting, with over 150,000 registered players.

CoinPoker: Our highest ranking choice for strategy plus chance games CoinPoker homepage CoinPoker is the go-to no-KYC casino for poker enthusiasts. At any given time, there are over 2,000 online players in the casino. Founded in 2017, the casino traces its roots to a community of poker lovers and crypto natives. Poker is a family of card games that combines elements of chance and skill, rewarding the best hand depending on the rules of the specific game. While it’s a poker favorite, the CoinPokercasino is also packed with other games. You can play slots, from classic three-reelers to video slots with bonus features and progressive jackpots. Others include fun crash games, table games, and sports betting—all no KYC. CoinPoker runs some of the most exciting promotions in the space. For one, they have a leaderboard that runs every four hours, with a $10,000 daily prize pool. While other casinos with similar promotions reset the leaderboard every 24 hours, CoinPoker’s is reset 6 times daily, giving you more winning chances. Concurrently, another leaderboard runs every week with a $5,000 prize pool. Away from the leaderboards, new players can claim a 150% deposit bonus of up to $2000 to stack up a bankroll. To qualify for the bonus, you must deposit at least $10. The other bonus includes a 33% weekly rakeback paid every Monday. One factor that stood out at CoinPoker was that the casino had a Proof of Reserves, a feature common in centralized exchanges. A Proof of Reserves means that the casino publicly displays the amount of funds in the spirit of transparency, which is essential in winning customer trust. The funds are stored in Fireblocks’ multi-authentication vaults, ensuring maximum protection. They also have a decentralized random number generator (RNG) that you can use to view the impact on the card shuffling. Supported cryptocurrencies USDT, CHP, BTC, POL, ETH, USDC, SOL No KYC limits None Other payment methods VISA, MasterCard, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Pix License Anjouan Internet Gaming license Operational since 2017 Support options Email Available games Poker, slots, live casino, sports Pros and cons Pros: Transparent, verifiable gameplay. Backed up by a dedicated team of poker enthusiasts. Completely KYC-free, no limits. Cons: The casino is only available as a downloadable application; you cannot play on your browser. High wagering requirements on bonuses. Degen Coin Flip: Top decentralized casino on Solana Playing Crash at Degen Coin Flip As the name suggests, Degen Coin Flip is a high-risk, high-reward anonymous online gambling casino for crypto degens. The casino is decentralized, meaning it runs on smart contracts. The smart contracts execute on predetermined conditions, and since they are coded on the Solana blockchain, they cannot be corrupted. The core mechanics of the game can be studied on the blockchain. The casino only accepts SOL, so you will need a Solana wallet: Phantom, Torus, Ledger, or Solflare. Once connected, you can now take your chances without making a deposit. The most popular game on Degen Coin Flip is Coi Flip. The game is provably fair, and you can double your SOL balance or lose it with a coin flip. Bets placed, wins, and losses are displayed publicly. My favorite, however, is the Crash game. Here, you place bets on how high you think a ‘token’ will go on the charts before crashing. During my time there, I consistently watched payouts go above 2X. A downside is that the casino, while fun, is not beginner-friendly. To play, you need prior knowledge of cryptocurrency wallets and transactions. With the knowledge, it is advisable to join their Discord group to stay updated on the latest updates and betting tips. The casino charges a 3.5% fee on every bet. Everything else is straightforward: no hidden charges, bonuses, or wagering requirements exist. However, the casino regularly runs challenges on its social media channels, X and Discord. Supported cryptocurrencies SOL No KYC limits No limits Other payment methods None License None Operational since 2021 Support options Discord Available games Coin flip, mini games including crash and coin dozer Pros and cons Pros: Decentralized and highly anonymous Transparent betting. Vibrant Discord community. Cons: Steep learning curve No bonuses Cryptorino: Top-ranking new casino Cryptorino lobby Cryptorino is a relatively new entrant in the crypto casino space, but continues to steal market share for its extensive game library and competitive bonuses. The sign-up process is simple; you only need an email address and a strong password, after which you are ready to go. Aside from this, the casino is available in over 10 languages, including French, German, and Spanish, catering to a global audience. Cryprorino is also a perfect choice for players looking for privacy and convenience. The casino sets the bar higher by being VPN friendly, meaning you can use a VPN service to mask your location when accessing the casino. The casino allows lightning-fast withdrawals for all payment methods. Deposits are also instant and are free. However, all deposits must be wagered at least 5 times to be withdrawable. This is aimed at preventing the use of the platform for mixing money. The only charge is blockchain fees, paid to miners who confirm crypto transactions. Being a crypto-friendly instant casino only increases its appeal for privacy-focused players. You can choose from many popular options, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether, as well as meme coins like SHIB and DOGE. For your first deposit of at least €10, Cryptorino rewards you up to 1 BTC or its equivalent in other currencies. While the bonus might be high, the casino requires you to meet its wagering requirements within the first 7 days to receive the bonus. Every Thursday, players can claim a free bet and 10% cash back on losses made every Monday, adding to the thrill of remaining loyal to the casino. Every week, Cryptorino runs a $10,000 tournament distributed to the top 50 players on the leaderboard. The scoring system includes points awarded based on your total win per bet minus your stake. You can also participate in the $7,000 pool tournament on selected games over the weekend. Other regular offers like odds boosts and prize drops keep the excitement going. The platform offers various options to casino game enthusiasts, from slots to instant wins and provably fair titles. You can find great game show options among the extensive suite of games, such as Pragmatic Play’s Snakes and Ladders and Dice City. You can also play Mini Roulette, which provides a minimalistic playing experience. There’s a fantastic choice of Mines, Crash, Plinko, and Hi-Lo titles and arcade-style releases such as Save the Princess. If you want a more premium experience, Cryptorino offers exclusive high-roller and private tables, such as Playboy Blackjack and Baccarat High Roller. I managed to play some excellent RNG table games and popular slot machines. Cryptorino’s VIP program is especially advantageous, particularly for loyal players. The VIP program is set in levels determined by the total amount of wagers you place; the higher your level, the better the perks. At the highest level, players become eligible for a personalized casino experience, which includes cashbacks, surprise spins, an account manager, and higher withdrawal limits.

Casinopunkz: Provably fair VPN friendly casino Casinopunkz bonuses Casinopunkz is a relatively new crypto casino offering a broad selection of games from top-tier providers like Playson, Slotmil, BGaming, and Hacksaw Gaming. The casino stands out for its punk-style theme characterized by pixelated images and wording, similar to the popular CryptoPunks NFT collection, adding a distinctive flair. Casinopunkz ensures user privacy by recommending VPN platforms, a feature I have not seen on any other casino. A VPN encrypts your internet connection and masks your real IP address. This means you can access the casino anywhere worldwide while staying protected from online threats and ISP monitoring. Their top VPN recommendations include NordVPN, Proton, and Express VPN. Casinopunkz welcomes new players with a 100% matchup bonus, meaning they double your initial deposit in bonuses. Other promotions include loot box drops, up to 15% cashback, and daily multiplier challenges with big prizes. The casino’s lobby features diverse categories such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and game shows. From the main page, you can switch between casino and live casino games, making it easy for users to locate their favorite games. The casino also features a search function and a section of new releases to keep the excitement alive for all gaming enthusiasts. If you’re more into strategic gameplay, you can explore hundreds of exciting RNG table games, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat, powered by top providers like Pragmatic Play and Evolution Gaming. The live dealer selection doesn’t hold back as well. The ‘Challenges’ section is particularly enticing, showcasing prizes on select games when you achieve the set milestones. For instance, you win €500 when you get 5,000x on the game Zeus by Hacksaw Gaming. When you hit 5,000x on Shaolin Panda by Octoplay with a minimum €10 bet, you win €2,000. I could count over 15 similar challenges running in parallel in the section. The Bonus Buy option, available within games from providers like Hacksaw Gaming, Pragmatic Play, and Playson, allows players to fast-track their way to bonus rounds and enhance their winning potential. Casinopunkz ensures fair play with its Provably Fair feature, giving players confidence in every spin and bet. Casinopunkz’s offers fair play, niche-themed games, and exclusive content.

Cons: Limited registration option Does not offer sports betting. What is a No KYC casino, and how does it work? A no KYC casino is a casino that does not require you to verify your identity to play on the platform. KYC stands for Know Your Customer or, in some settings, Know Your Client. No KYC casinos offer more privacy and anonymity, which helps prevent data breaches and identity theft. No KYC also means more inclusivity and faster account creation. However, it is important to note that non-KYC casinos can request identity verification if their systems flag your account for fraudulent or unusual activity, such as large withdrawal requests. Casinos with KYC requirements ask users to submit identity verification documents, which include a copy of a national identity card or a driving license, and, to some extent, utility bills as proof of residence. Casinos request KYC as a risk assessment measure to prevent fraudulent activity and to comply with local rules and regulations. Pros and Cons of using a no KYC casino Pros: Quick account set up The process of KYC verification can be lengthy and tiresome. The process involves uploading your identity documents and/ or utility bills to confirm your proof of address. You might also be required to upload a selfie holding your identity document. After submission, there is a turnaround time where you have to wait for your details to be verified. The waiting time can be costly, as you might miss the entry point for betting opportunities. Some casinos request KYC when you request a withdrawal, which is inconvenient, especially if you don’t have the documents. At no KYC casinos, you can create an account smoothly within minutes. Anonymity and privacy The casinos do not collect your information, meaning you can play freely without the fear of raising eyebrows from peers or regulatory authorities. Your wins and losses remain private. This is especially convenient for high-roller players who make big bets and regularly have big wins and losses. Accessibility and global reach Like the blockchain, which democratizes access to financial products, non-KYC casinos play a similar role to their KYC counterparts. The fact that you do not have to disclose your location means that anyone globally can sign up for an account without getting flagged. Some casinos go a step further and recommend VPN services that mask your location and IP address. Enhanced bonuses and promotions No-verification online casinos also tend to offer generous bonuses, promotions, and challenges. This is because they have lower operational costs as they don’t conduct KYC checks. The extra funds allow the casinos to splurge money on providing their clients with a more rewarding playing experience. Some casinos offer bonuses of up to 1BTC, while others do not require wagering requirements on bonuses. Reduced risk of data breaches There is always a risk associated with sharing personal and financial details over the Internet. Cases of impersonation and identity theft are rampant, especially with the growth of technology. No verification casinos safeguard their clients as they do not collect personal information, which is also known as anonymous gambling. The casinos assure players of data safety, winning their trust and confidence. Flexibility and freedom The fact that no verification betting sites do not require your verification documents means you get to have more flexibility and freedom. As an account holder, you are not limited to regional restrictions that may limit the amount of funds you transact. The casinos generally offer faster deposits and withdrawals than their KYC counterparts, as no extra checks are required. This gives you better control over your gaming experience. Crypto friendly All anonymous casinos are crypto-friendly. This is because cryptocurrencies share the same ethos of user privacy and anonymity. While crypto transactions can be monitored on the blockchain, they cannot be linked to an individual unless they are publicly declared. Players on the sites, therefore, enjoy better crypto support and faster transactions. Cons: Lack of regulatory oversight No-KYC casinos often operate in a grey area in terms of regulations. The state of crypto regulations across countries also differs, with some outright banning them. This conundrum becomes a challenge since anonymous casinos are known to operate globally with no restrictions on users who can play. For Compliance challenges Since casinos operate in a grey area, they can cause trouble for users who do not comply with local laws. Per their terms, customers must confirm whether the casino’s services are allowed in their jurisdictions. It can also be difficult for users to report taxes from non-KYC casinos. Potential customer support limitations Because these sites operate internationally, gamblers from all over the world are accessing them. That means when a player is wagering, the customer support team may not have assistance due to a language barrier or may not be available to assist due to time differences. Platform misuse Bad actors can mask illegal activity by taking advantage of the anonymity of no-verification casinos. Known bad actors can also use the system for money laundering without raising flags. A KYC check can help identify such threats quickly. Key factors to look for while choosing a no KYC crypto casino Licensing and regulation Anonymous crypto casinos require users to confirm the legality of accessing their services in their jurisdictions. Before engaging with a no KYC casino, checking with your regulator for compliance is important. This is because it is easier to receive assistance from local authorities if you have an issue with the casino. Compliant casinos also tend to be fairer and transparent, as it is a requirement to get licensed. Game selection There are hundreds of online game providers in the casino space. Check that the casino supports your favorite games and their variations, as there are thousands of games to choose from. Also, check whether the casino supports local leagues to avoid getting side-stepped on those fun football weekends. Customer support Before signing up, make a gesture to contact customer service through live chat and see how long it takes them to respond. Fast response times mean a chance to edit bets where you placed an extra zero or an opportunity to follow up on a withdrawal request that is taking too long to clear. Security measures Opt for casinos that offer two-factor authentication features, as they provide extra protection for your account. Some casinos go a step further and publish their proof of reserves as evidence that customer deposits are safely stored in their vaults. Check for features like SSL encryption, third-party accounts, and security audits. Payment methods Check with customer care if they support your payment method. Some gambling sites support fiat payment options like Revolut, Apple Pay, MasterCard, and VISA. For crypto, check whether your token, including the blockchain, is supported. Remember that when you deposit the wrong chain, you risk losing your funds. Also, confirm the casino’s withdrawal methods and limits. Reputation and reviews Reviews from third-party platforms like TrustPilot offer you a front-row seat to issues encountered by real customers. Check for low-rated reviews and follow up if the customer issues were resolved. Repeated negative reviews on the same issue are a red flag. Withdrawal limits and speed Some non-KYC casinos may flag your account if you request a huge withdrawal. Others have a limit on how much money you can withdraw. Check with support about their limits to confirm whether they align with your goals. High roller players may opt for casinos with high or no deposit and withdrawal limits. Low limits could also mean that you can’t withdraw your jackpot wins. Bonuses and promotions Bonuses and promotions are meant to reward player loyalty and keep you returning. Check for generous bonuses and perks like a percentage back on losses made. Some casinos offer rakebacks and cashbacks every other week. However, be wary of bonuses with high wagering requirements. While the requirements are implemented to prevent account misuse, they also prevent users from outrightly claiming their bonuses. Tips to stay anonymous while using a no-KYC crypto casino Fresh no-KYC linked wallets Crypto transactions are publicly displayed on the blockchain, meaning that with the right tools, it is possible to trace how funds move across known crypto wallets, e.g., exchanges, or public figures, to the casino. For this reason, it is advisable to use a new crypto wallet and address for online gambling. You should also regularly change your addresses to prevent leaving traces on the blockchain. Non-custodial wallets Some of the casinos allow users to sign in with their crypto wallets. In these instances, you do not deposit crypto to the casino; the casinos access your crypto in your wallet when you approve the transactions. Such wallets are known as non-custodial wallets. With such a wallet, the casino has limited access to your crypto balance and therefore cannot misuse it. Use VPN and proxy VPNs work by masking a client’s location and VIP address; this way, you can anonymously access the casino’s offerings. You can also access games that would otherwise be restricted in your jurisdiction by using a VPN. Choose a reputable no-KYC casino Check the casino’s reputation from third-party reviews and platforms like TrustPilot. You can also examine the reliability of its random number generators, which are crucial in ensuring fair play. Use privacy-focused crypto like Monero Use privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, Dash, Grin, and Zcash. These cryptocurrencies use special technology like zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, and stealth addresses that make them impossible to trace on the blockchain. Before signing up, check with the casino whether they support cryptocurrencies. Be mindful of transaction history Clear your transaction history on the casino. You can also request the casino for information they have stored about you. It can also help to regularly clear your cache and cookies, which leave traces of your activity on your devices. Also, as explained earlier, regularly switch to new wallet addresses to prevent getting traced. Be cautious of suspicious links or downloads Always be cautious of suspicious links and downloads. Phishing sites take advantage of a user’s ignorance to steal their personal information, which they can use to steal their identity, steal their funds, or perform illegal activity. Review the casino’s policy on anonymity and data policy Read the casino’s terms and conditions on anonymity and data policy. The terms will enlighten you on how they process user data and who they share their data with. Sometimes, the casino will request permission to share your data with third parties. Use a dedicated device for gambling A dedicated device will give you enhanced performance, a more immersive experience, and improved security. By using a separate device, you can prevent distractions and account breaches from other applications or services you access from the device. Also, in the case of an attack, you can contain the damage to the device. Stay updated on best practices With the advent of big data and artificial intelligence, technology is advancing rapidly. It is, therefore, important to keep yourself updated on best practices for staying anonymous while accessing crypto gambling sites through personal or peer-to-peer research. Conclusion No KYC casinos are rising in popularity for their benefits, which include better bonuses, promotions, and game offerings that rival their KYC counterparts and traditional casinos. As discussed, lower operational costs help the casinos provide their customers with a better playing experience. However, there are also significant disadvantages, such as operating without clear regulatory oversight. Our list has outlined ten of the best anonymous crypto and Bitcoin casinos, saving you the trouble. Note that these casinos still reserve the right to request KYC verification if they flag your account for suspicious activity. Check their requirements and local laws to ensure you don’t end up on the shorter end of the bargain. Also, explore responsible gambling tools, as gambling can be addictive.",Deep Dive - Crypto|Web3 & Market Insights,EN,0,0,SOL|USDT|BTC|ETH|DOGE|OTHER|ADA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-16 23:56:25

51846623,582141,1758067240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51846623.jpeg,"Bitcoin To Hit $750,000 By 2030 With ETH And SOL As Survivors, Says Pantera CEO",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-750000-by-2030-eth-sol-survive-pantera-ceo/,"Pantera Capital founder and CEO Dan Morehead told CNBC that Bitcoin could climb to $750,000 within four to five years, arguing the asset still represents only a “very low single-digit percentage of global wealth” and has historically “roughly doubled every year” across the firm’s 12 years in crypto. Morehead coupled the price call with a stark consolidation thesis: only a single-digit number of base-layer blockchains will endure—led by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Why Bitcoin, Ethereum And Solana Will Succeed Speaking on “ Squawk Box ,” Morehead framed Bitcoin’s upside as a function of its penetration into global portfolios rather than a speculative cycle. “I think it could go up to $750,000 in the next four or five years,” he said, reiterating that while a $1 million handle may be conceivable, it is a longer-dated prospect. The forecast extends a through-cycle view Pantera has pushed since launching what it describes as the first institutional bitcoin fund in 2013. The Pantera chief also dismissed “winner-take-all” narratives in smart-contract platforms, but he narrowed the field decisively. “There’s a single-digit number of layer ones… things like Bitcoin, Ethereum , Solana—not thousands, but definitely not one,” he said. In his view, these chains map to distinct use cases: “Bitcoin’s digital gold,” Ethereum anchors programmability, and Solana is “very good at the performance blockchain.” Morehead underscored Solana’s technical and market momentum to explain why it belongs alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in the long-run cohort. “Solana’s had better performance than even Bitcoin over the last four years,” he noted, adding that the network “could do 9 billion transactions a day,” a throughput he argued exceeds activity across traditional capital markets. While the exact comparative framing is debatable, the line reflects Pantera’s view that Solana’s execution capacity—combined with low fees—has crossed a threshold where “it’s not obvious you need a next thing” for high-speed on-chain finance. The interview doubled as a showcase for a new public-markets vehicle offering direct, unlevered exposure to SOL while capturing native staking yield for equity investors. Morehead cast the “digital asset treasury” structure as a bridge product in an era when large-cap crypto ETFs remain unevenly available. “Right now there’s no [spot US] ETF [for Solana]. It’s very difficult to get… For people with a brokerage account, this is the easiest way to get access,” he said, describing staking as “cumbersome” for typical retail users and positioning the listed vehicle to automate validator selection and reward capture. Pantera’s push fits a broader 2025 pattern: public companies raising capital to hold programmatic positions in major cryptoassets—often with staking overlays—and then listing on Nasdaq as equity proxies for tokens without spot ETFs. Just hours before Morehead’s appearance, Helius Medical Technologies announced an oversubscribed $500 million financing led by Pantera and Summer Capital to launch a Solana-backed treasury strategy, with an additional $750 million in warrants that could lift the vehicle’s size to roughly $1.25 billion. Helius said it would explore staking and conservative on-chain yield opportunities around its SOL reserves. Asked to arbitrate Ethereum versus Solana, Morehead avoided a binary call, returning to the same consolidation arc: multiple large-cap winners, but far fewer than the thousands of L1s launched over the last cycle. The market’s job now, he implied, is to price durable differentiation: Bitcoin as pristine collateral and macro hedge; Ethereum as the generalized settlement and execution layer for tokenized assets and DeFi; Solana as a high-throughput venue for consumer-scale and market-microstructure-intensive applications. “There would be lots of blockchains that are important,” he said, “but definitely not one.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $115,319.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin price prediction|btc|btc price|crypto|crypto news|Dan Morehead|ETH|Ethereum|SOL|solana,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 00:00:40

ETH Set Eyes On 77% Breakout Run,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-eyes-on-77-breakout/,"Ethereum has shown signs of strength after completing a healthy pullback. Having met and retested its $4,811 target, ETH is now holding firm, suggesting the correction phase may be over. If buyers regain control, the path could open for a powerful rally in the near term. Ethereum Pulls Back, But Bullish Signals Confirm Strength Javon Marks, in his most recent update, emphasized that ETH reached the $4,811.71 target before entering a pullback phase. Despite the temporary dip, bullish signals have re-emerged, indicating that ETH has regained strength and could soon retest this important level. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Looks Tired – Could Upside Momentum Fade Soon? He noted that surpassing the $4,811.71 zone would mark a decisive step forward for Ethereum. A confirmed breakout above this level could act as a catalyst, unlocking fresh buying pressure and signaling a continuation of the broader bullish trend. According to MARKS analysis, the bigger picture remains highly promising, as a sustained rally above this target could drive ETH toward $8,557.68, an impressive +77% move. Such a development would not only reinforce Ethereum’s dominance in the market but also underscore its ability to outperform as investor sentiment strengthens. Trendline Support Holds Firm, Strengthening Bullish Case According to Crypto King in a recent post, ETH looks to be preparing for its next decisive move in the market. After a period of consolidation, the price action has continued to show resilience, refusing to break down despite fluctuations across the broader crypto space. This behavior highlights the underlying strength of ETH and suggests that buyers are quietly accumulating while defending critical levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces September Profit-Taking Risks Despite $638M ETF Boost The analyst emphasized that ETH is firmly holding its ascending trendline, which has served as a strong backbone of support during recent pullbacks. Each time the price has tested this line, it has attracted renewed momentum, underscoring the importance of the trendline as a technical foundation. Now that the latest retest appears to be complete, Ethereum seems to be shifting toward another potential upside move. The structure of higher lows remains intact, showing that momentum is gradually building and buyers are preparing for a possible breakout attempt. If this bullish pressure continues, ETH could soon reclaim higher levels and aim for fresh targets in the coming sessions. Crypto King further noted that for traders or investors looking to position themselves for the next rally, this could be the ideal time to act. Should Ethereum follow through with a strong rally, the current price zone might be remembered as a key accumulation point ahead of its next major advance.

On Tuesday, Jim told investors on CNBC that he sees the bank as the first non-tech company to cross the $1 trillion market cap line. Right now, JPMorgan’s value is around $850 billion, but Jim thinks that’s just the beginning. He said, “JPMorgan’s got something special. It excels at so many things: lending, capital markets, trading, and perhaps most important, statesmanship, with CEO Jamie Dimon performing at a level that’s rare for any industry.” Jim added that: “JP Morgan has always been a top-quality bank, but it’s now become a fantastic place to work, and its global reach is unmatched. There’s a reason its market cap is so much bigger than the other major banks.” Banks push into trillion-dollar territory as sector rallies Jim made it clear this kind of growth isn’t easy. Only Berkshire Hathaway has made it to $1 trillion outside of tech, and it’s sitting just above that line at $1.05 trillion. Meanwhile, tech is bloated with trillion-dollar beasts. Nvidia is at $4.25 trillion, Microsoft at $3.78 trillion, Apple at $3.35 trillion, Alphabet at $3.04 trillion, Amazon at $2.50 trillion, Meta at $1.96 trillion, Broadcom at $1.70 trillion, and Tesla at $1.36 trillion. The bank isn’t just catching up in value, it’s pushing forward in performance too. JPMorgan just hit a new 52-week high on Tuesday and ended the day slightly up, rising 0.09%. So far this year, the stock has jumped 28.99%. That’s a hell of a move for a sector that’s usually ignored when tech is popping. Jim used a metaphor that works: JPMorgan is like “a horse that’s bided its time but is now at the far turn.” He sees the bank entering a new stretch of momentum, with the rest of the financial sector tagging along. He pointed out that Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are all making big moves too. But JPMorgan is the one leading. What’s driving this? Jim said the “real rocket fuel” is multiple expansion. In simple terms, Wall Street is starting to pay more for each dollar of bank earnings, and that’s not normal in this space. For years, banks have traded cheap. Now, those price-to-earnings ratios are finally climbing. “I’ve been waiting years for the banks to get higher price-to-earnings multiples,” he said . “They’re incredibly important to the broader market. When the banks are winning, it’s a terrific sign for the overall trading.” Jim added that this growth isn’t fragile. Even if the Fed shakes the market, this kind of shift doesn’t snap back easily. “Remember this tomorrow if the averages take a hit from the Fed, because once multiple expansion starts, it’s not easily reversed — we might be ok. These are hard-fought moves and I bet they’re just the beginning.” That’s the key point. Jim thinks JPMorgan’s valuation will keep climbing because earnings are growing, and investors are finally willing to pay more for it. If that trend holds, it means the stock doesn’t have to explode overnight. It just needs to keep moving up steadily. And compared to its peers, JPMorgan is already way ahead. Most other banks are still stuck under $300 billion in value. That gap shows up in investor confidence, deal flow, and stock performance. Jim sees this as validation, not hype.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to cut through the noise, offering a clear snapshot of prevailing market sentiment. Recently, this crucial indicator edged up to 53, holding steady in neutral territory. This reading, provided by cryptocurrency data provider Alternative, suggests a balanced market, where neither extreme fear nor overwhelming optimism dominates. Understanding what this index signifies can be a game-changer for your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a barometer for the cryptocurrency market. It quantifies the emotional state of investors, ranging from “Extreme Fear” (0) to “Extreme Greed” (100). When the index shows extreme fear, it often indicates that investors are too worried, potentially creating buying opportunities. Conversely, extreme greed might suggest the market is due for a correction, as prices could be unsustainably high. This index helps you identify when market participants are acting irrationally. It encourages a disciplined approach, urging you to “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The methodology behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is robust, incorporating several key factors to provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. Here’s a breakdown of its components: Volatility (25%): This measures current Bitcoin volatility and maximum drawdowns, comparing them with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals fear. Market Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a positive market can indicate strong bullish sentiment, while low volumes might suggest uncertainty. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes Bitcoin-related hashtags and mentions on social media, assessing the speed and quantity of interactions. A surge in mentions, especially with positive sentiment, can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Although paused currently, past surveys contributed to gauging investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often suggests fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. A decreasing dominance can signal greed, as money flows into riskier altcoins. Google Search Volume (10%): Analyzing search trends for Bitcoin-related terms provides insight into public interest. A sudden spike in search queries for “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin crash” indicates fear, while searches for “how to buy Bitcoin” might indicate growing interest or greed. What Does a Neutral 53 Reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Imply? A reading of 53, squarely in the “neutral” zone, suggests a balanced market sentiment. It means there isn’t an overwhelming consensus towards either fear or greed. Investors are neither panicking nor exhibiting excessive euphoria. This neutral stance can be interpreted in several ways: Uncertainty: The market might be awaiting a significant catalyst, or there could be conflicting signals pulling sentiment in different directions. Consolidation: Prices might be consolidating, forming a base before a potential move in either direction. Opportunity for Careful Analysis: A neutral reading encourages traders and investors to look beyond raw sentiment and delve deeper into fundamental and technical analysis. It’s a time for careful consideration, not impulsive decisions. Rather than reacting emotionally, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index score prompts a more strategic approach. How Can You Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Better Decisions? The primary benefit of monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is its ability to help you detach from emotional trading. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: When the index shows extreme fear, consider it a potential buying opportunity. When it signals extreme greed, it might be a good time to take profits or reduce exposure. Risk Management: Use the index as an additional data point for your risk assessment. High greed might warrant tighter stop-losses or smaller position sizes. Confirmation Tool: Combine the index with other technical indicators and fundamental analysis. If your analysis suggests a bullish trend but the index shows extreme fear, it could be a strong buy signal. Avoid FOMO and FUD: The index acts as a reminder not to succumb to the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) during greedy phases or Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) during fearful periods. Always remember, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive prediction tool. It works best when integrated into a broader investment framework. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently at a neutral 53, offers invaluable insight into the collective psychology of the cryptocurrency market. By understanding its components and implications, investors can make more informed, less emotional decisions. It’s a powerful reminder that while markets are driven by data, they are often swayed by human emotion. Use this index to stay grounded and navigate the volatile world of crypto with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Q1: What does a high score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A1: A high score (e.g., above 75) indicates “Extreme Greed.” This suggests that the market is overbought, and a price correction might be imminent as investors become overly optimistic. Q2: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only for Bitcoin? A2: While Bitcoin’s data heavily influences the index (especially dominance and search volume), the index reflects overall market sentiment, which generally applies to the broader cryptocurrency market. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A3: The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment. Q4: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as my sole trading indicator? A4: No, it is not recommended to use it as a sole indicator. The index is a sentiment tool and should be combined with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and sound risk management strategies for effective trading and investing. Q5: What factors cause the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to change? A5: Changes in Bitcoin’s volatility, trading volume, social media activity, Bitcoin dominance, and Google search trends for crypto-related terms all contribute to shifts in the index’s score.

51848160,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=810553,1758068897,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51848160.jpeg,Asia’s stock rally faces tariff shock as Trump levies bite into earnings,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/asias-stock-rally-tariff-shock-earnings/,"Asia’s stock markets are starting to feel the heat as Donald Trump’s tariff hikes begin cutting into corporate profits. Fund giants including T. Rowe Price and Franklin Templeton are warning that companies across the region, especially in South Korea and Taiwan, are more exposed than investors think. Export-heavy industries have enjoyed months of gains, but now the numbers aren’t adding up. And the White House isn’t backing down. According to Bloomberg, the warning signs are coming from all sides. Clarence Li, a senior portfolio analyst at T. Rowe Price in Hong Kong, said, “Current earnings and margins for exporters have not yet fully reflected the impact of the recent tariff agreements.” Clarence confirmed that they’ve already reduced their Asia and emerging market positions tied to exports. They’re not waiting around to see the damage unfold. Exporters face hit as profits fall short The rally has been huge. The MSCI Asia index has jumped more than 20% this year, way ahead of the 12% gain on the S&P 500. Investors rushed in, driven by cheap money, a weaker dollar, and the AI hype machine. That pushed the regional benchmark above its previous record from 2021. But now the policy change from Washington is cutting through the noise. Trump’s tariffs, announced in April, are targeting the region’s top exporters. The list is brutal: 34% tariffs on Chinese goods, 50% on India, 19% on Indonesia, and 15% on Japan. These aren’t symbolic. They’re aimed directly at countries with massive trade surpluses with the U.S., and almost all of them are in Asia. William Bratton, head of Asia Pacific cash equity research at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong, said the current earnings forecasts are “too optimistic.” He warned that markets still haven’t priced in the tariff risk properly. “We see continued risk of Asia’s export earnings materializing below current forecasts,” William said. He’s especially cautious about sub-sectors in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, all tightly tied to exports. It gets worse. Last year, over $1.3 trillion worth of goods flowed out of Asia to the U.S. China shipped $438.9 billion, Vietnam $136.6 billion, and South Korea $131.5 billion. Those numbers explain why analysts think the damage hasn’t shown up in full yet. The initial impact might be delayed, but it’s coming. Tech sector vulnerable as semiconductors targeted The problem goes beyond the visible tariffs. Christy Tan, an investment strategist at Franklin Templeton in Singapore, said supply chain disruptions and shrinking margins won’t show up right away. “Investors are expected to stay cautious over export-oriented companies and those exposed to tech sectors, as margin compression could be increasingly evident in months to come,” Christy said . There’s also concern about the semiconductor industry. It’s been one of Asia’s top-performing sectors this year. But that strength is exactly why it’s now in the firing line. Jerry Goh, investment director for Asian equities at Aberdeen Investments in Singapore, said, “There are concerns over potential tariffs on the semiconductor sector, which could weigh on Asia, given that it’s the center of the global semiconductor supply chain.” Jerry said Taiwan and Korea would face the biggest earnings pressure due to how much they rely on chips. Some regional data still looks okay on the surface. Manufacturing numbers in Thailand and Vietnam have been strong. Thai shipments grew by double digits in July. South Korean exports didn’t drop in August. But several managers say that’s just front-loading, companies rushing to export before the tariffs land. There’s still a chance that rate cuts by the Fed and other central banks could soften the hit. But that’s not guaranteed to offset the blow. The rally was built on liquidity and hype. Now it’s getting tested by policy. And the numbers aren’t lying. Everything points to one thing: Asia is vulnerable. The exposure to U.S. demand, the over-reliance on tech exports, and the delay in pricing in risks, it’s all catching up.

One moment, infrastructure projects are front and center; the next, retail momentum coins are dominating headlines. Over the past 48 hours, two stories have emerged: Chainlink (LINK) is showing technical strength that suggests a potential breakout, while Pi Coin (PI) is hovering dangerously close to historic lows. Both illustrate the contrast between projects building institutional confidence and those struggling to regain traction. But investors aren’t only focused on existing tokens. In the middle of this market reshuffling, a new presale has captured the imagination of retail and whale buyers alike. MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves with forecasts of 12,700% ROI , putting it in a class of its own for this cycle. If momentum holds, this presale may not just deliver profits, it could become one of the defining stories of the next bull run. Chainlink builds momentum for a breakout Chainlink has been quietly reasserting its role as a backbone of decentralized finance. According to analysis this week, LINK’s treasury reserves have grown 300% over the past month , underscoring the project’s reinvestment strength and financial discipline. This growth builds confidence that Chainlink can fund development even in choppier market waters. From a technical perspective, Chainlink has carved out a strong base of support. Analysts say this consolidation is laying the groundwork for a significant rally, with a push above resistance potentially opening the door to double-digit gains. Market chatter suggests that ETF discussions and rising institutional adoption of Chainlink’s oracle services are adding to the bullish setup. For investors looking for an established project with both adoption and technical potential, Chainlink offers one of the most compelling cases in the current market. Pi Coin struggles near historic lows On the other end of the spectrum sits Pi Coin. Once a hyped community-driven project, PI now trades around $0.345 , barely clinging to key support at $0.344. Analysts warn that a breakdown here could trigger a slide toward $0.322 , setting new all-time lows. The Pi Network has made progress, notably with the release of Version 23, which introduced decentralized KYC and touted 15 million verified users . Yet these milestones haven’t translated into meaningful price strength. Investor sentiment remains fragile, and without fresh capital inflows, Pi risks becoming another reminder that user numbers alone do not guarantee market traction. Pi Coin’s situation underscores a broader truth: crypto projects must balance community hype with tangible momentum and credible adoption. Without that balance, the downside risks remain acute. While Chainlink builds institutional credibility and Pi Coin faces existential price pressure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is writing a different story altogether. The presale has already attracted over $14 million , with allocations selling out at lightning speed as retail and whales compete for early access. Forecasts of 12,700% ROI reflect the scale of optimism building around this token. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its dual-threat positioning . On one side, it taps into meme culture, creating the kind of viral branding that spreads quickly across Telegram and X. On the other, it is rooted in legitimacy, with HashEx and CertiK audits completed , a rare badge of credibility at this stage of fundraising. Adding fuel to the fire is the PATRIOT50X bonus code , giving early participants 50% more tokens . This incentive not only accelerates adoption but also amplifies FOMO, as traders rush to lock in bigger allocations before rounds sell out. The combination of scarcity, legitimacy, and viral community energy has turned MAGACOIN FINANCE into one of the fastest-rising presales of the year. Features Driving Crypto Market Momentum Several elements explain why the broader crypto market is once again dominating conversations. Leading projects are focusing on credibility and security, with more protocols undergoing independent audits to strengthen investor confidence. Scarcity remains a major theme, as capped supply models across assets like Bitcoin and Chainlink ensure that increasing demand has a direct impact on price action. At the same time, whale participation is rising, with large-scale buyers entering alongside retail investors, a sign of growing institutional and grassroots alignment. Branding and cultural presence also matter more than ever, with projects that capture attention on social platforms often seeing faster organic adoption. Finally, strong fundraising and rapid sellouts in presales highlight that capital is flowing where investors see both narrative energy and structural resilience. Investor takeaways The current landscape offers a stark set of choices: Chainlink is building strength, supported by treasury growth and institutional adoption, and looks ready for a breakout. Pi Coin is testing critical levels, with real user growth but a fragile price structure that leaves little margin for error. MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining the presale model, blending meme culture, scarcity, and audits into a record-breaking story that could define the next bull run. For investors, the message is clear: balance safety with asymmetry. Established players like Chainlink offer measured upside, but the transformative gains of this cycle may come from projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Why timing matters Crypto thrives on cycles. Bitcoin consolidates near highs, Ethereum builds quietly through adoption, and infrastructure coins like Chainlink prepare for renewed rallies. But presales often hit their stride during these transitional phases, when investors want to secure asymmetric opportunities before the next wave of liquidity arrives. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE fits in. With macro headwinds pressuring traditional assets and established coins consolidating, presales with credibility and culture become magnets for capital. By combining legitimacy with hype at exactly this moment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is perfectly timed to ride the next market rotation. Conclusion Crypto markets are at a crossroads. Chainlink appears poised to surge as adoption strengthens, Pi Coin is flirting with breakdown as sentiment weakens, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is seizing the moment with a presale that has already broken records. With forecasts of 12,700% ROI , a PATRIOT50X bonus code boosting allocations, and demand that has allocations vanishing by the hour, it is shaping up as more than just a presale, it could become a defining story of the next bull run.

Employers are holding back, terrified of getting sued for offering higher-cost, harder-to-exit investments in retirement plans. The White House signed an executive order last month telling the Labor Department to cut down the legal risks. But legal experts say that won’t erase the threat. The rule that governs 401(k)s forces companies to act in the best interests of employees, a phrase so vague it’s fueled a nonstop wave of lawsuits for twenty years. Hundreds of companies have been dragged to court. Some, like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, paid millions to settle. It’s why most companies just stick to low-fee, basic investments. Offering hedge funds or crypto means getting slapped with a lawsuit, and no one wants to be the test case. Labor Department gets marching orders but can’t kill lawsuits Jennifer Doss, who leads the defined-contribution team at Captrust, said straight up, “The administration can only do so much to curb litigation.” The law’s too broad, and even new rules can’t promise immunity. Trump’s order gave the Labor Secretary six months to put out guidance for how to include alternative investments inside diversified 401(k) funds. The goal is a legal shield, a “safe harbor” rule. But even that can backfire. Lisa Gomez, who ran the Employee Benefits Security Administration under Biden, said employers could still be sued if they mess up any part of the procedure. Daniel Aronowitz, Trump’s pick to lead the EBSA now, told Congress in June he plans to “end the era of regulation by litigation.” He runs Encore Fiduciary, which sells lawsuit insurance to 401(k) plans. Aronowitz wants to give companies room to take on higher-return investments without worrying they’ll get sued if markets go sideways. But the courts won’t just bow to agency memos. Take what happened to Intel. The company dumped some employee funds into private equity and hedge funds about ten years ago. They got sued. They won. But the lawsuit dragged on for years and cost a fortune. That win didn’t give other companies any real confidence. Michael Kreps, who advises employers at Groom Law Group, said flat out: “Frustration over litigation has reached a boiling point.” New rules come fast, but courts still block employers The Labor Department has already started reversing Biden-era warnings. They pulled back on guidance that told small businesses not to offer private equity in their 401(k)s. They also tossed guidance that flagged crypto as a red flag for investigation. That doesn’t mean lawsuits are going away. In July, the agency filed a brief backing HP in court. Employees sued the company for using leftover matching contributions, money forfeited by workers who left early, to fund future matches. The plaintiffs said that money should’ve gone toward lowering costs. HP said they followed their plan documents and IRS rules. The Labor Department agreed with HP. Bradford Campbell, who led EBSA under George W. Bush, said the department is now backing companies more actively. But none of this fixes the deeper legal mess. In April, the Supreme Court made it harder for employers to get early dismissals in 401(k) lawsuits. That decision keeps cases alive longer and raises the cost of defending even if you win. Another Supreme Court ruling last year killed off the Chevron doctrine, which had forced courts to defer to agencies when laws weren’t clear. Douglas Tang, a partner at Patterson Belknap, said that change weakens any guidance that might come out of Trump’s executive order. Congress could change the law to add real safe harbor rules or make it harder for workers to sue, but Tang said, “there appears to be no momentum on such efforts.” So the lawsuits keep coming, and employers keep ducking risk. That’s where things stand.

Notably, this plan aligns with the nation’s aim to enhance its contribution to the AI ecosystem. The tech giant will collaborate with several partners currently developing their own Stargate UK data centers to achieve this tremendous objective. They include: Microsoft, CoreWeave, Nscale, and OpenAI. This initiative also aligns with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s vision of “sovereign AI,” which stands for developing AI purposefully to fulfill one’s needs and benefit them. Similar projects were initially introduced in France and the United Arab Emirates. Nvidia eyes the UK for AI expansion In a statement, Huang mentioned that the UK was creating the infrastructure needed for an AI-driven industrial revolution. Based on his explanation, this included enhancing science, transforming industries, and developing new economic opportunities. The CEO made these remarks when President Trump’s state had planned a visit to the country. To achieve Nvidia’s plan , Microsoft and Nscale have been assigned to create a superior supercomputer in Loughton, UK. This device will feature 24,000 Nvidia Grace Blackwell Ultra chips, essential to keep Microsoft’s Azure platform running in the country. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, weighed in on the topic of discussion. Nadella said they were committed to ensuring the US and the UK lead AI and cloud innovation globally. Therefore, based on his argument, they must work with NVIDIA to combine their international platform with their recent computing, software, and networking capabilities to achieve this goal. This is because innovators in these countries will acquire powerful tools to shape their future in AI. For Nscale, its contribution includes the installation of 60,000 Nvidia chips across the UK. The tech firm is collaborating with OpenAI to have its Stargate UK data center up and running by 2026. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, also commented on the situation. Altman pointed out the UK’s long history of leading in AI and its ability to attract high-ranked researchers, millions of ChatGPT users, and a government system that swiftly recognized the potential that this technology holds. He further explained that Stargate UK creates a strong base to accelerate science-based discoveries, improve productivity, and stimulate economic growth in the country. The CEO also acknowledged that this collaboration upholds their long-shared belief that with the right resources, AI can create various opportunities for individuals and businesses situated in the UK. Tech firms join forces to make significant advancements in the AI sector Apart from data centers focused on exploring AI, Nvidia has revealed a partnership with quantum computing firms OQC and Digital Realty to develop a Quantum AI center. On the other hand, ORCA Computing, Imperial College London, and Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center have joined forces to develop hybrid-quantum deep neural networks. At the same time, the University of Edinburgh centers its concentration on programs related to GPU-accelerated quantum error-correction. Other projects to contribute to advancing the AI sector include thorough research in robotics and several other fields. In the meantime, Microsoft pledged to invest approximately $30 billion in AI infrastructure and operations based in the UK in a blog dated September 16. According to the company, the plan will be effective from 2025 to 2028. This includes $15 billion specifically for the construction of cloud and AI infrastructure in the country.

Recently, South Korea’s Financial Security Institute (FSI) sounded an alarm, revealing sophisticated new crypto exchange hacking techniques . This isn’t just about simple phishing anymore; attackers are now employing cunning, multi-layered methods to breach security and steal valuable digital assets. Understanding these evolving threats is absolutely crucial for everyone in the crypto space, from seasoned traders to new investors. Understanding the Evolving Crypto Exchange Hacking Techniques Hackers are getting smarter, and their strategies are becoming increasingly elaborate. The FSI report highlights ""pretexting"" as a primary method in recent overseas crypto exchange hacks. But what exactly does this entail? Impersonation: Attackers often pose as recruiters or other legitimate professionals. Building Trust: They engage in seemingly innocent conversations to build rapport. Malware Delivery: The ultimate goal is to trick employees into installing malicious software on their computers. This malware then becomes the gateway, allowing infiltrators to gain an initial foothold within an organization’s network. It’s a social engineering masterclass, designed to bypass initial defenses and exploit human trust. How Hackers Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Once malware is successfully installed, hackers don’t stop there. Their next step involves exploiting ""supply chain vulnerabilities."" This sophisticated approach demonstrates an advanced understanding of network architecture. They target weaker links in the software, hardware, or services that a cryptocurrency exchange uses. By compromising a third-party vendor or a component within the exchange’s operational ecosystem, they can gain deeper access to the core network. This indirect infiltration strategy makes detection much harder, showcasing the growing sophistication of modern crypto exchange hacking techniques . The aim is always to move deeper into the system, often unnoticed, preparing for the final, devastating blow. The Peril of Blind Signatures and Obscure Laundering A particularly insidious method highlighted by the FSI involves ""blind signatures."" This technique is a significant threat to asset security: Deceptive Approvals: Employees are tricked into approving transactions without fully seeing or understanding their underlying details. Unauthorized Transfers: This allows hackers to authorize illicit transfers, effectively stealing assets directly from the exchange. After the theft, the stolen funds are quickly laundered to obscure their origin. Mixer protocols, like the infamous Tornado Cash, are frequently used to anonymize transactions. These mixers intentionally obscure the transaction trail, making stolen funds incredibly difficult to trace. Finally, the funds are converted into ""non-freezable coins"" and cashed out, disappearing without a trace. This entire process underscores the complex nature of these modern crypto exchange hacking techniques . Strengthening Defenses Against Advanced Crypto Exchange Hacking Techniques So, what can be done to counter these evolving threats? Vigilance and proactive security measures are paramount for both cryptocurrency exchanges and individual users. For Exchanges: Employee Training: Implement robust, ongoing training programs to educate staff about social engineering tactics. Supply Chain Audits: Conduct regular and thorough security audits of all third-party vendors and supply chain components. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Mandate MFA for all critical operations and employee access points. Advanced Threat Detection: Deploy sophisticated systems capable of identifying unusual network activity and potential breaches. Regular Security Audits: Perform frequent penetration testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them. For Users: Skepticism: Be highly skeptical of unsolicited communications, especially those requesting personal or sensitive information. Strong Security: Use strong, unique passwords and enable MFA on all your crypto accounts. Reputable Platforms: Only use well-established and reputable exchanges and wallets. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated on the latest scams and crypto exchange hacking techniques . Conclusion: A Call for Unwavering Vigilance The FSI’s revelations serve as a stark reminder of the ever-present dangers in the cryptocurrency world. As hackers continuously evolve their crypto exchange hacking techniques , our collective defenses must adapt and strengthen even faster. Staying informed, maintaining unwavering vigilance, and proactively implementing robust security measures are our best shields against these increasingly sophisticated threats. The security of your digital assets depends on it. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is pretexting in crypto security? Pretexting is a social engineering technique where attackers create a believable, fabricated scenario (a ""pretext"") to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security, such as installing malware. 2. How do supply chain vulnerabilities affect crypto exchanges? Supply chain vulnerabilities allow hackers to compromise an exchange indirectly by targeting a less secure third-party vendor or software component that the exchange relies on. This breach in the supply chain can then provide access to the exchange’s internal systems. 3. What are ""blind signatures"" and why are they dangerous? Blind signatures occur when an employee is tricked into digitally signing or approving a transaction without fully seeing or understanding the actual details of what they are approving. This can lead to unauthorized transfers of funds, as the employee unknowingly greenlights a malicious transaction. 4. How do hackers launder stolen crypto funds? Hackers typically launder stolen funds by routing them through ""mixer"" protocols (like Tornado Cash), which combine and shuffle various crypto transactions to obscure their origin. They then often convert these mixed funds into non-traceable cryptocurrencies before cashing them out. 5. What can I do to protect my crypto assets from these hacking techniques? Individual users should use strong, unique passwords, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), be wary of unsolicited communications, only use reputable exchanges, and stay informed about the latest security threats and scams.

The former CEO and co-founder of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, affectionately known as CZ, recently updated his profile description from “ex-@binance” to simply “@binance.” This seemingly small edit has fueled intense discussion: is CZ truly preparing to step back into the spotlight? What Signals a Potential Changpeng Zhao Binance Return? The recent change to CZ’s X profile is the primary catalyst for this wave of speculation. For many, this isn’t just a casual edit; it’s a deliberate signal. Following his legal challenges in the U.S. for violating anti-money laundering laws, and a period of imprisonment, the timing of this profile update is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a potential shift in his professional status or an upcoming announcement. Profile Update: Changing “ex-@binance” to “@binance” directly implies a renewed association. Industry Timing: Occurs after his legal obligations, raising questions about his future role. Community Reaction: The crypto world is highly sensitive to such signals from influential figures. Beyond the X profile, the broader context of Binance’s legal situation adds another layer to the narrative. Bloomberg recently reported that Binance is nearing a significant agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. This deal could potentially release the exchange from its obligation to retain a third-party compliance monitor. How Does Binance’s DOJ Agreement Impact CZ’s Future? An agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice is a major milestone for Binance. It signifies a move towards resolving past compliance issues and establishing a more stable regulatory footing. This development could pave the way for a more streamlined operation and potentially, a more welcoming environment for key figures like CZ to re-engage, even if not in a direct executive capacity initially. While CZ’s legal journey has been separate from Binance’s corporate entity in some respects, the fortunes of both are often intertwined in the public perception. A cleaner slate for Binance could indirectly facilitate a smoother path for any future involvement from its co-founder, making a Changpeng Zhao Binance return more plausible in the eyes of many. The crypto market thrives on anticipation and signals from its leaders. CZ’s influence on Binance, and indeed the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, remains substantial. His past requests for a pardon from President Donald Trump, made between April and May, also underscore his desire to re-enter the public and professional sphere without lingering legal shadows.

One key indicator that helps gauge these shifts is the Altcoin Season Index , which currently stands firm at 71. This reading, unchanged from the previous day, offers a fascinating snapshot of the market’s sentiment towards digital assets beyond Bitcoin. For many, the question isn’t just “what is this number?” but “what does it mean for my portfolio?” What Does the Altcoin Season Index at 71 Truly Indicate? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, serves as a barometer for market performance. It meticulously tracks whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies – excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens – have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A score nearing 100 unmistakably signals an “Altcoin Season,” a period where these alternative coins experience significant growth. Conversely, a lower score often points to a “Bitcoin Season,” where the pioneer cryptocurrency leads the charge. A steady score of 71 suggests a market in transition. While it’s not a full-blown Altcoin Season yet, it clearly indicates that a substantial number of altcoins are showing robust performance relative to Bitcoin. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it reflects sustained outperformance by a broad segment of the market. Investors often watch this metric closely to identify potential shifts in capital flows. Navigating the Crypto Landscape: Is a Full Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Given the current reading, many are wondering if a definitive Altcoin Season is just around the corner. Several factors could propel the Altcoin Season Index higher. For instance, major upgrades to prominent networks like Ethereum, or the emergence of compelling new narratives in decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), could draw significant capital into altcoins. These developments often spark renewed interest and investment. However, challenges remain. Bitcoin’s dominance can quickly reassert itself, especially during periods of market uncertainty or macro-economic shifts. A sudden surge in Bitcoin’s price could temporarily overshadow altcoin gains, pushing the index lower. Therefore, while 71 is promising, it’s not a guarantee. Smart investors will continue to monitor the broader market and specific project developments. Understanding the Dynamics: How the Altcoin Season Index Impacts Your Portfolio Recognizing the implications of the Altcoin Season Index is vital for strategic portfolio management. When the index climbs, it often signals opportunities for potentially higher gains in altcoins, which typically exhibit greater volatility and upside potential compared to Bitcoin during these periods. This can be an exciting time for those looking to diversify and capitalize on emerging trends. Conversely, misinterpreting the index can lead to risks. Chasing every altcoin without proper due diligence can result in significant drawdowns if market sentiment shifts rapidly. It’s crucial to remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Benefits: Identifying periods for potentially accelerated returns from altcoins. Challenges: Increased volatility and the risk of rapid market reversals. Examples: Historically, periods of high index scores have coincided with strong performances from sectors like DeFi tokens or Layer 1 solutions. Strategic Moves for Savvy Altcoin Investors in a 71-Point Market With the Altcoin Season Index holding at 71, what actionable insights can investors take? This reading suggests a selective approach is best. Research Diligently: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear utility. Don’t just follow the hype. Diversify Wisely: Spread your investments across different altcoin sectors to mitigate risk. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: A declining Bitcoin dominance chart often precedes or accompanies an Altcoin Season. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders. This dynamic environment demands continuous learning and adaptation. Staying informed about market narratives and technological advancements will be key to navigating the opportunities presented by the current Altcoin Season Index standing. The Altcoin Season Index at 71 serves as a compelling indicator of the crypto market’s current health and potential direction.

Standard Chartered has been cited with a year-end forecast of $7,500, while other market commentators and smaller research groups have floated targets as high as $8,500.

A pivot point near $4,811 was named by some analysts as the level that needs to clear for a larger advance to become more likely. Ethereum’s recent trading band has been roughly in the $4,400–$4,600 range in many charts, which means significant upside would be required to reach the lofty targets being discussed. What Would Need To Happen For $8,500 According to market commentary, several things would have to line up. Continued ETF inflows and steady institutional accumulation are key. Also important are clearer rules for ETF products and a soft macro backdrop that keeps risk appetite intact. Some analysts add that if Bitcoin moves higher — a move to roughly $150,000 has been used in scenarios — Ethereum could gain as investors reallocate across major crypto assets. Risks That Would Halt The Rally News cautions that the $8,500 concept is built on several positive developments occurring simultaneously. Policy shifts, softer ETF demand, or a change in macro sentiment might also stop a rally in a hurry.

51848793,582139,1758070833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51848793.jpeg,Shiba Inu Bulls Are Back: Here’s The 512 Billion SHIB Accumulation That Triggered A Spark,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bulls-are-back/,"Shiba Inu bulls are back, with on-chain data indicating heavy accumulation among the meme coin’s investors. Specifically, a 512 billion SHIB transfer has drawn the attention of the crypto community, sparking bullish sentiments towards the meme coin, which has underperformed so far. Shiba Inu Bulls Spark SHIB Accumulation Theory With 512 Billion SHIB Transfer Etherscan data shows that a Kraken hot wallet moved just over 512 billion SHIB ($7.14 million) to an unknown wallet (0x95a…4C4cE), sparking speculations that Shiba Inu bulls are actively accumulating the meme coin. Typically, a move from a hot wallet to what is possibly a cold wallet indicates that investors are looking to hold the crypto asset for the long term. Notably, thanks to this 512 billion transfer, the unknown wallet now ranks as the 38th largest Shiba Inu holder. Meanwhile, further on-chain data suggests that this wallet might be Kraken’s cold wallet , which stores its reserves. This wallet has made several transactions since then but still holds 1.47 trillion SHIB ($19.28 million), representing an increase from the initial 512 billion that was deposited. This confirms that Shiba Inu bulls have indeed been busy accumulating more SHIB even amid the sideways price action from the meme coin. This is a positive development, as it could trigger a supply shock, potentially leading to higher prices for SHIB. Meanwhile, Santiment data also shows that the exchange outflows are currently outpacing the exchange inflows. On September 15, 181.87 billion SHIB were taken off exchanges, while 87.37 billion tokens were moved into exchanges. This indicates that more Shiba Inu investors are currently leaning towards accumulating more SHIB rather than offloading their tokens. These investors are likely taking advantage of the dip opportunity as they anticipate higher prices for the meme coin despite its underperformance. SHIB is down almost 40% year-to-date (YTD). SHIB Could Still Rally 600% From Current Levels Crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the Shiba Inu price could rally by almost 600% from its current levels. He stated that the technicals point towards a near 6x happening in price to reach the $0.000081 target despite some bearish sentiments towards the meme coin. The analyst had earlier revealed that SHIB had confirmed a bullish pattern in a regular bull divergence with the MACD histogram. Fundamentals also present a bullish outlook for the Shiba Inu price. The SHIB team is about to roll out the LEASH v2 migration , which is positive for the entire Shiba Inu ecosystem. Meanwhile, ShibaSwap recently launched an upgrade to enable cross-chain access, further strengthening SHIB’s utility. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001306, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Shiba Inu|Coinmarketcap|etherscan|Javon Marks|Kraken|LEASH v2 Migration|MACD Histogram|meme coin|Santiment|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|ShibaSwap|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 01:00:33

In South Korea, a similar conversation is taking place, specifically concerning the potential introduction of a won-pegged stablecoin . The Bank of Korea, the nation’s central bank, is treading carefully, as highlighted by Governor Rhee Chang-yong’s recent remarks. Why the Caution Around a Won-Pegged Stablecoin? Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong recently shared his cautious perspective on a potential won-pegged stablecoin . Speaking at a special lecture at Seoul National University, Rhee expressed significant uncertainty regarding the benefits such a digital asset might bring to the Korean economy. His primary concern revolves around a crucial question: What tangible advantages would a domestic stablecoin offer that aren’t already addressed by existing financial mechanisms? Moreover, the Governor pointed out a significant risk: the potential for a won-pegged stablecoin to disrupt the nation’s established monetary system. Introducing a new form of currency, even one pegged to the national fiat, could have unforeseen consequences on: Monetary policy effectiveness Financial stability The existing banking infrastructure These are not trivial concerns for a central bank tasked with maintaining economic stability. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: Domestic vs. Dollar-Pegged One might assume that introducing a domestic won-pegged stablecoin would help stem the tide of foreign-pegged stablecoins, particularly those linked to the U.S. dollar. However, Governor Rhee believes this isn’t necessarily the case. He articulated that issuing a local stablecoin would not automatically prevent the influx or usage of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins within the Korean market. Why this distinction? The reasons are multifaceted: Global Liquidity: U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins often offer greater global liquidity and easier access to international markets. Investor Preference: Some investors might prefer the perceived stability and widespread acceptance of dollar-pegged assets, regardless of local alternatives. Regulatory Arbitrage: Different regulatory frameworks might incentivize the use of foreign stablecoins. Therefore, simply creating a won-pegged stablecoin does not solve the broader challenge of managing cross-border digital asset flows or the preferences of market participants. What Are the Potential Upsides of a Won-Pegged Stablecoin? (Even If Uncertain) While the Bank of Korea maintains a cautious stance, it’s worth considering the general arguments often made for stablecoins, even if their specific benefits for the Korean won are currently deemed uncertain by the Governor. Proponents often highlight: Payment Efficiency: Potential for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. Financial Inclusion: Greater access to financial services for underserved populations. Innovation: Fostering new financial products and services within the digital economy. However, Governor Rhee’s remarks suggest that for South Korea, these potential benefits are not yet compelling enough to outweigh the risks. The central bank’s primary role is to ensure stability, and any new financial instrument must clearly demonstrate its value without compromising this core mandate. The Bank of Korea’s stance reflects a pragmatic approach: prioritize stability and thoroughly assess the value proposition of new digital assets. The conversation around a won-pegged stablecoin is far from over, but for now, the emphasis remains on understanding its true impact before widespread adoption. As the digital finance landscape continues to evolve, central banks like the Bank of Korea will undoubtedly continue their careful evaluation, balancing innovation with the imperative of financial security. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a won-pegged stablecoin? A won-pegged stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won. This means its value should theoretically always be equivalent to one Korean Won. 2. Why is the Bank of Korea cautious about a won-pegged stablecoin? Governor Rhee Chang-yong expressed caution due to the uncertain benefits of such a stablecoin and its potential to disrupt the existing monetary system. The central bank prioritizes financial stability. 3. Will a won-pegged stablecoin stop the use of USD-pegged stablecoins in Korea? Governor Rhee believes that issuing a domestic won-pegged stablecoin would not necessarily prevent the influx or usage of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, citing factors like global liquidity and investor preference. 4. What are the general benefits often associated with stablecoins? Commonly cited benefits include improved payment efficiency, potential for greater financial inclusion, and fostering innovation in digital finance. However, the Bank of Korea questions if these apply compellingly to a won-pegged stablecoin in their context. 5. What is the Bank of Korea’s main priority regarding digital assets? The Bank of Korea’s primary goal is to ensure financial stability. Any new digital asset or financial instrument must clearly demonstrate its value without compromising this core mandate.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Polymarket and CME FedWatch are aligned: the Fed’s easing cycle begins tomorrow. Both have a 25 bps cut locked in for the next FOMC meeting, with odds building for a three-cut path through year-end. Polymarket traders leave more room for aggressive easing, while CME assigns steadier probabilities of 25 bps steps. Either way, markets see 75 bps in cuts as the baseline for 2025. Market conviction around the Fed pivot is already showing up on-chain, with BTC trading at $116,762, up 1.3% on the day and 4.7% on the week, while ETH sits at $4,502, up 4.3% on the week as traders price in the cuts. Now, some traders are sitting on the sidelines to see just how the market might react as the Fed announces cuts. In a recent report, CryptoQuant data shows bitcoin exchange inflows have dropped to a 7-day average of just 25,000 BTC, the lowest in more than a year and a half; the level seen in mid-July when BTC first crossed $120,000. The average BTC deposit size has also halved to 0.57 BTC, evidence that large holders are sitting idle rather than rushing to sell. ETH is seeing the same pattern: exchange inflows have fallen to a two-month low of 783,000 ETH, down sharply from 1.8 million in August. The average ETH deposit has declined to 30 ETH from 40–45 ETH earlier this summer, suggesting reduced sell-side activity from whales. If BTC and ETH are being hoarded, stablecoins are flowing in CryptoQuant writes in its report. USDT deposits into exchanges surged to $379 million at the end of August, the highest this year, and remain elevated at $200 million. The average daily USDT deposit has doubled since July, giving exchanges the “dry powder” needed to support a post-Fed rally. But the flows aren’t uniform. Altcoins are seeing a resurgence of exchange activity, with transaction deposits climbing to a 7-day total of 55,000, up from a flat 20,000–30,000 range earlier this year. That divergence signals possible profit-taking in higher-beta names even as BTC and ETH supply remains tight. ""September brings a wave of token unlocks totaling $4.5 billion, a dynamic that could pressure liquidity and test market absorption,"" OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin wrote in a note to CoinDesk. True opportunity lies beyond short-term volatility, Lin argued. ""Stablecoins are nearing $300 billion in supply, token unlocks are putting market depth to the test, and major infrastructure upgrades like Nasdaq’s move toward tokenized securities are signaling that crypto is becoming part of the global financial system, not an outlier,"" she wrote. The message is clear: the Fed pivot is nearly priced in. What matters now is whether crypto’s liquidity buffers, stablecoins, exchange inflows, and token unlocks can absorb the shocks and channel capital into the next leg higher for BTC. Market Movement BTC: BTC is trading above $116,500 as traders are optimistic about potential U.S. interest rate cuts. Technical factors such as the closing of futures gaps have added upward pressure. Some caution is setting in ahead of the Fed meeting. ETH: ETH is trading with modest strength, supported by overall crypto market momentum (dominated by BTC), but with some resistance as investors weigh macro risks and await clarity on policy from the Fed. Gold: Gold is hitting record highs, driven by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates, a weakening U.S. dollar, and heightened geopolitical or macroeconomic uncertainty. Safe‑haven demand from investors is strong. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks fell on Wednesday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.3%, as investors tracked Wall Street losses and awaited a likely Fed rate cut decision. S&P 500: The S&P 500 slipped 0.13% to 6,606.76 Tuesday as investors booked profits ahead of the Fed’s rate decision after touching a record high earlier.

The measure would block the Federal Reserve from creating or distributing a digital dollar before any such system is formally authorized. The proposal, known as the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and sponsored by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN), already cleared the House in July. Lawmakers aim to fold it into the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, the chamber’s flagship market structure legislation. The proposal emerged in a draft agenda from the House Rules Committee that seemingly would force the CBDC ban to be included in market structure legislation via an “engrossment.” That is, rather than play out in a standalone law, the ban would find its way into the final version of the market structure bill before it heads to the Senate. This will speed passage, lawmakers say. The standalone digital dollar legislation faced challenging margins, and packaging it within a broader digital assets package could give senators more ammunition to fend off objections. The bill is designed not only to bring clarity to the respective roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission but also to establish rules about trading, custody, and issuance for digital assets. With the CBDC ban folded in, it now sits squarely at the center of the U.S. crypto regulatory debate — especially in Discord circles. Lawmakers drive CBDC ban across several bills The CBDC ban is not just in the market structure bill, with lawmakers opting to push it through the once-a-year defense policy bil l, which is commonly referred to as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA is one of the must-pass pieces of legislation, establishing the Pentagon’s budget and defense priorities, which means it almost always gets passed by Congress. By grafting the CBDC ban onto this vehicle, lawmakers are opting for one of the surest pathways to ram through a contentious measure. This tactic also makes it harder for critics to prevent the provision from moving forward; voting against the NDAA would be perceived as standing in the way of military funds and defense planning at a time when tensions are escalating around potential international flash points. The provision included in the NDAA is unequivocal. It prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing, testing, or offering its own central bank digital currency. This ban is to work retroactively, blocking the startup of a potential future CBDC and any existing pilot programs or research projects. Supporters say the amendment sends a message to Congress against Fed policy in any administration. Privacy and competition battles heat up Proponents of the ban claim a CBDC could infringe on personal freedom. They caution that a digital dollar could enable the government to track, monitor, or restrict how citizens spend their money. They see a CBDC ban as a firewall against state surveillance and financial manipulation. Cynics, however, say that by banning a CBDC outright, the U.S. risks being left behind other major economies. China has already introduced its digital yuan, and the European Union is moving toward a digital euro. Economists and fintech experts warn that even the lack of an option for a CBDC leaves the U.S. in danger of losing its lead as global financial markets shift to new players .

A groundbreaking development recently emerged from the UK’s LMAX Group, a prominent fintech firm. They are now offering Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures trading with an astonishing up to 100x leverage, as reported by Bloomberg. This move signifies a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency landscape, providing sophisticated investors with powerful new tools. LMAX Group, known for processing an average of over $40 billion in daily spot trading volume, is not just dipping its toes; it’s making a bold leap. The company is launching cash-settled contracts specifically linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This initiative directly addresses the growing demand from institutional clients for more dynamic and leveraged access to the crypto market. What Are Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures and Why Now? Perpetual futures are a unique type of derivatives contract in the crypto space. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. LMAX Group’s decision to offer Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures stems from a clear understanding of market trends. They recognized that this market segment has been a core part of the crypto industry for the past four years, attracting significant retail and now institutional interest. Institutional investors are constantly seeking efficient ways to gain exposure to digital assets, manage risk, and potentially amplify returns. Leverage, in this context, allows them to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. For well-capitalized and risk-managed institutions, 100x leverage can be a powerful tool for strategic trading and hedging. LMAX Group’s Bold Move: A Catalyst for Institutional Crypto Growth? The introduction of such high-leverage Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures by a regulated entity like LMAX Group is a significant game-changer. It legitimizes and formalizes a product previously more associated with retail-focused, often unregulated, platforms. This move is not isolated; it reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption and the maturation of the crypto derivatives market. Consider these key impacts: Enhanced Market Liquidity: More institutional participation typically leads to deeper liquidity, making markets more efficient and less prone to sudden price swings. Sophisticated Risk Management: Institutions can strategically use these instruments for hedging existing crypto holdings, managing exposure, or speculating on price movements without direct ownership of the underlying assets. Increased Accessibility: For institutions, trading with a trusted and regulated provider like LMAX Group reduces counterparty risk and operational complexities, fostering greater confidence in the market. Competitive Landscape: This service follows similar launches, indicating a growing institutional appetite. Coinbase Financial Markets launched a comparable service in July, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has also announced plans for its own version in October, intensifying the race for institutional crypto market share. Navigating the Dynamics: Opportunities and Challenges for Institutional Crypto While the opportunities are significant, institutional clients engaging with Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures must also navigate potential challenges. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, combined with high leverage, means that positions can move dramatically in a short period. Robust risk management frameworks and a deep understanding of market dynamics are paramount for institutions utilizing these products. However, the opportunities for growth and innovation are equally compelling: Arbitrage Strategies: Institutions can capitalize on price discrepancies between spot markets and perpetual futures, generating profits from market inefficiencies. Capital Efficiency: Leverage allows institutions to deploy capital more efficiently across various strategies, optimizing their investment portfolios and maximizing potential returns. Market Maturation: The entry of established players like LMAX Group, alongside Coinbase and CBOE, signals the increasing institutionalization of the crypto derivatives market. This pushes the entire industry towards higher standards of compliance, regulation, and investor protection. This evolving landscape suggests a future where digital assets are more deeply integrated into global financial systems, offering diverse avenues for investment and risk management. LMAX Group’s launch of 100x leverage Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing demand from institutional investors for sophisticated, high-leverage trading products within a regulated framework. This move, alongside similar initiatives from other major financial players, is accelerating the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem. As the market continues to evolve, these offerings will undoubtedly shape how institutions interact with Bitcoin and Ethereum, paving the way for further innovation and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are perpetual futures in the context of cryptocurrency? A1: Perpetual futures are a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, without an expiry date. This means positions can be held indefinitely, unlike traditional futures contracts. Q2: How does 100x leverage work with perpetual futures? A2: 100x leverage means an investor can control a position worth 100 times their initial capital. For example, with $1,000, they could open a position worth $100,000. While this can amplify profits, it also significantly increases the risk of losses. Q3: Why is LMAX Group offering these products to institutions? A3: LMAX Group recognized a strong demand from institutional investors for leveraged market access to cryptocurrencies. They identified perpetual futures as a core part of the crypto industry that institutions want to engage with, within a regulated and secure environment. Q4: Which cryptocurrencies are supported for these perpetual futures?

This colossal shift, reported by the reputable on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, immediately sparked widespread discussion among market participants and analysts alike. What could this significant Bitcoin transfer signify for the future trajectory of the crypto market? Unpacking This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Event Just eight hours prior to the report, a fresh address, identified as starting with bc1qup, received a monumental Bitcoin transfer . Specifically, 5,816 BTC, valued at an astonishing $680 million, was moved from FalconX. As a prominent prime brokerage for institutional investors, FalconX’s involvement strongly suggests a meticulously calculated move by a major financial entity. Such a large-scale Bitcoin transfer naturally raises crucial questions about its underlying motivations. Who orchestrated this colossal transfer? FalconX’s role points towards an institutional entity or a high-net-worth individual. Why did this transfer happen now? The timing could be strategically linked to market conditions, portfolio rebalancing, or preparations for upcoming market events. What Does This Bitcoin Transfer Mean for the Market? A Bitcoin transfer of this immense magnitude rarely occurs without significant underlying activity or strategic intent. There are several compelling interpretations, each carrying different implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Firstly, it could represent a substantial institutional investor shifting funds into cold storage for long-term holding. This best practice secures digital assets away from online exchanges, reducing exposure to hacks or regulatory risks. If true, it could be a profoundly bullish signal, indicating strong conviction in Bitcoin’s enduring value. Secondly, this Bitcoin transfer might be the settlement of an over-the-counter (OTC) deal. Institutional players frequently execute large trades directly to prevent price slippage. The funds could be moving to a new custodian or directly to a buyer’s wallet following such a private transaction. Thirdly, the transfer could simply be an internal reorganization by FalconX or one of its major clients. Large financial institutions routinely rebalance their digital asset holdings across various wallets or custodians to optimize efficiency and enhance security. In this scenario, the Bitcoin transfer is more about internal asset management rather than a direct market indicator. Tracking Significant Bitcoin Transfers: Insights for Investors Observing and analyzing large Bitcoin transfer s offers invaluable insights into overall market sentiment and potential future price movements. Blockchain analytics firms, like Lookonchain, play an indispensable role in bringing transparency to these on-chain movements. By diligently tracking these “whale” transactions, experienced analysts can often infer whether major holders are accumulating, distributing, or simply securing their substantial investments. Key insights derived from monitoring large transfers: Market Sentiment: Consistent transfers to cold storage often suggest long-term bullish sentiment among large holders. Potential Price Impact: While this specific Bitcoin transfer did not directly involve an exchange deposit, any subsequent movements from the receiving address (bc1qup) to an exchange could potentially signal impending selling pressure. Institutional Adoption: The involvement of prime brokers like FalconX in these transactions strongly underscores the accelerating pace of institutional participation and confidence within the crypto ecosystem. Understanding these complex on-chain dynamics empowers investors to make more informed decisions, allowing them to anticipate potential market shifts rather than merely reacting to them. Navigating the Future After This Monumental Bitcoin Transfer The recent colossal Bitcoin transfer vividly underscores the continuous evolution of the cryptocurrency market. As more institutional capital flows into Bitcoin, we can expect similar large-scale movements to become increasingly common. These transfers, while sometimes mysterious, serve as a powerful testament to the growing maturity and sophisticated infrastructure now supporting digital assets globally. For everyday retail investors, the paramount lesson is to remain well-informed and to understand that not every large transfer signals an impending price crash or an immediate pump. More often than not, they are highly strategic, calculated maneuvers executed by sophisticated entities. This particular Bitcoin transfer , moving to a brand-new address from an established institutional platform, strongly leans towards a security-focused or long-term strategic holding narrative, rather than suggesting immediate selling pressure on the market. What key indicators to watch for next: Any subsequent movements or activity originating from the bc1qup address. Further detailed reports and analyses from leading on-chain analytics firms. The overall market reaction and prevailing sentiment in the wake of such a significant event. In conclusion, this monumental $680 million Bitcoin transfer from FalconX is a powerful and unmistakable reminder of the significant capital and strategic depth within the crypto ecosystem. While its exact purpose remains a subject of informed speculation, it undeniably highlights the deep pockets and calculated maneuvers of major players in the digital asset space. Keeping a close eye on such impactful events is absolutely crucial for anyone aiming to truly understand the pulse and direction of the Bitcoin market.

Each transfer needs context. Q4: How can I track large Bitcoin transfers? A: You can follow blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Whale Alert, or Glassnode, which specialize in monitoring and reporting significant on-chain movements. Q5: What is FalconX’s role in this transfer? A: FalconX is a prime brokerage that provides trading, credit, and clearing services for institutional investors in the digital asset space.

What Prompted the Yala Token Burn? The recent incident saw unauthorized YU tokens issued, raising concerns within the community.

By destroying the illicitly created YU tokens, the protocol effectively eliminates any supply that entered the ecosystem without proper authorization. This action is paramount for maintaining the integrity of the YU token’s economic model and preventing potential market instability caused by the unexpected supply. It also serves as a powerful signal to the community: Yala is proactive in neutralizing threats and preserving the legitimate value of its assets. This commitment builds confidence among users and investors, reinforcing the protocol’s reliability. Yala’s Proactive Stance: Beyond the Immediate Threat This incident highlights the constant vigilance required in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Yala’s rapid identification of the unauthorized tokens and the subsequent recovery efforts underscore its robust operational security. The protocol is not just reacting; it is setting a precedent for how a Bitcoin-native platform responds to external threats. Prioritizing asset security and user confidence is central to Yala’s operations. Users can take comfort in the fact that Yala’s core infrastructure and BTC holdings were unaffected, reinforcing its foundational strength. This proactive approach ensures long-term stability. The upcoming Yala token burn is a testament to this commitment, demonstrating that the protocol is actively working to protect its ecosystem from potential risks and maintain a secure environment for its participants. What Does the Future Hold After the Yala Token Burn? With the unauthorized tokens removed, Yala can focus squarely on its long-term vision for Bitcoin-native liquidity. The successful execution of the Yala token burn will likely restore and even strengthen community trust, demonstrating resilience and accountability in the face of adversity.

It showcases the importance of swift action and transparent communication when security breaches occur. Yala’s journey continues, building upon a foundation of security and innovation in the Bitcoin-native liquidity space. The protocol remains dedicated to advancing its mission and providing a reliable platform for its users. The upcoming Yala token burn is more than just a technical procedure; it’s a testament to the protocol’s dedication to security, transparency, and its community.

Koscom, a prominent financial IT firm, is making a significant move into the digital asset space, particularly with its sights set on a won-denominated Koscom stablecoin . This proactive step signals a strategic shift and highlights the growing importance of digital currencies in traditional finance. What’s Driving Koscom’s Stablecoin Ambition? The Korea Economic Daily recently reported that Koscom has filed five distinct trademark applications related to a won-denominated stablecoin. These applications, including names like “KSDC,” “KRW24,” “KRW365,” “KOSWON,” and “KORWON,” clearly indicate Koscom’s intent to establish a strong presence in this evolving market. It’s a clear signal that they are not just observing but actively preparing to launch their own digital currency offerings. Why is a Koscom stablecoin so important? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or, in this case, the Korean Won. This stability makes them ideal for various financial transactions, remittances, and even as a bridge between traditional finance and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Reorganizing for Digital Dominance: The New Task Force Koscom isn’t just filing trademarks; they’re also restructuring internally to support this ambitious venture. The company has elevated its Future Business Division, transforming it into a dedicated Digital Asset Business Promotion Task Force. This new task force now reports directly to the CEO, underscoring the strategic priority and company-wide commitment to digital assets. This organizational change aims to: Enhance Organizational Standing: Giving the digital asset initiative a direct line to top leadership. Strengthen Company-Wide Momentum: Ensuring resources and focus are aligned across departments. Reflect Growing Importance: Acknowledging the undeniable rise of stablecoins and other digital assets in the global financial arena. This strategic realignment demonstrates Koscom’s dedication to becoming a key player in the digital asset sector, particularly with its potential Koscom stablecoin . Why Are Stablecoins So Important Now? The global financial landscape is rapidly embracing digital innovation, and stablecoins are at the forefront of this transformation.

Accessibility: Stablecoins can provide financial services to a broader population, including those underserved by traditional banks. Innovation: They lay the groundwork for new financial products and services, driving further advancements in fintech. For South Korea, a won-denominated Koscom stablecoin could streamline domestic payments, enhance international trade, and position the nation as a leader in digital finance innovation. What Challenges Might Koscom Face? While the prospects for a Koscom stablecoin are exciting, the path ahead is not without its hurdles. Navigating the regulatory landscape will be paramount. South Korea has been cautious but progressive in its approach to digital assets, and any new stablecoin offering will need to comply with evolving financial regulations, including: Consumer Protection: Ensuring the security and stability of the stablecoin for users. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Implementing robust measures to prevent illicit activities. Market Stability: Addressing concerns about the potential impact on the broader financial system. Furthermore, competition from other stablecoin projects, both domestic and international, will require Koscom to differentiate its offering through unique features, robust technology, and strong partnerships. Koscom’s proactive stance with its trademark applications and internal restructuring signals a strong commitment to pioneering the future of finance in South Korea. The potential for a won-denominated Koscom stablecoin could unlock new efficiencies and opportunities, not just for the company but for the entire Korean economy. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, Koscom’s journey will be one to watch closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. It achieves this by pegging its value to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency (like the Korean Won or US Dollar), a commodity (like gold), or a basket of assets. What is Koscom’s main goal with these stablecoin trademark applications? Koscom’s main goal is to proactively enter the digital asset market, specifically with a won-denominated stablecoin. This move aims to leverage the stability of the Korean Won within the efficiency of blockchain technology for various financial applications. How will Koscom’s new Digital Asset Business Promotion Task Force impact its strategy? The new task force, reporting directly to the CEO, elevates the importance of digital assets within Koscom. It is designed to enhance organizational standing, strengthen company-wide momentum, and accelerate their entry and innovation in the digital asset sector, including the development of a Koscom stablecoin . What are the potential benefits of a won-denominated stablecoin for South Korea? A won-denominated stablecoin could offer benefits such as faster and cheaper domestic and international transactions, increased financial inclusion, and a foundation for innovative new financial products and services within South Korea’s economy. What challenges might Koscom face in launching a stablecoin? Key challenges include navigating complex and evolving regulatory frameworks in South Korea, ensuring robust security and consumer protection, and competing with existing or upcoming stablecoin projects in the market.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with an unprecedented event: a massive SOL accumulation by a suspected institutional investor. This significant move has seen an address withdraw a staggering 413,075 SOL, valued at an incredible $98.4 million, from various exchanges. This substantial withdrawal, reported by Lookonchain via FalconX, signals a potentially bullish outlook for Solana and warrants a closer look into its implications. Unveiling the Mystery: Who’s Behind This Massive SOL Accumulation? Over the past eight hours, a specific address, believed to belong to an institutional investor, executed a series of large withdrawals. This entity utilized FalconX, a prime brokerage platform, to consolidate its holdings. The sheer volume of this SOL accumulation suggests a calculated and strategic investment rather than a casual trade. Such significant movements often indicate high conviction from large players. Institutional investors typically conduct extensive due diligence before deploying such substantial capital. Therefore, this SOL accumulation could reflect a strong belief in Solana’s long-term potential and technological advancements. Why Does SOL Institutional Accumulation Matter? When institutions enter the market with such force, it often sends ripples throughout the entire ecosystem. Institutional SOL accumulation provides a crucial validation for the asset. It suggests that traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the value and stability of decentralized networks like Solana. Increased Confidence: Large investments by institutions can boost retail investor confidence, potentially attracting more capital. Market Stability: Institutional involvement can sometimes lead to greater market stability due to their typically longer investment horizons. Legitimacy: It lends further legitimacy to Solana as a serious contender in the blockchain space, moving beyond speculative retail interest. Demand Signal: A major SOL accumulation clearly signals a strong demand for the asset, which can influence future price action. Navigating the Waters: Potential Impacts of Significant SOL Accumulation This substantial withdrawal is not just a headline; it carries tangible implications for Solana’s market dynamics. Firstly, it reduces the circulating supply of SOL on exchanges, which can create upward price pressure if demand remains consistent or increases. Moreover, the sheer size of the transaction means a significant portion of available SOL has been moved into cold storage or private wallets, away from immediate selling pressure. However, it is also important to consider the potential for volatility. While initial reactions might be bullish, such large holdings can also exert selling pressure if the institution decides to liquidate in the future. Therefore, market participants should remain vigilant and observe subsequent on-chain activities. Price Appreciation Potential: Reduced supply on exchanges often correlates with price increases.

In his weekly “Market Outlook #51,” published on September 15, Nik Patel (@cointradernik) for Ostium Research maps out both long and short triggers around a tight cluster of resistance at $117.5k–$120k and a “line in the sand” support at $112k—frameworks he argues should contain BTC’s path through the FOMC and into quarter-end. How To Trade Bitcoin Into September FOMC Nik’s higher-timeframe read starts with a strong weekly close that reclaimed the August open near $115.3k and, crucially, kept price above $112k. “This is now the line in the sand for short-term bullishness,” he writes, warning that a weekly close back below would reopen the route to July’s local lows around $107k and, in a deeper flush, the $99k swing low. To the upside, he highlights $117.5k as the next inflection; a clean acceptance over $120k would set up a swift run at all-time highs, where $123k is the first major cap on the daily timeframe. Into the event, his directional bias remains conditional rather than dogmatic. On the long side, he favors a liquidity sweep early in the week: “On the long side you want to see a sharp flush lower… into $113.5k, where you could layer bids with invalidation on a daily close below $112k,” aiming for a reaction back to $117.5k (TP1) and $119k (TP2) into the FOMC. Related Reading: Analyst Raises Red Flags On Bitcoin Price: Allegations Of Market Manipulation Conversely, if BTC grinds higher without that flush, his short plan is to “short above $119k pre-FOMC,” then “add… on acceptance back below $117.5k post-FOMC,” with $112k as the first target and scope to trail for lower lows if structure weakens. The trader concedes the next couple of weeks are “a lot more unclear… with many variables,” but his base case still envisions “the second half of Q4 will be very strong.” The setup lands as BTC churns around $115k ahead of the decision—a zone multiple analysts have framed as pivotal. Heading into the weekly close, market commentary stressed that a sustained reclaim of ~$114k is a prerequisite for renewed momentum, with one widely tracked technician arguing, “The goal isn’t for Bitcoin to break $117k… The goal is for Bitcoin to reclaim $114k into support first.” Over the weekend and into Tuesday, BTC’s price action remained pinned in that band, keeping both the upside break toward $119k–$123k and the downside sweep into $113.5k–$112k on the table. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set For Short Squeeze Before Long Trap In October Macro context heightens the stakes. Markets broadly expect the Fed to cut its policy rate by 25 bps on September 17, shifting the target range from 4.50% to 4.25%—a baseline Nik explicitly builds into his calendar. Yet traders are equally focused on Chair Jerome Powell’s guidance and the updated “dot plot,” which will shape the path for additional cuts into year-end. While a cut is priced, the tone—whether the Fed signals a shallow or accelerated easing path—could be the catalyst that resolves BTC’s tight $114k–$119k coil. Positioning provides further texture to Nik’s plan. He flags three-month annualized basis and the split between Bitcoin and altcoin open interest, along with concentrated one-week and one-month liquidation pockets just below spot and above the recent range highs—context for why he prefers either reactive longs on a downside flush or fades into strength near $119k–$120k if derivatives chase the move. The framework leans heavily on acceptance/rejection around well-defined levels rather than attempting to front-run the policy outcome itself. Bottom line: in the Ostium playbook, bulls want a controlled dip that holds $112k on a daily closing basis and then forces a reclaim of $117.5k on the way to $119k–$123k; bears get their best shot if price runs late into $119k–$120k pre-FOMC and then loses $117.5k on the reaction. With BTC glued to the mid-$110ks and the market already bracing for a quarter-point cut, the catalyst may come down to Powell’s nuance. At press time, BTC traded at $115,427.

Symbiotic, Chainlink, And Lombard Team Up On Monday, staking protocol Symbiotic announced its partnership with decentralized oracle provider Chainlink and Bitcoin DeFi protocol Lombard to launch the industry’s first-of-its-kind guarantee layer for cross-chain Bitcoin transfers. The collaboration integrates Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to secure transfers of Lombard Staked Bitcoin (LBTC) across blockchains. Additionally, it introduces two new Symbiotic vaults, backed by a Symbiotic-powered monitoring network that verifies LBTC transfers via CCIP and issues alerts in case of discrepancies, the team detailed. One of the staking vaults will hold up to $100 million of Chainlink’s native token, LINK, while the other will have 20 million of Lombard’s upcoming native token, BARD. Notably, the Bitcoin DeFi protocol recently discussed the launch of its native token on X, stating, “Lombard is redefining how Bitcoin moves. At the core of this movement is BARD.” The protocol revealed that the tokenomics will be shared on September 16, while the airdrop and other participant allocation claims will take place on September 18. The integration will introduce immediate token utility for BARD holders, the announcement explained, by enabling staking into the vault via the Lombard App to secure cross-chain LBTC transfers while earning up to 15% APY. Moreover, Symbiotic’s modular architecture will allow Lombard and partners to dynamically customize protection levels, with value transferred and no disruption to ongoing operations, “positioning this model as foundational infrastructure for the next generation of cross-chain DeFi security.” ‘A New Standard’ For Cross-Chain Bitcoin Transfers According to the statement, the integration will deliver a “dual-layer protection system that scales with demand while setting a new standard for cross-chain Bitcoin derivatives” by combining Symbiotic’s permissionless restaking, CCIP’s modular security, and Lombard’s Bitcoin infrastructure . This collaboration not only reinforces LBTC’s position as the leading institutional-grade, yield-bearing Bitcoin asset trusted by top DeFi protocols, but also establishes a replicable framework for securing broader DeFi infrastructure such as oracles and settlement layers, creating systemic resilience that strengthens with network growth. Misha Putiatin, Symbiotic’s co-founder, affirmed that the protocol “turns passive crypto assets into modular, active security infrastructure,” adding that “Integrating our restaking framework with Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain LBTC transfers showcases how decentralized collateral can be deployed quickly and permissionlessly to reinforce cross-chain value flows and deliver tangible benefits to end users.” Meanwhile, Jacob Phillips, Lombard’s Co-founder, highlighted that LBTC is “a chain asset, meeting demand across networks rather than being confined to one.” He noted that holders seek the freedom to move their Bitcoin wherever the best opportunities are, but without compromising security. To address that, Phillips explained that “pairing CCIP’s modular architecture with Symbiotic’s restaked collateral gives our community stronger economic guarantees through staking. Each BARD staked reinforces the robustness of LBTC, aligning incentives and strengthening the integrity of our interoperability stack.”",Crypto News|bard|Bitcoin Transfers|btc|BTCUSDT|chainlink|cross-chain Bitcoin transfers|DeFi Bitcoin Protocol|Guarantee layer|LBTC|LINK|Lombard|Staking protocol|Symbiotic,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|LINK|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 02:00:40

This isn’t just another discussion; it’s a significant opportunity for the industry to directly engage with lawmakers shaping its future. Why This US Senate Crypto Meeting Holds Immense Importance Tomorrow morning, as reported by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, citing multiple sources, this high-stakes US Senate crypto meeting will commence. It brings together key players from both sides: innovative crypto executives and influential U.S. senators. The stakes are incredibly high, as the outcomes could dictate the regulatory landscape for digital assets for years to come. For too long, the crypto industry has grappled with regulatory uncertainty. Different agencies often have conflicting views, leading to a patchwork of rules that makes innovation and compliance challenging. This direct engagement offers a chance for clarity and a more unified approach. Key Discussion Points at the US Senate Crypto Meeting The agenda for this pivotal US Senate crypto meeting is packed with critical topics that have long been at the forefront of regulatory debates. These discussions are expected to delve into the fundamental nature of digital assets and how they should be classified under existing law. Classifying Securities and Commodities: A major point of contention has been whether specific cryptocurrencies should be treated as securities, subject to SEC oversight, or as commodities, falling under the CFTC’s purview. Clear definitions are essential for market participants. The Treatment of DeFi: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) presents a unique challenge due to its permissionless and often anonymous nature. Lawmakers are keen to understand how to regulate DeFi to protect consumers without stifling its innovative potential. Other Key Issues: Broader discussions will likely include stablecoin regulation, anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, and consumer protection frameworks. These conversations are not merely academic; they have real-world implications for how crypto businesses operate, how investors participate, and how the U.S. positions itself as a leader in financial innovation. Challenges and Opportunities Arising from the US Senate Crypto Meeting While the prospect of clearer regulation is exciting, this US Senate crypto meeting also highlights significant challenges. The crypto industry often operates on principles of decentralization and open access, which can clash with traditional regulatory models designed for centralized financial institutions. Challenges: Divergent Perspectives: Bridging the gap between the rapid pace of technological innovation and the often slow, deliberate process of legislative action is a monumental task. Risk of Over-Regulation: There is always a concern that overly stringent regulations could stifle innovation, pushing development offshore and limiting the U.S.’s competitive edge in the digital asset space. Opportunities: Enhanced Consumer Protection: A well-defined regulatory framework can build trust among mainstream investors, encouraging wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Market Stability: Clear rules can lead to more stable markets, attracting institutional capital and fostering greater confidence in the asset class. Innovation with Guardrails: Thoughtful regulation can provide the necessary guardrails for innovation to flourish responsibly, ensuring that new technologies serve the public good. The dialogue at this meeting is crucial for finding a balanced approach that protects consumers and financial stability while also fostering innovation. What’s Next After the US Senate Crypto Meeting? The immediate outcome of this US Senate crypto meeting might not be new legislation, but rather a deeper understanding and a pathway forward. These discussions are often the first step in a longer process of policy formulation. We can expect to see further hearings, white papers, and potentially draft legislation emerging in the coming months. For crypto firms, the actionable insight is clear: continued engagement with policymakers is vital. Staying informed and prepared for potential regulatory shifts will be key to navigating the evolving landscape. For investors, these developments signal a maturing industry, albeit one still finding its footing within established financial systems. This engagement between crypto leaders and U.S. senators is a testament to the growing influence and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. The outcomes of this US Senate crypto meeting will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of the industry, setting precedents for how innovation and regulation can coexist. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary purpose of the US Senate crypto meeting?

Investors in US spot ETH ETFs have just witnessed a notable shift, as these funds recorded net outflows, breaking a five-day streak of positive inflows. This sudden reversal has caught the attention of many, prompting questions about what might be driving this change and what it could mean for the broader Ethereum market. What Caused the Sudden Shift in US Spot ETH ETFs ? On September 16, a significant change occurred for US spot ETH ETFs . These investment vehicles collectively saw $61.84 million in net outflows. This figure, equivalent to approximately 85.4 billion Korean Won, marks a clear pivot from the trend observed over the preceding five trading days, which had all reported net inflows. The data, compiled by Trader T, highlights that not all funds experienced the same fate. The majority of the outflows were concentrated in two major players: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund experienced substantial outflows totaling $20.44 million. Fidelity’s FETH: Even larger outflows were recorded here, amounting to $48.15 million. Interestingly, one fund managed to buck the trend. Bitwise’s ETHW actually recorded net inflows, adding $6.75 million to its holdings on the same day. This mixed performance suggests a nuanced market environment rather than a uniform bearish sentiment across all US spot ETH ETFs . Why Do US Spot ETH ETFs Outflows Matter? The shift from inflows to outflows in US spot ETH ETFs is more than just a daily statistic; it can signal evolving investor sentiment. For five consecutive days, capital had been flowing into these Ethereum-backed exchange-traded funds, indicating growing institutional and retail interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. However, this recent outflow could suggest several possibilities: Profit-Taking: After a period of potential price appreciation, some investors might be cashing out to secure profits. Market Reassessment: Investors might be re-evaluating their positions in response to broader economic news, regulatory updates, or changes in the overall crypto market outlook. Short-Term Volatility: It could simply be a natural fluctuation in a highly dynamic market, where daily flows can swing significantly based on various factors. Understanding these movements is crucial because ETFs often act as a barometer for institutional adoption and broader market confidence. When major funds like BlackRock and Fidelity see outflows, it can influence market perception, even if it’s a short-term phenomenon. Navigating the Volatility: Insights for US Spot ETH ETFs Investors For those invested in or considering US spot ETH ETFs , such daily fluctuations are a reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. While a single day of outflows doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend, it does highlight the importance of staying informed and adopting a strategic approach. What should investors consider in light of these developments? Long-Term Perspective: Daily flows can be noisy. A long-term investment thesis for Ethereum and its ecosystem should ideally not be swayed by short-term movements. Diversification: As with any investment, diversifying your portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with specific assets or funds. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on broader market news, macroeconomic indicators, and regulatory changes that could impact the cryptocurrency space and, by extension, US spot ETH ETFs . The fact that Bitwise’s ETHW still saw inflows suggests that investor sentiment isn’t uniformly negative. Some investors might be shifting funds between different ETF providers, or new capital is entering certain funds while existing capital exits others. This dynamic interplay is typical of maturing markets. The recent net outflows from US spot ETH ETFs , ending a positive five-day streak, serve as a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH experienced significant withdrawals, Bitwise’s ETHW managed to attract new capital. This mixed picture underscores that market sentiment is complex and influenced by various factors, from profit-taking to broader economic considerations. For investors, these movements highlight the importance of a well-informed, long-term strategy, rather than reacting to every daily fluctuation. The journey of institutional adoption for Ethereum is still unfolding, and these ETFs will continue to be a key indicator of its progress. Frequently Asked Questions About US Spot ETH ETFs Here are some common questions regarding the recent performance and broader implications of US spot ETH ETFs. Q: What is a US spot ETH ETF? A: A US spot ETH ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Q: Why did US spot ETH ETFs see outflows after five days of inflows? A: The shift to outflows on September 16 could be due to several factors, including investors taking profits after a period of positive performance, a broader market reassessment influenced by economic news, or simply short-term market volatility. It indicates a change in immediate investor sentiment. Q: How do these outflows impact the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A: While direct causation is complex, significant outflows from US spot ETH ETFs can contribute to negative market sentiment, potentially putting downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. However, the overall impact depends on many other market factors and the scale of the outflows relative to the total market cap. Q: Are all US spot ETH ETFs experiencing the same trend? A: Not necessarily. As seen on September 16, while BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH experienced outflows, Bitwise’s ETHW recorded net inflows. This suggests that investor activity can vary across different funds, possibly due to fund-specific strategies, fees, or investor preferences. Q: Should investors be concerned about these outflows? A: A single day of outflows doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term problem. Investors should view these movements within a broader context, considering their own investment goals and risk tolerance. It’s crucial to focus on long-term trends and fundamental analysis rather than reacting to daily fluctuations. Found this analysis of US spot ETH ETFs insightful?

51853108,https://invezz.com/?p=2884808,1758075973,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Best crypto that should be in your portfolio, a utility token to explode 300x faster than SHIB did in 2021",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/17/best-crypto-that-should-be-in-your-portfolio-a-utility-token-to-explode-300x-faster-than-shib-did-in-2021/,"When meme coins were all the rage in 2021, SHIB’s meteoric rise, which saw it rise more than 300 times in only a few months, was one of the most talked-about tales. That surge was all hype, thanks to memes and commotion on social media. But the surge didn’t have any genuine use behind it, which is why traders frequently wonder what is going on with crypto now that might lead to such big gains, but with real fundamentals. Analysts say that the solution clearly goes to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility token that is building up to provide a comparable multiplier but with better mechanisms, more reasons to use it, and more real-world use. From meme hype to utility growth The SHIB rally in 2021 was a strange event that was fueled by speculation. Investors got in because they thought other people would, but there were no built-in ways to keep demand going for a long time, so it was just a one-time thing on crypto charts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is building its token on an ecosystem that is meant to keep demand high. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized stablecoin that is linked to $1 at its core. This stablecoin will only be made from assets that are overcollateralized, like ETH, SOL, or AVAX. There will be rigorous regulations for issuing it, and accounts will be capped, and smart contracts will be used to enforce them. Decentralized governance will set the borrowing costs, which will change automatically to keep the peg stable. Liquidations will happen automatically, which will keep both lenders and borrowers secure, even if the price of crypto crashes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) loans on top of this stablecoin technology. People will be able to borrow stablecoins against meme tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. Others will be able to get P2C loans against blue-chip tokens and stablecoins. This makes it appealing to a wide range of people, bringing together both serious and speculative investors into one ecosystem. The disparity in results is obvious when you look at instances of investors. Someone who took part in Phase 1 and put up $5,000 when MUTM was worth $0.01 got 500,000 tokens. That bag is worth $17,500 by Phase 6, when the token is worth $0.035. That’s 3.5X what it was worth before the platform was began. If you follow that same path along the 300x path that experts expect, you will get $1.5 million. This shows how a utility-driven token can beat meme currency hype by combining genuine usage with growth potential. The goal of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is to be efficient as well. Transactions will be quicker and cheaper with Layer-2 integration than with typical Layer-1 blockchains. This will make it more appealing for use in the real world. When it first comes out, a beta version of the loan and stablecoin minting platform will already be active, which will create demand for MUTM right away as people start testing it. Presale momentum and credibility anchors The presale stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving along quickly. Phase 6 is now open, and tokens cost $0.035 each. More than $15.85 million has already been raised, and 40% of the supply has been sold to more than 16,350 investors. The price will go up by 15% to $0.040 once Phase 7 starts. This means that this is the last chance for investors to buy tokens at a discount before they are listed. These reduced entry locations provide traders the best opportunity to make money on crypto investments. The strategy for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stresses trust and responsibility. CertiK did an outside audit of the project and gave it a score of 90.00 on Token Scan and 79.00 on Skynet, which shows that the smart contracts are secure and the ecosystem is strong. There is a live bug bounty program with incentives ranging from $200 for minor bugs to $2,000 for major bugs. This ensures that security improvements will continue. In addition to this, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on that rewards people for becoming involved in the community and spreading the word. Phase 4 of the roadmap will provide multi-chain growth, which will turn Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into a cross-network DeFi ecosystem. Along with the token listing, a beta version of the platform will be released. This will provide rapid pressure on early users to employ the borrowing, lending, and stablecoin minting features. Final words SHIB’s rise in 2021 demonstrated how quickly retail speculation can impact markets, but it didn’t really do anything useful. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering both a token linked to a real DeFi ecosystem and a development path that experts think will lead to 300X quicker adoption than SHIB’s hype run. MUTM is pitching itself as the greatest cryptocurrency to add to your portfolio this year. It has already doubled the profits of early investors, has innovative lending mechanisms, and a solid roadmap supported by audits and incentives. If you’re trying to figure out where the next big wave in crypto will come from, don’t look at meme coins. Look at utility tokens that are based on adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is that coin. It has the potential for huge growth and a way to be around for a long time.

It’s the foundation of decentralized finance, NFTs, tokenization, and Layer 2 scaling solutions. But beyond the headlines and price charts, there are elements of Ethereum’s story that most investors overlook. These details explain why ETH continues to dominate attention heading into the next bull market, and why it remains a pillar of the digital asset ecosystem. At the same time, history shows that every bull run produces new stars alongside established giants. Just as Ethereum once emerged from obscurity to define an era, new projects are positioning themselves to do the same today. One name leading that charge is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a presale whose forecasts are drawing comparisons to early ETH and even PEPE’s meteoric rise. With projections of 15,500% ROI , it is being hailed as one of the most explosive early-stage breakouts in modern crypto history. Fact 1: Ethereum wasn’t always meant to be money Unlike Bitcoin, which was created purely as digital cash, Ethereum began life as a world computer , a programmable blockchain for decentralized applications. Vitalik Buterin and the early team weren’t focused on making ETH a currency, but on enabling smart contracts and self-executing code. This distinction explains why Ethereum evolved into the bedrock of DeFi and NFTs, while Bitcoin stayed closer to its “digital gold” narrative. Fact 2: The Ethereum Foundation holds less ETH than you think Despite its central role in Ethereum’s development, the Ethereum Foundation controls less than 0.3% of all ETH in circulation . That’s far less than many assume, reflecting a deliberate effort to keep the ecosystem decentralized. Most of Ethereum’s supply is distributed across exchanges, long-term holders, staking pools, and DeFi protocols. This distribution helps reduce concentration risks and gives the network resilience that extends beyond any single entity. Fact 3: Ethereum dominates tokenization experiments While headlines focus on NFTs and DeFi, Ethereum has quietly become the backbone of real-world asset tokenization . From bonds and treasuries to real estate and commodities, financial giants are piloting projects that run on Ethereum. BlackRock’s foray into tokenized funds, for example, leverages Ethereum infrastructure. This dominance positions ETH as more than just a crypto asset, it’s becoming part of global financial plumbing. Ethereum’s history shows how transformative early entries can be. Investors who backed ETH in its infancy saw astronomical returns as it evolved into a pillar of crypto. Today, some analysts argue MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a similar asymmetry. Forecasts of 15,500% ROI have already put it in a league of its own. Unlike many presales, it has legitimacy through HashEx and CertiK audits , scarcity-driven tokenomics, and viral cultural branding. Demand is so intense that presale allocations are selling out within hours. The PATRIOT50X bonus code is adding fuel, giving early participants 50% more tokens and deepening the sense of urgency. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its dual-threat identity : meme energy that spreads fast across Telegram and X, paired with smart tokenomics designed to sustain momentum. For traders who missed early ETH or PEPE, the narrative is clear, this feels like a second-chance lottery ticket in the middle of a bull market. The fact that it’s even being compared to institutional favorites is creating a powerful narrative that this presale could defy every expectation. Fact 4: Ethereum’s energy use dropped by 99% The shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake during the 2022 Merge was one of the biggest technical upgrades in blockchain history. The result was a 99% reduction in energy consumption , instantly changing Ethereum’s environmental footprint. This move also positioned ETH more favorably with regulators and institutions increasingly sensitive to sustainability metrics. It is no exaggeration to say that the Merge preserved Ethereum’s long-term viability in an ESG-focused financial landscape. Fact 5: ETH supply can actually shrink Unlike Bitcoin’s strictly capped 21 million coins, Ethereum’s supply is dynamic. With EIP-1559 (implemented in 2021), every transaction burns a portion of ETH. Combined with proof-of-stake rewards, this mechanism means Ethereum can sometimes experience net negative issuance , in other words, its supply can contract over time. This “ultrasound money” narrative is one reason analysts remain bullish on ETH’s long-term price trajectory. Why timing matters now The crypto market is in a delicate balance. Bitcoin is consolidating, Ethereum is quietly strengthening its fundamentals, and liquidity expectations are rising as central banks prepare to ease policy. These are the conditions that often set the stage for altcoin breakouts. In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum is timely. It is capturing the exact moment when retail investors are hunting for high-upside plays, while whales are allocating to presales with structural credibility. This combination of timing, scarcity, and legitimacy explains why so many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the defining presale of 2025. Conclusion Ethereum remains the backbone of the crypto ecosystem, with hidden facts that highlight its strength: a programmable origin story, decentralized supply, massive energy savings, potential for deflation, and leadership in tokenization. But every bull cycle also brings new names into the spotlight. Right now, that spotlight is firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE . With forecasts of 15,500% ROI , a shrinking presale supply, and cultural branding that spreads like wildfire, it has already separated itself from the crowd. For traders looking to combine the lessons of Ethereum’s early days with the urgency of today’s market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be more than a presale, it could be the breakout story of the cycle.

Whales and institutions tend to stick with well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but regular investors looking for big gains are starting to look elsewhere. Safe options are all over the news, but there are also chances with asymmetric upside that are hidden among the rising prices of cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most talked-about names right now. It’s a DeFi project that experts think will provide them a 250x return on their investment. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional trust, retail limits People still think of Bitcoin (BTC) as the main currency in the crypto realm. Whales are buying more BTC to protect themselves from traditional markets. The market trusts it so highly that it is worth $4.0 trillion. It is also the most stable asset for anyone who wants to invest in crypto because it is like digital gold. This reliability is good for people who want to hang on to their investments for a long time, but it’s not good for retail investors who want to make a lot of money quickly. Most crypto predictions say that Bitcoin (BTC) will rise by 2x to 3x, which is a lot for its market size. That is strong by traditional measures, but when you look at crypto charts with tokens that are worth double or triple digits, Bitcoin (BTC) doesn’t have much room to grow. Institutions will still like BTC, but its ceiling makes it less appealing to individual investors with ambitious plans. Ethereum (ETH): DeFi backbone, but growth constrained Ethereum (ETH) is just as important. It has formed the backbone of DeFi, smart contracts, and tokenization projects run by big institutions. With a market valuation of more than $540 billion, it stands for confidence and stability in the crypto ecosystem as a whole. ETH is more than simply a money; it’s the base for many apps that are created on it. But this same strength makes it hard for it to give very high returns. Ethereum (ETH) will still be the most important cryptocurrency for investors, but its current value means that a 3x to 4x growth is the most likely outcome. That makes ETH popular with institutions, but it can’t give the uneven growth that lesser altcoins can. For individual investors, ETH’s story is one of dependability, not quick growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The altcoin for asymmetric growth This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. MUTM is still in presale, unlike BTC or ETH. This gives investors the option to buy into a project with huge potential before it becomes live on exchanges. The price is now $0.035 in Phase 6. 40% of the tokens have already been sold, $15.85 million has been raised, and more than 16,350 people are holding them. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% increase that makes people who are thinking about investing in crypto right now feel like they need to act quickly. MUTM is different from other altcoins that are just for speculation because it has real-world uses. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a loan and borrowing system that lets people get cash without having to liquidate their possessions. For instance, an investor who puts $10,000 worth of ETH into a P2C lending account can borrow $5,000 in USDC at a 50% loan-to-value ratio. This lets them preserve their ETH exposure while still getting access to cash. In P2P lending, you can even employ assets like DOGE or PEPE. This makes lending markets riskier while keeping the system safe. Staking mtTokens is another important feature. People who stake mtTokens will get MUTM rewards through a system that lets them buy and sell them. The platform will utilize the money it makes to purchase back MUTM tokens from the market and provide them to people who invest them. This keeps the buy side busy all the time and ties the performance of the platform directly to the rewards for investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have an even bigger edge if it runs on Layer-2. Lower transaction prices and faster speeds will make more people want to utilize the service, which will lead to more overall value locked. Every new transaction, whether it’s a loan, a repayment, or a liquidation, makes money that goes into the MUTM ecosystem. The roadmap for the future is just as big. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its beta version and offer it on exchanges. It will also work to get its stablecoin launched at the time of exchange listing. The goal of each milestone is to encourage people to use the service and reward those who use it for a long time. Conclusion You can already see the upside. In Phase 1, a $10,000 entry is worth $35,000 today in Phase 6. At $2 per token, that same amount of money will be worth $570,000, and at $3, it will be worth $855,000. This is exactly why experts say that MUTM has the potential for a 250x return on investment (ROI), which is not attainable with BTC or ETH at their current prices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the kind of opportunity that can make early investors very rich. Whales and banks still trust Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but retail investors seeking for the next big thing will find MUTM to be the best solution to the issue of what are the best cryptos to buy right now.

ETH is the foundation of decentralized apps, and SOL is known for being fast and able to grow. Both have established themselves as leaders in their fields, but their development has slowed down since their early years. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. It’s a penny altcoin that is still in presale and was created with the same goal of getting people to use it in the real world. Analysts think that it has the momentum and structure to provide investors a speedy 23x return on investment. This mix of usefulness and huge potential makes it stand out from other large-cap possibilities for traders looking at the crypto fear and greed index. Building utility with speed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) doesn’t want to compete with ETH or SOL on heritage. Instead, it is working on a new system where utility is directly tied to token demand and investor incentives. It has a stablecoin that is worth $1 and can only be created using assets that are worth more than they are worth, including ETH, SOL, and AVAX. Unlike initiatives that are based on hype, issuance is tightly managed by authorized accounts with set restrictions. This keeps things stable and secure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized governance will set borrowing rates and change them as needed to maintain crypto values in line with the peg. Liquidation procedures will immediately kick in to defend the system, keeping both lenders and borrowers safe. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers more than just collateralized lending. It also offers P2C lending, which lets users borrow stablecoins against blue-chip tokens and stablecoins themselves, as well as P2P financing for meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. This makes it easier for a lot of different types of users, from high-cap traders to speculative groups, to become involved. This increases the flow of liquidity in the ecosystem. A sample of an early Phase 5 investor illustrates how rapidly profits are growing. A $10,000 investment in crypto at $0.03 got you 330,000 tokens. In Phase 6, those tokens are valued $11,700, which is already a 16% increase before they ever hit the markets. That identical bag will increase to more than $230,000 if the estimated 23x ROI projection holds true. Neither ETH nor SOL can now deliver this kind of growth since their markets are already well-established. This is sped up even more by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s staking strategy. People who own mtTokens will be able to stake them in certain contracts and get MUTM payouts. The platform will utilize the money it makes to purchase back MUTM tokens on the open market, and the benefits will go straight to mtToken stakers. This cycle of buying and distributing puts ongoing pressure on buyers and rewards long-term users. Presale momentum, risk controls, and trust anchors The buzz surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale indicates how rapidly people are getting on board. Phase 6 is now live at $0.035. It has raised more than $15.85 million, sold more than 40% of its tokens, and has more than 16,350 holders. The presale price will go up 15% in Phase 7 to $0.040, which shows how important it is for investors to act quickly if they want to get in before the discount window expires. For anybody keeping an eye on crypto investing trends, getting in early at this point gives you the best chance to make big profits before the coins are listed on exchanges. The project’s comprehensive risk management structure makes this momentum even stronger. Stable interest rates will be dynamically managed to maintain the $1 peg. Collateral efficiency ensures that positions are overcollateralized, and limited collateralization lowers systemic risk. Liquidation triggers are automatic; thus, they work even in unstable markets. These structural features make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reliable for big investors while still giving penny coin returns. From the beginning, credibility has also been a big issue. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was audited by CertiK and got a score of 90.00 on Token Scan and 79.00 on Skynet, which are both good signs of security. A $50,000 bug bounty program has been set up to back this up. Rewards range from $200 for small bugs to $2,000 for major bugs. There is also a $100,000 giveaway going on right now, which is raising awareness and encouraging more people to become involved in the community during the presale phase. Conclusion ETH and SOL laid the groundwork for blockchain adoption based on usefulness. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that a new cent token can do the same thing, but much quicker. Stablecoin-backed lending, P2C and P2P mechanisms, mtToken staking and buybacks, and a presale that has already given double-digit profits are all examples of how it is producing both practical application and rapid development. MUTM is a unique opportunity for traders looking for the next big thing since it has both usefulness and a clear 23x ROI path. ETH and SOL showed what utility currencies can do. MUTM is the finest new crypto investment opportunity right now since it combines usefulness and speed in the crypto pricing tale.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-investors-xrp-looks-strong-for-the-day-heres-why/,"Crypto enthusiast Gonzo shared an update on XRP’s technical setup, noting that the asset displayed strength during the day’s trading. In his words, “$XRP looks strong for the day. It broke the trend line with a re-test of the outside, while holding the 50% level and holding the 50 SMA.” His post was accompanied by a chart illustrating the recent price action, trend structure, and Fibonacci retracement levels. $XRP looks strong for the day. It broke the trend line with a re-test of the outside, while holding the 50% level and holding the 50 SMA. pic.twitter.com/IhJY0CRsMS — Gonzo (@gonzo_3t) September 16, 2025 Breakout and Re-Test of the Trend Line The chart shows that XRP is trading just above the $3.00 level, closing near $3.0454 at the time of capture. A descending trend line that had contained price action for several weeks was recently broken, with XRP moving above it and then returning to re-test the breakout area. This re-test was held, which is the basis for Gonzo’s description of strength. Fibonacci Levels and the 50 SMA as Support In addition to the breakout, the chart highlights the importance of the 50% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). The 50% retracement is placed at $2.9415, while the 0.382 level sits just above at $2.9993. Both of these align with the moving average zone, providing a technical support range between $2.94 and $3.00. Gonzo pointed out that XRP held this zone while maintaining support on the 50 SMA, adding weight to the view that the breakout has been confirmed. Resistance and Support Levels Ahead Upside levels visible on the chart include resistance near $3.1865, with a further marker positioned higher at $3.3924. On the downside, the chart identifies a lower support zone around $2.6965. These price points indicate the next technical areas traders may watch should XRP either extend its move upward or face renewed selling pressure.

The emphasis is on the combination of the trend line break, the re-test that successfully held, and the continued support provided by the Fibonacci levels and the moving average. XRP’s price structure presently reflects a technical recovery from earlier declines, with the $3.00 zone acting as the immediate reference point for strength. Gonzo’s update suggests that as long as this zone remains intact, the outlook for the day favors stability above the breakout level, with attention shifting to resistance levels above.

The digital asset has officially reclaimed its coveted position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, successfully surpassing Solana (SOL). This dynamic shift highlights the intense competition and constant flux characterizing the top tiers of the crypto world, where the BNB market cap continues to be a key indicator of its strength. Understanding the Recent BNB Market Cap Shift The race for the fifth spot has been particularly captivating this month, with BNB and Solana frequently exchanging positions. This ongoing rivalry keeps investors and enthusiasts on the edge of their seats, watching every movement. According to recent data from CoinMarketCap, the BNB market cap impressively reached approximately $133.4 billion. This figure comfortably placed it ahead of Solana’s market capitalization, which stood at around $128.3 billion. Such significant numbers underscore the immense value and investor confidence associated with these leading digital assets. Currently, BNB is trading at $958.84, reflecting a robust 4.02% increase. In contrast, Solana is priced at $236.41, showing a more modest 0.84% gain. These price movements are crucial in determining the overall BNB market cap and its competitive standing. What’s Driving the BNB Market Cap Momentum? Several factors likely contribute to BNB’s recent surge and its ability to reclaim a higher ranking. The BNB Chain ecosystem continues to expand, fostering new decentralized applications (dApps) and projects that drive demand for the native token. Furthermore, investor sentiment often plays a significant role in market movements. An overseas media outlet recently reported that the return of Binance co-founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), appears to be imminent. While the exact timing and nature of his return are speculative, such news can generate considerable buzz and positively influence the perception of BNB, potentially boosting the BNB market cap . The utility of BNB within the Binance ecosystem, including trading fee discounts, participation in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and use in various DeFi protocols, consistently adds to its value proposition. This intrinsic utility provides a strong foundation for its market performance. BNB vs. Solana: A Dynamic Rivalry in Market Cap The competition between BNB and Solana is more than just a battle for market capitalization; it represents a clash of innovative blockchain ecosystems. Both platforms offer distinct advantages and attract different segments of the crypto community. BNB Chain: Known for its high transaction throughput and lower fees, it appeals to a broad base of users and developers. Its strong connection to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, provides unparalleled liquidity and user access. Solana: Celebrated for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and scalability, Solana has carved out a niche, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, often referred to as an ‘Ethereum killer.’ This back-and-forth in the rankings demonstrates the dynamic nature of the crypto market. It also highlights how quickly fortunes can change based on development updates, investor sentiment, and broader market trends affecting the BNB market cap and Solana’s standing. Navigating the Volatility: What Investors Should Consider For investors, understanding these market dynamics is paramount. While BNB’s recent performance is impressive, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile. Rankings can shift, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. It is always advisable to conduct thorough research and consider various factors beyond just market cap. Look into the project’s fundamentals, its development roadmap, community support, and the overall macroeconomic environment. Diversification across different assets can also help mitigate risks in such a fast-moving space. The continuous evolution of the BNB market cap and other major cryptocurrencies requires a well-informed and cautious approach. BNB’s remarkable surge to reclaim the fifth spot by market capitalization over Solana underscores its enduring strength and the vibrant, competitive spirit of the crypto market. While the immediate catalyst appears to be strong investor interest and possibly news surrounding Changpeng Zhao, the underlying utility and ecosystem growth of BNB Chain are fundamental to its success. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the race among top digital assets promises to remain an exciting spectacle for all involved. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is market capitalization in cryptocurrency? A: Market capitalization, or market cap, is the total value of all coins that have been mined or are in circulation. It’s calculated by multiplying the current price of a single coin by the total number of coins in circulation. It helps gauge an asset’s size and relative dominance. Q2: Why is the BNB market cap significant? A: The BNB market cap is significant because it reflects the overall value and investor confidence in the BNB ecosystem. A higher market cap typically indicates greater stability, liquidity, and broader adoption of the token and its underlying blockchain. Q3: What are the main differences between BNB and Solana? A: BNB (Binance Coin) is the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain, closely tied to the Binance exchange, offering utility for trading fees, staking, and dApps. Solana is a separate blockchain known for its high transaction speeds and scalability, popular for DeFi and NFTs. Q4: How does news about Changpeng Zhao (CZ) affect BNB? A: As the co-founder and former CEO of Binance, CZ’s activities and potential return can significantly influence investor sentiment towards Binance and, by extension, BNB. Positive news or developments related to him often lead to increased interest and a potential boost in the BNB market cap . Q5: Will BNB maintain its 5th market cap ranking? A: The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic. While BNB has reclaimed its position, rankings are fluid. Continuous development, market trends, and investor sentiment will determine if BNB can maintain its spot or if Solana, or another asset, will challenge it again.

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to make headlines, yet volatility around key price levels is seeing traders seek alternatives. Newer projects like Remittix, meanwhile, are attracting attention for their blend of utility, security and rapid presale momentum. The gap between legacy giants and disruptive newcomers opens the door to what could be a trend-setting narrative in 2025. Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Trends and Market Shifts The Bitcoin Price recently made an attempt at a major resistance level at $116,000 prior to rejection, trading at $114,703.81, 0.71% lower on the day. Ethereum also followed lower, dropping to $4,495.08, 2.13% lower on the day. Trading volumes for both assets, in spite of the drops, remain high, reflecting strong investor interest. The rejection of Bitcoin at resistance suggests near-term selling pressure, while Ethereum whales moving funds between wallets suggest a shift in strategy, possibly into promising presales like Remittix. Remittix: Presale That Is Luring Ethereum Whales Remittix (RTX) is a cross-chain DeFi solution for global remittances. The $0.1080 token has already raised $25,8 million and sold over 664 million tokens in presale. Remittix’s selling point is its focus on real-world use cases: direct crypto-to-bank transfer, decentralized exchange integration and wallet features currently in beta testing. The team has revealed upcoming listings on BitMart and LBANK, large centralised exchanges that will provide instant liquidity. The roadmap has placed RTX among the best crypto presale 2025 potentials, with Ethereum investors turning to early stage crypto investments. Learn more at Remittix.io. Security, Community and Growth One of the biggest confidence boosters was when Remittix team got verified by CertiK and ranked #1 pre-launch token on CertiK Skynet. The ranking demonstrates the security and transparency of the project something that is typically missing in the launch of new crypto tokens. Alongside its technical development, Remittix has also initiated a $250,000 giveaway and 15% USDT referral program, allowing early users to earn while they spur adoption. All these, along with strong presale momentum, are pointers to why Remittix is rapidly becoming one of the fastest growing crypto 2025 tokens. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction $25,8 Million+ raised and 664 Million+ tokens sold Verified by CertiK, #1 ranked pre-launch project Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBANK Real-world focus on crypto-to-bank payments Looking Ahead As Bitcoin Price struggles at resistance and Ethereum whales diversify, the focus on up-and-coming crypto projects intensifies. Remittix stands out not just as a top crypto under $1, but as a crypto solving real-world problems with transparent FX conversions, low fees and cross-chain capabilities.

Bitcoin Bull Score Index Is Back In Neutral Region In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno has talked about the latest trend in the analytics firm’s Bull Score Index. This indicator basically tells us about which phase of the market Bitcoin is in right now. The index combines the data of several key on-chain metrics to determine its value. Some of these indicators include the Market Value to Realized Cap (MVRV) Ratio, keeping track of average investor profitability on the network, and the Stablecoin Liquidity, measuring the amount of capital stored in the form of fiat-tied tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows In Last 1.5 Years Surpassed First 15 Years Combined: Data When the Bull Score Index has a value of 60 or higher, it means the majority of the underlying metrics are currently giving a bullish signal. On the other hand, the metric’s value being 40 or lower implies BTC is in a bear phase according to its indicators. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Bull Score Index over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Bull Score Index was sitting at a low of just 20 four days ago, but since then, its value has witnessed a sharp climb to the 50 level. This means that on-chain metrics are signaling neutral market conditions for the asset now. This shift comes just as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. BTC price itself has taken to sideways movement ahead of it, indicating that the market is divided about the event’s outcome. Analytics firm Santiment has shared in an X post about how social media users are reacting to the meeting. In the chart, Santiment has attached the data of the “Positive/Negative Sentiment,” an indicator that compares the bullish and bearish posts related to Bitcoin that are appearing on the major social media platforms. This metric has surged recently and hit the 1.77 mark, suggesting that there are 1.77 positive comments being made for every negative comment related to the cryptocurrency. This is the most bullish that retail traders have been on social media in around 10 weeks.

Upcoming XRP and Dogecoin ETFs Boost Optimism The XRP ETF (ticker: XRPR) and Dogecoin ETF (ticker: DOJE) are expected to debut within days, with Dogecoin’s listing scheduled for Thursday and XRP’s by Friday. This will be the first U.S. ETF for Dogecoin, providing traditional investors with access to the meme coin without the need for wallets or direct token ownership. For XRP, the launch signifies a milestone as it becomes the first major altcoin ETF after Ethereum to gain entry into U.S. markets. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas highlighted that the XRP fund will combine direct holdings of the token with exposure to other global spot ETFs. Meanwhile, James Seyffart noted that over 90 additional crypto ETF applications are currently awaiting SEC review, including those tied to Litecoin and Avalanche. What It Means for Altcoin Investors The arrival of XRP and Dogecoin ETFs signals growing institutional acceptance of altcoins, moving beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts believe these products could attract billions in inflows from retirement funds, brokerage platforms, and traditional investment accounts. For Dogecoin , the ETF marks a leap from meme culture into mainstream finance. Already, DOGE has seen price momentum around $0.26–$0.28, with whales accumulating heavily ahead of the launch. Some technical analysts argue Dogecoin is finalizing a bullish chart pattern that could push its price toward $0.35, $0.45, and even $1 if momentum holds. XRP , on the other hand, is positioned as a utility-driven altcoin with strong liquidity. Its ETF could accelerate inflows into Ripple’s ecosystem, especially if paired with dovish global monetary policies in the coming weeks. Broader Market Impact The timing of these ETF launches coincides with key central bank meetings. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, while the Bank of England and Bank of Japan will announce decisions within days. Analysts suggest that if multiple central banks coordinate easing, the result could spark a mega altseason, driving Bitcoin past $120,000 and Ethereum beyond resistance levels. For investors, the message is clear: XRP and Dogecoin ETFs are not just symbolic victories; they could transform altcoin adoption in traditional finance. Now we wait and see what may unfold over the next ten days.

This move will advance Meta’s augmented reality plans while the company is under scrutiny over social media protections for children. At the two-day event at Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Zuckerberg plans to introduce the company’s first commercially viable eyewear with a screen. Analysts expect the device to debut for about 800 US dollars. Internally, the project has been known as “Hypernova,” and the product is expected to reach the market as “Celeste.” The launch would extend Meta’s bid to keep pace in AI-powered hardware against rivals like OpenAI and Alphabet’s Google, though analysts say the price could weigh on demand. The glasses are expected to be far less advanced than “Orion,” a prototype highlighted at last year’s Connect, which Zuckerberg described as “the time machine to the future.” Orion is slated for release in 2027. Meta’s AI smart glasses glasses raise concerns about child safety Meta sells two AI-enabled eyewear lines built with Oakley and Ray-Ban. Those products offer cameras, voice-driven control, and the ability to livestream to Instagram and Facebook. Zuckerberg has directed over 60 billion US dollars since 2020 into the company’s AR divisiont. He has stated that smart glasses will be the main route to bring “superintelligence” into everyday life. In pursuit of AI leadership, he has also fueled an expensive talent contest by recruiting leading researchers from rival firm. Reuters reported that Meta’s artificial intelligence guidelines enabled chatbots to converse with children on topics such as race. Meta pushes ahead with new tech despite losses Along with the display-equipped glasses, Meta is expected to unveil a first-generation wristband that lets wearers control the eyewear using hand gestures. The company also plans to introduce a refreshed Ray-Ban line with better battery life and cameras and added AI features. Meta is one of the few big tech firms that progressed significantly in smart glasses, selling around 2 million pairs of the Ray-Ban model since 2023. According to CNBC the Hypernova glasses may carry Prada branding, since the Italian label’s wide frames can easily contain the electrical components. Even so, the expected price of $800 may be too much for most users, well above above the $299 starting price for the Ray-Ban line and $399 for the sport-focused Oakley glasses. Analysts estimate that the device could sell “a few hundred thousand units at most,” though the rollout could help attract more developers to build software around this new tech.

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with speculation surrounding Grayscale’s recent on-chain activities, suggesting a significant move towards future Grayscale ETH ETF staking . This development, highlighted by a prominent analyst, points to Grayscale potentially positioning itself for an innovative offering in the burgeoning Ethereum ETF landscape. For many investors, the prospect of combining the accessibility of an ETF with the yield-generating potential of staking represents an exciting evolution in digital asset investment. What Recent On-Chain Activity Signals About Grayscale’s Plans? According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, a notable transaction occurred recently that has sparked widespread discussion. Just hours ago, an address associated with the Grayscale ETH Mini Trust ETF executed a substantial transfer of Ethereum. Specifically, 214,400 ETH, valued at an impressive $967 million, was moved from this Grayscale address. These funds were then distributed across 67 newly created wallets, with each wallet receiving an identical allocation of 3,200 ETH. EmberCN’s analysis suggests a high probability that these meticulously divided funds are being prepared for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking. This strategic distribution indicates a methodical approach rather than a simple asset reallocation, strongly hinting at future operational readiness for Grayscale ETH ETF staking activities. Why is Grayscale Preparing for ETH Staking Now? The timing of Grayscale’s actions raises an intriguing question: why now? The analyst speculates that Grayscale might have received some form of advance information, prompting these preparatory steps. This could range from informal discussions with regulators to a strategic anticipation of future policy changes regarding spot ETH ETFs. Historically, market participants often make proactive moves when they foresee significant regulatory shifts. Grayscale’s apparent readiness for Grayscale ETH ETF staking could be a testament to their long-term vision for Ethereum-based investment products, aiming to be at the forefront once regulatory clarity emerges. Understanding the Appeal of Staking for ETH ETFs Staking is a fundamental component of the Ethereum blockchain’s security and operation, particularly since its transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. When you stake ETH, you essentially lock up your tokens to support the network’s validation process. In return, stakers earn rewards, typically paid in ETH. For an ETF, integrating staking offers several compelling advantages: Enhanced Returns: Staking rewards can provide an additional yield on the underlying ETH assets, potentially boosting the ETF’s overall performance. Increased Investor Interest: The ability to earn passive income from an ETF could attract a broader range of investors looking for yield in their crypto exposure. Network Participation: By staking, the ETF would actively contribute to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network, aligning with the ethos of the crypto community. The potential for Grayscale ETH ETF staking to generate extra value is a significant draw, differentiating it from traditional ETFs that simply track asset prices. The Regulatory Roadblock: Can US Spot ETH ETFs Stake? Despite the clear benefits, a major hurdle remains: the U.S. has not yet approved staking for spot ETH ETFs. This regulatory uncertainty is a critical factor. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, the approvals did not explicitly include provisions for staking the underlying ETH. The SEC’s stance on whether staking constitutes a security or falls under existing regulations for investment products is still evolving. This lack of explicit approval means that any preparations for Grayscale ETH ETF staking are currently speculative regarding their immediate implementation in the US market. However, Grayscale’s forward-thinking approach suggests they are either confident in future regulatory shifts or exploring all operational possibilities for their products. What This Means for the Ethereum Market and Investors If Grayscale ETH ETF staking eventually receives regulatory green light, the implications for the Ethereum market could be substantial. A large institutional player like Grayscale staking a significant amount of ETH would likely: Reduce Circulating Supply: More ETH locked in staking contracts could lead to a decrease in the available circulating supply, potentially impacting price dynamics. Increase Institutional Demand: The added yield from staking could make ETH ETFs even more attractive to institutional investors, driving further adoption. Strengthen Network Security: Greater participation from major entities in staking enhances the overall security and robustness of the Ethereum blockchain. For individual investors, this could mean access to a regulated product that offers both exposure to Ethereum’s price appreciation and the passive income potential of staking, all within a familiar investment vehicle. Grayscale’s reported preparations for Grayscale ETH ETF staking underscore a fascinating phase in the evolution of cryptocurrency investments. While regulatory approvals for staking within US spot ETH ETFs are still pending, these on-chain movements signal a proactive and strategic vision from a major player. As the regulatory landscape continues to unfold, the potential for yield-bearing ETH ETFs could redefine how traditional investors engage with the decentralized finance ecosystem, promising a future where innovation and traditional finance increasingly intertwine. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking? Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking is a mechanism where cryptocurrency holders lock up their tokens to help secure a blockchain network and validate transactions. In return for their participation, they earn rewards, typically in the form of new tokens. 2. Has the SEC approved staking for spot ETH ETFs in the US? No, while the SEC recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, the current approvals do not explicitly include provisions for staking the underlying ETH. The regulatory stance on this specific aspect is still under consideration. 3. What are the potential benefits of Grayscale ETH ETF staking? Potential benefits include enhanced returns for investors through staking rewards, increased investor interest due to passive income opportunities, and stronger network security for the Ethereum blockchain through greater institutional participation. 4. How much ETH did Grayscale transfer, according to the analyst? According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, a Grayscale ETH Mini Trust ETF address transferred 214,400 ETH, worth approximately $967 million, to 67 new wallets. 5. What could be the market impact if ETH ETF staking is approved? If approved, it could lead to a reduction in the circulating supply of ETH, increase institutional demand for Ethereum, and further strengthen the network’s security, potentially impacting ETH’s price dynamics and overall adoption.

In the case of XRP, one analyst has highlighted similarities between the 2017/2018 bull market and the current structure forming in 2025. The comparison suggests that XRP could be positioned for another substantial upward movement. Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent market analyst on X, posted a chart that compared XRP’s explosive rally in late 2017 to the ongoing cycle. Alongside the image, the analyst predicted that XRP holders are about to get mega-rich. All #XRP holders about to get MEGA RICH. Time to pay close attention! pic.twitter.com/4VwsU8Im7E — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 16, 2025 Lessons From the 2017/2018 Cycle The left side of the chart tracks XRP’s price action during the 2017/2018 cycle. At its peak, XRP achieved an extraordinary gain of over 40,000%. The rally took XRP from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $3.36 at the time, before a steep correction of approximately 74% followed, pulling the asset into a consolidation phase . That dramatic rise and subsequent decline remain one of the most notable moments in the asset’s market history. The highlighted data shows that XRP’s initial upward momentum was swift and intense, fueled by both retail and institutional interest. While the retracement was severe, the cycle established a precedent for how XRP behaves in a bull market. Analysts continue to use that cycle as a benchmark when evaluating XRP’s potential in new market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Current Trajectory On the right side of the chart, the analyst mapped the ongoing XRP cycle. According to the projection, XRP has already entered a growth phase, with the potential for gains reaching nearly 1,936% from current levels. The chart outlines a possible trajectory that could lift XRP’s price higher, with key levels extending above its all-time high of $3.65 and even pointing toward the $10 range. This perspective builds on the notion that, while XRP’s growth may not replicate the 40,000% of the 2017 cycle, the asset could still generate returns that stand out in the current market. The forecast reflects both the maturation of the cryptocurrency industry and XRP’s established position as a digital asset with ongoing demand from both institutions and retail investors. The chart positions XRP’s current cycle as one with meaningful upside potential. The direct comparison with the previous cycle highlights the belief that XRP continues to follow repeatable long-term patterns , and traders watching XRP may interpret these similarities as signs of another major rally approaching.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as South Korean exchange Bithumb announces its latest additions. These Bithumb crypto listings are set to bring two intriguing digital assets, Toshi (TOSHI) and Holoworld (HOLO), to its platform. Starting September 17th, traders will have the opportunity to engage with these new cryptocurrencies against the South Korean Won (KRW), opening fresh avenues for investment and portfolio diversification. This move underscores Bithumb’s commitment to expanding its offerings and catering to the dynamic interests of its user base. What’s Happening with These Bithumb Crypto Listings? Bithumb, a leading player in the South Korean crypto market, has officially confirmed the listing schedule. Toshi (TOSHI) trading will kick off first, becoming available at 6:00 a.m. UTC. Shortly after, Holoworld (HOLO) will join the fray, with its trading commencing at 7:00 a.m. UTC on the very same day. These back-to-back listings highlight a strategic push by the exchange to introduce promising new projects to its robust trading environment. For many investors, new Bithumb crypto listings represent significant opportunities to get in on the ground floor of potentially high-growth assets. Understanding the specifics of these listings is crucial for any trader. Both TOSHI and HOLO will be paired directly with the KRW, simplifying the trading process for local users. This direct pairing often leads to higher liquidity and more straightforward price discovery, which are beneficial factors for both seasoned traders and newcomers alike. Diving Deeper: Understanding Toshi (TOSHI) Toshi, often associated with the Base blockchain ecosystem, is a community-driven project that has garnered attention for its meme coin appeal and decentralized finance (DeFi) aspirations. Named after the cat of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, TOSHI aims to build a robust ecosystem around its token, focusing on utility and community engagement. While specific details on its long-term roadmap are still evolving, its presence on a major exchange like Bithumb suggests a growing recognition of its potential within the broader crypto landscape.

Why BullZilla Is the Best Crypto to Invest In Now,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/missed-bitcoin-why-bullzilla-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-now/,"The story of Bitcoin will forever be remembered as one of crypto’s most frustrating and exhilarating chapters. In 2009, a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper that barely caused a ripple beyond a small group of cypherpunks. At the time, a single Bitcoin was worth less than a cent. Skeptics dismissed it as “nerd money,” a fleeting internet experiment destined to fade. Yet as the years unfolded, Bitcoin defied every expectation. From pizza purchases at 10,000 BTC to its first big rally past $1,000, then a breathtaking surge to $20,000 in 2017 and a new all-time high above $69,000 in 2021, it transformed from a niche curiosity into digital gold. Early adopters turned pocket change into life-altering fortunes. Latecomers watched headlines scream about overnight millionaires, feeling the sting of missed opportunity. Stories of investors who once owned thousands of coins and sold too soon became cautionary legends. But crypto is nothing if not cyclical, and redemption is always just one bull run away. For every train you miss, another pulls into the station. Today, many see that fresh chance in the explosive rise of BullZilla , a new presale phenomenon capturing the same raw excitement Bitcoin once did. While no project can ever be “the next Bitcoin,” the lesson is clear: markets reward the bold and the early. Remembering the Missed Bitcoin Wave For many seasoned investors, the real lesson of Bitcoin isn’t just its meteoric price chart, it’s the power of conviction when everyone else doubts. Those who bought during the quiet bear markets, when headlines declared Bitcoin dead and friends scoffed, reaped the greatest rewards. That same dynamic drives today’s hunt for the next breakout project. BullZilla’s early presale stage echoes those early Bitcoin days: high risk, yes, but also high potential for those willing to research, commit, and hold through volatility. History shows that the crypto world rewards foresight far more than hesitation. BullZilla Presale: A Fresh Start for Investors The Bull Zilla Presale is the centerpiece of the top meme coin presale to buy now, attracting both retail and seasoned investors. The presale price sits at $0.00005908, with 26 B tokens sold and over 1,500 holders. Early participants have already locked in a staggering 8,822.49% ROI to the projected listing price of $0.00527. Another 11.27% price hike is expected as Stage 3B approaches. Investors see BullZilla as the best crypto to buy today, combining the virality of meme coins with tokenomics designed for sustainability. The promise of the BullZilla best crypto to invest is drawing whales who missed earlier mega-runs like Shiba Inu and PEPE. A unique Progressive Price Engine increases the presale price every 48 hours or after $100k raised, creating urgency. The Roar Burn Mechanism further reduces supply, helping long-term holders. Upcoming Stage 3B signals an 11.27% price surge, a major reason analysts call it the BullZilla best crypto to invest and one of the best crypto to buy today. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Set Up a Wallet: Install a Web3 wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Purchase ETH from exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site: Connect your wallet to the official BullZilla ($BZIL) presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL: Select the amount you want to invest and confirm. Your allocation is instantly secured and claimable once the presale ends. Why BullZilla Could Be the Best Crypto to Invest Meme coins live and die by their ability to capture attention, and BullZilla ($BZIL) is already proving it has the narrative strength to rise. Its presale momentum is fueled by rapid funding milestones, viral exposure, and a narrative of strength and power, something the meme coin crowd deeply resonates with. When you consider Bitcoin’s past and compare it with BullZilla’s trajectory, the similarities are clear: low entry pricing, strong branding, and an eager investor base. These are exactly the conditions that made Bitcoin skyrocket. That’s why many now label BullZilla as one of the top early-stage crypto Investments. Conclusion The harsh reality of crypto is that most only realize potential after the gains are gone. Bitcoin reminded everyone of that fact. But BullZilla offers a chance to apply those lessons, getting in early before mainstream hype arrives. This is the cycle that creates legends in the meme coin world: hesitation leads to regret, but decisive moves toward Early Presale Crypto projects can change lives. Investors who recognize this pattern may find BullZilla to be their moment of redemption. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) FAQs What is BullZilla? BullZilla is a meme coin currently in presale, raising over $350K so far, and is gaining attention as one of the best crypto to invest. Why is BullZilla compared to Bitcoin? Because many see it as a “second chance” after missing Bitcoin, with similar low entry pricing and hype potential. What stage is BullZilla Presale in? It’s currently in Stage 2C, priced at $0.00004575. How do I buy BullZilla? You’ll need Ethereum, connect your wallet to the presale site, and swap ETH for $BZIL tokens. Could BullZilla become the best crypto to invest Meme Coin? While nothing is guaranteed, early momentum and funding success suggest it has that potential. Summary Bitcoin created millionaires, but only for those who acted early. For everyone else, it was a bitter reminder of what hesitation costs. Now, with BullZilla gathering massive presale momentum, investors are being handed a second chance. With its organized presale, growing hype, and low entry point, BullZilla is quickly establishing itself as one of the best crypto to invest and a leading name among best crypto to invest.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the BTC price has officially soared past the remarkable $117,000 mark, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This significant movement, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, signals a vibrant period for the digital asset. As BTC price reaches this new high, many are asking: what’s fueling this incredible rally, and what does it mean for the future of crypto? What’s Driving This Monumental BTC Price Surge? This latest surge in the BTC price isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s often the result of several underlying market forces converging. Understanding these drivers can provide valuable context for investors navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Several factors typically contribute to such a powerful upward trajectory for the BTC price : Increased Institutional Adoption: Major corporations and investment funds are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, seeing it as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against inflation. Positive Macroeconomic Outlook: A generally optimistic global economic sentiment or specific policy decisions, like interest rate cuts, can push investors towards riskier, higher-growth assets such as Bitcoin. Technical Breakouts: Chart analysts often point to key resistance levels. When the BTC price breaks above a significant threshold, it can trigger a wave of buying activity from traders using technical indicators. Halving Cycle Influence: While not immediate, the long-term effects of Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, contribute to its scarcity and can drive up its value over time. Understanding the Significance of the $117,000 BTC Price Mark Reaching a BTC price of $117,000 is more than just a number; it carries substantial weight for market participants. For many, it represents a psychological victory and a reinforcement of Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. This milestone often leads to: Renewed Investor Confidence: A strong upward move can attract new investors and re-engage existing ones, fostering a positive feedback loop. Media Attention: Higher prices naturally draw more mainstream media coverage, further increasing public awareness and potentially bringing in more retail investors. Validation of Bitcoin’s Role: Each new high reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ and a viable alternative to traditional financial assets. As reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, the BTC price is actively trading at $117,000 on the Binance USDT market, indicating robust liquidity and active participation from a global investor base. Navigating the Market: What Should Investors Consider with the Current BTC Price? While the current surge in BTC price is undoubtedly exciting, it’s crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and informed decision-making is key. Here are some considerations for investors: Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Volatility can lead to rapid price swings, so understand your risk tolerance. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your investment strategy is geared towards short-term gains or long-term holding. Bitcoin’s history shows significant long-term appreciation despite short-term fluctuations. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio across different assets, not just cryptocurrencies, to mitigate overall risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic trends that can influence the BTC price . Resources like Bitcoin World provide valuable insights and timely updates. The incredible climb of the BTC price above $117,000 marks a significant moment in the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market.

The BTC price is influenced by a combination of factors including institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions (like inflation concerns or interest rate changes), regulatory news, technological advancements in the crypto space, and market sentiment.

Their current behavior could define the trajectory of the ongoing cycle. Repeat 2021-Style Cycle Top? In the 2021 cycle, long-term holders began their main distribution phase between November 2020 and March 2021. In the process, this cohort of BTC holders trimmed their supply by 13.5% just before Bitcoin’s April 2021 peak, which Michael Nadeau, founder of The DeFi Report, argues was the “true” cycle top. These coins were transferred to short-term holders (STHs) and introduced new liquidity into the market. However, LTHs soon re-accumulated, finishing the year with larger positions than they began with, which explains why the second top in November 2021 was relatively muted as it lacked the influx of new capital and was largely fueled by repositioning of existing holdings. Interestingly, the same structure is unfolding in the present cycle according to the latest findings by Nadeau. LTHs reduced their supply by 12.4% into what may have been the first “true” top earlier this year (in the first quarter Q1 2025). Since then, the re-accumulation trend has returned, which is quite similar to the post-April 2021 phase. Despite this, unlike in earlier cycles, the participation from short-term holders (STH) remains low, and there was minimal evidence of new money entering the market. Nadeau said that this muted demand could cap the strength of future rallies, echoing the two-top structure of 2021, where LTH behavior and time-driven holder transitions, rather than broad inflows, shaped late-cycle price action. BTC Market Remains Vulnerable Glassnode’s data also pointed in the same direction. The analytics platform found that despite modest signs of recovery, fragility lingers beneath the surface, which has left Bitcoin vulnerable if fresh demand fails to make a comeback. While the spot market momentum is strong enough to push RSI into overbought territory, conviction looks shallow, owing to flat volumes and weakening CVD, suggesting sellers continue pressing into strength. Futures markets reflected high activity, as evidenced by open interest and aggressive buy-side flows driving perpetual CVD higher, though softer funding highlighted reduced long demand and a more cautious outlook. Options markets told a similar story: open interest climbed, but volatility spreads narrowed and skew dropped sharply, which means less hedging and greater complacency, thereby increasing the risk of sharp reactions if volatility resurfaces. On-chain signals were mixed. BTC addresses trended toward cycle lows while transfer volumes rose, pointing to capital inflows without broader user growth. Fees declined, reflecting weak block space demand and muted speculative pressure. With profitability metrics improving, investors are broadly in profit, but increasing profit-taking hints at potential demand exhaustion.

Then you’ve likely noticed the buzz around Solana. The ecosystem is truly thriving, and recent reports highlight an incredible milestone: Solana app revenue has seen an explosive surge, reaching an impressive $190 million in August. This isn’t just a small bump; it represents a staggering 126% increase year-over-year, painting a vibrant picture of growth and innovation within the Solana network. Solana App Revenue: An Unprecedented Surge The latest figures from a Step Finance report reveal a remarkable story for Solana. Applications built on the high-performance blockchain generated $190 million in revenue during August alone. This significant jump clearly demonstrates the increasing utility and adoption of the Solana platform. Such substantial year-over-year growth signals strong underlying demand and a maturing ecosystem, solidifying Solana’s position in the competitive blockchain space. This impressive revenue isn’t spread thinly across thousands of apps. Instead, a concentrated effort from a few key players is driving the majority of this success. The report indicates that the top 10 applications are responsible for over 86.5% of the total revenue, showcasing the immense power and popularity of established and innovative platforms within the Solana sphere. This concentration suggests that while the ecosystem is growing, certain applications have found strong product-market fit. What’s Driving This Remarkable Solana App Revenue Growth? Understanding the catalysts behind this impressive Solana app revenue surge is crucial for anyone interested in the blockchain’s future. Several standout applications are leading the charge, each contributing significantly to the overall financial health of the ecosystem. Let’s look at the top performers and their impact: Axiom: This platform led the pack, bringing in a substantial $49.1 million. Axiom’s focus on innovative financial products and services, often involving structured products and yield generation, has clearly resonated with users seeking advanced DeFi opportunities. Its strong performance highlights the demand for sophisticated financial tools on Solana. pump.fun: Following closely, pump.fun contributed $41 million. This platform’s unique approach to enabling quick, fair, and decentralized token launches has attracted a significant user base, especially those interested in meme coins and community-driven projects. It proves the appeal of novel social and financial experimentation on Solana. Phantom: The popular self-custody wallet for Solana users secured $22.3 million. Phantom’s essential role in facilitating secure transactions, managing digital assets, and providing a seamless gateway to dApps underscores its critical importance to the entire ecosystem. Its revenue reflects widespread user adoption and trust in its services, directly impacting overall Solana app revenue . These applications, along with others in the top ten, highlight diverse use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to social applications and essential infrastructure. Their collective success underscores the versatility, robust nature, and growing user base of the Solana blockchain. Beyond the Numbers: Understanding Solana’s Ecosystem Strength The impressive revenue figures are more than just numbers; they reflect the fundamental strengths of the Solana ecosystem itself. Key benefits that attract both users and developers include: High Throughput: Solana’s ability to process thousands of transactions per second makes it ideal for high-demand applications. Low Transaction Fees: Users benefit from significantly lower costs compared to many other blockchains, enhancing affordability and accessibility. Rapidly Expanding Developer Community: A growing pool of talent building innovative solutions ensures continuous advancement and new applications. This combination fosters an environment where innovative applications can thrive and generate substantial value. The growing Solana app revenue indicates increased user engagement and a healthy economic cycle within the network. More users mean more transactions, which in turn drives revenue for applications and validators. This positive feedback loop is vital for long-term sustainability and continued expansion, signaling a vibrant and active community. Challenges and Future Outlook for Solana App Revenue While the growth is undoubtedly exciting, it’s also important to consider the broader landscape. The cryptocurrency market can be inherently volatile, and competition among layer-1 blockchains is fierce. Solana, like any other platform, faces challenges such as maintaining network stability, ensuring robust security, and the need for continuous innovation to stay ahead. However, the current trajectory, backed by strong development and user adoption, suggests a resilient foundation. Looking ahead, the future of Solana app revenue appears remarkably promising. Continued core protocol development, strategic partnerships, and a relentless focus on enhancing user experience are likely to sustain this upward trend. For users, developers, and investors, closely monitoring the performance of key applications and overall ecosystem health will provide valuable insights into Solana’s enduring potential and its capacity for future growth. In conclusion, the astounding 126% year-over-year increase in Solana app revenue to $190 million in August is a powerful testament to the network’s burgeoning strength and innovation. Led by key players like Axiom, pump.fun, and Phantom, Solana is clearly demonstrating its capability to host a vibrant and economically successful decentralized application landscape.

But while assets that get a lot of attention are frequently in the news, the ventures that will really succeed in the long run are the ones that combine new ideas with long-term viability. Early investors realize that good fundamentals and tokenomics are what make wealth grow, and it’s what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out. Analysts say that this cryptocurrency will provide investors a 1200% return by 2026, making it the best one to purchase this month for those who want to see beyond the hype. Staking, buybacks, and roadmap confidence for 1200% The mtToken stake and repurchase strategy is another thing that makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out. Users may stake their mtTokens in certain smart contracts to get MUTM payouts. The platform will also use the money it makes to buy back MUTM straight from the open market. Then, these tokens will be given back to stakers, creating a feedback loop of demand that rewards those who hold on to their tokens for a long time and makes prices more stable. This strategy is what changes MUTM from a speculative play into an asset that pays interest. Another way to tell whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is real is by looking at its roadmap. Phase 1 has already done important presale tasks, community advertising, monitoring platform listings, and an outside audit. The next steps will involve building the core smart contracts and DApps, the back-end infrastructure, the risk management systems, and the analytics tools. Before the presale ends, there will be beta testing, final audits, and ensuring that all rules are followed. After that, the platform will be live, the MUTM token will be listed on exchanges, and the staking and claim procedures will start. In Phase 4, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also roll out institutional collaborations, multi-chain growth, and platform improvements. This will make it a whole ecosystem. Security has also been made a top priority. The CertiK audit gave the project a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00, which made investors feel more confident. There is a $50,000 bug bounty program in place, with payouts of up to $2,000 for serious problems and as little as $200 for less serious ones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving away $100,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 people, each of whom will get $10,000 worth of tokens. This is to get more people involved in the community. Stablecoin utility and presale growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating an ecosystem around its decentralized stablecoin, which will always try to stay at a $1 peg. This stablecoin is different from meme assets that go up and down in value. It is created only when users borrow against collateral like ETH, AVAX, or SOL, and it is burnt when loans are paid back or sold. Only issuers who have been authorized will be able to mint, and there will be constraints to keep systemic risk in check. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s protocol will set the interest rates for borrowing the stablecoin to safeguard the peg. When the stablecoin trades for more than $1, rates will go down, and when it trades for less than $1, rates will go up. Arbitrage possibilities will help bring the price back down, and all loans will be overcollateralized and immediately paid off when required. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has an advantage over ventures that just depend on speculative demand since it has governance, arbitrage, and collateral safety nets. This is the type of thing that helps explain why more and more people are investing in crypto initiatives that provide depth and sustainability instead of just hype. The project is in Phase 6 of its presale right now, with a price of $0.035. It has already generated more than $15.85 million, sold 40% of its supply, and brought on more than 16,350 holders. There can only be 4 billion tokens in total. The next phase, Phase 7, will raise the price of the token by 15% to $0.040. This means that this is the final opportunity for investors to acquire MUTM at this discounted price. The tokenomics are set up to provide value, as the platform’s earnings will be utilized for open-market buybacks that help the price rise over time. An investor who bought $2,500 worth of MUTM at $0.01 in previous rounds now possesses $8,750, and the same bag is expected to be worth $300,000 when the token hits $2. The presale success gives further weight to crypto projections that say MUTM would provide investors more than 1200% profits by 2026. While the market talks about stories about a crypto ETF or daily price swings, this initiative shows that disciplined token economics and steady growth are what really drive gains. Conclusion Whether you’re an investor who wants to know whether crypto is a solid investment right now, the answer is that time and choosing the right projects are more important than anything else. Meme coins do well when there is a lot of buzz, but they don’t last long. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting the stage for long-term development, and the presale is going to move to a higher price, so the chance to get MUTM at an inexpensive price is running out quickly. As SHIB and other meme currencies continue to make news, the sharpest investors are transferring their money to ventures that have a legitimate basis. When 1200% growth becomes genuine in 2026, anyone who bought in today for $0.035 will have shown that actual DeFi innovation, not hype, is where big profits come from.

Recently, one particular event has captured the attention of traders and investors alike: ETH liquidations . Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) has unfortunately led the charge in crypto liquidations, experiencing a staggering $60.45 million wiped out from perpetual futures positions. This substantial figure underscores the volatile nature of digital assets and highlights crucial market dynamics that every participant should understand. What Are ETH Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the crypto derivatives space, the term ""liquidation"" can sound intimidating. Simply put, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when the market moves against their prediction, and they can no longer meet the margin requirements to keep the trade open. The recent surge in ETH liquidations is particularly significant because Ethereum is a major player in the crypto ecosystem. Its price movements and associated liquidations can often signal broader market sentiment and potential future trends. Understanding these events is vital for anyone looking to navigate the complex world of crypto trading. A Closer Look at the Recent Market Wipeout The past 24 hours saw considerable turbulence across various cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial liquidations. Let’s break down the key figures: Ethereum (ETH): Topping the list, ETH saw a massive $60.45 million in liquidations . A striking 69.88% of these were long positions, meaning traders betting on a price increase were caught off guard by a downturn. Bitcoin (BTC): Not far behind, Bitcoin experienced $25.38 million in liquidations. Interestingly, the majority here were short positions, accounting for 75.39%. This suggests that while ETH longs were suffering, some BTC shorts were also squeezed, perhaps indicating a nuanced market movement rather than a uniform crash. Dogecoin (DOGE): The popular meme coin also felt the pressure, with $11.08 million in liquidations. Similar to ETH, long positions were dominant, making up 61.11% of the total. These figures paint a clear picture of heightened volatility and the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. The sheer volume of ETH liquidations alone indicates a significant price movement that impacted a large number of bullish traders. Decoding Long vs. Short Liquidations: What Does It Mean? The distinction between long and short liquidations is crucial for interpreting market sentiment. When long positions are liquidated, it implies a downward price movement that caught bullish traders off guard. Conversely, short liquidations suggest an upward price movement that squeezed bearish traders. For Ethereum, the dominance of long liquidations (nearly 70%) means that a significant number of traders who expected ETH’s price to rise were forced to close their positions. This often creates further selling pressure, potentially cascading into more liquidations. In contrast, Bitcoin’s majority short liquidations suggest a brief upward bounce or resistance to further downside, catching those betting on a deeper fall. These opposing trends in BTC and ETH liquidations highlight the complex interplay between different assets in the market and underscore the need for careful analysis. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors The recent wave of liquidations, particularly the large volume of ETH liquidations , serves as a powerful reminder of market risks. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Risk Management is Key: Always use stop-loss orders when engaging in leveraged trading. This helps limit potential losses and protects your capital from sudden market shifts. Understand Leverage: While leverage can amplify gains, it also significantly amplifies losses. Be conservative with your leverage ratios, especially in volatile markets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different assets can help mitigate risks associated with single-asset volatility. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data. Understanding the broader context can help anticipate potential price movements. Avoid Emotional Trading: Liquidations often trigger fear and panic. Make decisions based on analysis, not emotion. By adopting a disciplined approach and prioritizing risk management, investors can better navigate the unpredictable nature of the crypto market, even amidst significant events like widespread ETH liquidations . In summary, the past 24 hours have been a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency perpetual futures market, with Ethereum leading the pack in liquidations. The substantial $60.45 million in ETH liquidations , predominantly from long positions, signals a challenging period for bullish traders. While Bitcoin and Dogecoin also saw significant liquidations, the specific distribution between long and short positions offers nuanced insights into market sentiment. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, understanding these liquidation events and adopting robust risk management strategies will be paramount for sustained participation and success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about cryptocurrency liquidations: What exactly is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against them, and their collateral (margin) is no longer sufficient to maintain the trade. This prevents further losses beyond the initial margin. Why did ETH liquidations lead the market recently? ETH liquidations were highest primarily because Ethereum experienced significant price volatility, leading to a substantial number of leveraged long positions being closed out. Traders betting on a price increase were particularly affected by a downward price movement. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when a trader betting on a price increase (a ""long"" position) is forced to close due to a price drop. Short liquidations occur when a trader betting on a price decrease (a ""short"" position) is forced to close due to a price increase. How can I protect myself from liquidations? Effective risk management is crucial. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, manage your leverage responsibly, diversify your portfolio, and stay informed about market conditions. Avoid over-leveraging and emotional trading. Do liquidations always mean a market crash? Not necessarily. While large-scale liquidations can contribute to downward price pressure, they are a normal part of leveraged markets. They can indicate significant volatility or a shift in sentiment, but don’t always precede a sustained market crash. Did you find this analysis of ETH liquidations helpful?

However, while traders focus on volatile meme coins, Remittix (RTX) is steadily climbing its way to the top, becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Shiba Inu is currently trading around $0.00001298, following a sharp drop that shocked investors. The decline was partly driven by a $2.4 million hack on the Shibarium bridge , shaking market confidence. On Saturday, SHIB recorded a massive spike in activity, with over 7.17 trillion tokens transferred in a single day, according to Etherscan. From a technical perspective, the failure to stay above the 200-day EMA has made many traders lose confidence in the token. According to some analysts, SHIB is capable of falling to $0.000012 and if it does, it may fall to $0.000010. Others are more optimistic and they are projecting an upward price of $0.00003150 or even up to $0.000081 in the months ahead. source: @ramseycrypto on X For now, the Shiba Inu price prediction suggests a period of uncertainty, with SHIB caught between bearish technical signals and bullish long-term speculation, including rumors of a Shiba Inu ETF. Pepe Coin Faces Consolidation PEPE is currently priced around $0.00001061. A single wallet purchase of 1.52 trillion PEPE tokens , worth nearly $16 million, sent shockwaves through the market. This is among the biggest individual deals in the history of the token. Presently, PEPE is experiencing a narrow range between $0.00000941 and $0.00001340, which is an indication of consolidation. Analysts feel this may be quiet before the storm and there may be a great breakout or a great breakdown in the near future. Support lies at $0.00001035, with resistance just slightly above at $0.00001064. While some analysts see cooling momentum as a sign of exhaustion, others believe PEPE is simply building a base for another leg higher. source: FX_Professor on TradingView Remittix: The Token Taking The Spotlight Remittix is the best crypto under $1 , raising over $25,8 million, selling more than 664 million tokens at $0.1080 each.

XRP was one of the longest runners in cross-border payments, but there is competition, regulatory challenges, and market volatility to consider whether it is in its own good.

XRP Price Prediction and Market Climate XRP has been an established remittance player globally for several years now and is among the most sought-after cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. At a sale price of $3.05, market capitalization of $181.09 billion, and 24-hour trading volume of $5.02 billion (down 15.34%), XRP remains among the most traded cryptocurrency. For XRP to be a real possibility at $100, though, it would need enormous market growth and adoption both in the institutional and retail spaces. Although its role in cross-border payments is monopolistic, the crypto universe is today full of upcoming crypto initiatives offering faster settlement, lower fees, and higher integration flexibility. XRP’s trajectory is also highly dependent upon regulation clarity. In the United States, judicial proceedings have decelerated momentum, whereas other regions keep testing out regulations that would benefit or injure its progress. The Rise of Utility-First Projects The crypto space is moving towards real-world utility. Low gas fee crypto projects, decentralized exchanges, and new altcoins with payment use cases are making large headlines. Investors are more concerned with hype coins now and are instead focusing on crypto with real utility, long-term sustainability, and practical adoption. This shift creates space for platforms that do not only guarantee innovation but have even working solutions. While XRP is fighting to push banking adoption, rivalry from the next big altcoin 2025 players is tough. Among such projects creating buzz is Remittix (RTX), a cross-chain DeFi platform bridging crypto and fiat payments. The Forces Powering Remittix’s Rise Remittix ( $0.1080 per token ) has already secured more than $25.9 million, selling 664Million+ tokens in presale. It solves a $19Trillion payments problem by allowing users to pay crypto straight to bank accounts in 30+ nations. Unlike most early-stage crypto investments, Remittix already possesses a real-world use case which is already being trialed through its wallet beta. Important project highlights are: Ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens First CEX listing confirmed with BitMart and second with LBank $250,000 giveaway active for presale supporters 15% USDT referral incentives paid every day Over $25.9Million raised in one of the best crypto presales 2025 With CertiK auditing, Remittix is a secure, open DeFi project and is increasingly viewed as the next altcoin 2025. Final Thoughts on XRP Price Prediction Whereas XRP is one of the top cryptos to invest in today for others, reaching $100 would require historic adoption and growth in the market. The cryptocurrency market is evolving at a fast pace, and investors are diversifying into low cap crypto gems and future cryptos that have real-world effects. Remittix provides a fresh perspective by integrating cross-border payments with blockchain effectiveness, and therefore it is among the most realistic crypto presales that are currently running. Be it XRP hitting $100 or not, the advent of projects like Remittix is an indication that the future of crypto lies in offering practical solutions and not speculation.

According to reports, the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) of Israel flagged 187 wallet addresses and asked platforms and service providers to take action. Immediate freezes were limited, and most of the funds appear to have been moved before they could be held. Israel Names Wallets And Asks For Action The NBCTF supplied a list of 187 addresses it believes are tied to the IRGC . Tether responded by blacklisting 39 of the flagged wallets, which blocked those addresses from further on-chain transactions. Reports indicate that only about $1.5 million is presently frozen or held, while the larger sum — roughly $1.5 billion in incoming transfers over time — has largely been shifted through other addresses and services. Questions Remain Over Ownership And Flows Reports have disclosed that blockchain analytics firms have urged caution about attributing direct ownership of every flagged address to the IRGC. Companies like Elliptic have said that some wallets could belong to exchanges or third-party services used by many different users, which complicates claims of direct control. Tracing crypto flows is possible but messy, and the distinction between transaction volume through a wallet and direct ownership matters in legal terms. How The Funds Were Handled On-Chain Israeli authorities say they tracked large USDT flows into the flagged network over months. While a small portion was located and frozen, most of the tokens were reported to have been moved before enforcement steps could be completed. Tether’s decision to blacklist some wallets shows one way stablecoin issuers can act, but the moves do not recover funds that have already left the flagged addresses. The situation highlights how quickly assets can be shifted among many addresses. Why It Matters For Sanctions And Crypto Compliance According to market and regulatory coverage, the case illustrates the ongoing challenge of stopping sanctioned actors from using crypto to move value. Stablecoins like USDT are widely used for cross-border transfers, and their scale makes them attractive for many users. Lawmakers and regulators will likely watch how exchanges, wallets, and issuers respond, since cooperation by private firms can make enforcement more effective.

Binance Ethereum Trading In Neutral Zone According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Ethereum trading on Binance during September 2025 is witnessing a period of relative calm compared to other months. Notably, there has been a decline in the imbalance between ETH spot and perpetual volumes. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record 36 Million ETH, Driving Structural Supply Shock Commenting on ETH’s recent price surge, which saw it jump from $2,127 on June 15 to around $4,500 at the time of writing, Arab Chain noted that this rally was not supported by strong momentum. Neither the spot market nor leveraged speculators contributed to the price appreciation. The CryptoQuant contributor brought attention to ETH’s Z-score, which has oscillated between 0.0 and -1.0 for most of September. Such a Z-score typically signifies the asset trading in a neutral zone, with a slight tilt toward the spot market. For the uninitiated, a Z-score measures how far a data point is from the mean, expressed in units of standard deviation. In trading, it’s used to identify whether a value – like volume or price – is unusually high or low compared to its historical average. In essence, ETH’s current Z-score means that perpetual contracts are slowly losing their dominance in trading volume. This could be due to multiple reasons, such as speculators exiting the market or due to increased dependence on real buy/sell orders from actual investors. The decline in perpetual trading volume is significant compared to the period between June and August. As a result, the appetite for leveraged speculation has dwindled too, a sign of growing caution in the market. Arab Chain added: Despite this decline, the spot market also showed limited strength, reflecting a general lack of investor engagement. Spot volume remained below the 500K–1M range, which is significantly lower than the peaks recorded in July and June. The analyst cautioned that although the lack of strong imbalances between the spot and perpetual markets may seem positive at first, it could also mean there is heightened uncertainty and stagnation pertaining to the direction of ETH’s price. Is ETH Preparing For A New Rally? Although ETH appears to be stuck in limbo due to its sluggish price action, some analysts are confident that the digital asset is likely to resume its bullish trajectory in the near term. For example, ETH reserves on exchanges continue to deplete at a rapid pace. Related Reading: Ethereum Outflows Drive Binance Supply Ratio Under 0.037, Signaling Bullish Setup Similarly, institutional demand for ETH continues to be strong, with some analysts forecasting ETH to climb to $6,800 by the end of 2025. At press time, ETH trades at $4,439, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

The promotion, running from 10:00 (UTC) on September 16 to 10:00 (UTC) on September 30 and rewards users for their trading activity. Participants must register and achieve specific trading volume thresholds. Rebates are calculated based on new daily trading volume using a tiered system, with higher percentages applied to higher volumes. All rebates will be distributed in HTX tokens, with a maximum of $20,000 worth of $HTX per user. During the event, trades made through spot trading bots, isolated margin, and cross margin will be counted toward the total spot trading volume. Participants’ new daily trading volume will be calculated using the following formulas: ● New Daily Trading Volume = Daily trading volume during the event − Average daily trading volume in the 30 days prior to the event. ● Actual Daily Rebate Amount = Daily net spot trading fees × Rebate coefficient. Daily New Trading Volume (Per user) Rebate Coefficient Reward (in $HTX) ≥1 million USDT 10% net trading fees ≥ 5 million USDT 15% net trading fees ≥ 10 million USDT 25% net trading fees ≥ 20 million USDT 35% net trading fees ≥ 50 million USDT 50% net trading fees Example: Suppose User A’s average daily spot trading volume in the past 30 days before the event was 8 million USDT: On September 18, User A’s spot trading volume reaches 20 million USDT, then User A’s daily new trading volume is therefore 12 million USDT. According to the rebate rules, if the rebate coefficient for that day is 25%, then User A’s rebate = Net spot trading fees from 20 million USDT * 25% in equivalent $HTX; On September 23, User A’s spot trading volume reaches 60 million USDT, then User A’s daily new trading volume is therefore 52 million USDT. According to the rebate rules, if the rebate coefficient for that day is 50%, then User A’s rebate = Net spot trading fees from 60 million USDT * 50% in equivalent $HTX. HTX is committed to delivering a secure, convenient, and efficient digital asset trading experience for users worldwide. The platform continues to strengthen its technology and risk management to safeguard assets and transactions. It also enhances product features and user experience, making trading accessible for investors at all levels.

The price is now recovering losses and faces hurdles near the $3.080 zone. XRP price is consolidating losses after declining below the $3.120 resistance. The price is now trading below $3.080 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the price clears the $3.080 zone. XRP Price Attempts Recovery XRP price started a fresh decline below the $3.120 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $3.020 level to enter a short-term bearish zone. There was a move below the $3.00 pivot level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A low was formed at $2.957 and the price recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.186 swing high to the $2.957 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $3.060 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls protect the $3.00 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.060 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.186 swing high to the $2.957 low. A clear move above the $3.080 resistance might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.180 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.060 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.00 level. The next major support is near the $2.950 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.950 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.880. The next major support sits near the $2.840 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $3.00 and $2.950.

Today, a significant development has unfolded on one of the largest crypto exchanges, Binance, with the announcement of new Binance perpetual futures listings. This move opens up fresh avenues for traders looking to capitalize on price movements of emerging digital assets. What Exactly Are Binance Perpetual Futures? For those new to the concept, perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract in the crypto market that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without actually owning it. Unlike traditional futures, these contracts have no expiry date, meaning you can hold them indefinitely as long as you meet margin requirements. This flexibility makes them incredibly popular. Here are some core aspects of Binance perpetual futures : No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions as long as they maintain sufficient margin. Leverage: They enable traders to amplify their potential returns (and risks) by trading with borrowed funds. Funding Rates: A unique mechanism that ensures the perpetual futures price stays anchored to the spot price. Binance, as a leading exchange, continually adds new assets to its perpetual futures lineup, providing a diverse range of trading instruments for its global user base. This expansion keeps the market dynamic and responsive to emerging tokens. Diving Into TOSHI and STBL: New Binance Perpetual Futures Pairs Binance has officially announced the immediate addition of two new perpetual futures pairs: TOSHI/USDT and STBL/USDT. These listings are set to go live today, offering traders new frontiers for speculation and portfolio diversification. The TOSHI/USDT pair will commence trading at 5:30 a.m. UTC, quickly followed by the STBL/USDT pair at 5:45 a.m. UTC. Let’s look at the specifics for these new Binance perpetual futures : TOSHI/USDT: This pair will offer an impressive leverage of up to 75x. Such high leverage allows for significant exposure with a relatively smaller capital outlay, though it also magnifies potential losses. STBL/USDT: Traders can access up to 50x leverage for this pair. While slightly lower than TOSHI, 50x leverage still presents substantial opportunities for amplified trading strategies. These additions reflect Binance’s commitment to expanding its derivative offerings, catering to the growing demand for diverse trading instruments in the fast-paced crypto market. The inclusion of these tokens suggests a growing interest and liquidity around them. Why Do These Binance Perpetual Futures Listings Matter? The introduction of TOSHI and STBL as Binance perpetual futures is more than just a routine update; it carries significant implications for the broader crypto ecosystem and individual traders alike. Firstly, it enhances market liquidity for these specific tokens. When an asset is listed on a major platform like Binance for futures trading, it typically sees increased trading volume and visibility. Moreover, these listings offer traders: Diversification: New pairs mean more options to spread risk and explore different market segments. Price Discovery: Futures markets often play a crucial role in price discovery, helping to establish fair market values for assets. Hedging Opportunities: Holders of TOSHI or STBL in their spot portfolios can use these futures contracts to hedge against potential price declines. For the projects behind TOSHI and STBL, this Binance listing is a massive vote of confidence, potentially attracting more users and developers to their respective ecosystems. It signifies a maturation and increased acceptance of these digital assets within the institutional trading landscape. Navigating the World of Crypto Perpetual Futures: Risks and Rewards While the prospect of high leverage and new trading pairs can be exciting, it’s crucial to approach Binance perpetual futures with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. Leverage, while offering amplified gains, also significantly increases the potential for rapid losses, sometimes exceeding initial capital if not managed properly. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies further compounds these risks. Here are some actionable insights for traders: Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Never trade with more capital than you can afford to lose. Education: Understand how perpetual futures work, including funding rates, margin calls, and liquidation mechanisms. Market Analysis: Conduct thorough technical and fundamental analysis before entering any trade. Start Small: Especially when dealing with new, potentially less liquid assets like TOSHI and STBL, begin with smaller position sizes. Responsible trading is paramount. The thrill of potential gains should always be balanced with a disciplined approach to risk. By staying informed and cautious, traders can better navigate the complexities of these powerful financial instruments. The addition of TOSHI and STBL to Binance’s perpetual futures lineup marks an exciting development for the crypto derivatives market. It offers traders fresh opportunities to engage with emerging assets, leveraging Binance’s robust platform and liquidity. However, as with all high-leverage trading, understanding the risks and implementing sound risk management strategies are essential for success. This expansion underscores Binance’s continuous effort to remain at the forefront of the digital asset trading landscape, providing diverse tools for its global community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the maximum leverage offered for TOSHI/USDT perpetual futures? A1: Binance will offer up to 75x leverage for the TOSHI/USDT perpetual futures pair. Q2: When will the STBL/USDT perpetual futures pair go live on Binance? A2: The STBL/USDT perpetual futures pair is scheduled to go live at 5:45 a.m. UTC today. Q3: Do Binance perpetual futures contracts have an expiry date? A3: No, Binance perpetual futures contracts do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as margin requirements are met. Q4: What are the main risks associated with trading Binance perpetual futures with high leverage? A4: High leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses, meaning traders can lose their capital very quickly. Market volatility further increases these risks, making robust risk management crucial. Q5: Why is Binance listing new perpetual futures pairs like TOSHI and STBL? A5: Binance lists new pairs to expand its derivative offerings, enhance market liquidity for these assets, provide more diversification options for traders, and respond to growing market interest in emerging tokens.

Ethereum is also attracting interest as whales place strategic bets. While so much focus has been on these two giants, investors have also been keeping an eye on new faces such as Remittix (RTX) , which has already made a name for itself as a leading candidate among the best crypto presale 2025 investment prospects. Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Trading Setup Bitcoin is valued at $115,702.01, with a slight daily gain of 0.93%. Its market cap is $2.3 trillion, with the daily trading volume falling by 16.88% to $40.97 billion. All of these figures are indicative of growing caution among investors, as the Bitcoin Price consolidates after recent highs. Ethereum, which is going for $4,450.01, has dropped 0.68% in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization is $539.06 billion, with $30.15 billion worth of trading in the past 24 hours.

Circle’s Strategic Move Into Hyperliquid As part of this initiative, Circle has launched Native USDC and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP V2) on HyperEVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) integrated into Hyperliquid’s layer-1 blockchain. This move is expected to streamline the adoption of USDC and enhance its utility. Plans also include enabling direct deposits and ensuring CCTP interoperability for Hyperliquid USDC on HyperCore, a platform that specializes in on-chain financial operations. Related Reading: Crucial Ten Days Ahead For Crypto: Will They Ignite Mega Altcoin Season? Circle’s announcement further revealed that it has become a direct stakeholder in Hyperliquid. The stablecoin issuer is also considering becoming a Hyperliquid validator, which would strengthen its position within the network. Hyperliquid also boasts nearly $6 billion in USDC, which is a little over 8% of Circle’s total USDC supply. These deposits would reportedly generate approximately $250 million in annual interest for partners such as Circle and Coinbase (COIN). Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s CEO stated on X (formerly Twitter): Don’t Believe the Hype. We are coming to the HYPE ecosystem in a big way. We intend to be a major player and contributor to the ecosystem. Happy to see others purchase new USD tickers and compete . Hyper fast native USDC with deep and nearly instant cross chain interoperability will be well received. HYPE Token Hits New All-Time High The blog post further asserted that the integration of Native USDC onto HyperEVM—and the upcoming support from HyperCore—promises to enhance the capital efficiency of transactions within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. This initiative is said to allow developers and users to transact seamlessly across the crypto economy, making it easier for fintech firms and other service providers to leverage USDC. Circle’s investment in Hyperliquid is just the beginning as the company plans to introduce incentive programs for builders working on HyperEVM, aiming to stimulate innovation and collaboration. The blog post concluded: We’ve simply been blown away by the growth and success of Hyperliquid over the last year, and as we’ve gotten to know Jeff and team, and many of the major emerging builders in the ecosystem, it’s very clear that this is something incredibly unique and special. Circle is here. We’re investing. We’re thrilled to be supporting this incredible community.

As of this writing, the price of Hyperliquid’s native token has retraced toward $53 after reaching a new all-time high of $57 last Friday. Circle’s stock, on the other hand, which recently debuted on the Nasdaq, is trading at $135 per share — a nearly 55% drop compared to its all-time high of over $298.

PayPal To Allow Users To Transfer Crypto With Personalized Payment Links According to a press release , PayPal has expanded its peer-to-peer (P2P) offerings to include cryptocurrencies. US users will soon be able to send and receive these tokens directly within the app, transferring not only to PayPal and Venmo, but also to other digital asset wallets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and PYUSD are in the list of coins confirmed to be supported so far. The news comes a couple of months after PayPal’s July announcement about adding a “Pay with Crypto” feature to help merchants accept digital asset payments in a convenient manner. This new integration into the P2P system would now allow everyday users to seamlessly transfer cryptocurrencies to friends and family. The digital asset integration isn’t the only new feature that PayPal has revealed. Starting today, users in the US can start creating personalized payment links via “PayPal Links.” These are one-time links that users can share with others to send and receive money. “For 25 years, PayPal has revolutionized how money moves between people. Now, we’re taking the next major step,” said Diego Scotti, General Manager, Consumer Group at PayPal. “Whether you’re texting, messaging, or emailing, now your money follows your conversations.” According to the payments processor giant, P2P and other consumer payments saw solid growth in the second quarter of 2025, with volume jumping 10% year-over-year. The company’s latest P2P expansion ties into its greater “PayPal World” initiative, a global platform that connects digital payments systems and wallets from around the world. PayPal World is expected to launch in late 2025, but for now, no specific timeline is known for when Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will become available in the P2P system. PayPal has also reassured users on the tax side of P2P transfers, noting, “as always, friends-and-family transfers through Venmo and PayPal are exempt from 1099-K reporting. Users won’t receive tax forms for gifts, reimbursements, or splitting expenses, helping ensure that personal payments stay personal.” Bitcoin Has Stalled In Its Recovery Surge Bitcoin has steadily made its way up since the bottom at the start of the month, but over the last few days, the coin has taken to sideways movement as its price is still trading around $115,400. Below is a chart that shows how the price action has looked for the cryptocurrency over the past month. The sideways movement may be about to break, however, if the pattern related to dormant transactions is anything to go by. In a post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out how BTC has just seen a large movement of coins aged between 3 to 5 years old. In the chart, Maartunn has identified an interesting pattern. “Notice how this metric aligns with the sharp price reactions in recent times,” explains the analyst. Given that another such movement of dormant coins has surfaced, it’s possible that Bitcoin may be due some volatility.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|ETH|Ethereum|PayPal|PayPal crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|TRADING|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 05:00:57

SOL price is now consolidating gains below $240 and might aim for another increase if it stays above $230. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $240 and $242 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $240 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $238 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend losses if it dips below the $230 zone.

Today, the same early voices are talking about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and saying that its current presale stage is similar to Bitcoin’s (BTC) first growth cycle. If you’re an investor wondering why crypto prices are going up or watching them now, the answer is clear: businesses that are still in their early stages generally see huge increases. MUTM is distinct from other coins because it has a mix of presale momentum, mechanisms that are useful, and infrastructure that is meant to be faster than rivals like Ethereum (ETH). Five reasons Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mirrors early Bitcoin (BTC) momentum Analysts notice similarities with BTC since the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is growing so quickly. The project has now generated $15.85 million and gotten more than 16,350 holders, from Phase 1 at $0.01 to Phase 6 at $0.035. Demand has been stable, and prices have gone up with each phase. Investors who act sooner get the best deals. An investor who put $1,500 into Phase 1 got 150,000 MUTM, which illustrates how big the increase was. At the current Phase 6 price, that amount is already $5,250. With the ultimate listing price set at $0.06 and predictions going up to $2, the same tokens will be worth $300,000, which shows why getting in early is important. The second argument is usefulness. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adds peer-to-contract pools with stablecoins like DAI and USDC, which provide lenders with steady, predictable profits. If you put $20,000 in DAI, you will get mtDAI, which will yield you around 12% APY. That is a passive return of $2,400 in one year, which is a good thing in a market where volatility is regularly in the news. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows how predictable income streams may be combined with exposure to token growth for investors who want to know whether crypto is a solid investment. Third, borrowing is meant to be flexible. Picture someone with $5,000 worth of ADA. They may borrow up to 75% of the value of their ADA instead of selling it. This gives them $3,750 in cash flow while still benefiting from ADA’s performance. This method gives you flexibility without giving up long-term exposure, which is a problem that many crypto holders encounter. Fourth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) goes beyond conventional financing by creating a peer-to-peer model in detail. The P2P approach will link individual lenders and borrowers, whereas peer-to-contract lets funds communicate directly with a protocol. Because of this flexibility, users may agree on conditions that work for them, and the platform will make sure that everything is protected, backed up, and settled. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a financing environment that works for a wide range of users by integrating P2C and P2P. Analysts point to security as the fifth reason. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed a CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. In a market where trust is important for investor confidence, these figures matter. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with reward levels up to $2,000 for important findings strengthens security by making sure that the system is always being watched and is able to withstand attacks. Expected listings on Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase will give traders throughout the world more trust. Historically, exposure on these exchanges has led to quick uptake, which puts MUTM in a good position to reach a lot of people once the presale rounds are over. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s infrastructure will outpace Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) changed decentralized finance, but its problems with scale are still a problem. High gas prices and long wait times for transactions have frequently made it hard for people to join, particularly when the network is busy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developed with Layer-2 integration from the start, which means that transactions will be almost immediate and much cheaper. This makes things easier for both borrowers and lenders, which is something that is now preventing DeFi from being used on ETH. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also stand out in terms of how volatile the market is. The loan-to-value ratios are carefully planned. For example, Ethereum (ETH) and other stable tokens will have LTVs of around 75%, while Chainlink (LINK) and other more volatile assets would have LTVs of about 40%. These settings operate as guardrails to prevent users from having to sell their assets when prices shift quickly. The platform builds trust in long-term interaction by putting safety and accessibility first. A final call before the next price rise The emergence of Bitcoin (BTC) is now a legend, but the essential lesson is still the same: those who acted first got the most out of it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering the same mix of usefulness, safety, and investment growth that early BTC experts saw. The presale is now in Phase 6, and the token costs $0.035. In Phase 7, this price will go up by 15%. People who are keeping an eye on crypto prices now know that the window for an inexpensive entrance shuts rapidly if a project gets big listings. Whether you’re wondering whether crypto is a viable investment, look at utility-driven enterprises that are still in their early stages. Just as those who bought BTC early didn’t think too much about their choices, people who buy MUTM today will get in before the presale momentum leads to widespread acceptance.

The Bullrunners host explained that while government officials are projecting strong economic growth, market data suggest recession risks are building. He urged XRP investors and broader crypto participants to take defensive measures to protect their holdings in the uncertain months ahead. Ripple #XRP Holders – You have 90 DAYS to PREPARE (Watch This NOW!) pic.twitter.com/CGW0JFeDbe — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) September 15, 2025 Statements from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick The video highlighted comments from Howard Lutnick, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, who said the United States is on the verge of record-scale factory construction, with projects exceeding ten trillion dollars. He projected that this expansion would create major job growth and make the first quarter of next year the strongest in U.S. history for construction. Lutnick also forecast GDP growth above four percent under President Donald Trump’s administration. Recession Concerns and Economic Strains The Bullrunners host challenged these projections, arguing they overlook mounting risks. Analysts such as Andy Goldberg expect a recession by late 2025 or early 2026, while Daily Op Capital has flagged labor market weakness and a potential AI bubble. U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities delinquency rates have risen to 11.7%, surpassing levels seen during the 2008 crisis. Banks are also carrying $395 billion in unrealized losses, raising doubts about financial stability. Cycles and Historical Parallels The video compared current conditions to past cycles, including the dot-com bubble of 2000 and the shale industry downturn of the late 2000s. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence markets was described as showing bubble characteristics. The Federal Reserve is also expected to cut rates this week for the first time in 2025, a step that historically has preceded financial turbulence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Role and Market Outlook The discussion turned to Ripple’s efforts to modernize cross-border payments . Ripple’s CEO explained that most banks rely on intermediaries like JPMorgan or Citibank. However, Ripple is working with over 100 banks to enable direct settlement using XRP, which processes transactions in three seconds. He said XRP’s long-term value lies in solving large-scale liquidity problems. Looking ahead, Bullrunners pointed to Ripple’s upcoming Swell event, with institutions such as the European Central Bank, IMF, Federal Reserve, and BRICS expected to test Ripple’s technology. Anticipation also surrounds pending XRP spot ETF applications due by late October, which could boost institutional demand. At the time of the video, XRP was priced at $3.04, with resistance seen around $3.56 to $3.70 and an upside target of $4.38 if momentum continues. Bullrunners concluded that the next ninety days are crucial for preparation. While official forecasts highlight growth, mounting data points to financial risks. At the same time, Ripple’s advancing role in banking and the spot ETFs underscore XRP’s growing significance in global finance.

Recent news has sent a ripple of concern through the crypto community, shedding light on a significant Coinbase data breach . It’s an unsettling development that highlights the constant need for vigilance in safeguarding digital assets. Unmasking the Suspect: Who Was Behind the Coinbase Data Breach? According to recent reports from Fortune, citing crucial court documents, the likely suspect in the extensive Coinbase data breach that came to light in May is an employee of TaskUs, a third-party contractor. This revelation points to Ashita Mishra as the individual allegedly at the center of the security incident. The investigation suggests that Mishra began exploiting access to Coinbase customer information as early as last September. The method involved systematically stealing this sensitive data and subsequently selling it to various hackers. This alleged operation underscores a critical vulnerability: the trust placed in external service providers. The Staggering Scale of the Customer Data Compromise The scale of the alleged data theft is truly alarming. Investigators found that Ashita Mishra was reportedly passing on details for more than 200 customer accounts every single day, each fetching a price of $200. This sustained activity painted a grim picture of the potential damage. Key findings from the investigation include: Over 10,000 Customer Records: Mishra’s mobile phone was found to contain the information of more than 10,000 Coinbase customers. Estimated 69,000 Victims: The total number of individuals impacted by this particular Coinbase data breach is estimated to be around 69,000. This figure highlights the widespread nature of the compromise. Recruitment of Accomplices: It’s also alleged that Mishra actively recruited colleagues to establish a dedicated channel for these illicit data leaks, indicating a more organized effort than a solitary act. Such a large-scale compromise originating from an insider within a contractor’s team raises serious questions about vetting processes and internal security protocols. What Does This Mean for Coinbase Users and Crypto Security? This incident serves as a stark reminder of the multifaceted threats present in the digital asset space. While exchanges like Coinbase invest heavily in their own security infrastructure, the reliance on third-party contractors introduces additional layers of risk. The Coinbase data breach through a contractor’s employee underscores this challenge. For Coinbase users, and indeed all crypto enthusiasts, it emphasizes the importance of: Vigilance: Regularly monitoring account activity for any suspicious transactions. Strong Security Practices: Always using unique, complex passwords and enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on all accounts. Awareness: Being skeptical of unsolicited communications that ask for personal information or login credentials. Protecting Your Digital Assets After a Data Breach In the wake of any Coinbase data breach or similar security incident, proactive steps are essential. While Coinbase itself would likely take measures to secure affected accounts, individual users also have a crucial role to play in protecting their investments. Consider these actionable insights: Change Passwords Immediately: If you use the same password across multiple platforms, change them all, especially for your Coinbase account and associated email. Strengthen 2FA: Ensure you are using the strongest form of 2FA available, such as hardware keys (YubiKey) or authenticator apps, rather than SMS-based 2FA. Monitor Financial Statements: Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and credit card statements for any unauthorized activity. Be Wary of Phishing: Scammers often capitalize on news of data breaches to launch phishing attacks. Be extremely cautious of emails or messages claiming to be from Coinbase. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about the latest security best practices in the cryptocurrency world. The alleged actions of a contractor’s employee in this Coinbase data breach serve as a powerful reminder that security is a shared responsibility. While exchanges strive to protect their users, individual vigilance remains a cornerstone of digital asset safety. This incident highlights the critical need for continuous review of security protocols, both internal and external, to safeguard customer data in an ever-evolving threat landscape. Staying informed and proactive is your best defense. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is the suspected individual in the Coinbase data breach? A1: Ashita Mishra, an employee of Coinbase’s contractor TaskUs, is the likely suspect, according to court documents cited by Fortune. Q2: What was the estimated scale of the customer data compromised? A2: The investigation suggests information from over 10,000 customer mobile phones was accessed, with an estimated total of around 69,000 victims in this particular Coinbase data breach incident. Q3: How did the suspect allegedly carry out the data theft? A3: Ashita Mishra allegedly began stealing Coinbase customer information last September and selling it to hackers, reportedly passing on more than 200 customer accounts per day for $200 each. Mishra is also said to have recruited colleagues to facilitate these data leaks. Q4: What should Coinbase users do if they suspect their account was affected? A4: Users should immediately change their Coinbase password and any linked email passwords, enable or strengthen Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and actively monitor their account for suspicious activity. Be cautious of phishing attempts related to the breach. Q5: What lessons can be learned from this incident regarding crypto security? A5: This incident underscores the critical importance of robust security vetting for third-party contractors, continuous monitoring of internal and external access, and the necessity for users to maintain strong personal security practices like unique passwords and 2FA.

OKX, a leading global crypto exchange, has just announced the much-anticipated listing of ENA/USDT and PENDLE/USDT perpetual futures contracts. This move is set to open up thrilling new avenues for traders, allowing them to engage with these popular altcoins with substantial leverage. Understanding the implications of these new OKX perpetual futures listings is key for anyone looking to capitalize on market movements. What Are OKX Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? Perpetual futures are a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t expire, making them a popular choice for continuous trading. For many in the crypto space, these contracts offer flexibility and opportunities to profit from both rising and falling markets. Flexibility: No expiration date means traders can hold positions as long as they wish. Leverage: Amplify potential gains (and losses) with borrowed funds. Market Access: Trade popular cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. The introduction of ENA and PENDLE to the OKX perpetual futures lineup signifies growing institutional and retail interest in these specific projects. OKX’s decision to list them underscores their market relevance and potential for significant price action. Deep Dive into ENA and PENDLE: What Makes Them Special? ENA (Ethena) and PENDLE (Pendle Finance) represent innovative corners of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Their inclusion on OKX’s perpetual futures platform highlights their increasing prominence and trading demand. Ethena (ENA): Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, offering a crypto-native solution for money that is independent of traditional banking infrastructure. Its USDe stablecoin aims to be censorship-resistant and scalable, making it a compelling asset in the DeFi world. Traders are often drawn to its unique approach to stability and yield generation. Pendle Finance (PENDLE): Pendle is a DeFi protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future yield. Essentially, it splits yield-bearing assets into principal tokens (PT) and yield tokens (YT), enabling users to fix their yield, speculate on future yield, or provide liquidity. This innovative approach to yield management attracts users looking for advanced strategies to optimize their returns. Both ENA and PENDLE offer distinct value propositions within the crypto sphere, contributing to their appeal for traders engaging with OKX perpetual futures . Navigating the High-Leverage Landscape: Risks and Rewards of OKX Perpetual Futures One of the most compelling features of these new listings is the availability of up to 50x leverage. This means that for every dollar you put in, you can control a position worth fifty dollars. While this can dramatically amplify potential profits, it also significantly increases the risk of substantial losses. Consider these points when trading with high leverage: Amplified Gains: A small price movement in your favor can lead to significant returns. Amplified Losses: Conversely, a small adverse price movement can quickly liquidate your position. Risk Management is Crucial: Always use stop-loss orders and only trade with capital you can afford to lose. Market Volatility: ENA and PENDLE, like many altcoins, can experience high volatility, which is further exacerbated by leverage. Engaging with OKX perpetual futures requires a thorough understanding of these dynamics. It’s not just about picking the right asset, but also about managing your exposure effectively. Actionable Insights for Trading ENA and PENDLE on OKX Perpetual Futures For traders looking to dive into these new opportunities, a strategic approach is essential. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Research: Understand the fundamentals of ENA and PENDLE. What are their use cases? What are the latest developments? Start Small: Especially if you’re new to perpetual futures or high leverage, begin with smaller position sizes to get a feel for the market. Implement Risk Management: Set clear stop-loss and take-profit levels. Never trade without a plan. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on news and social media trends surrounding ENA and PENDLE, as these can influence price action. Stay Informed: Follow OKX announcements and market analysis to stay ahead of potential shifts. By combining careful research with disciplined risk management, you can navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of OKX perpetual futures . The listing of ENA and PENDLE perpetual futures on OKX represents a significant expansion of trading opportunities for crypto enthusiasts. With up to 50x leverage, these contracts offer the potential for substantial gains, but also come with heightened risks. Successful engagement hinges on a deep understanding of the underlying assets, meticulous risk management, and continuous market awareness. As the crypto landscape evolves, platforms like OKX continue to innovate, providing powerful tools for traders to interact with the digital asset economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

However, the company faces serious challenges due to having to build liquidity and establish distribution channels from scratch, according to Bernstein analysts. Tether's new US product, USAT, aims to meet regulatory compliance requirements such as proof of reserves and bankruptcy protection. However, analysts argue that simply operating within the legal framework won't be enough for success. They point out that Tether's main challenges lie in generating liquidity and integrating into the US market.

Furthermore, analysts noted, “Fundamentally changing liquidity in the crypto ecosystem is extremely difficult, and simply sharing incentives is not enough.” Tether will need to build liquidity from scratch and attract partners for USAT, which is scheduled to launch towards the end of the year.

A recent survey reveals that more than half of financial institutions currently not using stablecoins are planning to adopt them within the next year. This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a clear signal of mainstream acceptance and a future where digital assets play a pivotal role in traditional finance. The Crucial Surge of Stablecoin Adoption in Finance The groundbreaking survey, conducted by EY-Parthenon, the strategy consulting arm of Ernst & Young, polled 350 financial executives. The findings are compelling: 54% of firms that haven’t yet embraced stablecoins intend to start using them within the next six to twelve months. This rapid planned adoption highlights a growing recognition of the unique benefits these digital currencies offer. For institutions already leveraging stablecoins , the advantages are tangible. A significant 41% reported achieving cost savings of at least 10% compared to traditional payment methods. This efficiency gain is a powerful motivator for firms looking to modernize their operations and reduce overheads. When it comes to preferred choices, the survey offers clear insights into the current market leaders: USDC: Dominates with 77% adoption among current users. USDT: Follows closely at 59%. Euro-denominated stablecoins: Show strong regional interest at 45%. These figures underscore the practical utility and trust being built around specific stablecoins within the financial sector. Why Are Financial Firms Embracing Stablecoins? The move towards stablecoins isn’t arbitrary; it’s driven by a confluence of factors that address critical pain points in traditional finance. Financial institutions are constantly seeking ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the speed of transactions. Stablecoins offer a compelling solution to these challenges. Consider the benefits: Reduced Transaction Costs: As reported, significant savings of 10% or more are a major draw. Faster Settlements: Transactions can settle in minutes, not days, improving liquidity and operational flow. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain technology provides an immutable ledger for all transactions. Global Reach: Facilitating seamless cross-border payments with fewer intermediaries. These advantages make a strong case for integrating stablecoins into existing financial frameworks, particularly for payment processing and treasury management. Navigating the Path to Stablecoin Integration While the benefits of stablecoins are clear, their integration isn’t without its considerations. Financial firms must navigate an evolving regulatory landscape. Governments and central banks worldwide are still developing comprehensive frameworks for digital assets, including stablecoins . Staying informed and compliant is paramount for any institution venturing into this space. Moreover, firms need to address: Technological Integration: Ensuring seamless compatibility with existing legacy systems. Security Concerns: Implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect digital assets. Scalability: Choosing stablecoins and platforms that can handle high transaction volumes. Risk Management: Understanding and mitigating risks associated with digital asset volatility and smart contract vulnerabilities. Despite these challenges, the proactive stance of over half of non-adopting firms indicates a willingness to overcome these hurdles, viewing stablecoins as an inevitable and beneficial evolution. What Does This Mean for the Future of Payments? The survey’s findings paint a vivid picture of a future where stablecoins are no longer niche digital assets but integral components of the global financial infrastructure. This widespread adoption by financial institutions could revolutionize how payments are made, how capital is moved, and how financial services are delivered. The increasing use of USDC, USDT, and euro-denominated stablecoins points to a diversified ecosystem. This suggests that different stablecoins may find specialized roles, catering to various regional needs or specific use cases within the financial industry. The trend also signals a potential shift away from traditional correspondent banking models, offering more direct and efficient payment rails. This is a transformative moment for finance. The clear intent of institutions to adopt stablecoins underscores their potential to drive significant innovation and efficiency across the industry. It’s an exciting time to watch as these digital assets reshape the future of financial transactions.

BTC gained 1.5% on the day, and almost 5% on the week, but had retreated slightly to $116,600 at the time of writing on Wednesday morning in Asia. The move comes on the day that the US Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates for the first time this year. This will lead to greater liquidity and a potential cycle of monetary easing, which has been historically bullish for riskier assets such as crypto. Crypto Analysts Weigh In Economist Alex Krüger said he was ready for the dovish cut despite markets already pricing the move in. “Though my market views have not changed much. I’m bullish on equities and Bitcoin. The market often forgets how much BTC can move due to recency bias.” Rate cuts also result in liquidity flow from less-risky assets like treasury bills to high-risk assets like stocks and crypto, observed ‘Ash Crypto.’ “As more cuts happen, liquidity flows into Bitcoin, and altcoins will increase,” he said before adding: “We already have major catalysts like ETF approval, pro-crypto administration and regulatory clarity. Once liquidity starts to flow, these catalysts will be priced in, leading to a parabolic Q4 rally.” “The last time the FED cut rates, the market pumped very hard,” said crypto analyst Sykodelic. The last time the FED cut rates the market pumped very hard. So I honestly do not understand why so many people are bearish about rate cuts? We are quite literally, almost to the day, in the exact same position we were last time the FED cut rates. IF we had been mega pumping… pic.twitter.com/OWVDcwgnZY — Sykodelic (@Sykodelic_) September 16, 2025 Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes spoke about the Fed’s “third mandate,” which is now being discussed. Advocacy for yield curve control (YCC) signals a potential shift in monetary policy, which is good for Bitcoin , he alluded. Weakening the Greenback Excess liquidity also tends to weaken the US dollar as more dollars chase fewer goods and assets. Bitcoin, often viewed as a “digital gold” or hedge against inflation, historically benefits from a weaker dollar. The dollar index (DXY), which measures USD against a basket of currencies, has already weakened 12% so far this year. Speaking on CNBC on Monday, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee said the Fed “can actually reinject confidence by saying we’re back into an easing cycle,” before adding that a rate cut will be a “real improvement in liquidity.” He predicted that Bitcoin and Ethereum would make a “monster move” in the last three months of this year.

Meanwhile, REX-Osprey is preparing to debut two altcoin funds this week: the XRP ETF (XRPR), the first US spot product for the token, and the Dogecoin ETF (DOJE), which will be the country’s first meme coin ETF. Both products are launching under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which provides an automatic approval pathway after the 75-day review period. Bitwise Plans Stablecoin Tokenization ETF Bitwise filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the “Stablecoin & Tokenization ETF.” The proposed ETF is designed to track an index split evenly between equities and crypto assets, targeting the fast-growing stablecoin and tokenization sectors. According to the filing, the equity sleeve will include companies directly tied to stablecoins and tokenization, like issuers, payment processors, infrastructure providers, exchanges, and even retailers. Meanwhile, the crypto asset sleeve will offer exposure to blockchain infrastructure supporting these technologies, including oracles and regulated exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The index will undergo quarterly rebalancing, with the largest crypto ETP capped at 22.5% of the sleeve. Bitwise filing with the SEC This new filing reflects the fact that there is growing competition in the market for mixed crypto-equity ETFs, as products like Nicholas Wealth’s Crypto Income ETF (BLOX) also combine stocks and crypto-linked exposure. Bitwise was founded in 2017, and already manages over 20 US-listed crypto ETFs. This makes it one of the most active players in the space. Analysts suggest Bitwise’s product could be approved by November if regulators give the green light. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas pointed out that the SEC is currently delaying most crypto ETF applications until October and November, setting up a busy period for potential launches. The timing of Bitwise’s filing also proves the rising importance of stablecoins and tokenization as investment themes. Since the US passed the GENIUS Act in July, the market expanded by growing from $205 billion in January to nearly $290 billion this week, according to DefiLlama . Stablecoin market overview (Source: DeFiLlama ) Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), like blockchain-based bonds and credit instruments, have also seen a lot of adoption, with their market reaching $76 billion in 2025. Analysts attribute this surge to the pro-crypto policy shift under President Donald Trump’s administration, and SEC Chair Paul Atkins explicitly endorsing tokenization as an innovation worth supporting. This political backing unleashed a wave of ETF proposals across the sector, ranging from straightforward Bitcoin and Ethereum funds to more specialized strategies like Bitwise’s latest submission. If approved, the Stablecoin & Tokenization ETF will give investors a unique vehicle to gain diversified exposure to two of the fastest-growing areas in the industry. XRP and Dogecoin ETFs Coming This Week Meanwhile, two new altcoin ETFs are set to debut in the United States this week, and will offer investors fresh exposure to XRP and Dogecoin as regulators seem more open to crypto-linked investment products. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, which will trade under the ticker XRPR, is expected to be the first US ETF to provide spot exposure to XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. According to the fund issuer, trading could begin as early as Friday after the expiration of the SEC’s 75-day review window. Unless unexpected objections arise, the ETF will be automatically approved under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a framework that provides a faster approval route than the Securities Act of 1933, which governs spot Bitcoin ETFs. The 1940 Act approach allows these products to move forward without direct SEC intervention after the review period, setting the stage for XRPR to test investor demand for altcoin exposure in an ETF structure. Nate Geraci , president of ETF store Nova Dius, believes that this launch will serve as a litmus test for appetite around XRP spot products, particularly as futures-based XRP ETFs are already approaching $1 billion in assets under management. Dogecoin will follow closely behind, with Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas confirming that the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, trading under the ticker DOJE, is slated for a Thursday launch. This fund was also cleared under the 1940 Act framework, and will be the first meme coin ETF in the United States. While the Dogecoin fund may attract some attention due to the token’s popularity, REX-Osprey’s previous Solana staking ETF (SSK), which launched in July, struggled to gain momentum. It is managing $274 million in assets with less than $25 million in recent inflows . The firm also plans to expand its lineup, with a BNB staking ETF filing submitted in late August.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/jake-claver-xrp-at-10-13-is-realistic-20-25-by-years-end-isnt-crazy-heres-why/,"Crypto proponent John Squire drew attention to a recent appearance by business leader Jake Claver on the Paul Barron Show, where Claver outlined his expectations for XRP’s price performance in connection with exchange-traded funds. According to Squire’s post, Claver described a range of $10 to $13 for XRP as realistic if ETFs are launched, adding that a move to $20 to $25 by year’s end would not be out of reach. In the video clip of “The XRP Pod” attached to the post, Claver explained his broader theory for how XRP could reach much higher valuations, noting that he envisions several catalysts aligning together to create significant momentum. While he stressed that multiple elements would be required for extremely high prices, he placed strong emphasis on the role ETFs could play in creating liquidity and broad market access. JUST IN: Jake Claver told the Paul Barron Show that with ETFs on the horizon, seeing #XRP at $10–$13 is realistic and $20–$25 by year’s end isn’t crazy! pic.twitter.com/cOSlU9R11k — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 15, 2025 Key Points From the Discussion During the conversation, Barron encouraged Claver to consider the scenario under minimal assumptions, such as the confirmation of ETFs and the likelihood of a rate cut, which he estimated at 90 percent. Responding to this framework, Claver stated that a price between $10 and $13 for XRP would be very reasonable, with the potential for $20 to $25 depending on market conditions. He specifically tied the higher range to the introduction of ETFs this year, emphasizing that the liquidity generated from such products would be a decisive factor. When Barron asked if this forecast applied to the end of the current year or the following year, Claver was clear that his projection was for the end of this year, provided that ETFs are launched. He acknowledged that other factors beyond ETFs could contribute to XRP surpassing even these estimates. However, within the specific context of ETFs, he argued that the stated ranges were the most reasonable expectations. Broader Implications of the Forecast Claver’s comments, highlighted by Squire, contribute to ongoing expectations that regulated financial products tied to XRP could attract substantial institutional capital. The potential approval of ETFs would mark a major development for the digital asset, as they provide traditional investors with exposure without direct custody of the token. According to Claver, the liquidity the instruments would bring into the market could transform the pricing environment within a short timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While Claver did not provide a detailed timeline for scenarios involving higher valuations beyond $25, he reiterated that multiple catalysts beyond ETFs would be needed to drive such outcomes. His focus in this discussion remained on what he called the “bare minimum” case involving ETF approval and monetary policy adjustments, which he believes would already be sufficient to push XRP into a new price range by year’s end. Squire’s highlighting of Claver’s remarks places attention on a developing narrative surrounding XRP’s integration into regulated investment products. With expectations surrounding ETF approvals and interest rate cuts forming the backdrop, Claver’s forecast reflects a view that significant liquidity inflows are both possible and impactful in the near term. Whether these conditions align as anticipated will be central to determining whether XRP reaches the ranges he described before the close of the year.

Reportedly, the Justice Department is discussing with Binance whether it should continue to have an outside compliance monitor. The development marked another sign of the DOJ’s softer stance on independent oversight after rolling back several monitors introduced under the Biden administration. This comes as Binance sought to reassure customers on Tuesday last week after one of the largest supply chain attacks ever to hit the JavaScript ecosystem. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the exchange said no user data or assets were compromised during the incident. In a statement posted on X, Binance confirmed its database was unaffected by the breach, which targeted widely used Node.js packages involved in more than 2 billion weekly app downloads. The US Justice Department has scrapped monitorship programs for some companies Binance has been trying to smooth ties with US regulators . The exchange’s founder. Changpeng Zhao, who went to prison for four months as part of the 2023 settlement, even said in May he hoped for a pardon from President Trump. The exchange has also worked with the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial to establish a new stablecoin. Per reports, the platform wrote the basic code to power WLFI’s USD1. The Justice Department is still reviewing the status of the three-year Binance monitorship. However, it would probably demand the company step up its compliance reporting before dropping it. US prosecutors have also been considering dropping the requirement for other companies to retain outside monitors, a compliance tool critics have claimed is both expensive and intrusive. The DOJ has often used independent monitors in settlements to prevent repeat corporate offenses, such as bribery or money laundering. However, in a memo this year, Criminal Division leader Matthew Galeotti noted that these monitors can also add extra costs and interfere with lawful business operations, despite their usefulness. So far, according to recent court filings, the DOJ has already terminated monitorships for three firms that agreed to them under the Biden administration. Additionally, prosecutors stated they would drop monitors at two Glencore Plc subsidiaries, which reported $142 million in related costs over 2023 and 2024. Not to mention, they agreed to end monitoring for a NatWest Group Plc subsidiary and Austal USA after both companies consented to stricter compliance reporting obligations. Binance has been under dual monitorships since its DOJ plea and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) settlement, though only the FinCEN-appointed monitor is still active at the moment. Boeing agreed to use a compliance consultant instead of a monitor Several companies are still under monitoring. According to Bloomberg Law, a monitor remains at a US subsidiary of Toronto-Dominion Bank, which pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, the first case of its kind. Balfour Beatty Communities LLC will also stay under oversight until mid-2026 so regulators can continue to assess its compliance systems after its 2021 guilty plea for defrauding the US military. Other companies are still under oversight but not under monitorships. The Boeing case especially turned monitorships into a point of contention. Prosecutors reversed course on installing an independent monitor tied to the plea agreement over the deadly 737 Max crashes. The original deal had been rejected by a Texas judge, who criticized a requirement that diversity and inclusion play a role in the monitor selection process. In May, the government and Boeing announced that they had struck a preliminary deal under which the company would sidestep criminal charges. The agreement calls for using a compliance consultant, not a monitor, who would guide the company without formally signing off on its compliance program.

51859618,582924,1758088800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51859618.jpeg,Google Unveils AI Payment Protocol With Coinbase As Partner For Stablecoin Integration,https://bitcoinist.com/google-unveils-ai-payment-protocol-with-coinbase/,"On Tuesday, the multinational tech company Google announced the release of a new payment protocol designed to streamline the process of sending and receiving money for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This open-source initiative expands beyond traditional payment methods like credit and debit cards to include stablecoins. Google’s New Payments Protocol To facilitate the integration of stablecoins , Google collaborated with US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which has already developed its own AI and crypto payment solutions through its x402 Bazaar program. Google also engaged with over 60 organizations, including major players like Salesforce, American Express, and Etsy, to incorporate a wide range of perspectives and capabilities into the new protocol. James Tromans, the head of Web3 at Google Cloud, emphasized the protocol’s design in an interview with Fortune, stating, “We built it from the ground up to consider both existing payment infrastructures and emerging capabilities like stablecoins.” Over the past year, AI solutions have been one of the largest trends in the cryptocurrency sector, driven by their ability to automate complex tasks such as trading and decentralized finance (DeFi) management. Given the significant interest in stablecoins following the passage and signing of the GENIUS Act , the United States’ first stablecoin bill, it seems that Google is positioning itself in support of this development, as well as of the Trump administration’s support for both crypto and AI solutions. Many industry leaders predict a future where AI systems will communicate autonomously, potentially allowing AI financial advisors to negotiate mortgages directly with AI representatives from various institutions, or personal shopping agents to engage with AI retailers. Tech Giants Embrace Stablecoins The recent launch builds on a protocol introduced by Google in April, which established a standard for communication between different artificial intelligence agents. Tromans noted that this new payments protocol is intended to ensure that transactions between artificial intelligence agents are safe, secure, and aligned with user intentions. Coinbase’s head of engineering, Erik Reppel, highlighted the importance of their partnership, stating, “We’re all working to figure out how we can make AI transmit value to each other.” Reppel believes that this new collaboration between the two giants, aims to pave the way for a more interconnected digital economy, where AI systems can seamlessly facilitate financial transactions. Google’s entry into the stablecoin space aligns with a growing interest among major tech firms . Companies like Apple, Airbnb, and Meta are exploring stablecoin integrations, reflecting a broader trend in Silicon Valley toward embracing cryptocurrency. In June, e-commerce platform Shopify also announced plans to implement stablecoin payment options later this year, further indicating a shift towards new financial solutions.

Bitcoin Is Still Maintaining Above Short-Term Holder Realized Price In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about the Realized Price of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor or address on the BTC network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Score Sees Sharp Jump, No Longer Signals Bear Phase When the value of the metric is greater than BTC’s spot price, it means the investors as a whole are sitting on some net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the asset’s value implies the overall market is in a state of net loss. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of a specific segment of the userbase is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). This cohort includes the investors who purchased their tokens within the past 155 days. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price for the STHs over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin retested the STH Realized Price at the start of the month and found support at it. Since then, the coin’s price has seen some recovery. This pattern of the STH Realized Price acting as a support barrier has actually been seen many times through this bull market. The reason behind the pattern may lie in investor psychology. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. Since the STHs have a relatively low holding time, however, they don’t tend to be resolute, and thus, easily make panic moves when shifts occur in the market. The STHs can particularly be susceptible to panic when the cryptocurrency retests their break-even level. When the market mood is bullish, the reaction comes in the form of buying. This is because the STHs look at drawdowns to their cost basis as dip-buying opportunities. Similarly, STHs react to surges to their Realized Price by selling during bearish periods instead, fearing that the asset would decline again in the near future and send them back into a state of loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows In Last 1.5 Years Surpassed First 15 Years Combined: Data For now, Bitcoin is maintaining above the STH Realized Price. “As long as the price respects this level, the trend remains constructive,” notes the analytics firm. “Losing this support has coincided with phases of contraction or pullbacks.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $116,200, up almost 5% over the last seven days.

Investors are now looking for safer options as the crypto market experiences turbulence. Meme coins like PEPE are showing signs of a possible rebound, but many are turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) . With real-world PayFi features, a live wallet beta, and ranking #1 on CertiK for prelaunch tokens, Remittix provides a practical way to protect investments while staying involved in crypto growth. Shiba Inu Price Falls After Shibarium Hack Shiba Inu price is currently $0.00001307. The coin has taken a heavy hit recently due to the broader crypto market downturn. Ethereum dropped to $4,500, and other major altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, and Chainlink also fell by over 3%. The main blow to Shiba Inu came from a hack on Shibarium, its largest DeFi protocol. The attacker used a flash loan of 4.6 million BONE tokens worth $2.3 million. They also gained control over 10 of 12 validator signing keys, allowing them to approve state checkpoints. This led to the theft of 224 ETH (over $1 million) and 92.6 billion SHIB tokens (over $1.27 million). The SHIB price has fallen below the 50-week EMA, showing that bears are in control. The weekly chart shows a symmetrical triangle forming, which is part of a bearish pennant pattern. When the two lines converge, a strong bearish breakout is likely. If this pattern plays out, the Shiba Inu coin price could fall to around $0.000005955, its lowest level in 2023. This represents a potential drop of about 55% from the current level, which is a warning for investors looking at Shiba Inu price prediction for the near term. PEPE Price Gains Momentum PEPE price is currently $0.00001085. After slowing down over the last year, PEPE has started showing bullish signs. Over the past weekend, the meme coin rallied more than 10%, forming a falling wedge pattern on the chart. A falling wedge pattern is generally a bullish reversal signal. It shows that sellers are losing strength and buyers are likely to take over. If this pattern confirms, PEPE could see a strong rally, potentially rising above $0.000018. This would be more than a 60% increase. In the best-case scenario, the meme coin could even approach a 90% gain if momentum continues. Remittix Offers a Hedge Against Volatility Remittix is a PayFi token that allows users to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. The project has CertiK verification and a top pre-launch ranking, highlighting its security and credibility. The Q3 wallet beta is live, giving early users access to cross-border payment features. The token’s latest metrics show over 664 million sold, a price of $0.1080, and more than $25.9 million raised. Some features of Remittix are as follows: The referral program pays 15% in USDT, claimable daily via the Remittix dashboard. Remittix supports real-time FX conversion, making crypto-to-bank transfers faster and easier. Deflationary tokenomics are designed for long-term growth, rewarding patient holders. The platform is ideal for freelancers, remitters, and global earners, giving practical use beyond speculation. Project momentum is rising ahead of the wallet launch, giving early investors a strategic advantage. RTX Offers Investors New Opportunities The Shibarium hack and broader crypto sell-off have put pressure on Shiba Inu price prediction, suggesting that SHIB could fall significantly in the short term. PEPE shows promise with bullish patterns, but Remittix stands out as a practical and secure choice for investors looking to hedge against volatility. With its real-world PayFi use, growing adoption, referral program, and upcoming wallet launch, Remittix offers both stability and upside potential in a market filled with uncertainty.

The amended class-action complaint, filed Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, expands on earlier disclosures about how criminals infiltrated Coinbase’s support operations in India. Plaintiffs accuse TaskUs of systemic failures and concealment, saying insiders funneled user data to hackers from late 2024 until the breach was uncovered in Jan. 2025. Court documents reveal further details of the Coinbase data breach. Ashita Mishra, an employee at Coinbase's outsourced customer service company in India, stole sensitive customer information, including social security numbers and bank account details, starting in September 2024.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 17, 2025 TaskUs Staff Allegedly Paid $200 a Photo to Leak Coinbase Data According to the filing, TaskUs employees were paid $200 per picture to photograph customer information displayed on their computer screens. The complaint estimates that the bribes generated at least $500,000, a sum equivalent to the annual salaries of more than 100 employees in India. Investigators identified one worker, Ashita Mishra, as joining the conspiracy as early as Sept. 2024. The filing says she stored personal data from more than 10,000 Coinbase customers on her phone and at times took up to 200 photos a day. The documents describe a “hub-and-spoke” conspiracy in which Mishra and an accomplice directed smaller groups of TaskUs employees to collect and pass along Coinbase user records. The filing claims that many participants were unaware of others’ involvement, allowing the operation to continue even if one individual was exposed. Complaint Says TaskUs Tried to Silence Insiders Over Data Leak TaskUs dismissed around 300 staff in January after discovering the scope of the breach. Plaintiffs allege the company attempted to silence insiders who raised concerns and even fired human resources personnel who began investigating. Reuters previously reported that TaskUs staff used personal phones to capture screenshots of Coinbase accounts, exposing names, addresses, transaction logs and bank details. The new complaint characterizes the scheme as “a far broader and coordinated criminal campaign” than TaskUs has admitted publicly. @Coinbase has disclosed a data breach involving a small subset of customer information. #Coinbase #DataBreach https://t.co/qfBEmf3Cc0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 15, 2025 The plaintiffs also accuse TaskUs of delaying disclosure. They argue that Coinbase knew about the leak in January . However, the company only went public in May. By then, criminals had already stolen between $180m and $400m in customer assets. Exchange Cut Ties With Overseas Agents Following Data Leak Coinbase said it notified regulators and users as soon as it became aware of the breach and reimbursed affected customers. In response, the company said it terminated the TaskUs personnel involved , cut ties with other overseas agents and implemented tighter controls. It has not publicly named the other foreign agents implicated. The case exposes the risks of outsourcing critical customer functions in the crypto industry, where exchanges handle sensitive personal data alongside financial assets. Analysts say the allegations, if proven, could reshape how exchanges manage offshore operations. For TaskUs, the claims could prove damaging to its reputation as a trusted business process outsourcing provider.

Hong Kong is stepping up its game in the digital asset space, signaling a future where traditional banking and innovative blockchain technology merge seamlessly. This bold move is set to redefine how commercial banks operate and how investors access assets. At the heart of this transformation are Hong Kong’s tokenization initiatives , poised to unlock new efficiencies and opportunities across the financial landscape. What Are Hong Kong’s Tokenization Initiatives All About? Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee recently made a pivotal announcement, confirming the city’s commitment to fostering digital assets. As reported by the Shanghai Securities News, this isn’t just talk; it’s a strategic roadmap. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively preparing to support commercial banks as they venture into groundbreaking areas: Tokenized Deposits: Imagine your bank deposits existing as digital tokens on a blockchain. This innovation promises enhanced efficiency, faster settlements, and potentially new financial products. Trading Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA): This is a game-changer. RWAs can be anything from real estate and art to commodities and intellectual property, all represented as digital tokens. Tokenizing these assets can unlock liquidity, enable fractional ownership, and broaden investment access. Furthermore, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is carefully considering an expansion of digital asset products and services for professional investors. This expansion comes with a crucial caveat: robust investor protections must be firmly in place. Hong Kong is prioritizing innovation, but not at the expense of security and trust. Why is Hong Kong Tokenization a Game Changer? The embrace of Hong Kong tokenization initiatives isn’t an isolated event; it’s part of a consistent, forward-thinking strategy. Hong Kong has been methodically building a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Previous steps include establishing clear guidelines for: Cryptocurrency exchanges Stablecoin issuers Strengthening custody systems for client assets on licensed platforms These foundational measures ensure that as new tokenized products emerge, the underlying infrastructure is secure and regulated. This systematic approach builds confidence among institutions and investors alike, positioning Hong Kong as a reliable hub for digital finance innovation. The move towards tokenized deposits and RWA trading offers several compelling benefits: Enhanced Efficiency: Blockchain technology can streamline processes, reduce intermediaries, and accelerate transaction speeds. Increased Liquidity: Tokenizing illiquid assets like real estate can make them more easily tradable, opening up new investment avenues. Greater Transparency: The immutable nature of blockchain ledgers provides a high degree of transparency for asset ownership and transactions. Fractional Ownership: Tokenization allows large assets to be divided into smaller, more affordable units, making them accessible to a wider range of investors. Expanding Digital Horizons: Beyond Basic Hong Kong Tokenization The SFC’s consideration to broaden digital asset offerings for professional investors signals a deep commitment to evolving the financial landscape. This isn’t just about facilitating existing transactions; it’s about fostering an environment where new and complex digital asset products can thrive responsibly. For professional investors, this could mean access to a more diverse portfolio, incorporating innovative financial instruments backed by blockchain technology. The emphasis on “robust investor protections” highlights Hong Kong’s balanced approach. Innovation is encouraged, but regulatory oversight remains paramount. This commitment to security and integrity is vital for building long-term trust in the digital asset ecosystem. The goal is to ensure that as the market for Hong Kong tokenization grows, it does so on a foundation of stability and accountability. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in Hong Kong Tokenization While the prospects for Hong Kong tokenization initiatives are exciting, the journey ahead will involve navigating certain challenges. These include: Regulatory Nuances: Continuously adapting and refining regulations to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology. Technological Integration: Ensuring seamless integration of blockchain solutions with existing banking infrastructure. Market Education: Educating commercial banks, investors, and the broader public about the benefits and risks of tokenized assets. Cybersecurity: Maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to protect digital assets from sophisticated threats. Despite these challenges, the opportunities are immense. Hong Kong is positioning itself to be a global leader in digital finance, attracting talent, capital, and innovation. The support for commercial bank tokenization could serve as a blueprint for other financial hubs looking to embrace the future of finance. This proactive stance is a clear signal of Hong Kong’s ambition to remain a competitive and cutting-edge financial center. A Vision for a Digitally Advanced Financial Hub Hong Kong’s commitment to supporting commercial bank tokenization initiatives marks a pivotal moment in its financial evolution. By embracing tokenized deposits and real-world assets, and by expanding digital asset services for professional investors under stringent protections, Hong Kong is not just adapting to the future; it’s actively shaping it. This strategic vision promises a more efficient, liquid, and accessible financial ecosystem, reinforcing Hong Kong’s status as a leading global financial hub in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are tokenized deposits in the context of Hong Kong’s initiatives? Tokenized deposits are traditional bank deposits represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. This allows for more efficient, faster, and potentially programmable transactions compared to conventional banking methods. Q2: What are tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA)? Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) are physical or intangible assets (like real estate, art, commodities, or intellectual property) that are converted into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process can unlock liquidity, enable fractional ownership, and broaden investment access. Q3: Who can invest in these new digital asset products in Hong Kong? The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is considering expanding digital asset products and services primarily for professional investors, ensuring robust investor protections are in place. Q4: How does Hong Kong ensure investor protection in digital assets? Hong Kong emphasizes robust regulatory frameworks. This includes guidelines for licensed platforms to strengthen custody systems for client assets, along with ongoing oversight from bodies like the HKMA and SFC to ensure market integrity and security. Q5: What benefits do tokenization initiatives bring to Hong Kong’s financial sector? These initiatives promise enhanced efficiency, increased liquidity for illiquid assets, greater transparency through blockchain, and the possibility of fractional ownership. This positions Hong Kong as a leading, innovative digital finance hub. Did you find this article insightful?

In an X post, SMQKE wrote, “Yes, XRP was created before Ripple. Documented.” Alongside the post, he shared an image of a passage from the SMU Science and Technology Law Review. The section, titled “Difference Between Ripple and XRP,” contains detailed commentary on the relationship between the two, noting their separate purposes and histories. Yes, XRP was created before Ripple. Documented. pic.twitter.com/wOXHqUNTA7 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 15, 2025 Details from the Referenced Legal Review The academic review explains that Ripple and XRP are often incorrectly used as if they mean the same thing, when in reality they are distinct. Ripple is described as a privately owned company focused on developing solutions such as software and platforms to facilitate global money transfers at a lower cost. In contrast, XRP is defined as an independent cryptocurrency designed to operate as a bridge currency across various platforms. The review makes clear that while Ripple employs XRP in its products to provide banks and financial institutions with liquidity , the company does not own or control the technology behind XRP. Instead, XRP runs on open-source technology that is not controlled by any single entity and can be utilized or modified by anyone. This separation is central to the legal review’s conclusion, which emphasizes that XRP operates independently of Ripple and that the two cannot be interchanged. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Emphasis on Independence The review further distinguishes Ripple’s governance from XRP’s structure. Control over Ripple is held by its founders, directors, employees, and investors. By contrast, XRP is open to anyone who chooses to use it, with no centralized ownership. This distinction highlights the broader framework in which XRP functions, where governance is distributed and access is not dependent on corporate involvement. The review positions Ripple as a company that builds financial products, and XRP as a digital asset that stands on its own. The Core Point Presented By highlighting the statement from the SMU Science and Technology Law Review, SMQKE’s post underscores the documented fact that XRP predates Ripple. This chronology is presented in the review as evidence that the two should never be considered the same. The distinction carries implications for how XRP’s role is discussed within the broader financial and regulatory environment, as it emphasizes its independence from the corporate entity.

This price range reflects a broader stagnation in the cryptocurrency market, as various digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), struggle to regain the momentum that led both BTC and ETH reach new records above $124,000 and $4,9000 respectively. Notably, Citigroup, the third-largest investment bank in the United States, has tempered expectations for the Ethereum price, forecasting a year-end price target of $4,300 for the altcoin. Citi Forecasts Moderate ETF Inflows Into Ethereum According to a report by Reuters, Citigroup’s analysis attributes the current demand for Ethereum to burgeoning interest in Ethereum-based applications, including stablecoins and tokenization. However, the bank cautions that the recent price strength may be more a reflection of market sentiment than underlying fundamentals. Related Reading: Analyst Raises Red Flags On Bitcoin Price: Allegations Of Market Manipulation In a note released on Monday, Citi remarked, “Current prices are above activity estimates, potentially driven by recent buying pressure and excitement over use-cases.” Ethereum’s appeal has grown among investors looking for more than just price appreciation. Analysts forecast increased price growth for the altcoin due to the recent passage of bills, including the GENIUS Act, which aims to provide a new framework for stablecoins, as well as the surge in interest in tokenization. Despite these developments, Citigroup predicts that the inflow of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into Ethereum will be less robust compared to Bitcoin. In contrast, Standard Chartered has recently revised its year-end target for Ethereum significantly upward, from $4,000 to $7,500. Bearish And Bullish Scenarios For ETH This adjustment reflects stronger engagement within the industry and increasing corporate investments. The bank anticipates that the stablecoin sector could grow eightfold by 2028, which would likely drive up Ethereum network fees and demand. Citi also presented a more optimistic bull case, projecting a potential price of $6,400 if activity and adoption of Ethereum-based applications continue to rise. This would represent a major 42% uptrend ahead for the leading altcoin. Conversely, the bank outlined a bearish scenario in which the Ethereum price would drop to $2,200 in the event of a macroeconomic downturn or a decline in the equity market. If this scenario plays out, it could spell major trouble for bulls, as it would represent a 50% drop from current levels.

Interestingly, a recent report from Sygnum, a digital asset bank, has painted a more favorable outlook for Ethereum. The bank highlights Ethereum’s upgrades and increasing institutional interest as significant factors that could position ETH to benefit from anticipated trends in stablecoin issuance and broader adoption. Furthermore, the digital asset bank highlighted that as liquid Ethereum reserves on exchanges diminish and demand intensifies, the possibility of a supply squeeze arises, potentially sending the altcoin into a new leg up to retest all-time high levels. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $4,480, which is up 5% on the weekly time frame. Compared to record prices, the altcoin is trading nearly 10% below all-time high levels.

51861777,582968,1758092423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51861777.jpeg,8.3 Million Bitcoin Will Be Considered ‘Illiquid’ By 2032: Fidelity Report,https://bitcoinist.com/8-3-million-bitcoin-illiquid-2032-fidelity/,"According to a recent report by Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) illiquid supply could climb to 8.3 million BTC – roughly 42% of its total supply – by Q2 2032. As a result, the digital asset’s price may experience extraordinary price appreciation by then. Bitcoin Illiquid Supply Could Jump To 8.3 Million For their analysis, Fidelity used two distinct BTC cohorts to determine the illiquid supply. The first cohort consists of BTC that was last moved seven or more years ago. The second cohort includes public companies that hold at least 1,000 BTC. Bitcoin included in the first cohort was found to be highly illiquid, as its total portion of the BTC supply has only increased quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) since tracking became possible in 2016. The following chart shows the quarterly net change observed in this cohort. When it comes to public companies holding more than 1,000 BTC, there has only been one QoQ decrease in total supply since 2020. As of June 30, this cohort held a total of 830,000 BTC. Notably, public companies holding more than 1,000 BTC represent 97% of the total BTC held across all public companies. It is also worth noting that the vast majority of these holdings are concentrated among 30 companies. When looking from a macro viewpoint, it can be observed that there has been an accelerating trend of holding BTC versus trading or transacting. Specifically, the rising adoption of BTC among public companies has led to a rise in illiquid supply since Q3 2024. The following chart illustrates the rise in BTC’s illiquid supply. The report adds that at the end of Q2 2025, BTC’s circulating supply hovered around 19.8 million. Of this, close to 8.3 million BTC could become illiquid by Q2 2032. The following chart shows this projection. The analysis predicts that Bitcoin’s maximum finite supply of 21 million is likely to become relatively more illiquid over time. Further, the trend of more companies buying BTC is likely to provide additional momentum. The following chart further shows the change in Bitcoin’s liquid, illiquid, and still to be mined supply since Q2 2010. As can be seen, illiquid supply only started appearing in Q2 2020 and has already doubled since then. BTC Adoption Continues To Grow A trend spearheaded by Strategy – formerly known as MicroStrategy – the corporate adoption of BTC is not slowing down. The firm recently added to its BTC holdings, as it bought another 525 BTC. Earlier this month, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet shared plans to raise $880 million to purchase more BTC. Similarly, Cyprus-based firm Robin Energy allocated $5 million toward its Bitcoin strategy. Latest data shows that total BTC held by public firms recently crossed the one million mark, signifying the increasing trust in BTC as a reliable store of value. At press time, BTC trades at $115,767, up 1% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|Bitcoin Illiquid Supply|Bitcoin price forecast|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|Fidelity|Fidelity digital assets,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 07:00:23

According to Steph, XRP holders are going to get rich today, and he shared a chart highlighting September 17, with a picture of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in the background. Dear #XRP holders, We’re all getting RICH tomorrow! This man will make it happen. pic.twitter.com/251zLhE8UQ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 16, 2025 The Market Prepares for the Federal Reserve’s Decision Today is the day of one of the most closely watched Federal Reserve meetings of the year, where investors expect a move that could set the tone for both traditional and digital markets. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates today after months of hesitation. Market data places the probability of a rate cut at 99.1% , reflecting near certainty among traders. Powell has resisted lowering rates throughout 2025, but mounting pressure from financial markets and political leaders, including President Trump , has created conditions where a policy shift appears imminent. The expected reduction is likely to be 25 basis points, though some believe a larger cut remains possible. Either decision would mark the first rate cut of the year, signaling that monetary policy is moving toward easing. This change carries significance for all asset classes, but digital assets such as XRP stand to benefit significantly from the shift in liquidity and sentiment. Why Rate Cuts Matter for XRP A rate cut lowers the cost of borrowing, encourages lending, and injects additional liquidity into the financial system. Traditionally, this environment benefits risky assets because investors seek higher returns outside of conventional fixed-income instruments. Cryptocurrencies, positioned as speculative and high-growth investments, often rise in such circumstances. For XRP specifically, a rate cut could serve as an accelerant. The asset already has an established role in discussions of cross-border payments, and institutional interest has remained steady . As liquidity expands, demand for alternative assets is expected to increase, placing XRP in a favorable position for both short-term price appreciation and longer-term adoption momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Powell’s Position and Market Expectations Powell has delayed cutting rates for much of 2025, but the current economic backdrop makes it difficult to avoid action. The financial world believes the Fed will deliver the cut not only because of economic indicators but also due to political preference for looser economic conditions. If Powell confirms the cut today, XRP and other digital assets could see immediate gains. Investors have already positioned themselves for this outcome, but confirmation from the Fed typically creates fresh momentum. The extent of XRP’s movement will depend on whether the cut matches expectations or exceeds them with a larger reduction.

DAT companies are seen as relatively risky, but SOL offers additional passive income opportunities. An unnamed large-scale buyer of SOL may be building a treasury. Based on FalconX transfers, a whale acquired 412,075 SOL, valued at $98.4M. The amount is close to the size of purchases used in treasury companies. The SOL was acquired at market rates, as FalconX moved the tokens from major exchanges Binance, OKX, Coinbase, and Bybit. SOL still took a step back to $233.86, allowing the whale to buy the dip. Recent accumulation raised the influence of Solana DAT companies, already holding 2% of the SOL supply, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. The SOL buying continued, even after Forward Industries completed the purchases for its large-scale treasury . At the same time, some whales are using the hype to leave the market, as in the case of one whale sending $23M worth of SOL to OKX. FalconX reflects the growing demand for SOL, with active trading through its public wallets. | Source: Arkham Intelligence . FalconX still carries around 449K SOL, valued at over $117M. At the current stage, large-scale treasuries locked in 2M SOL, while smaller ones still hold under 500K tokens. Treasury companies are offsetting the selling and unlocks, which pressured the price of SOL. Solana treasuries still lag behind the accumulated reserves for BTC and ETH, but are showing strong growth and significant daily buying pressure. SOL treasuries also mostly have mNav ratio above 1, showing their stock is still attractive. For mow, Forward Industries is traded most actively, with the price of FORD near a six-month peak at $37.35 . SOL treasuries boost staking SOL treasuries are not passively held, and are sending significant amounts of tokens for staking and liquid staking. As of September 17, Solana treasuries hold an estimated 17.112 SOL, spread to 17 entities of varying size. A total of 7.4M SOL is staked at 7.96 annualized rate, meaning treasuries may receive another 589K SOL as a reward for liquid staking. Even with price risk, treasuries are showing significant demand for this kind of return. The SOL rewards are an automated expansion of the treasuries, compounding the holdings of the biggest entities. The treasury companies may also not sell their SOL, but instead use the value through liquid staking tokens. As a result, SOL ecosystem value locked is near peak levels at $12.35B. Entities like Jito, Jupiter, Binance Staked SOL and even BONK are competing to gain access to treasuries. In the past month alone, Binance Staked SOL expanded its holdings to a new record above $2.88B . Is the altcoin season a Solana season? The SOL market capitalization dominance is at 3.2%, the highest in six months. The Solana ecosystem contributes to the overall altcoin season, adding a mix of new and older memes. However, meme coins are lagging with just $12B in market capitalization and only three assets valued at over $1B. The Solana ecosystem is yet to recover the token-based hype from January. Currently, the network is switching to DeFi, including lending and liquid staking. Solana also produces the most revenues from apps compared to all other chains, offering passive income for SOL holders. Get seen where it counts.

Recent analysis suggests that increased Fed intervention crypto to manage interest rates might actually be a surprising boon for the cryptocurrency market. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a potential shift that could redefine how we view the relationship between traditional finance and decentralized assets. What Does Fed Intervention Crypto Mean for Interest Rates? According to a detailed analysis by Cointelegraph, a more active approach from the U.S. Federal Reserve in maintaining appropriate interest rate levels could signal a positive turn for cryptocurrencies. This perspective gained traction following comments from Steve Miran, a newly appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Miran emphasized the central bank’s core mandate: ensuring “moderate long-term interest rates.” This mandate is crucial. When the Fed actively works to keep rates within a certain range, it influences everything from borrowing costs to investment returns. The Cointelegraph report speculates that a potential Trump administration might push for even more aggressive intervention in the bond market to achieve these goals. Purchasing Government Bonds: One key method could involve the Fed directly buying government bonds. This action injects liquidity into the financial system. Expanding Quantitative Easing (QE): Another tool is expanding QE, which is essentially large-scale asset purchases designed to lower long-term interest rates and increase money supply. How Could Low Interest Rates Fuel Crypto Growth? The core argument is simple yet powerful: if government policies successfully keep interest rates low, traditional savings and fixed-income investments become less attractive. This scenario often prompts investors to seek alternative assets that offer better potential returns or serve as a hedge against inflation. This is where the Fed intervention crypto connection becomes vital. Bitcoin, in particular, has increasingly been viewed as a digital gold – a robust inflation hedge. When the purchasing power of fiat currencies is eroded by inflation, or when interest rates offer negligible returns, assets like Bitcoin can attract substantial capital. This isn’t just about chasing high returns; it’s about preserving wealth. Consider these benefits: Capital Influx: Low-yield environments can push institutional and retail capital into riskier, yet potentially more rewarding, assets like Bitcoin. Inflation Hedge Appeal: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive alternative to fiat currencies susceptible to inflation, especially if the Fed’s actions lead to an expanded money supply. Market Maturation: Increased interest from traditional investors due to macroeconomic factors can further legitimize and mature the overall cryptocurrency market. Navigating the Economic Landscape: What Challenges Lie Ahead? While the prospect of Fed intervention crypto creating a bullish environment is exciting, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. Economic policies are complex, and their effects can be multifaceted. The specific nature and duration of any Fed intervention will significantly influence its impact on the crypto market. For instance, an aggressive expansion of quantitative easing, while potentially lowering rates, could also lead to concerns about asset bubbles or increased market volatility. Investors need to remain vigilant and understand that while a correlation might exist, it’s not a direct causation. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a myriad of factors beyond just interest rates. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts Understanding this potential dynamic allows crypto enthusiasts and investors to approach the market with more informed strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Fed Announcements: Pay close attention to Federal Reserve statements, especially regarding interest rate targets and bond market activities. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin might benefit, a diversified crypto portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with single asset volatility. Educate Yourself: Continuously learn about macroeconomic indicators and how they traditionally influence various asset classes, including how Fed intervention crypto dynamics play out. The Future of Crypto and Monetary Policy The intersection of central bank policy and the burgeoning world of digital assets is a fascinating space. The idea that more deliberate Fed intervention crypto in managing interest rates could provide a tailwind for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin highlights the increasing interconnectedness of global finance. As traditional financial systems evolve, so too does the narrative around digital assets. This ongoing dialogue between centralized economic management and decentralized finance will undoubtedly shape the future of investment. In conclusion, the analysis suggesting that active Fed intervention to maintain moderate long-term interest rates could benefit cryptocurrencies presents a compelling outlook. By keeping traditional interest rates low, the Federal Reserve might inadvertently steer significant capital towards digital assets like Bitcoin, solidifying their role as an inflation hedge. This potential synergy between monetary policy and crypto market dynamics offers a unique perspective for investors navigating today’s complex financial landscape.

What is “Fed intervention” in the context of interest rates? Fed intervention refers to actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve to influence interest rate levels, often through monetary policy tools like buying government bonds or adjusting the federal funds rate. The goal is typically to achieve economic stability, such as maintaining moderate long-term interest rates and controlling inflation. 2. How do low interest rates benefit cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? When interest rates are low, traditional investments like savings accounts or bonds offer diminished returns. This often encourages investors to seek higher-yielding alternatives or assets perceived as inflation hedges, such as Bitcoin, thereby driving capital into the cryptocurrency market. 3. What is quantitative easing (QE), and how does it relate to crypto? Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy where a central bank purchases large quantities of government bonds or other financial assets to lower long-term interest rates and increase the money supply. This can make traditional assets less attractive and potentially push investors towards cryptocurrencies as a store of value or an inflation hedge. 4. Is Bitcoin truly an effective inflation hedge? Many investors view Bitcoin as a potential inflation hedge due to its decentralized nature and fixed supply, which contrasts with fiat currencies that can be devalued by central bank policies. However, its effectiveness as a hedge can be debated, as its price can also be subject to significant volatility and market sentiment. 5. What are the risks of Fed intervention for the crypto market? While some Fed interventions might benefit crypto, aggressive policies could also lead to increased market volatility, concerns about asset bubbles, or unforeseen economic shifts that negatively impact investor confidence across all asset classes. It’s crucial for investors to understand that correlations do not always imply direct causation. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing this article with your network!

Other players, like Solana and the emerging XYZVerse, are also gaining speed. With prices shifting and new stories unfolding, all eyes are on whether these moves will hold. More details reveal what’s driving interest and what may come next. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005 . At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin’s Bold Journey: From Idea to Today’s Digital Gold Rush Bitcoin appeared in 2009 after a person called Satoshi Nakamoto shared a plan for money without banks. It runs on a public list called a blockchain that sits on many computers at once. People send coins to each other directly, and helpers named miners check each move by solving tricky puzzles. New coins drop into their accounts as a prize, but only until 21 million exist. Every four years the prize shrinks, a moment fans call the halving. This shrinking supply has often sparked fresh price waves, as fewer new coins meet growing demand. While newer tokens chase quick fame with flashy apps, Bitcoin stays the main yardstick of the whole market. Big firms now hold it as a store of value, styling it as digital gold. If rising rates cool risky bets, Bitcoin can still draw eyes thanks to its long record and tight limit. As the next halving nears, some traders see a fresh climb, though swings stay wild compared with regular cash. Ethereum: The Beating Heart of Web3 Gears Up for a New Price Run Ethereum, born from Vitalik Buterin’s idea in 2013, went live in 2015. It moved from mining to a lighter Proof-of-Stake system after the 2022 Merge. This cut energy use and lets users earn ETH by staking. The chain hosts smart contracts, the code behind many apps for lending, games, art, and more. It also set the ERC-20 rule, so any team can launch a token that still pays fees in ETH. Layer-2 tools like Arbitrum and Polygon help send those tokens faster and cheaper. Sharding, the next step, should push costs even lower. Past cycles hint at big moves when Bitcoin halves its supply. Analysts expect ETH to swing between $2,700 and $6,580 in 2025, with a slow climb toward the decade’s end. That range puts it ahead of many altcoins that still rely on hype. Demand comes from gas fees, staking rewards, and its use as loan collateral. New spot ETFs and rising interest in DeFi add fuel. While rivals like Solana boast speed, they trade off age and size. Ethereum keeps the lead in users, tools, and trust, making it a strong pick for the current upswing. Solana’s Fast Lane: Can SOL Overtake the Crypto Pack? Solana was built for speed. While chains like Ethereum and Cardano juggle heavy traffic with add-ons, Solana keeps one straight road and pushes more cars through. Its design lets apps run in many coding languages, so builders can launch games, markets, and art hubs without learning a new toolkit. The network clocks thousands of transactions in a blink, and each move is paid for with SOL, the coin that keeps the engine warm. In this market cycle, users crave quick and cheap moves after feeling the sting of high fees elsewhere. DeFi and NFT creators are flocking to Solana, betting that a smooth ride will lure the next wave of fans. SOL gains value every time someone trades, stakes, or launches a fresh project, so growing activity could pump new life into the coin. Prices still sit well below past peaks, offering room if momentum returns. If the rush to fast, high-capacity chains continues, SOL may steer closer to the front of the crypto race.

He said those factors could challenge the recent rally that’s pushed the market to all-time highs. BofA noted that the S&P 500 hit the bank’s 6,500 target this summer and pushed to another new high. The bank also revealed that its 6,625 secondary target is close to getting hit, with the index exchanging hands at 6,606. Summer-to-fall transition pushes stocks lower Ciana maintained that the summer-to-fall transition tends to be rough for stocks. According to BofA data, the S&P 500 typically sees its worst performance in September. He also believes the stock market could now be headed for the worst week-and-a-half-long stretch of the year. BofA data shows that stocks tend to have the largest downside risk in the last 10 days of September. The bank’s stock data analysis dating back to 1928 shows that the S&P 500 was only up 40% of the time, with an average return of -1.1%. Ciana said that the prospect of a downturn is worse when coupled with a year that kicks off a president’s term in office, like 2025. BofA data shows that the index is only up 29% of the time and posts an average return of -1.5% during the last 10 days of the month in the first year of a new presidential cycle. The bank’s analyst revealed that the last 10 trading days of the month usually begin on September 17, which coincides with the Fed’s next rate decision. According to Ciana, investors expect Wednesday to be a volatile day for trading since the market priced in a 96.1% chance the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 bps at the September meeting. Interest rate cuts could cause stocks to rise Andrew Tyler, the global head of market intelligence at JPMorgan, cited research from the bank’s chief U.S. economist and stated that there might be a dovish cut, which could produce a positive gain. He revealed that S&P 500 options are currently pricing in an 88 basis point move on the rate decision day. Tyler maintained that the bank pegged a 47.5% probability that the central bank will issue a 25 bps cut and issue dovish commentary about the state of the economy. He believes such a scenario could see the S&P 500 gain around 1% immediately after the rate cut, suggesting that the benchmark index could rise to around 6,650. “As we look toward the month-end, Fed Day may act as a ‘sell-the-news’ event as investors take time to consider the macro environment, the Fed’s future reaction function, potentially stretched positioning, a temporarily weaker corporate buyback bid, waning retail investor participation, and quarter-end rebalancing.” -Andrew Tyler, Global Head of Market Intelligence at JPMorgan. Tyler argued that stocks could fall as much as 5% if those headwinds take hold in the coming weeks. He also believes that a sell-off could make room for several buying opportunities for investors. The Bank of America technical analyst also noted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average recently rose to a fresh all-time high. However, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, a separate index linked to the benchmark index, has lagged. Ciana said the Transportation average has not broken above anything relevant to confirm the breakout. The BofA analyst revealed that the Dow Jones Transportation Average also recently plummeted below its trend line support, and its 200-day simple moving average is also dropping. He believes it shows signs that the index is losing momentum. Ciana noted that market breadth, which measures the proportion of rising stocks versus those dropping, is starting to pull back. He also found that the NYSE advance-decline line, which measures the number of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange that are rising versus falling, has stalled recently.

Through the hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) are quickly becoming top coins to keep an eye on. Mutuum Finance is emerging as something greater than a mere ERC-20 token, but a groundbreaking DeFi protocol that works towards bridging the disconnect between innovation, liquidity, and long-term sustainability. While meme coins fueled by hype are moving in the opposite direction, Mutuum Finance is offering more utility with its decentralized borrowing and lending process. Shiba Inu Clings to Support as Market Observes Ethereum Ecosystem Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001374, with recent price action having been noted to move around that number while volumes are held in check. The recent movement of the tokens is characterized by being cautious momentum, with the push by profit-taking and competition by other meme coins for attention from users. SHIB’s development milestones, such as Shibarium updates and higher burn rates, are repeatedly hyped as potential drivers but yet to bring meaningful price appreciation. As SHIB continues to linger in the meme coin sector of the market, it is being compared to emerging DeFi project Mutuum Finance, which some believe may carry more growth this cycle. PEPE Price Update and Outlook PEPE currently trades at levels of $0.00001126, as price oscillates between $0.00001117 and $0.00001178 over the last 24 hours. The near-term history shows moderate selling pressure, with moderate volume losses and resistance just above its current price. With its meme-coin fame and enormous circulating supply, PEPE’s upside potential is extremely volatile and more a reflection of sentiment action than by virtue of underlying network advancements. As opposed to newer, lower-market-cap, higher-utility protocols, some feel there is less space for huge percentage upside in PEPE. Meanwhile, focus is being placed increasingly on newer DeFi player Mutuum Finance, which most people think have better upside in this cycle. Mutuum Finance: Phase 6 Presale Underway Mutuum Finance has witnessed humongous traction during presale with more than 16,340 investors buying coins and more than $15.85 million raised thus far. Tokens can be bought during Phase 6 for $0.035 per token. Its tiered pricing system is a reward scheme and the individuals who jump on early are eligible to receive maximum rewards. Mutuum Finance’s long-term vision is to reshape the DeFi market as we know it today. Besides that, the project is also driving early adoption through a $100,000 giveaway where 10 people will land a $10,000 MUTM reward. Development of Stablecoin with Security and Credibility Besides its general development of an ecosystem, Mutuum Finance is going to release a USD stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Compared to algorithmic stablecoins that have collapsed under financial stress, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and thus capable of maintaining its peg during financial stress. The mechanism takes advantage of the power of idle collateral reserves to secure long-term stability with value preservation assurance. This makes the stablecoin a safe unit of exchange, and a safe store of value, in the Mutuum Finance scheme. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to be the most stable altcoin bet of 2025, coming with 10x potential gains in view for early-in investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as the top Ethereum-based digital assets to bet on 2025, ahead of meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) on the basis of exclusive DeFi potential alone. Now at Phase 6 presale at $0.035, MUTM has already raised $15.85M+ and has 16,340+ investors with prices about to be higher in the subsequent phase. Whereas SHIB and PEPE surf community mania, Mutuum offers decentralized borrowing and lending, a USD-backed overcollateralized stablecoin, and long-term scalability. With a $100K giveaway and top exchange listings in the works, analysts are calling for 10x for early birds. Lock your tokens today in Phase 6 before the next price rally.

With a real-world cause (#FreeThePandas campaign) fuelling its momentum, this new meme coin on presale proves there’s room for more at the party Pudgy Pandas challenges the Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) franchise, which has dominated the year, reaching a market cap of over $2B and gaining social currency in the form of over 900M daily views on X. Speaking of, the $PENGU ETF and the $DOGE ETF filings are more signs of meme coins being seen as serious investment products. That institutional acceptance, combined with the growing buzz around projects like Pudgy Pandas and Pudgy Penguins, is spilling over into newer projects, with degens hunting for the next breakout token. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is pumped up and ready to ride this wave, already soaring past $2.2M in its presale. Meme Coin Mania Isn’t Stopping – Here Are the Tokens Degens Are Watching Now The meme coin market has surged over the past seven days, with several tokens reaching new highs. Dogecoin led the market with a 12.3% increase, followed by Pepe at 5.27%, signaling that the major meme plays still command the spotlight. In the lower cap range, MemeCore exploded by 20%, Bonk saw a 4% gain, and Pudgy Penguins inched up by +0.06%, highlighting how degens may be piling into newer, high-volatility tokens. Riding the meme coin wave, here are the top meme coins that our experts believe could surge in value in 2025. Historically, meme coins have shown the potential to deliver gains ranging from 10x to 100x during bullish periods. This is particularly true when investors enter early in a project’s cycle, as seen with the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale, which is drawing significant attention from early adopters eager to capitalize on the current meme coin mania. Meme Coin Frenzy Pushes Maxi Doge Presale to New Heights Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a high-octane trading meme token built for ultra-leveraged strategies. The token rewards traders who love to time entries, ride market swings, and turn each green candle into an opportunity for massive gains. Besides high-leverage plays and relentless market action, here’s why $MAXI could be the next moonshot bag: An ‘Alpha Dog’ lifestyle token fueling conviction, stamina, and risk-taking in the bull run. It delivers the raw edge and motivation needed to out-trade, out-pump, and outlast. Its smart contract handles presale mechanics and automates prize distributions directly on-chain. Keeps the community always buzzing – firing up the squad with non-stop giveaways and degen competitions, pumping engagement, and keeping the vibes WAGMI. Plans for integration with larger DeFi platforms, including swaps, liquidity, and partner events, as the ecosystem expands. Maxi Doge is flexing hard right now. At just $0.0002575 per token, the presale has already raised over $2.2M; though the next price surge is set to occur once it reaches $2.4M, most likely tomorrow. The $MAXI vibe is MAX RIPPED. MAX GAINZ. MAX MENTALITY – a mantra so strong it;s seen some whales drop as much as $37K on $MAXI . Pure meme-fuelled early entries like this are where the real degens play, which can turn them into mega moonshots. Feeling the FOMO? If you ape in with $500 today, you’ll get about 1.94M $MAXI tokens plus an additional ~2.79M tokens in staking rewards at 144% APY p/a. That means your buy could stack serious passive gains, even before the next pump kicks in With over $5.2B $MAXI already staked, the community is clearly riding this bull wave. If meme coin momentum keeps raging, $MAXI could be the next crypto to explode . Bulk up on the $MAXI presale before the next pump. This is not financial advice. The cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile and speculative. Please do your own research before making any investments.

They’ve just unveiled two groundbreaking crypto ETPs designed to give investors unique exposure to cutting-edge technologies: artificial intelligence and the Solana ecosystem. This move signifies a growing maturity in the market, offering regulated pathways into some of the most exciting areas of decentralized innovation. What Are These New Crypto ETPs and Why Do They Matter? Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) are financial instruments that track the price of an underlying asset, like a cryptocurrency or a basket of assets. For many investors, crypto ETPs offer a familiar and regulated way to gain exposure to digital currencies without directly owning or securing the underlying assets themselves. This launch by 21Shares is particularly significant because it targets two distinct yet highly promising sectors within the crypto space. AFET: This ETP focuses on decentralized AI protocols. It aims to capture the growth of projects that are building AI applications on blockchain technology, offering a new frontier for investment. ARAY: This product dives into the Solana ecosystem, specifically investing in tokens traded on Raydium, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Solana. Unlocking Decentralized AI: The AFET Crypto ETP Artificial intelligence is already transforming industries, and its integration with blockchain technology promises even more revolutionary changes. The AFET crypto ETP is designed to track the performance of various decentralized AI protocols. These protocols are working to democratize AI, making it more transparent, censorship-resistant, and accessible. Investors keen on the intersection of AI and blockchain now have a streamlined way to participate. AFET is set to begin trading on prominent European exchanges, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris. This listing on regulated platforms provides a significant level of accessibility and institutional credibility for an otherwise niche and emerging market segment. Imagine investing in the future of AI through a familiar investment vehicle. This ETP could represent a pivotal shift in how traditional investors approach decentralized AI, bridging the gap between innovative technology and conventional finance. Diving into the Solana Ecosystem with the ARAY Crypto ETP Solana has rapidly emerged as a leading blockchain platform, renowned for its high throughput and low transaction costs. Its vibrant ecosystem hosts a multitude of decentralized applications (dApps), including powerful decentralized exchanges like Raydium. The ARAY crypto ETP offers a unique entry point into this dynamic environment. By investing in tokens traded on Raydium, ARAY provides exposure to the diverse projects and liquidity within the Solana network. This isn’t just about Solana itself; it’s about the innovative projects building on top of it. The ETP will be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, further broadening its reach to European investors. This product allows investors to gain exposure to a broad basket of assets within a high-performance blockchain ecosystem, potentially benefiting from its continued growth and development without the complexities of managing individual tokens or navigating decentralized exchanges directly. What Are the Key Benefits of Investing in These Crypto ETPs? These new crypto ETPs from 21Shares offer several compelling advantages for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors looking to dip their toes into the digital asset space: Regulated Access: ETPs trade on traditional stock exchanges, providing a familiar and regulated investment environment. This can offer a sense of security and compliance that direct crypto investments sometimes lack. Diversification: Instead of picking individual tokens, these ETPs offer diversified exposure to specific themes – decentralized AI or the broader Solana DEX ecosystem. This can help mitigate risks associated with single-asset investments. Ease of Investment: Investors can buy and sell ETPs through their standard brokerage accounts, simplifying the process compared to setting up crypto wallets or navigating various exchanges. Institutional Grade: Products from issuers like 21Shares often come with robust infrastructure and oversight, appealing to institutional investors and those seeking professional-grade solutions. Navigating the Landscape: Considerations for Crypto ETPs While the benefits are clear, it’s crucial for investors to understand the inherent considerations when dealing with crypto ETPs . The underlying assets, cryptocurrencies, are known for their volatility and are subject to rapid price fluctuations. Therefore, these ETPs carry similar risks. Market Volatility: The value of these ETPs will largely depend on the performance of decentralized AI protocols and the Solana ecosystem tokens. Cryptocurrency markets can be highly unpredictable. Regulatory Changes: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the value and availability of these ETPs. Technological Risks: While robust, the underlying blockchain technologies are still developing. Potential bugs, hacks, or network issues could affect performance. It’s always advisable for investors to conduct thorough due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before investing in such innovative, yet potentially volatile, financial products. The launch of AFET and ARAY by 21Shares marks an exciting progression in the digital asset investment landscape. By offering regulated, thematic crypto ETPs focused on decentralized AI and the Solana ecosystem, 21Shares is not only expanding investment opportunities but also validating the long-term potential of these emerging technologies. This development provides a more accessible and structured avenue for investors to participate in the future of finance, showcasing the continued innovation within the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto ETPs What is an ETP? An Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) is a type of security that tracks an underlying index, asset, or basket of assets. ETPs trade on exchanges like stocks, offering investors a way to gain exposure to markets without directly owning the underlying assets. How do 21Shares’ new ETPs differ from buying crypto directly? These ETPs provide regulated access to specific crypto themes (decentralized AI, Solana ecosystem) through traditional brokerage accounts. You don’t need to manage private keys or set up crypto wallets, simplifying the investment process compared to direct crypto purchases. Where can I trade the AFET and ARAY ETPs?

The company said the move provides exposure to the asset at an effective discount of 65%. Caret Digital mines Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, but did not specify what tokens would be traded or the magnitude of the conversion. XRP is trading near $3 with a market cap of around $182 billion. “A key objective of this strategy is to secure XRP exposure at the lowest average cost possible, through a combination of token swapping from digital asset mining activities and by purchasing Ripple Lab shares.” VivoPower International The swap complements VivoPower’s broader plan to reduce acquisition costs by combining token purchases with equity deals based on Ripple Labs. The dual-pronged strategy exhibits an institutional model of treasury management in the altcoin market. Ripple equity deals add to the discount strategy The company’s XRP pivot was launched in May with a $121 million private placement by His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Talal Al Saud. Former Ripple board member Adam Traidman also joined as the advisory chairman. In June, VivoPower partnered with BitGo to provide it as an exclusive custodian and trading partner for XRP acquisitions, as Cryptopolitan reported. Around the same time, the firm announced a $100M yield initiative with Flare, the Ripple Labs-backed blockchain network, signaling an intent to generate returns on treasury reserves. Further deepening its stake, VivoPower revealed “definitive agreements” in August to purchase $100 million of Ripple Labs equity from existing shareholders, pending final approval. The deal would translate into 211 million XRP, or $0.47 per token worth of ownership, an 86% discount compared to market conditions at the time. These moves point to a systemic attempt to integrate discounted exposure with institutional-grade custody and yield solutions. Treasury push extends into payments and yield VivoPower’s XRP strategy is no longer limited to balance sheet management. Its electric vehicle subsidiary, Tembo, will now accept Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoins as payment. The integration of RLUSD promises to eliminate transaction friction and bank charges, while improving enterprise-grade crypto capabilities for VivoPower. The company also recently announced a $30 million pilot with Doppler Finance, which will see the company deploy XRP into structured yield pools with direct reinvestment of proceeds in reserves. That initiative could grow to $200 million. In parallel, VivoPower’s partnership with Flare has grown, deploying $100 million worth of XRP onto the chain to generate yield via decentralized finance applications. These integrations enable the treasury to be a yield-generating platform, instead of merely a passive holding strategy. XRP’s market activity has also picked up with VivoPower’s announcements. Open interest in XRP derivatives jumped to $8.45 billion in recent weeks from $7.7 billion in August, when liquidations sparked a 30% drop. The rebound is an indicator of increasing speculative activity and renewed trader conviction. Source: CoinGlass. Technical levels indicate that $3.05 could be a significant support level. Analysts believe XRP could break out of the $3.50-$4.00 range if defended. However, a breakdown below $3.05 is in danger of retesting $2.80.

That’s precisely the situation Japan faces today. Its deepening debt crisis isn’t just a concern for economists; it’s a topic that could surprisingly reshape the future of digital assets. Experts suggest that as traditional financial systems feel the strain, investors might increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies as a viable alternative. Understanding the Severity of Japan’s Debt Crisis Japan, a nation renowned for its economic stability, now confronts a significant hurdle: a soaring national debt. Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, highlights the country’s alarming debt-to-GDP ratio, which has climbed to roughly 240%. This figure is not merely a statistic; it signals a potential debt crisis on the horizon. What is Debt-to-GDP? This ratio compares a country’s public debt to its economic output. A high ratio indicates that a nation might struggle to repay its debts without further borrowing. Exacerbating Factors: Rising inflation, which erodes purchasing power, and increasing bond yields, which make government borrowing more expensive, are compounding the issue. These elements create a challenging environment for traditional investments. As concerns about this growing financial instability mount, investors are naturally seeking safe havens and alternative instruments to protect their wealth. This shift in sentiment creates an unexpected opening for digital currencies. Why Are Investors Looking Beyond Traditional Assets During Japan’s Debt Crisis? When a major economy like Japan faces such severe financial headwinds, the confidence in conventional assets like government bonds or even certain fiat currencies can waver. Investors typically look for stability and growth, but in a crisis, their priorities shift towards preservation and diversification. The traditional playbook for managing economic uncertainty often involves gold or other precious metals. However, the digital age introduces a new player: cryptocurrencies. These assets offer distinct characteristics that can be appealing in times of economic distress: Decentralization: Unlike fiat currencies, which are controlled by central banks, many cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, making them less susceptible to government policy changes or inflationary pressures. Accessibility: Digital assets are globally accessible, allowing investors to move capital across borders more freely and efficiently than with traditional banking systems. This evolving landscape suggests that Japan’s debt crisis could act as a significant catalyst for broader crypto adoption. The Strategic Appeal of Crypto and Stablecoins Amidst Economic Uncertainty As investors evaluate their options during Japan’s debt crisis , cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, emerge as compelling alternatives. Stablecoins, in particular, are designed to minimize price volatility, often by pegging their value to a stable asset like the US dollar. This characteristic makes them particularly attractive for those looking to preserve capital without exposure to the extreme price swings often associated with other cryptocurrencies. For investors, the potential benefits include: Inflation Hedge: While not all cryptocurrencies are inflation hedges, some, particularly Bitcoin, are seen by proponents as ‘digital gold’ due to their limited supply. Diversification: Adding crypto to a portfolio can offer diversification away from traditional financial markets, potentially reducing overall risk. Ease of Transfer: Cryptocurrencies facilitate quick and low-cost international transfers, which can be crucial for capital flight or securing assets in a different jurisdiction. The move towards these digital assets is not just a speculative gamble; it represents a strategic decision by investors seeking robust alternatives in an increasingly uncertain global economy. Navigating Potential Benefits and Risks for Crypto Adoption While the prospect of cryptocurrencies benefiting from Japan’s debt crisis is exciting, it’s essential to consider both the upsides and the challenges. The increasing institutional interest and growing regulatory frameworks could pave the way for more mainstream adoption, but risks remain. Benefits: Innovation: The crypto space is constantly evolving, offering new financial products and services. Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can provide financial services to the unbanked or underbanked populations. Transparency: Blockchain technology offers a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions. Risks: Volatility: Many cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, meaning their prices can fluctuate dramatically. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for crypto is still developing, which can pose risks for investors. Security Concerns: While blockchain is secure, individual users must take precautions against hacks and scams. Ultimately, the long-term impact of Japan’s economic challenges on crypto adoption will depend on how these benefits and risks are managed by both investors and regulators. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto? Japan’s deepening debt crisis serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional financial systems. As concerns grow, the appeal of alternative assets like cryptocurrencies and stablecoins intensifies. While challenges and risks are part of any emerging market, the unique characteristics of digital assets—such as decentralization, global accessibility, and potential for value preservation—position them as increasingly attractive options for investors seeking to navigate economic turbulence. The unfolding situation in Japan could very well mark a crucial turning point, propelling cryptocurrencies further into the mainstream financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason Japan’s debt crisis could benefit crypto? A1: The primary reason is that as confidence in traditional assets like government bonds erodes due to high debt and inflation, investors seek alternative, more resilient assets. Cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, offer diversification and a potential hedge against economic instability. Q2: What is Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio, and why is it significant? A2: Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 240%. This figure is significant because it indicates that the country’s debt is more than double its annual economic output, raising concerns about its ability to manage and repay its obligations, which can impact investor confidence. Q3: How do stablecoins differ from other cryptocurrencies in this context? A3: Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. This stability makes them particularly appealing during economic uncertainty, as they offer a way to preserve capital without the high volatility typically associated with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Q4: Are there any risks for investors moving into crypto due to Japan’s debt crisis? A4: Yes, risks include the inherent volatility of many cryptocurrencies, the evolving and sometimes uncertain regulatory landscape, and security concerns such as hacks and scams. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. Q5: Could Japan’s situation influence other countries’ approaches to crypto? A5: Potentially, yes. If Japan’s debt crisis indeed leads to a significant shift towards crypto adoption, it could serve as a precedent. Other nations facing similar economic challenges might observe Japan’s experience and consider how digital assets could play a role in their own financial strategies.

Key Takeaways: The Ether Machine has filed an SEC Form S-4 to go public via a SPAC merger with Dynamix Corporation. The firm has amassed 495,362 ETH, valued at over $2.1 billion, making it the third-largest corporate Ethereum holder. Founder Andrew Keys contributed nearly $741 million in ETH, anchoring a treasury backed by over $800 million in institutional funding. The filing, submitted on Form S-4 , relates to the firm’s proposed combination with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Dynamix Corporation, which trades on Nasdaq under the ticker ETHM. The Ether Machine confirmed the move on Tuesday via social media, writing: “We’re shifting into the next gear, and officially on its path to full public form.” Ether Machine–Dynamix Merger Expected to Close in Q4 Originally announced in July, the merger is expected to close in Q4, pending shareholder approval at Dynamix’s upcoming extraordinary general meeting. The Ether Machine has gained attention for rapidly growing its ETH reserves. Earlier this month, the company disclosed it had added 150,000 ETH in August alone , bringing total holdings to 495,362 ETH. The latest investment adds to The Ether Machine’s existing pool of institutional backing. In prior rounds, the company raised more than $800 million from a mix of institutional and strategic investors, including an anchor commitment from co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys. Keys’ initial contribution of 169,984 ETH, now valued at roughly $741 million, has served as a cornerstone of the company’s treasury. The company was formed through the merger of Ether Reserve LLC and blank-check firm Dynamix Corporation. The Ether Machine initially set out to raise over $1.5 billion , courting names such as Blockchain.com, Kraken, and Pantera Capital. As of today, we have confidentially filed our S-4 with the SEC.

In total, the firm has secured commitments for 495,362 ETH, currently worth around $2.16 billion, with approximately $367.1 million available for further acquisitions, assuming no shareholder redemptions. That puts it behind only Bitmine Immersion Tech and SharpLink Gaming among public Ethereum treasuries, according to SER data. SharpLink Deepens Ethereum Strategy as Share Buybacks Top 1.9 Million As reported, SharpLink Gaming has repurchased nearly 1.94 million shares under its buyback program launched in late August, citing undervaluation and strong fundamentals. With no outstanding debt and a net asset value of $3.86 billion (or $18.55 per share), the company is using repurchases as a way to return value to shareholders amid favorable market conditions. At the same time, SharpLink has significantly expanded its Ethereum treasury, now holding 838,152 ETH—most of it staked, generating ongoing yield. Since June, staking rewards have added 3,240 ETH, and the firm’s ETH concentration ratio has nearly doubled, signaling a long-term bet on Ethereum’s role in the digital asset economy. Co-CEO Joseph Chalom says SharpLink aims to become the “MicroStrategy of Ethereum,” aligning shareholder interests with the growth of ETH while showcasing how digital assets can be deployed responsibly. With over $4 billion in ETH exposure and ongoing buybacks, SharpLink is positioning itself as a corporate leader in Ethereum adoption.

Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped exciting news that could reshape your trading strategies. They’ve announced the addition of new SKY margin trading pairs, offering fresh avenues for advanced market participants. What Does This Mean for Your SKY Margin Trading Strategy? Starting at 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 17, Binance will officially list SKY/USDT and SKY/USDC for both cross and isolated margin trading. This significant development expands the utility and accessibility of the Skycoin (SKY) asset, bringing enhanced flexibility to those looking to leverage their positions. For many, the introduction of these pairs on a major platform like Binance signals growing confidence in the underlying asset. It provides traders with the tools to potentially amplify their gains, or even hedge existing spot positions, through sophisticated strategies. Understanding Cross and Isolated Margin Trading If you’re new to the world of margin, these terms might sound a bit complex. Let’s break them down simply: Cross Margin: Your entire margin balance is shared across all open positions. This means that if one position performs poorly, other profitable positions can help cover the margin requirements, potentially preventing liquidation. However, a significant downturn can impact your entire portfolio. Isolated Margin: Margin is allocated independently to each position. If a position goes south, only the margin allocated to that specific trade is at risk. This offers better risk management for individual trades, but you’ll need to manually add margin if a position approaches liquidation. The availability of both options for SKY margin trading empowers users to choose the risk management approach that best suits their individual trading style and market outlook. Why Is Binance Adding SKY Margin Trading Pairs Now? Binance consistently evaluates market demand and asset liquidity before introducing new trading options. The decision to add SKY/USDT and SKY/USDC margin pairs suggests increased interest and stability for the Skycoin project. This move can lead to several benefits: Increased Liquidity: Margin trading typically brings more trading volume, improving the liquidity of the SKY token. Enhanced Trading Opportunities: Traders can speculate on both upward and downward price movements, utilizing leverage to potentially increase returns. Broader Market Participation: Attracts a segment of traders who specifically engage in margin trading, expanding the overall community interacting with SKY. It’s a clear indication that Binance is keen to provide its users with a diverse range of trading instruments, reinforcing its position as a leading exchange. Navigating the Risks of SKY Margin Trading While the prospect of amplified gains is enticing, it’s crucial to remember that margin trading comes with significant risks. Leverage can magnify both profits and losses. A small adverse price movement can lead to substantial losses, potentially exceeding your initial investment. It is paramount to: Understand Leverage: Know how much leverage you are using and its implications. Implement Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders and only trade with capital you can afford to lose. Conduct Due Diligence: Research Skycoin (SKY) thoroughly before engaging in leveraged trading. Binance often provides educational resources on margin trading, and it’s highly recommended that users familiarize themselves with these materials before diving in. Ready to Explore SKY Margin Trading on Binance? The addition of these new pairs opens up a new chapter for Skycoin traders on Binance. Whether you’re an experienced margin trader looking for new opportunities or considering exploring advanced strategies, this development is worth noting. Always approach margin trading with caution, a clear strategy, and a solid understanding of the market dynamics. This expansion by Binance reflects the continuous evolution of the crypto market, where sophisticated tools are becoming increasingly available to a wider audience. The future of SKY margin trading looks set for increased activity. Frequently Asked Questions About SKY Margin Trading Here are some common questions about Binance’s new SKY margin trading pairs: Q1: What is Skycoin (SKY)? A1: Skycoin (SKY) is the native cryptocurrency of the Skycoin project, which aims to build a new internet based on a decentralized mesh network, focusing on privacy, security, and net neutrality. Q2: What is the main difference between cross and isolated margin? A2: Cross margin uses your entire margin balance to cover all open positions, potentially sharing risk. Isolated margin allocates a specific amount of margin to each position, limiting risk to that individual trade. Q3: When will the SKY/USDT and SKY/USDC margin pairs be available for trading? A3: The new SKY margin trading pairs will be effective starting 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 17. Q4: Is margin trading suitable for beginners?

This milestone underscores Bybit’s commitment to supporting Vietnam’s digital asset ecosystem and deepening long-term cooperation in building Da Nang into a hub for international finance and innovation. Da Nang, one of Vietnam’s largest cities and a major economic center, has been approved to deploy a blockchain sandbox — making it a natural location for the country to pilot progressive policies and attract international partnerships in digital assets and blockchain technology. Under the MOU, the partners will jointly support the city’s vision to establish an International Financial Center (IFC) through three core pillars: Digital asset liquidity to connect Da Nang with global financial markets. Ecosystem connectivity to link Vietnam with leading international finance hubs. Infrastructure security to ensure a resilient, risk-controlled environment for blockchain innovation. The partnership is key to translating national strategies into local implementation, ensuring that the IFC model is both policy-flexible and risk-controlled - minimizing exposure to threats targeting digital asset ecosystems. The MOU underscores mutual commitments. Da Nang will facilitate administrative procedures for the partners to invest, open offices, and integrate into the IFC. In turn, Bybit and its partners will offer policy consultation on digital assets and blockchain technology, share international best practices, and support Da Nang in building a modern regulatory framework. Helen Liu, Co-CEO of Bybit, said: ""Vietnam is an inspiring example of a nation embracing digital transformation, and we are honored to contribute to its journey. Bybit is committed to sharing our global expertise in blockchain and digital asset innovation to support Da Nang’s vision of becoming an International Financial Center. This partnership reflects our belief in building sustainable ecosystems hand in hand with governments, institutions, and trusted partners."" This collaboration builds on Bybit’s earlier engagement in Vietnam. In April 2025, Bybit Co-Founder and CEO Ben Zhou met with H.E. Nguyen Van Thang, Minister of Finance of Vietnam, at the Ministry of Finance headquarters in Hanoi. During the meeting, Bybit expressed strong support for Vietnam’s regulatory sandbox initiative and its vision to establish a safe, transparent, and innovation-friendly digital asset ecosystem. Discussions focused on the Government’s plan to launch a pilot sandbox mechanism to test the issuance and trading of crypto assets in a controlled environment, with robust safeguards such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols to protect investors and strengthen financial security. Today’s MOU marks a natural continuation of these efforts, reaffirming Bybit’s role as a long-term partner in Vietnam’s digital transformation journey.

51863968,582909,1758096013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51863968.jpeg,"Ethereum & Altcoins Capture 85% Of Futures Trading, Bitcoin Share Shrinks",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-altcoins-85-futures-bitcoin-share-shrinks/,"Data shows Bitcoin has lost interest to Ethereum and altcoins recently as their combined futures volume has broken past the 85% mark. Ethereum & Altcoins Have Seen Their Futures Volume Rise Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the futures trading volume share of Ethereum and the altcoins . The futures trading volume here naturally refers to the amount that’s becoming involved in futures-related trades on the various derivatives exchanges. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the dominance in this metric for ETH and the alts over the last couple of years: As is visible in the graph, the futures trading volume dominance has seen a sharp increase for the altcoins recently, implying that speculative interest in these coins has gone up. The metric is still significantly down for Ethereum compared to its earlier high, but it has nonetheless also enjoyed an uptick at the same time as the altcoin growth. Combined, ETH and the alts occupy around 85.2% of the total cryptocurrency futures trading volume following the increase. This means that the remaining portion, Bitcoin, has gone below 15% in dominance. Historically, periods like these have been a bad omen for not just BTC, but the market as a whole. Examples of these are visible in the chart during both the late 2024 and Summer 2025 price tops. Thus, considering that Ethereum and the altcoins are once again dominating futures trading activity, it’s possible that Bitcoin and other assets may be in for some volatility. In some other news, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared in an X post an update on how the various projects in the digital asset sector rank up in terms of the Development Activity . This indicator measures the total amount of work that the developers of a given project are doing on its public GitHub repositories. The metric makes its measurement in units of “events,” where one event is any action taken by the developer on the repository, like the push of a commit or creation of a fork. Here is the table posted by Santiment that shows the ranking for cryptocurrency projects on the basis of their 30-day Development Activity: As displayed above, Ethereum is only the 10th largest project in terms of 30-day Development Activity, despite its market cap being second only to Bitcoin. The project that’s seeing its developers work the hardest right now is Internet Computer (ICP), which has the metric sitting at a value nearly three times that of ETH’s. ETH Price Ethereum recovered above $4,750 earlier, but it seems the asset’s price has once again faced a pullback as it’s now back at $4,450.",Ethereum|altcoins|Altcoins Futures Volume|bitcoin|btc|ETH|Ethereum Futures Volume|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|ALTCOIN|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 08:00:13

XRP and the Banking System SMQKE stated that XRP is integrated into regulated systems processing trillions of dollars daily. He stressed that his presentation was based on verifiable documentation, not speculation, making it a rare disclosure of XRP’s role in global finance. Interledger Protocol He explained that Ripple’s ILP , introduced in 2012, was created to connect otherwise incompatible blockchains and traditional ledgers. ILP routes payments across independent networks, offering scalability, privacy, and interoperability. RippleNet, Ripple’s payments network, is built on ILP and uses XRP for liquidity. According to SMQKE, banks prefer ILP for its ability to scale while maintaining transaction secrecy. The Single Most Important XRP Video You’ll Ever Watch. https://t.co/911qz6lO6x — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 14, 2025 ISO 20022 Compliance SMQKE highlighted the link between ILP and ISO 20022, the new global messaging standard replacing SWIFT. XRP is among the few ISO 20022-compliant assets , giving it direct compatibility with banking systems. He cited RippleNet’s use of ISO 20022 PACS-008 messages and Standard Chartered Bank’s recognition of XRP as a native ISO 20022 token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 International Finance Bank Evidence SMQKE pointed to the International Finance Bank (IFB), which has adopted ILP in its settlement framework. IFB is compliant with Basel, FATF-16, DORA, and EU sanctions. Its payment matrix shows scenarios where XRP is chosen, such as when counterparties are Ripple-native or when XRP liquidity provides cost advantages. Ripple’s presence alongside traditional rails like SWIFT GPI and SEPA Instant was described as confirmation of XRP’s role in banking infrastructure. He concluded that RippleNet already covers 90 percent of the global foreign exchange market and partners with over 100 banks, including tier-one institutions, covering more than 80 percent of trade corridors. SMQKE explained that banks are prepared to use XRP as a liquidity bridge once its market capitalization supports large-scale adoption. SMQKE’s presentation framed XRP as an integrated part of banking infrastructure through ILP and ISO 20022 standards. He presented evidence that banks are already positioned to utilize XRP for liquidity, with the framework for adoption firmly in place.

But now, Remittix (RTX) is gaining serious attention with its bold vision and rapid growth. Some analysts are even wondering if Ripple could be losing market share to this fast-rising project. Ripple Battles $3 Resistance as ETF Launch Boosts Sentiment XRP is currently trading around $3.03. In a recent interview with Paul Barron, Claver highlighted multiple catalysts, including the upcoming launch of the REX-Osprey XRPR ETF , the first-ever spot exchange-traded fund for XRP. Well-known trader Papa shared a bullish chart indicating XRP could surge to $8.50 by November, while popular crypto analyst WhaleGuru made an even more explosive prediction of $300. source: @mamagucci on X Despite the bullish XRP news and optimistic predictions, Ripple’s token has struggled to make a decisive breakout. Recent on-chain data reveals a sharp decline in Coinbase’s XRP cold wallet holdings, plunging from 970 million XRP three months ago to just 98 million XRP today. However, despite this dramatic drop, XRP’s price has managed to stay above the crucial $3 level, indicating that strong buying demand is stepping in. This tug-of-war reflects growing uncertainty as Remittix continues to rise, challenging Ripple’s dominance in the cross-border payments space. Why Remittix Is Gaining Attention Fast Remittix has quickly become the best crypto to buy now . The project has achieved remarkable milestones in a short period of time. It recently crossed $25.9 million raised, with over 664 million tokens sold at $0.1080 each. Remittix has also officially confirmed BitMart and LBank as its first CEX partners. The team has also already launched its beta wallet, which allows users to store, send, and receive RTX securely. On top of that, Remittix recently passed a comprehensive security audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted names in blockchain security. Investors can also earn 15% of every referral purchase, paid instantly in USDT and claimable every 24 hours. Here’s why Remittix is the top crypto under $1 : Over $25.9 million raised, showing strong global investor confidence. First exchange listings confirmed with BitMart and LBank, creating massive excitement for the public launch. Beta wallet already live, giving users a functional tool to manage their RTXX tokens. CertiK security audit passed and ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens. Built to transform global remittances, tapping into a trillion-dollar cross-border payments market. Could Ripple Be Losing Market Share to Remittix? The latest XRP news shows that Ripple still has strong backing and bullish predictions. However, Remittix is quickly proving that it’s the next 100x altcoin . For investors looking to diversify, Remittix could deliver much higher upside potential, especially for those who get in early enough.

The filings show that a TaskUs employee, Ashita Mishra, helped plan the theft of confidential customer information and funneled it to criminals who used it in phishing schemes. Coinbase revealed in May that the breach had affected at least 69,000 customers, and the damage was estimated to be worth around $400 million. The exchange initially linked the breach to a rogue staff member in an Indian-based vendor. The amended court filings outline how Mishra, a TaskUs service center employee, stole the information beginning in September 2024. TaskUs employee allegedly sold customer data The latest lawsuit alleges that Ashita Mishra, a TaskUs employee in Indore, India, sold confidential customer data, including Social Security numbers and bank details, to a phishing hacker group. She also recruited other TaskUs employees to carry out the breach in a style described as a hub-and-spoke conspiracy. The investigators uncovered over 10,000 Coinbase customer data points on Mishra’s phone. Mishra was allegedly paid $200 per data record, which she captured for up to 200 customers. The hacker group behind the breach was associated with a loose group called ‘the Comm,’ who used the stolen data to impersonate Coinbase staff and deceive customers into giving up their crypto holdings. According to the latest findings , the breach was disclosed in May. The petitioners argued that TaskUs took extra steps to hide the extent of the compromise, including the dismissal of 226 employees in January and the termination of its internal HR team. TaskUs has been accused of misleading regulators by downplaying the breach in its February Form 10-K filing. The filing omitted any revelation of a material incident despite the outsourcer later dismissing hundreds of staff linked to the breach. The Indian vendor allegedly continued to assure the regulators that it faced no material breach even as it pursued a $1.6 billion buyout deal with Blackstone. Coinbase has distanced itself from the vendor. It immediately notified the regulators and affected customers, reimbursed the impacted accounts, tightened the internal controls, and ended its partnership with TaskUs. In a statement by a Coinbase spokesperson, the exchange refused to pay the criminals and instead created a $20 million reward for information leading to the arrest and convictions. Coinbase says the vendor actions were systemic TaskUs, headquartered in Texas, has not yet responded to the accusations but has previously reiterated its commitment to safeguarding client data and confirmed that it has strengthened its security protocols. Coinbase alleged that TaskUs’ actions were systemic and not isolated, citing violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act, which covers unfair practices. Regulators are expected to take the next step to assess whether TaskUs used sufficient safeguarding methods, such as encryption or multi-factor authentication. They will also assess whether the risk could be avoided and whether the breach exposed customers to identity theft or financial loss. Coinbase, on the other hand, has received multiple lawsuits from the affected customers, although the exchange has so far sought to consolidate the claims and move the case to arbitration. Cryptopolitan reported in May that Binance and Kraken may have also been involved in social engineering attacks similar to Coinbase’s. The report stated that hackers attempted to bribe Binance employees to steal sensitive information, even sharing Telegram contacts to coordinate. Binance utilized AI-driven monitoring to flag and stop the conversations, alongside limiting access to user data for verified customer-initiated calls. Kraken, on its part, denied the allegations, saying it had already warned Coinbase of suspicious activities before its breach. Get seen where it counts.

51864516,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/a-closer-look-at-the-real-world-use-cases-of-fasttoken-ftn,1758096585,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/51864516.jpeg,A Closer Look at the Real-World Use Cases of Fasttoken (FTN),https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/a-closer-look-at-the-real-world-use-cases-of-fasttoken-ftn,"Since launching less than three years ago, Fasttoken (FTN) has made good on its promise to facilitate fast, secure, low-cost transactions in a range of domains, from iGaming to lending. While many utility tokens lack practicality outside their native realms, Fasttoken's adoption and integration across gaming, e-commerce, and payments highlight the value of digital assets beyond mere speculation. The native currency of the Bahamut blockchain, an EVM-compatible Layer-1 with a Proof of Stake and Activity (PoSA) mechanism, FTN has found favor with gamers, stakers, developers \and merchants alike. For the uninitiated, we've taken a deep dive into the real-world uses of this crypto asset as its third anniversary draws closer. Strong Foundations: The Bahamut Blockchain Fasttoken derives its name from its progenitor Fastex , a multifaceted network of blockchain services. These services extend far beyond the Bahamut network, encompassing an eponymous trading exchange, NFT marketplace (ftNFT) for digital collectibles, payment arm (Fastex Pay), and 3D metaverse platform (YoCerebrum) designed to host customizable spaces for virtual events, conferences and concerts. Needless to say, the chain upon which a token is minted is vital to its success – and that's certainly the case here. Bahamut is no ordinary network, employing a novel PoSA consensus mechanism that combines staking with active participation. In other words, validators are motivated to not just hold tokens but deploy and maintain smart contracts. The net result? Amplified security, efficiency and network effects. While the consensus mechanism is unique, the use-cases of FTN within Bahamut itself are fairly typical, in that it is utilized to facilitate transactions and secure the network. At present, over 40 million FTN is locked in Bahamut's staking smart contracts and liquid staking dApps, while another 10 million is ring-fenced for the Bahamut Grants Program. With a market cap of $1.9 billion and holdings in over 7 million wallets, FTN's momentum is undeniably impressive considering it's less than three years old. The Uses of FTN in iGaming and Web3 Clearly, FTN has plenty of utility within the Fastex world; but that's to be expected since they designed it for that reason. What about beyond that world? One of the most compelling use-cases for the token lies in the gaming sector, where speed, economy and interoperability are paramount. Since early 2023, Fasttoken has been the primary payment method for BetConstruct, a leading provider of iGaming and betting solutions. The latter's ecosystem includes a decentralized casino platform built directly on Bahamut, as well as a comprehensive sportsbook, and with users able to deposit, wager, and withdraw FTN seamlessly, they can take advantage of cheap transactions and fast settlement. It's not just BetConstruct either: over 70 major iGaming suppliers have integrated Fasttoken in one form or another. Away from iGaming, FTN has been woven into a raft of Web3 applications (dApps) including those concerned with gaming and staking. Apps like Ortak, Lolik, YoHealth and Mutuari leverage FTN in multiple ways, granting utility while incentivizing hodling. Of course, Fastex's Web3 suite puts the token to good use too: the aforementioned ftNFT marketplace and YoCerebrum metaverse are priced in FTN. Bridging Crypto and Commerce In today’s world, the ability to actually spend your crypto assets counts for a lot. In this regard, Fasttoken is well-covered, serving as a versatile payment option thanks to its integration with not only Fastex Pay but also Simplex, Banxa, CoinPayments, CryptoPay, AEON and other infrastructure entities. Thanks to these partnerships, it is extremely easy for merchants to accept FTN for goods and services, and thus for FTN users to spend their tokens whenever the notion takes them. The recently-announced partnership with AEON alone instantly enabled FTN holders to make transactions at over 20 million global retailers. Naturally, the integration of Fasttoken with major payment platforms doesn’t just make the asset spendable. It makes it easier to cash out, to switch from crypto-to-fiat or fiat-to-crypto. For example, those utilizing FTN for the purposes of staking may prefer to cash out their profits to USD while retaining the deposit. Of course, you can’t contemplate spending FTN tokens without first acquiring them. Fortunately, the token is listed and actively traded on around a dozen top-tier exchanges, among them Gate.io, MEXC, BitGet, and Bybit, ensuring deep liquidity and optimal trading conditions. An FTN Future From powering high-stakes iGaming to enabling lending and e-commerce payments, Fasttoken reflects the power of Web3 tech to drive efficiency and deliver meaningful value. By securing numerous partnerships and integrations, Fastex has succeeded in fostering real-world interactions with crypto at the core.

This strategic initiative involves establishing two new subsidiaries, signaling a bold step forward in its Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy. The company is set to launch Bitcoin Japan in its home country and Metaplanet Income in the United States, aiming to deepen its engagement with the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Behind Metaplanet Bitcoin’s Latest Strategic Move? Metaplanet’s decision to create these new entities reflects a deliberate effort to solidify its position within the global Bitcoin ecosystem. By extending its reach, the company aims to not only manage its existing Bitcoin holdings more effectively but also to explore new avenues for growth and adoption. This move is a clear indication of Metaplanet’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The establishment of these subsidiaries comes at a time when institutional interest in Bitcoin is soaring. Companies worldwide are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, prompting many to consider similar treasury strategies. Metaplanet, however, stands out as a pioneer in Japan with its aggressive adoption. Unpacking the Vision: Bitcoin Japan and Metaplanet Income Let’s delve deeper into what each new subsidiary is poised to achieve: Bitcoin Japan: This entity will focus on the domestic Japanese market. Its primary goals are expected to include promoting Bitcoin education, facilitating easier access to Bitcoin for Japanese investors and businesses, and potentially developing localized Bitcoin-related services. This could involve everything from educational seminars to partnerships with local financial institutions. Metaplanet Income: Positioned in the United States, this subsidiary likely aims to tap into the mature and dynamic U.S. cryptocurrency market. While specific details are forthcoming, its name “Metaplanet Income” suggests a focus on generating yield from Bitcoin holdings or exploring investment opportunities within the U.S. digital asset space. This could involve lending, staking, or other sophisticated financial strategies leveraging Bitcoin. These two entities represent a dual-pronged approach, tackling both regional market penetration and advanced financial strategies, all centered around the Metaplanet Bitcoin vision. Why is Metaplanet Bitcoin Doubling Down Now? The timing of Metaplanet’s expansion is no coincidence. Several factors likely contribute to this accelerated embrace of Bitcoin: Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and currency devaluations, make Bitcoin an attractive alternative for corporate treasuries. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply offer a compelling contrast to traditional fiat currencies. Increasing Institutional Acceptance: The past few years have seen a significant shift in how traditional finance views Bitcoin. With major asset managers launching Bitcoin ETFs and increasing regulatory clarity in some regions, the path for corporate adoption is becoming clearer. Shareholder Value: Companies like MicroStrategy have demonstrated that a significant Bitcoin treasury can attract a new class of investors and potentially boost shareholder value, despite market volatility. Metaplanet appears to be following a similar strategic playbook. This proactive stance by Metaplanet Bitcoin highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. Challenges and Opportunities for Metaplanet Bitcoin While the prospects are exciting, Metaplanet’s expansion into new territories with Bitcoin-focused operations also comes with its set of challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscapes in both Japan and the U.S. will be crucial. Each jurisdiction has unique requirements for digital asset businesses, and compliance will be paramount. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile. While Metaplanet has shown resilience in managing its existing holdings, expanding operations means increased exposure and the need for robust risk management strategies. Operational Complexities: Establishing and running new subsidiaries in different countries requires significant operational expertise, including staffing, legal compliance, and technological infrastructure. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges. Metaplanet could cement its position as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption, attracting further investment and talent. Its move could also inspire other Japanese companies to explore similar strategies, driving broader adoption of Metaplanet Bitcoin initiatives in the region. In conclusion, Metaplanet’s decision to launch Bitcoin Japan and Metaplanet Income marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company, but for the wider corporate adoption of Bitcoin. This bold expansion reinforces Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a global treasury asset and sets a precedent for how traditional companies can strategically integrate digital assets into their long-term vision. As Metaplanet continues to lead with its innovative Metaplanet Bitcoin approach, the financial world watches eagerly, anticipating the ripple effects of this strategic move.

Every week, some “next-gen” token claims to be the one that changes everything. Most disappear in months. So when you hear about x1000 project , it’s natural to raise an eyebrow. What is it really? Another pump-and-dump? Or something with actual tech behind it? I’ve dug into the project’s docs, looked at the team’s approach, and tested the tools myself. And I can tell you - while x1000 isn’t flawless, it’s not just smoke and mirrors either. What Exactly Is the X1000 Project? x1000 is positioned as an ecosystem for algorithmic trading and DeFi, not just a standalone token. x1000 presents itself as more than just a token. It’s an ecosystem built around algorithmic trading and decentralized finance. At its core, the project aims to give traders - from complete beginners to seasoned pros - a single hub where they can access automation, analytics, on-chain AI analysis, Twitter-based market sentiment insights, and staking mechanisms. Instead of bouncing between five different apps, you get everything under one roof. It combines three main parts: On-chain AI analytics and sentiment tools: already live and helping users track blockchain activity and social trends. Staking X1000: live feature that allows token holders to earn rewards. Future roadmap: yield farming, DAO governance, advanced bots for trading automation, and arbitrage scanners are all planned, but not yet launched. The goal? Make it easier for both beginners and pros to trade smarter without juggling 10 different platforms. Technology: Why X1000 Feels Faster Than Competitors Here’s the tricky part: running everything on-chain is transparent but slow. That’s why x1000 uses a hybrid architecture: On-chain: transactions, smart contracts, user funds → ensures transparency and trust. Off-chain: heavy data crunching, AI models, and bot logic → ensures speed and efficiency. This way, you don’t get the usual lag that makes some crypto bots useless when markets move fast. What makes x1000 interesting is its focus on accessibility. Most trading automation platforms are intimidating: you need coding knowledge, advanced market understanding, and a lot of time to configure them. x1000 is trying to lower that barrier. If you’re new, you can start with ready-made trading strategies that run with minimal setup. If you’re experienced, the system still gives you room to tweak bots, combine them with DeFi options, and customize strategies. In that sense, it feels a bit like having both a beginner-friendly autopilot and a manual gearbox for those who want more control. The true engine behind X1000 is its AI layer. Unlike projects that only drop “AI” as a buzzword, here the tools are practical and already live: On-chain activity analysis. AI tracks wallet flows, token swaps, and liquidity movements, highlighting abnormal spikes that may signal whale actions or early trends. Market sentiment from Twitter and social feeds. Algorithms measure engagement, mood, and hype around projects in real time, showing when the community starts to shift bullish or bearish. Risk scoring. Instead of raw data, the system assigns risk levels to tokens and trading pairs, helping traders filter noise. Smart signal generation. AI combines on-chain patterns with sentiment and liquidity depth to generate actionable alerts, not just charts. Why is this important? Because in crypto, speed and context matter more than raw numbers. Retail traders rarely have the bandwidth to monitor multiple blockchains, liquidity pools, and Twitter accounts at once. X1000’s AI compresses that flood of data into simple insights: “This token is gaining traction on-chain,” or “Market mood is shifting bearish on X.” This gives both newcomers and professionals a practical edge - one that is usually reserved for hedge funds with entire quant teams. Tokenomics: More Than Just Another Coin The x1000 token is the backbone of the ecosystem. The x1000 token is not just a speculative asset floating around exchanges. It plays an active role in the ecosystem. Users can stake it for rewards, use it for paying for premium analytics and AI insights. Governance via DAO is not live yet, but it’s clearly stated in the roadmap. The supply mechanics are worth noting: capped supply and periodic burns. This combination of scarcity and utility makes the token more resilient than many short-lived coins. Analysts estimate that, if adoption grows and the roadmap is executed, the token has realistic potential to reach a $100M market cap - a milestone that would significantly strengthen its position among AI-driven crypto projects. Now, if you’ve read reviews online, you’ve probably seen concerns. Let’s tackle them directly. “The token is volatile.” → True, but so is every early-stage crypto. That’s not a bug; it’s the market. “What if adoption is slow?” → That’s always a risk, but the project is shipping real tools, not just a roadmap. That’s more than half the space can say. So yes, there are risks, but they’re the normal risks of crypto, not red flags unique to X1000. Practical Tools for Traders This is where the project moves from theory to practice. X1000 isn’t just about holding tokens; it’s about using them. AI-powered analytics: on-chain data processing and Twitter sentiment tracking. Staking X1000: allowing users to earn passive rewards. Instead of giving vague “AI will change crypto” promises, they’re shipping tools you can test today. Let’s be blunt: there are plenty of trading platforms. So why X1000? Plenty of projects talk about automation and AI. Few actually deliver tools that are usable right now. X1000’s main advantage is speed, thanks to its hybrid design. Add to that its flexibility across multiple blockchains and a transparent set of smart contracts, and you have a platform that stands out in a space where buzzwords often outweigh results. Future Outlook: Where X1000 Could Go If the team delivers, here’s what X1000 could evolve into: A go-to hub for algorithmic trading, similar to what MetaTrader did for forex. A trusted DeFi toolkit with staking and farming under one roof. A governance-driven ecosystem where token holders shape the product. And given the rising hype around AI-driven trading, the timing is on point. Another angle worth noting: the X1000 community is growing, and the team is active in keeping people updated. Regular AMAs, roadmap releases, and smart contract audits show they’re not hiding. Compare that to projects that go silent for months - X1000’s openness is a strong signal. Conclusion X1000 is not a guaranteed moonshot, but it’s far from being an empty hype coin. Unlike projects that only promise bots and DeFi, X1000 already delivers working AI-powered tools: on-chain analysis, Twitter sentiment, and staking. Yes, trading automation and arbitrage scanners are still ahead, but the roadmap is realistic. The technology makes sense, the tokenomics are thought out, and the vision is backed by real progress. Considering the potential to reach a $100M market cap, X1000 positions itself as more than speculation — it feels like an early-stage AI startup in crypto. There’s risk, of course, but also clear upside. FAQs 1. What makes X1000 different from other crypto bots?The hybrid system: off-chain speed + on-chain transparency. 2. Does the token have real utility?Yes — staking, governance, payments, and unlocking platform features. 3. How safe is it to use?Smart contracts are auditable, and funds remain on-chain. Still, it’s crypto, so risks exist. 4. Is it beginner-friendly?Definitely. You can deploy pre-built bots in a few clicks, no coding required. 5. Could X1000 actually grow long term?If adoption continues and the roadmap is met, it could become a serious player in algorithmic trading.

The upcoming Binance Alpha DL listing on September 19th signifies the introduction of a new digital asset, “DL,” to this exclusive trading ecosystem.

This integration simplifies the process of managing funds and executing trades for these emerging assets. When approaching any early-stage listing, including DL, thorough research is paramount. While Binance Alpha provides a platform, individual due diligence remains crucial. Investors should: Examine the project’s whitepaper: Understand its technology, use case, and roadmap. Assess the team: Look for experienced developers and advisors. Analyze tokenomics: Understand the supply, distribution, and vesting schedules. Monitor community sentiment: Engage with the project’s social channels. These steps help in making informed decisions and managing the inherent risks associated with new ventures in the crypto space. Furthermore, remember that market volatility is common for early-stage projects. What Opportunities Does the Binance Alpha DL Listing Present? The addition of DL to Binance Alpha creates several exciting opportunities. Firstly, it offers early access to a potentially innovative project, allowing investors to be part of its foundational growth. Secondly, it enhances the diversity of assets available within the Binance ecosystem, providing more choices for those seeking high-growth potential. Moreover, the listing could bring increased visibility and liquidity to the DL project itself, fostering its development and community engagement. For Binance Alpha users, it reinforces the platform’s commitment to continuously expanding its offerings with carefully selected early-stage assets, maintaining its position as a go-to for cutting-edge crypto opportunities. The Binance Alpha DL listing on September 19th is more than just another coin addition; it represents a continued commitment to fostering innovation and providing unique investment avenues within the decentralized finance landscape. For savvy investors, this could be an excellent opportunity to explore the next wave of promising digital assets. As always, remember to conduct your own research and invest wisely.

The coin’s price faces new guesses and possible shocks, with a key ETF launch and fresh signals from the Federal Reserve all set for this month. Investors and fans alike wait to see which way the odds will turn. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ , the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet . Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin trades between $0.23 and $0.31 after a lively week. The coin climbed 10.57% in 7 days, 15.69% in a month, and a solid 50.14% over 6 months. The 10-day average sits at $0.27, almost on top of the 100-day line at $0.28, showing price is coiling for a clear move. Momentum signals show a tug-of-war. RSI at 47.81 is neutral, while a Stochastic reading of 68.33 tilts bullish but not overheated. MACD is barely negative at ‑0.0014, hinting that bears have not seized control. If buyers push above $0.31, the nearest ceiling is $0.35. A break there could unlock $0.43, adding roughly 40% from today’s mid-range. Failure to hold $0.23 opens a slide toward $0.18, about 25% lower. Long-term holders still point to that 50% six-month jump as proof of strength, yet short-term traders wait for a spark. Watch $0.27 as the pivot. Above it, bulls press for fresh highs; below it, the support bench comes into play fast. Conclusion DOGE stays bullish through Q4, but XYZVerse (XYZ) rises as the first all-sport memecoin, targeting 20,000% growth with a community-led GameFi plan that could crown it the next cultural icon.

The partnership brings to Saudi banking Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), a step towards onchain financial services. The CCIP facilitates secure cross-chain transfers of assets and data. This functionality bridges decentralized applications and traditional financial platforms, opening up the path for the seamless integration of tokenized assets, programmable contracts, and real-time settlement mechanisms. CRE provides SAB with a developer-friendly platform for testing, building, and deploying next-generation banking tools reliably and securely. In a tweet on X, SAB noted, “This collaboration marks a pivotal step in our commitment to drive Financial Innovation in Saudi Arabia.” Through these technologies, SAB has the ability to test new applications such as automated lending, tokenization of physical assets, and faster cross-border payments. Tokenization is relevant to financial markets, where stocks, bonds, and real estate can be digitally represented for easier and safer transactions. Smart contracts can also make loans and insurance contracts more efficient by automating the process and cutting down on paperwork and operational delay. Saudi Awwal Bank ( @alawwalsab ), one of Saudi Arabia’s largest banks with over $100 billion in total assets, is leveraging several Chainlink services to facilitate the deployment of next-generation onchain applications in Saudi Arabia.

Earlier this year, in a message on his vision for 2030, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom would “turn the Public Investment Fund into the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Our nation holds strong investment capabilities, which we will harness to stimulate our economy and diversify our revenues,” he said. Early stages of the collaboration will include pilot projects that will test the viability of blockchain in live banking environments. These trials will include cybersecurity safeguards, regulatory alignment, and customer education. Chainlink’s built-in security standards and compliance ethos help advance SAB’s objective of bringing solutions that comply with domestic and international best practices. In April, Saudi Arabia also announced that it has invested in almost 40 U.S. venture capital firms, with several targeting cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 initiatives. Sanabil, the investment arm of the Public Investment Fund, is central to this push. The firm invests approximately $2 billion per year in several funding rounds to support companies developing innovative business models. Expanding Saudi banking through blockchain partnerships The partnership with Chainlink furthers SAB’s history of blockchain adoption. Earlier this year, SAB led the world’s first Islamic Repo using blockchain in collaboration with Oumla, a Saudi-based blockchain infrastructure provider. The transaction enabled the bank to lend funds to its peers according to Islamic finance regulations, while using blockchain to increase speed, transparency, and safety. SAB has also held a virtual assets summit to demonstrate its digital ambitions and opportunities in tokenized finance. Saudi Arabia’s blockchain hype goes beyond SAB. Oumla, in partnership with Avalanche, recently announced plans to construct the nation’s first Layer 1 blockchain that will be fully hosted within the Kingdom. The project aims to support startups and small businesses, support technological development, and grow the regional Web3 ecosystem. Following the announcement, Chainlink is up 3.36% in the last 24 hours, trading at $23.40.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Named Top Crypto to Buy for the 2025–26 Bull Run,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/from-0-035-to-10-mutuum-finance-mutm-named-top-crypto-to-buy-for-the-2025-26-bull-run/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is predicted to skyrocket from $0.035 to hit $10 in 2025, making it one of the top talked-about cryptos. Mutuum Finance is currently in its sixth phase of presale. The tokens are being sold at $0.035 per MUTM. The project has raised over $15.85 million and has over 16,340 holders. In contrast to the majority of crypto projects that are based on market sentiment, Mutuum Finance is building steam on the basis of its actual use case as a decentralized borrowing and lending protocol. Analysts point to its parabolic rise and growing utilization as signs that MUTM could disrupt investor expectations, setting it apart from more speculative assets and firmly putting it on the radar as the top crypto to invest in for the next cycle. Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance possesses strong protection measures for any collateralized asset in order to ensure protocol’s and users’ security. They include target collateral ratios, lending and deposit caps. In an attempt to encourage systemic stability, off close undercollateralized positions are incentivized to be liquidated, call penalties and charge liquidation guarantee remediation in a timely manner. Collateral effectiveness is maximized in the correlated assets, i.e., lending power is increased proportionally to Loan-to-Value (LTV) levels in securely collateralized lending. Reserve factors are supplied as a hedge against exceptional market circumstances, and excess reserves can be imposed on highly volatile assets to charge for volatility. Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has seen more than 16,340 investors buy in to raise $15.85 million amid unimaginable demand. In pursuit of better security and transparency, the project is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Through the program, vulnerabilities can be submitted by researchers and developers, with the reward set on four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. Dynamic Interest Rate Adjustments Mutuum Finance is based on a floating interest rate system that changes depending on the liquidity level. Borrowing is cheap when there is high liquidity and leaves room for higher utilization. Borrowing is expensive when there is low liquidity, leaving room for loan repayment and higher deposits. This helps in balancing the system as well as avoiding over-borrowing. The long-term strategy of Mutuum Finance is to have high-exchange listings to offer liquidity as well as real-world adoption. Further, the project is also incentivizing early adoption by conducting a $100,000 giveaway campaign with $10,000 MUTM rewards for 10 participants. Reclaiming Market Volatility and Preserving Liquidity Mutuum Finance is extremely sensitive to having the correct on-chain liquidity in order not to liquidate low-slippage, low-quality positions. The LTV ratios and liquidation levels are extremely sensitive to the volatility of the underlying token. Tokens that are less volatile and more stable can have higher borrow amounts and lower liquidation levels, whereas riskier and more volatile tokens can have more conservative parameters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most watched tokens of the 2025–26 bull cycle, with analysts calling for it to hit $10. Already in Presale Phase 6, MUTM has collected $15.85M and added 16,340+ investors, demonstrating high demand and early accumulation. Unlike hype projects, MUTM provides genuine real-world DeFi utility with lending and borrowing protocols underpinned by dynamic interest rates and robust risk management, as well as a $50K CertiK bug bounty for security peace of mind. It is that utility, security, and scalability combination that has so many labeling it as the best crypto to keep an eye on. Lock your tokens in Phase 6 today before Stage 7’s increasing price.

51867254,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=822984,1758101407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51867254.jpeg,Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? Confluence Of Signals Says Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/is-the-dogecoin-bottom-in-signals-says-yes/,"The Dogecoin daily chart is clustering several classical support signals around $0.256–$0.265, as highlighted by Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) via X: “DOGE finding support. Tweezer bottom. 0.382 linear fib holding. AVWAP from cycle high holding.” On the Coinbase DOGE/USD one-day view shown, price is reclaiming the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $0.26537 while riding the Anchored VWAP drawn from the cycle high, with yesterday’s session marked at an open of $0.26840, high $0.27214, low $0.25680 and last $0.27119. What This Means For Dogecoin Price For readers less familiar with the terms, a “tweezer bottom” is a two-bar reversal formation in which consecutive candles print almost identical lows after a decline. The repeated low shows that dip buyers defended the same price on back-to-back sessions, and the intraday wicks rejecting that level often indicate absorption of sell pressure. In the chart, the twin lows cluster exactly into the $0.265 area, giving a clean reference for risk. On higher timeframes such as the daily, this pattern is watched because it defines a precise inflection without requiring a long basing process; confirmation is typically evaluated by whether subsequent candles hold above those lows and push through the interim highs of the pattern. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could See Another Double-Digit Surge This Week As These Developments Take Place The 0.382 “linear fib” refers to a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement calculated on a linear price scale from the prior swing extremes drawn on the chart. In practical terms, it marks a shallow retracement level where trends frequently pause or resume. Here, that retracement prints at $0.26537, almost perfectly overlapping the tweezer lows. “Holding” in the analyst’s note means price probed the level intraday but closed back above it, preserving it as support rather than converting it to resistance. AVWAP—the Anchored Volume-Weighted Average Price—is the running average price of all trades since a chosen starting point, weighted by traded volume, with that starting point “anchored” to a specific candle. The anchor here is the cycle high visible on the left side of the chart. Functionally, this AVWAP (drawn as the blue band) represents the composite cost basis of market participants from that top onward. When price is below an AVWAP anchored to a major high, it often behaves as dynamic resistance because many holders are underwater; when price reclaims it, the same line can flip into dynamic support as the average participant moves back to break-even or profit. On this chart, the AVWAP is sloping through $0.265–$0.27 and “holding,” meaning successive tests have found buyers along that band, precisely where the 0.382 retracement and tweezer lows coincide. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $0.54 ‘Final Boss’ Breakout, Says Top Analyst Technically, that three-way overlay—pattern, retracement, and anchored cost basis—is what traders call confluence. It improves the quality of a level because different methods, derived from different data (price structure, proportional retracement, and volume distribution over time), all argue for the same zone. Where Is DOGE Heading Next? The chart also frames the next directional checkpoints. The nearest marked resistance is the 0.5 retracement at $0.30724, which capped the latest advance before the pullback into $0.265. Above that, the Fibonacci ladder steps to $0.34911 (0.618), $0.40871 (0.786), $0.44419 (0.886), and $0.48464 (1.000), with extensions labeled at $0.58115 (1.272) and $0.63153 (1.414). If the confluence at $0.265 were to fail on a closing basis, the next plotted downside reference on this template is the 0.236 retracement at $0.21357, while the bottom of the displayed range sits at $0.12984. Put together, the chart Cantonese Cat shared communicates a straightforward message: DOGE tested a cluster of technical supports at $0.265, produced a tweezer-style reaction there, and is attempting to stabilize above both the 0.382 retracement and the AVWAP from the cycle high. That is the specific technical context behind the analyst’s “local bottom” read. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.267.

Iesācēju ceļvedis,https://bitcoinist.com/kas-ir-skinsluck-latvija/,"SkinsLuck ir viena no jaunākajām un straujāk augošajām CSGO/CS2 skins likmju platformām. Ja esat CS2 fans un jums ir neizmantoti ieroču skins vai vēlaties izmēģināt savu veiksmi jautrās balvu spēlēs, SkinsLuck piedāvā drošu un vienkāršu veidu, kā to izdarīt, neizmantojot reālu naudu. Viss, kas jums nepieciešams, ir Steam konts, daži ieroču skins savā inventārā un vēlme spēlēt. Šajā rakstā mēs apskatīsim, kā darbojas SkinsLuck , kādas ir tā galvenās funkcijas un kāpēc tas jau ir kļuvis par vienu no populārākajām platformām Latvijā. Kā sākt izmantot SkinsLuck? Reģistrācijas process ir ļoti vienkāršs. Jūs varat pieteikties ar Steam vai Google kontu dažu sekunžu laikā. Izveidojot kontu, jums būs pieejama visa platforma. Jūs varat noguldīt CS2 skins no sava personīgā inventāra. Ieroču skini tiek konvertēti virtuālajā valūtā (monētās), kuras tiek izmantotas, lai spēlētu dažādas spēles platformā. Alternatīvi, dažas spēles ļauj arī tieši veikt likmes ar skiniem. Vietne ir pilnībā savietojama ar mobilajām ierīcēm, kas nozīmē, ka jūs varat spēlēt un uzvarēt no sava tālruņa vai planšetdatora. Kādas spēles piedāvā SkinsLuck? SkinsLuck darbojas kā skinu balstīts tiešsaistes kazino, kas pielāgots CS2 kultūrai. Platforma piedāvā daudzveidīgas spēles, kas visas ir izstrādātas ātrumam un izklaidei. Kādas spēles piedāvā SkinsLuck? SkinsLuck darbojas kā skins balstīts tiešsaistes kazino, kas pielāgots CS2 kultūrai. Platforma piedāvā daudzveidīgas spēles, kas visas ir izstrādātas ātrumam un izklaidei. Starp tiem izceļas Skins Cases, kur jūs atverat kastes, kas satur nejaušus ieroču skinus, ar iepriekš noteiktām izredzēm. Pirms atverat katru kasti, jūs varat redzēt izredzes un to, ko varat vinnēt. Case Battles jūs spēlējat viens pret vienu ar citiem spēlētājiem, un uzvarētājs ir tas, kuram ir visvērtīgākie laimesti. Tas ir viens no populārākajiem un konkurētspējīgākajiem režīmiem. Upgrader funkcija ļauj spēlētājiem apmainīt parastos skinus, cerot uzvarēt retākus. Rezultāts ir balstīts uz nejaušības sistēmu (laimīgā rulete), kas padara pieredzi aizraujošu. Ir arī klasiskais Coinflip, kur divi spēlētāji veic likmes uz skiniem vai monētām, un sistēma nosaka uzvarētāju ar digitālu “monētas mešanu”. Visbeidzot, jūs varat spēlēt Roulette vai Crash, kur jūs veicat likmes un gaidāt pareizo brīdi, lai izņemtu savus laimestus, pirms spēle “sabrūk”. Vai SkinsLuck ir drošs? Platforma liek lielu uzsvaru uz drošību un pārredzamību. Visi savienojumi tiek veidoti caur Steam, un transakciju sistēmas ir šifrētas. Spēles izmanto pierādāmi godīgu tehnoloģiju, kas balstīta uz nejaušu skaitļu algoritmiem. Tas nozīmē, ka katrs rezultāts ir pārredzams un pārbaudāms, nodrošinot godīgumu visiem spēlētājiem. Lapā atklāti tiek parādītas uzvaras izredzes katram skinam vai gadījumam, un lielākā daļa darījumu (īpaši izņemšana) tiek izpildīti gandrīz uzreiz. Ko var laimēt? SkinsLuck var laimēt dažādus ieročus, nažus, cimdus un uzlīmes. Daži no tiem ir ļoti reti vai dārgi, kas padara spēlēšanu vēl aizraujošāku. Visus laimestus var pārskaitīt atpakaļ uz spēlētāja Steam kontu, ļaujot tos paturēt vai izmantot citos darījumos vai pirkumos. Kopiena un atbalsts SkinsLuck nav tikai azartspēļu platforma. Tai ir aktīva kopiena Discord, reāllaika informācija par rezultātiem un uzvarētajiem skiniem, kā arī atbalsts, kas pieejams 24/7, ja rodas jautājumi vai bažas. Spēlētāji var čatot, izveidot cīņas un parādīt savu kolekciju, tādējādi nodrošinot sociālāku un jautrāku pieredzi. Secinājumi Secinājumi SkinsLuck ir pilnvērtīga un droša skinu azartspēļu vietne CS2 spēlētājiem, kuri vēlas izklaidēties, izmēģināt savu veiksmi un iegūt retus skinus. Steam pieteikšanās izmantošana, ātras spēles, rezultātu pārredzamība un aktīva kopiena padara to par ideālu izvēli gan iesācējiem, gan pieredzējušākiem lietotājiem.

Among these, Near Protocol stands out as a formidable player, aiming to simplify blockchain adoption for developers and users alike. As interest in high-performance, scalable blockchain solutions grows, many are asking: What does the future hold for NEAR? This comprehensive guide delves into the NEAR price prediction for the coming years, exploring the factors that could drive its value and whether a significant surge is on the horizon for NEAR crypto . Understanding Near Protocol: The Foundation of Future Growth Before we dive into numbers, it is crucial to understand what makes Near Protocol unique. It is a layer-one blockchain designed for scalability and usability, focusing on developer-friendliness and seamless user experiences. Unlike many complex blockchain environments, Near aims to be an intuitive platform where developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) without extensive prior blockchain knowledge. Its core technology, Nightshade sharding, allows the network to process transactions in parallel, significantly boosting its capacity and speed. Key aspects that define Near Protocol include: Sharding Technology: Nightshade enables dynamic scaling, allowing the network to expand its processing power as demand grows. Developer Experience: Supports familiar programming languages like Rust and AssemblyScript, lowering the barrier to entry for developers. Usability for End-Users: Features like human-readable account names (e.g., ‘yourname.near’) and transaction fee abstraction (users don’t always pay gas directly) enhance user experience. Ecosystem Focus: A strong emphasis on fostering a vibrant ecosystem of dApps, wallets, and infrastructure projects. These foundational strengths are vital for any long-term crypto price forecast , as they dictate the project’s utility and potential for widespread adoption. Current Market Dynamics and NEAR Crypto Performance The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and NEAR crypto is no exception. Its price movements are influenced by broader market trends, investor sentiment, technological developments within the Near ecosystem, and competitive pressures. Historically, NEAR has shown periods of significant growth, especially during bullish market cycles, demonstrating its potential to capture investor interest. When evaluating the current performance, it is important to consider: Market Capitalization: A higher market cap often indicates greater stability and investor confidence. Trading Volume: Healthy trading volumes suggest liquidity and active interest in the NEAR token . Ecosystem Development: New dApp launches, partnerships, and upgrades within the Near Protocol ecosystem can positively impact its value. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, and regulatory news can sway the entire crypto market, including NEAR. Understanding these dynamics provides a baseline for any credible NEAR price prediction , allowing us to contextualize future projections within the current landscape. Factors Driving the NEAR Price Prediction 2025-2030 Several critical factors will shape the trajectory of Near Protocol and its native token, NEAR, in the coming years. These elements contribute to the overall utility and demand for the platform, directly impacting its market value. Technological Advancements: The Core of NEAR Protocol’s Edge Near’s commitment to innovation, particularly with its Nightshade sharding, is a major driver. As the network further refines its sharding implementation and introduces new features, its ability to scale efficiently will attract more developers and users. Continued improvements in transaction speed, cost-effectiveness, and security will solidify Near’s position as a leading blockchain for Web3 development. Any breakthroughs in these areas will provide a strong tailwind for the NEAR price prediction . Ecosystem Growth and Adoption: Fueling NEAR Crypto Demand The strength of a blockchain often lies in its ecosystem. The growth of dApps, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and gaming projects built on Near Protocol directly translates to increased utility and demand for the NEAR token . Strategic partnerships, grants for developers, and successful marketing campaigns to onboard new users will be crucial. As more projects choose Near for its scalability and user-friendly environment, the demand for NEAR to pay for transaction fees, staking, and governance will naturally increase, positively impacting the NEAR crypto value. Market Sentiment and Broader Crypto Trends: What Does the Crypto Price Forecast Say? The overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market plays a significant role. A bullish market cycle, often driven by institutional adoption, clearer regulations, or technological advancements across the industry, tends to lift all boats, including NEAR. Conversely, bearish trends can exert downward pressure. Monitoring the broader crypto price forecast and understanding market cycles is essential for anticipating NEAR’s movements. Factors like Bitcoin’s performance, global economic stability, and regulatory clarity will continue to influence investor confidence in altcoins like NEAR. Competition and Regulatory Landscape: Navigating Challenges for the NEAR Token The blockchain space is highly competitive, with numerous Layer 1 protocols vying for market share. Near Protocol must continue to innovate and differentiate itself to maintain its edge against competitors like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Additionally, the evolving regulatory landscape globally could introduce challenges or opportunities. Clearer regulations could foster greater institutional investment, while restrictive policies might hinder growth. The ability of Near Protocol to adapt to these external pressures will be vital for its long-term success and the stability of the NEAR token . NEAR Price Prediction 2025: A Look at the Mid-Term Horizon As we approach 2025, several factors could converge to shape the NEAR price prediction . The continued maturation of its sharding technology, coupled with an expanding ecosystem of dApps, could drive significant user adoption. If the broader crypto market enters a sustained bullish phase, fueled by macroeconomic improvements or increasing institutional interest, Near Protocol is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum. In 2025, we might see: Increased Network Activity: More dApps launching and higher transaction volumes. Stronger Developer Community: Continued growth in developer tools and resources. Potential for Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with major Web2 companies or other blockchain protocols. Analysts often project a conservative yet steady growth for NEAR crypto in the mid-term, with potential for more aggressive surges if specific catalysts, such as a major technological upgrade or a widespread adoption wave, materialize. A 2X surge from current levels by 2025 is certainly within the realm of possibility, contingent on favorable market conditions and strong execution by the Near team. NEAR Price Prediction 2026-2030: Long-Term Growth Potential Looking further out to 2026 and beyond, the long-term outlook for Near Protocol appears promising, assuming it continues to deliver on its roadmap and adapt to market changes. By 2030, the Web3 landscape is expected to be significantly more developed, with blockchain technology integrated into various aspects of daily life. Near’s focus on usability and scalability positions it well to be a foundational layer for this future. Key drivers for the long-term NEAR price prediction include: Mass Adoption of Web3: If Web3 truly goes mainstream, platforms like Near, which prioritize user experience, will be at the forefront. Interoperability Solutions: Near’s ability to seamlessly interact with other blockchains (e.g., through bridges like Rainbow Bridge) will enhance its utility. Decentralized Governance: The maturation of Near’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) will ensure community-driven development and resilience. Inflationary/Deflationary Mechanisms: How the supply of the NEAR token is managed over time will also influence its value. A significant crypto price forecast for Near Protocol in this timeframe often anticipates substantial growth, potentially seeing the token reach new all-time highs as its ecosystem expands and Web3 adoption accelerates. While a 2X surge is a near-term possibility, the long-term potential for multiple X gains exists if Near becomes a dominant player in the decentralized internet. Is NEAR Protocol a Good Investment?

Bitcoin vor der Entscheidung,https://www.newsbtc.com/deutsch/zinsschock-oder-kursexplosion-bitcoin-vor-der-entscheidung/,"Der Markt wartet gespannt auf die Zinsentscheidung der US-Notenbank. Im Vorfeld zeigt Bitcoin eine auffällige Stärke. Nach einem Rücksetzer konnte der Support gehalten werden, wodurch sich der Kurs erneut nach oben bewegte. Besonders der Ausbruch über eine diagonale Trendlinie gab den Bullen kurzfristig Rückenwind. Das Ziel bei rund 117.400 US-Dollar wurde jedoch knapp verfehlt. Der Chart zeigt eine bullische Flagge, die Raum für weitere Anstiege lassen könnte. Bitcoin Bullflag, Quelle: www.tradnigview.com Die Unsicherheit bleibt. Kommt eine Zinssenkung von 0,5 Prozent, wäre ein explosives Szenario nach Norden denkbar, möglicherweise sogar neue Allzeithochs. Bei nur 0,25 Prozent und einer mahnenden Rede von Jerome Powell droht dagegen ein Abverkauf. Anleger müssen sich also auf starke Schwankungen einstellen. Unterstützungen und Widerstände sind in dieser Lage entscheidend, um klare Setups zu finden. Widerstände im Blick Die entscheidende Zone liegt im Bereich von 119.000 bis 123.000 US-Dollar. Erst wenn Bitcoin diese Hürde nachhaltig überwindet, könnte der Weg frei sein für ein Schließen aller offenen Gaps und einen größeren Aufwärtsschub. Scheitert der Kurs an diesem Bereich, droht ein Rückfall in die Region um 113.000 oder sogar 100.000 US-Dollar. Charttechnisch verstärken sich die Risiken, da eine bearishe Divergenz auf dem Vierstunden-Chart sichtbar ist – steigende Kurse, aber ein schwächerer RSI. For those still fooled thinking the bull is “about to start” wake up. It started in Jan 2023. BTC has been moving up for 2 years and 8 months! In 2015-2017 bull market lasted 820d2019-2021 bull market lasted 1004dCurrent ""bull market"" lasting 1035d.. You’re late! — Doctor Profit 🇨🇭 (@DrProfitCrypto) September 15, 2025 Kurzfristig bleibt der Markt also ein Spiel zwischen Geduld und Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit. Trader beobachten engmaschig die Bewegungen rund um diese Zonen. Auch die Entwicklung anderer Märkte wie S&P 500, Nasdaq oder Edelmetalle spielt eine Rolle, da sie stark mit der US-Geldpolitik verknüpft sind. Ethereum kämpft mit wichtigen Marken Ethereum verläuft ähnlich wie Bitcoin. Nach einem Rücksetzer konnte die Tageskerze oberhalb einer wichtigen diagonalen Linie schließen – ein positives Signal. Kurzfristig ist ein Anstieg bis in den Bereich zwischen 4.615 und 4.640 US-Dollar möglich. Erst über dieser Zone wäre der Weg zu 4.700 und darüber hinaus frei. Doch auch bei Ethereum ist Vorsicht angesagt. Fällt der Kurs unter 4.333 oder gar 4.200, könnten weitere 15 Prozent Verlust folgen, mit Kursen bis in den Bereich um 3.600 US-Dollar. Das eröffnet langfristig neue Einstiegschancen, kurzfristig droht aber Druck auf die gesamte Altcoin-Landschaft. Die Marktlogik bleibt also dieselbe: Überraschende Zinsschritte könnten für Rallys sorgen, während warnende Worte der Notenbank die Kurse belasten. In beiden Fällen reagieren Kryptowährungen besonders heftig. Gerade diese Unsicherheit macht die Nebenwerte spannend. Nach jeder größeren Bitcoin-Korrektur hatten Altcoins in den vergangenen Zyklen das Potenzial, überproportional zu steigen. Projekte mit innovativen Ansätzen nutzen die Marktphasen, um Investoren, die auf den Aufschwung hoffen, schon vorzeitig abzuholen. Ein Top-Beispiel ist hier Pepe Node ($PEPENODE). Das neue Projekt vereint spielerisches Mining von Memecoins mit einem Krypto Presale und bringt damit enormes Potenzial für einen Bullenmarkt. Das Projekt setzt nicht auf klassische Coud-Mining-Modelle, die in der Vergangenheit durch Skandale aufgefallen waren. Stattdessen kombiniert es Mining mit einem spielerischen Ansatz. Nutzer können virtuelle Mining-Setups aufbauen, upgraden und damit Meme-Coins wie Pepe oder Fartcoin verdienen. Ein entscheidender Mechanismus ist dabei die Deflation: 70 Prozent aller eingesetzten PEPENODE-Token beim Upgraden werden dauerhaft verbrannt. Dadurch sinkt das Angebot kontinuierlich. Zudem können Käufer ihre Tokens bereits im Presale staken mit dynamischen Renditen von über 1.100 Prozent pro Jahr (zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt). Damit entsteht eine seltene Kombination: frühzeitige Belohnungen und ein deflationäres Modell, das langfristig Druck auf den Kurs ausüben könnte. Mit inzwischen über 1,2 Millionen US-Dollar eingesammeltem Kapital zeigt PepeNode, wie stark das Interesse an innovativen Meme-Projekten derzeit ist. Auch wenn das Risiko eines Memecoins mitschwingt, scheinbar glauben viele Investoren an einen Altcoin Bullrun und an den Anstieg von PepeNode. Hier PepeNode Token im Presale kaufen.

FORD's pivot to Solana follows years of declining revenues and negative net income, with its SOL holdings now exceeding $1.58B in value. Despite staking SOL for a 6.8% yield, FORD trades at over 30x forward sales, suggesting the stock is significantly overvalued at current prices. I rate FORD as a 'hold,' preferring a moderate premium to the PIPE price over the current ~$40 share price for SOL exposure. As I laid out in my recent Solana ( SOL-USD ) piece highlighting the impending SOL purchases through public equities, we have a new leader in the race to be the biggest Solana DAT, or Digital Asset Treasury company. That crown is currently worn by Forward Industries (FORD), which recently purchased over 6.8 million SOL tokens following a PIPE investment from Multicoin Capital, Galaxy Digital (GLXY), and Jump Crypto. In this piece, we'll look at some of the key details of those investments and assess whether FORD shares are a 'buy,' 'hold,' or 'sell' at the present time. Forward Industries As has often been the case in some of the more recent examples from the DAT craze this summer, the public companies that transition to the DAT model often have very little in the way of assets or profitable business lines prior to shifting to crypto. Such is the case for Forward Industries, which previously operated a product design business for medical and technology companies. Data by YCharts In addition to declining revenues going back at least the last 3 years, Forward Industries has had negative net income for 7 consecutive quarters. Thus, a timely pivot to Solana was aided by a massive capital raise. The PIPE Through a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, Forward Industries was able to raise approximately $1.65 billion from various investors at a price of $18.50 per share. The proceeds from that PIPE were to purchase Solana for the company's SOL strategy. On September 15th, the company announced over 6.8 million SOL tokens purchased with the proceeds from that PIPE. That amount of SOL currently makes Forward Industries the largest Solana DAT by a wide margin. In fact, not including Helius Medical Technologies (HSDT), which is also raising millions of dollars for a SOL treasury, Forward Industries has a bigger SOL balance than the previous 8 SOL DAT companies combined: Entities Total Solana Market Value DeFi Development Corp. ( DFDV ) 2,027,817 $470,453,544 Upexi ( UPXI ) 2,018,419 $468,273,208 Sharps Technology ( STSS ) 2,000,000 $464,000,000 Sol Strategies ( STKE ) 370,420 $85,937,440 BIT Mining Limited ( BTCM ) 44,412 $10,303,584 Exodus Movement ( EXOD ) 43,738 $10,147,216 Torrent Capital ( OTCPK:TRRPF ) 40,039 $9,289,048 Lion Group Holding ( LGHL ) 6,629 $1,537,928 Combined 6,551,474 Forward Industries 6,822,000 $1,582,704,000 Source: CoinGecko, values at $232 SOL price Subsequent to the PIPE, Forward Industries raised another $32.9 million through a direct investment at $18.50 per share. Per that prospectus , there are now 84,527,120 shares outstanding. This is an important number because it implies an equity valuation of $3.3 billion at a $39 closing price on September 15th. Should the company really be worth that much? I'm not convinced. Valuation Given the company's $3.3 billion valuation relative to the $1.6 billion SOL that the company holds, it would be fair to call FORD overvalued at a 2x mNAV multiple if it were a DAT that held a non-productive asset. However, the company has put the SOL to work through native staking. Meaning, these tokens do generate a yield on top of any price appreciation that they might produce. 1 yr Solana APYs ( Staking Rewards ) Presently, staked Solana generates 6.8% annually. Keep in mind, as more Solana is purchased and subsequently staked for income, the yields from staking come down, similar to how a bond yield would come down when the price of the bond increases. But at 6.8%, we can at least model a price-to-sales multiple for FORD based on expected annual revenue from staking. Current SOL holdings: $1,582,704,000 Staking Yield 6.8% Annualized revenue $107,623,872 Market Capitalization $3,296,557,680 FWD P/S Multiple 30.63 Source: Author's calculations Assuming the staking yield stays the same and the price of SOL doesn't deviate from current levels, FORD is trading at over 30x forward sales. To be sure, there are other things that the company can do to maximize returns for shareholders. It could take SOL out of stake and instead put it into riskier, higher-yield DeFi protocols. It could make investments in companies that build on and grow the Solana ecosystem as well. But, before any of that happens, FORD is probably overpriced at $39 per share. Closing Thoughts It is a very interesting time in the digital asset markets. Publicly listed companies are essentially competing with ETFs and other asset managers for capital to put into the blockchain ecosystem. Part of what makes the share price gains in these smaller cap companies so explosive is that the floats are so small. For example, prior to the PIPE, there were slightly more than 1 million FORD shares outstanding. Now that number is closer to 85 million shares, but the overwhelming majority of them are temporarily locked up. You could talk me into FORD at a moderate premium to the PIPE offering price of $18.50. At closer to $40, I would find alternative ways to get exposure to SOL. I'll initiate with a 'hold.'",SOL-USD|FORD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-17 09:41:50

The Guaranteeing U.S. Exchange Neutrality for Interconnected and Universal Stablecoins Act , passed in July, is a federal framework that has given institutions and banks clarity on how to issue stablecoins. According to CoinGecko data, the global market for these assets is now valued at $294 billion. Coinbase economists predict the industry could reach $1.2 trillion by 2028. The market is undoubtedly expanding, but Ripple executive Jack McDonald believes not every project meets the standards required for an interoperable, compliant and transparent stablecoin. Many tokens, he argues, are developed for purely hype, which in turn limit their potential. Ripple executive wary of short-sighted stablecoin issuers McDonald, who is the chief executive of Standard Custody & Trust Co. and senior vice-president for stablecoins at Ripple, said many current projects lack vision. Pouring his sentiments in an insight published on Ripple’s website on Wednesday, McDonald reiterated that stablecoins should not be treated as “just a marketing initiative.” Stablecoins carry responsibilities of trust, compliance, and scale. Tokens focused on loyalty programs, gaming economies, or closed ecosystems often fall short of this,” he wrote. The Ripple stablecoins SVP coined the hype-based stablecoins as “isolated islands of value” that fail to connect with broader financial systems, and lack the liquidity, portability, or utility sought in real-world payments. McDonald explained how stablecoins thrive in jurisdictions where financial infrastructure is considered “limited or inefficient” by world standards, because they can bridge access to the US dollar, lower the cost of remittances, and make faster settlements than the slow and expensive banking networks. “The benefits are tangible and measurable,” McDonald continued, “This is where stablecoins can unlock real economic value, and where the need is greatest.” Moreover, he asserted that stablecoins can only succeed if they are interoperable across platforms and networks, transparent about reserves, and capable of scaling as core infrastructure. “These are prerequisites for mainstream adoption and the stability that the term ‘stablecoin’ implies,” the Standard Custody CEO surmised. Concluding his insight, McDonald listed Ripple USD (RLUSD) as the example of a compliance-first token, fully backed 1:1 by U.S. dollar reserves held in reputable US banks. As reported by Cryptopolitan during launch, RLUSD is issued under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Services and is built on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Ripple says this dual-network issuance makes it flexible for cross-border payments, in tandem with enterprise-grade compliance standards. The UK wants to control stablecoins The stablecoin discussion was also part of The Rollup Podcast’s interview earlier this month with David Grider of Finality Capital, who said “the most interesting thing happening in crypto is TradFi convergence and the unshackling of regulation,” “That’s what’s allowing companies to do DATs and Hype to get their own stablecoin, and it’s also allowing tokenization you are seeing today with Nasdaq. I feel this is pretty exciting for everyone,” the Finality Capital partner reckoned. While the US has created room for stablecoin issuers to thrive, the Bank of England is proposing limits on how many stablecoins individuals and businesses can hold. According to the UK’s central bank, systemic stablecoins could weaken the banking system by draining deposits if left unchecked. Its plan would cap individual holdings at between £10,000 and £20,000, while businesses could be restricted to £10 million. Officials said they intend to press ahead with the policy to “safeguard financial stability,” but for crypto and payments groups, it would leave the UK lagging. “Imposing caps on stablecoins is bad for UK savers, bad for the City and bad for sterling,” said Tom Duff Gordon, vice-president of international policy at Coinbase. The Financial Conduct Authority’s research shows that 93% of UK adults have heard of crypto, and seven million people own some form of it. “Capping stablecoin holdings is how you drive capital away,” complained one naysayer of the BoE’s proposed stablecoin cap on X.

51867787,583284,1758102294,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51867787.jpeg,Why Bitcoin Hyper’s L2 Solution Could Power $BTC’s Next Big Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-l2-can-save-troubled-bitcoin/,"Many industry experts and analysts predict $BTC to touch $1M by 2030. Given that it has generated around 188M% returns since 2010 and governments across the world are embracing digital assets, the prediction doesn’t seem far-fetched. But here is the problem: does the Bitcoin blockchain have what it takes to back its growing popularity, at only seven transactions per second (TPS)? The answer is a resounding yes, thanks to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Not only does this new Layer-2 (L2) solution bring more speed and scalability to the Bitcoin blockchain, it also makes it programmable for Web3 innovation. The best part is that the project is still in the early phases with solid technical progress. Bitcoin Hyper offers a low-cost entry into Bitcoin’s journey ahead, making it no surprise that the viral $HYPER token presale has already reached $16.4M+. Why Bitcoin Hyper is Trending Bitcoin Hyper is one of the best new cryptocurrencies to buy this year, with both whales and retail investors in a hurry to secure its native crypto $HYPER. This week alone has seen whale buys of $27.1K and $31.5K . These purchases follow a much bigger transaction last month, where a whale swapped 35.149 $ETH worth $161.3K for $HYPER tokens. What’s fueling this buying frenzy? To understand that, we need to first look at the pain points that Bitcoin Hyper sets out to solve. Bitcoin is a brilliant store of value, as its value appreciation over the years proves. But when it comes to everyday transactions, $BTC doesn’t justify the ‘currency’ in cryptocurrency. Transaction fees can climb so high during busy times that you’d be better off paying with fiat. Bitcoin transactions can also be incredibly slow. $BTC’s seven TPS is dwarfed by Visa’s 65K TPS , making it obvious why its entry into the mainstream as digital cash remains elusive. While Bitcoin is often heralded as the crypto king, real innovation in the blockchain space takes place elsewhere. Interestingly, it has been close to 17 years since the Bitcoin blockchain launched, but it still lacks programmability. Web3 owes its growth to blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano for their networks, compatible with smart contracts – not Bitcoin. As a blockchain, Bitcoin is outdated. Developers can’t rely on it for building dApps, DeFi solutions, NFTs, and meme coins. And that’s exactly the reason why Bitcoin Hyper is trending now; it is on a mission to make the Bitcoin blockchain relevant again. The Mechanics of Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2 Bitcoin Hyper is a fast, cheap, and secure L2 solution designed for Bitcoin, with two core pillars: The first is a non-custodial Canonical Bridge . You send your $BTC to an address monitored by the Canonical Bridge, and once verified, it’s minted on the L2 as wrapped $BTC. Unlike $BTC, you can use the wrapped $BTC across different applications, from DeFi to NFTs and games. The L2 unlocks Web3 avenues that $BTC never could. When you want your $BTC back, simply withdraw it back to Bitcoin’s native Layer-1, any time you choose. The second is the Solana Virtual Machine , which brings Solana-level performance to Bitcoin. For developers familiar with Solana’s framework and tools, it will be easy to build apps onto Bitcoin Hyper. Near-instant execution and low fees are added incentives. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper website to learn more about the L2 infrastructure. Solid Tech Progress Justifies the FOMO The crypto market is a decentralized space where anyone can launch a project. Low entry barriers lead to innovation, but they can also overcrowd the market with substandard projects. Investors who have watched the crypto market for a while know that new projects are not to be judged by the promises they make. Their dev updates matter more than their roadmap. It is for this reason, strategic investors are buying $HYPER tokens before it hits exchanges. Here is what we can expect next: Better roll-up sequencing models, refined for anchoring to Bitcoin’s base layer Stronger dev workflows for SVM-compatible contracts, from deployment to monitoring Lightweight infra services (RPC, indexers, explorers) to help developers interact with Hyper efficiently Pathway for early builders to test contracts and infra components before the mainnet launch. In addition, the project has undergone two smart contract audits by leading blockchain security firms Coinsult and SpyWolf . The reports clear any concerns investors may have around rug pulls and code traps – both genuine risks in the crypto space. Backed by a strong project with consistent tech progress, it wouldn’t be surprising to see $HYPER explode on its initial exchange listings. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , $HYPER could make a 28x gain from its presale price, hitting $0.32 by the year-end. $16.4M Raised: The Presale Window is Now Open – But Not For Long The $HYPER presale is racing ahead, with growing support from Bitcoin investors. They are making a strategic move with the new token, as it is closely tied to Bitcoin’s brand value and utility. The pro-crypto shift across the world hints at Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption. For example, Japan plans to cut crypto taxes from 55% to 20%, and the new rule treats crypto gains similarly to stock gains. The US, on the other hand, is on a mission to become the crypto capital of the world. SEC Chair Paul Atkins reiterated this goal in his keynote address at the inaugural OECD Roundtable on Global Financial Markets . ‘An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come. And today, ladies and gentlemen, we must admit that: crypto’s time has come.’ – Paul Atkins, SEC Chair As Bitcoin climbs up the charts, $HYPER is expected to follow. But here is the distinction. Bitcoin has a gigantic market cap of $2.3T , which limits its pace, while Bitcoin Hyper is a small-cap project with more room for returns. The tokenomics is designed with eyes set on long-term growth and value appreciation. Waiting until the exchange listing, however, might be a bad idea, as the residual FOMO from the presale could push the token price exponentially. The dynamic staking program also encourages early investments with higher APYs. Right now you can buy $HYPER for $0.012935 and unlock a juicy 70% staking APY. Our How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper guide explains how to do just that. Being a presale, though, the price rises in stages while the APY lowers as more holders stake their tokens. And the next price surge is less than two days away. So early action is key. Ready to join the presale? Buy your $HYPER via the official Bitcoin Hyper website today.

Most altcoins have failed to produce any big moves over the past day, while BNB charted a new all-time high, and HYPE has neared its own. BTC Stopped at $117K The primary cryptocurrency has been on an evident uptrend for the past week or so, after bouncing off the $111,000 support last Tuesday. The asset started to recover some of the recently lost ground almost immediately and had risen to over $116,000 by Friday. It failed there at first and remained sideways for most of the weekend, at least after it jumped to $116,800 on Saturday morning, where it was quickly stopped. The bulls went on the offensive on Monday, but the subsequent rejection at the same level pushed BTC south to $114,400. However, bitcoin recovered again and headed north to just over $117,200 earlier today, which became a four-week peak. Although it has slipped slightly since then, it’s still in the green on a daily scale. More volatility is expected later today when the US Federal Reserve will announce whether it will indeed lower the interest rates as many anticipate. For now, though, BTC’s market cap sits at just over $2.325 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is up to 56.2%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BNB New Peak Most larger-cap alts have remained at essentially the same price levels as yesterday, including ETH, XRP, SOL, ADA, DOGE, TRX, and SUI. In contrast, BNB topped $960 earlier today to mark a new all-time high. HYPE also neared its own record but now trades at $55. LINK, AVAX, XLM, and HBAR are slightly in the red on a daily scale. MYX has skyrocketed the most from the larger-cap alts, gaining over 50% in a day to trade above $16. IP and SKY are far behind with 6% and 5%, respectively. The total crypto market cap has risen to $4.140 trillion on CG, gaining more than $140 billion in the past several days. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Ethereum e altcoin registrano un aumento del volume dei futures In un post su X , l’analista della community CryptoQuant, Maartunn , ha discusso dell’ultima tendenza nel volume dei futures di Ethereum e delle altcoin.Con “volume dei futures” si intende la quantità di trading legata ai contratti derivati sulle principali piattaforme di scambio. Il grafico condiviso da Maartunn mostra come negli ultimi anni il dominanza del volume dei futures di ETH e delle altcoin abbia subito variazioni: Negli ultimi giorni, il volume dei futures delle altcoin ha registrato un forte aumento, indicando un rinnovato interesse speculativo verso queste monete. Ethereum, pur non avendo raggiunto i picchi passati, ha comunque registrato un leggero incremento contemporaneo alla crescita delle altcoin. Combinati, ETH e le altcoin ora rappresentano circa l’85,2% del volume totale dei futures crypto, lasciando Bitcoin sotto il 15% di dominanza. Storicamente, periodi simili sono stati un cattivo segnale non solo per BTC, ma per l’intero mercato, come evidenziato dai grafici dei massimi di prezzo della fine del 2024 e dell’estate 2025. Questo suggerisce che, considerando il predominio di Ethereum e altcoin nei futures, Bitcoin e altri asset potrebbero affrontare maggiore volatilità nei prossimi giorni.

Sales dropped 6% year-over-year in the two months leading up to the global launch of the iPhone 17, according to data from Counterpoint Research. That dip hit harder than what the company usually sees before a new model drops. The pullback happened in July and August, weeks before Apple’s new lineup is set to go live this Friday, September 19. And it wasn’t just Apple. Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Vivo, and Honor also had slower numbers, which dragged the entire market down 2% in the same period, despite government-backed incentives meant to push more people to buy. China matters to Apple more than anywhere outside the U.S., and the latest numbers show it’s becoming a tougher place to win. CEO Tim Cook told investors during Apple’s latest earnings call that the company saw a short-term sales recovery in China during the June quarter, helped by subsidies. But even with that bounce, Apple still landed in sixth place over the summer, owning just 12% of the market. Chinese rivals were ahead: Xiaomi, Oppo, and Huawei each grabbed 16%, while Vivo led with 19%. Xiaomi fast-tracks its release after Apple’s announcement To stay competitive, Xiaomi pushed up its next flagship launch to this month. Lei Jun, the company’s co-founder and CEO, said he wants Xiaomi phones to be judged next to Apple’s top-tier devices. The iPhone 17 lineup is Apple’s biggest hardware shake-up in years, with four different models rolling out: the regular iPhone 17, the thinner Air, the higher-end Pro, and the super-sized Pro Max. Every single one of them runs on Apple’s updated in-house chips, has better cameras, and comes wrapped in tougher glass. Preorders started September 12. The company also tweaked its pricing. Most models kept last year’s pricing, but the iPhone 17 Pro now starts at $1,099, which is $100 higher than before. That version now ships with 256GB of storage, matching the price of last year’s 256GB iPhone 16 Pro. The global release date for all four models is September 19. On that same day, Bloomberg reporters got hands-on time with the new devices during Apple’s media event, which also showed off the newest AirPods Pro and updated Apple Watch models. Those first impressions focused on the hardware upgrades, especially the new body build and camera system, but didn’t mention much about software features. Apple’s AI suite missing in China but buyers don’t care yet One major gap still looms large. Apple hasn’t rolled out its Apple Intelligence features in China yet. But so far, that hasn’t seemed to affect how people are buying phones. Analysts from Counterpoint say Chinese consumers are still looking at basics like battery life, storage, and value for money. None of the major brands are seeing AI features drive sales. That means Apple’s lack of AI in China isn’t hurting … yet. Even so, the broader Chinese smartphone market is still weak. Counterpoint expects sales across the country to drop slightly for the full third quarter. There’s no major change happening this year, and no signs that a single product, iPhone or otherwise, is going to turn that around. Cook told investors that Apple’s customer base in Greater China hit a record in the last quarter. He said, “If you look at the other products, Mac, iPad, and Watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China mainland were new to the product.” So Apple’s still pulling in first-time buyers for its other devices, even if the iPhone is losing ground. The problem is, Chinese phone makers aren’t sitting still. They’re speeding up launches, matching specs, cutting prices, and competing more aggressively than ever. Apple is still chasing the lead in a market where value sells more than hype, and features matter more than branding. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After a 1.23% gain yesterday, Bitcoin is now challenging the $117K resistance, which caused a 9% fall in August. There’s a high likelihood $BTC blasts past this resistance, seeing as it made a healthy retest on September 15. This is a strong sign the token wants to sustain its move. Even better, Bitcoin’s September rally is coming right from the 61.8% Fibonacci level – drawn on the weekly chart from the June low ($98,242) to the August high ($124,501). This is a picture-perfect technical pattern, suggesting BTC’s August downtrend was nothing more than a healthy pullback. Looking forward, we can expect Bitcoin to continue trading higher, till at least the Fib high of $124,501, which also happens to be Bitcoin’s all-time high.

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is reportedly planning to ease some of its rules for cryptocurrency companies, signaling a more adaptable approach to UK crypto regulation . This move aims to foster innovation within the burgeoning crypto sector while still upholding essential financial stability and consumer protection. What’s Changing in UK Crypto Regulation? According to reports from the Financial Times, the FCA’s proposal suggests a more tailored regulatory environment for crypto firms. This isn’t a complete deregulation but rather a strategic adjustment, recognizing the unique operational models of digital asset companies compared to traditional financial institutions. Less Stringent Oversight: Crypto firms might face less rigorous requirements than banks or established investment platforms, particularly concerning senior management responsibilities and internal systems and controls. Targeted Approach: This differentiation acknowledges that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach might stifle growth in a rapidly evolving sector like cryptocurrency. Balancing Act: The goal is to strike a balance, allowing crypto businesses more operational flexibility without compromising core regulatory objectives. Why is the FCA Adjusting its Stance on UK Crypto Regulation? The decision to revisit existing rules stems from a broader governmental push to establish the UK as a global hub for crypto and blockchain innovation. By creating a more accommodating regulatory framework, the FCA hopes to attract leading crypto firms and talent, encouraging investment and job creation within the country. This strategic shift in UK crypto regulation is a testament to the growing recognition of digital assets’ potential. It reflects an understanding that an overly restrictive environment can push innovation offshore, leading to a loss of economic opportunity. Where Will Stricter Rules Still Apply? While some areas may see a loosening of controls, it is crucial to understand that the FCA is not abandoning its commitment to security and market integrity. In fact, certain critical areas will face even stricter oversight to protect consumers and the financial system. Cybersecurity Measures: Expect heightened regulations concerning cyberattacks and data security. As digital assets are prime targets for malicious actors, robust defenses are paramount. Consumer Protection: The FCA will likely maintain or enhance rules designed to safeguard retail investors from fraud, market manipulation, and misleading promotions. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): These areas are consistently high priorities for regulators globally, and the UK will continue to enforce stringent measures to prevent illicit financial activities. The proposed framework for UK crypto regulation seeks to differentiate between the risks associated with operational management and those related to market integrity and cyber threats. What Does This Mean for Crypto Firms in the UK? For cryptocurrency companies operating or looking to establish themselves in the UK, these proposed changes could be a significant boon. They signal a more welcoming environment and potentially reduced compliance burdens in specific administrative areas. However, it also means a clear expectation of excellence in critical security and compliance domains. Firms should view this as an opportunity to engage constructively with the regulator, understand the nuances of the new rules, and demonstrate their commitment to responsible innovation. Adapting quickly to evolving UK crypto regulation will be key to success. The Future of UK Crypto Regulation: A Balancing Act This planned easing of rules represents a thoughtful evolution in the UK’s approach to digital assets. It moves away from a broad, often ill-fitting application of traditional financial regulations towards a more bespoke framework. The aim is to create a regulatory landscape that is both progressive and secure, positioning the UK as a leader in the global crypto space. The journey towards optimal UK crypto regulation is ongoing, but these developments indicate a positive direction. It’s a clear signal that the UK intends to be at the forefront of the digital finance revolution, fostering an environment where innovation can thrive responsibly. In summary, the FCA’s proposed adjustments to UK crypto regulation are a nuanced and strategic move. They promise a more flexible operating environment for crypto firms in some aspects, while simultaneously reinforcing robust safeguards in critical areas like cybersecurity. This forward-thinking approach aims to cement the UK’s position as a hub for digital asset innovation, benefiting both businesses and the broader economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the FCA’s proposed changes to UK crypto regulation? The main goal is to balance fostering innovation within the UK’s cryptocurrency sector with maintaining robust financial stability and consumer protection. It aims to create a more tailored regulatory environment for crypto firms. Q2: How will these changes make rules less stringent for crypto firms? Under the proposal, crypto firms may face less stringent rules than traditional banks or investment platforms regarding senior managers, systems, and controls, recognizing their unique operational models. Q3: In which areas will UK crypto regulation become stricter? Stricter regulations are anticipated in critical areas such as cybersecurity measures to combat cyberattacks and robust controls for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) to protect market integrity. Q4: Why is the UK government encouraging these regulatory changes? The UK government aims to establish the country as a global hub for crypto and blockchain innovation. By creating a more accommodating regulatory framework, it seeks to attract leading crypto firms, investment, and talent. Q5: When are these changes to UK crypto regulation expected to take effect?

51868397,583112,1758103221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51868397.jpeg,Is XRP Becoming A Privacy Coin? Ripple’s New Proposal Says Yes—And No,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-privacy-coin-ripple-new-proposal-yes-no/,"Ripple’s developer arm has floated a blueprint to bring privacy-coin-like functionality to the XRP Ledger—without abandoning the network’s long-standing emphasis on public supply integrity and compliance tooling. In a new XRP Ledger Standards (XRPLF) discussion opened on September 13, Ripple engineers Murat Cenk and Aanchal Malhotra propose “Confidential Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs),” an amendment that would encrypt balances and transfer amounts using EC-ElGamal and zero-knowledge proofs, while preserving the accounting semantics of XRPL’s existing MPT framework. RippleX subsequently highlighted the proposal on X, drawing mainstream attention to what could be the most consequential privacy addition yet considered for XRPL. Is XRP Becoming A Privacy Coin? At its core, the draft introduces confidentiality at the token layer without obscuring aggregate supply. Confidential MPTs provide confidential transfers and balances using EC-ElGamal encryption and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), while preserving XLS-33 semantics,” the authors write. Crucially, they stress that “Public auditability” remains intact because issuance limits continue to be enforced by the network’s existing invariant—OutstandingAmount never exceeding MaxAmount—so validators can verify that no new tokens are silently minted even if individual balances are encrypted. The design leans on a practical architectural compromise. Instead of redefining supply math for a private system, issuers would maintain a designated “second account” that the ledger treats like any other holder. Public supply metrics, including OutstandingAmount, then account for both public and confidential balances, with a new ConfidentialOutstandingAmount field tracking the private portion. This lets validators enforce the same XLS-33 rule set they already understand, while transactions themselves rely on equality proofs and range proofs to ensure spends are valid without revealing amounts. The proposal is explicit about the “twist” that differentiates it from pure privacy chains such as Monero or Zcash : selective disclosure and issuer controls are built in. The spec outlines two auditor models—an on-chain, trust-minimized approach that supports pre-defined auditors and later additions via re-encryption, and a simpler issuer-controlled “view key” option. It also proposes issuer-only freeze and clawback capabilities over confidential balances, framed as compliance tools rather than discretionary surveillance. In the authors’ words, the system enables “flexible auditability” while keeping private balances “encrypted under the holder’s key,” with optional auditor copies of the same ciphertext verifiably bound via ZK equality proofs. To make the flow reliable at scale, the draft adopts a split-balance model that separates a holder’s encrypted funds into a spendable “Spending” balance and an “Inbox” for new incoming transfers. A lightweight merge operation prevents “stale proof” failures that can occur when a new receipt lands while a user is preparing a proof for an outgoing transfer. That operational detail, commonplace in high-throughput confidential systems, suggests the authors are mindful of UX and wallet-developer realities, not just cryptographic elegance. If advanced, the change would arrive as an XRPL amendment and need to clear the ledger’s formal governance hurdle: more than 80% validator approval sustained for two weeks before activation on mainnet. Nothing in the discussion implies a live vote yet; the status is “Discussion,” and any production path would first require code landing in a stable server release. Context matters here. The multi-purpose token standard (XLS-33, “MPT”) already equips XRPL with a more compact, compliance-aware fungible token primitive than legacy trustlines, including allow-lists, freeze and clawback, and on-chain metadata. Confidential MPTs don’t replace that model; they extend it. The ledger would continue to expose supply caps and enforce invariants even as per-account balances become opaque, aiming squarely at institutional tokenization where privacy, auditability, and policy controls must coexist. Technically—and politically—the framing invites the obvious question in the headline. Is XRP becoming a privacy coin? The honest answer is ambivalent by design. On one hand, balances and amounts would be encrypted end-to-end, with ZKPs securing the flow—indistinguishable at a glance from what privacy coins promise. On the other hand, the draft hardwires audit channels and issuer recourse that privacy-maximalist communities typically reject, and it preserves validator-enforced supply checks that make “stealth inflation” mathematically impossible. That is the “Yes—and No” in a nutshell.

SOL Can Pump 10% But Institutes Are Rotating To an Altcoin Already 3.5x Up,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-to-buy-today-for-short-term-sol-can-pump-10/,"When traders check crypto charts or ask what is going on with crypto today, many are eyeing SOL for a potential 10% swing. That’s attractive for day traders chasing momentum. But institutions—who tend to think beyond short-term fluctuations—are shifting their attention toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This presale altcoin has already delivered a 3.5x return to early buyers before even listing, showing the kind of acceleration that SOL’s modest pump cannot compete with. For serious investors, the real question is not about chasing 10% gains, but about entering into a platform designed with structural safeguards and long-term capital flow in mind. Why Institutions Are Choosing MUTM Over SOL’s Small Swings Consider the numbers: a $20,000 investment during Phase 2 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.015 secured 1.33 million tokens. Today, in Phase 6, with the presale price at $0.035, that same allocation is worth $46,600. That’s 3.5x returns before launch—returns far beyond the 10% SOL swing traders are watching. The presale itself has momentum, with $15.85 million already raised, 40% of the supply sold, and over 16,350 holders. With Phase 7 approaching, the price will climb to $0.040, a 15% increase from today’s level. Institutions are not waiting for that shift—they are positioning now. Their reasoning is simple: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not only offering high returns in the presale, it is also structured with features that directly appeal to institutional risk frameworks. The platform introduces deposit and borrow caps alongside restricted collateral lists, which means lending operations will remain within controlled limits. Institutions value these guardrails because they reduce exposure to sudden liquidity crunches and ensure that only vetted assets, such as leading cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, are accepted as collateral. This prevents low-quality or volatile assets from destabilizing the system, creating the kind of risk-controlled environment that funds demand. Another innovation that strengthens Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal is Enhanced Collateral Efficiency. Traditional DeFi protocols often lock excess collateral that sits idle, reducing capital efficiency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will change that by allowing borrowers to unlock greater borrowing power relative to the value of their collateral. For institutions, this means being able to deploy larger positions without requiring disproportionate amounts of locked-up capital. The result is a more active borrowing market, more lending activity, and higher overall protocol usage—all of which generate recurring revenue streams for the platform and boost demand for MUTM tokens. Complementing this is the utilization-based interest model, which dynamically adjusts rates depending on how much liquidity is being used. When liquidity is abundant, borrowing rates will be lower, encouraging borrowers to take on loans. When liquidity becomes scarce, rates increase, incentivizing lenders to supply more capital. This feedback loop ensures balance in the system, preventing scenarios where either side of the market is neglected. For institutions, this adaptability is crucial because it guarantees market stability even during volatile times. Rather than being locked into rigid rate structures, they will operate in an ecosystem that naturally regulates itself to attract and maintain liquidity. Beta Launch and Layer-2 Efficiency: Why Timing Matters Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not waiting until long after listing to roll out features. A beta version will already be live at token launch, allowing users to test lending and stablecoin functions from day one. This readiness makes the token even more attractive to institutions, who want to see practical use cases in action before committing large sums. Unlike other presales that raise funds first and build later, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will present a working foundation immediately, accelerating adoption. Layer-2 integration is another key factor in this early adoption story. Operating on Layer-2 ensures faster transactions and lower costs than traditional Layer-1 blockchains, an essential feature for funds managing large-scale activity. Reduced transaction fees and near-instant execution provide an edge in efficiency that will appeal both to institutions and to retail investors seeking smoother experiences. In contrast, while SOL’s 10% swing is drawing short-term excitement, it does not offer the structural growth opportunities that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already providing. SOL is a mature asset with steady movements, while MUTM is a rising token combining safety mechanisms, efficiency upgrades, and adoption-ready features. That combination explains why institutions are rotating early into MUTM, while retail traders still have a narrowing window at $0.035 before Phase 7 pushes the price higher. The choice for short-term investors is becoming clear. SOL may deliver its 10%, but the real gains are already unfolding in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale. With 3.5x growth locked in for early buyers and institutional rotation underway, retail investors only have days to align with the same opportunity before the price climbs again. In a market that often punishes hesitation, this is the moment to act decisively.

According to a report from Bloomberg , federal prosecutors are discussing ending the requirement for Binance to maintain an outside compliance monitor, which has a three-year duration under the original 2023 agreement. BINANCE CLOSE TO AGREEMENT TO AVOID DOJ COMPLIANCE MONITOR — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) September 16, 2025 DOJ Reviews Monitor Program as Corporate Costs Mount The reported ongoing negotiation is the latest softening in DOJ’s approach to independent oversight under the Trump administration, which, according to the report already ended monitors for three companies appointed during the Biden era. Binance would likely adopt enhanced compliance reporting requirements before the DOJ signs off on eliminating the monitor requirement. The Justice Department has been conducting an internal review of corporate monitor usage after companies complained that the oversight is onerous and expensive. Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ’s Criminal Division, noted in the report that while monitors reduce repeat offenses, they “ can also impose substantial expense and interfere with lawful business operations. “ Binance was initially saddled with two corporate monitors after pleading guilty and reaching separate settlements with both the DOJ and the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The FinCEN monitor remains in place while discussions focus on the DOJ oversight requirement. Trump Administration Scales Back Corporate Monitor Program Amid Industry Pressure According to Bloomberg, the DOJ has already terminated independent oversight for three companies that agreed to monitors under Biden administration settlements, including two Glencore units that accumulated $142 million in combined costs during 2023 and 2024. NatWest Group and navy shipbuilder Austal USA agreed to enhanced compliance reporting as alternatives to continued monitoring. The review happened as concerns raised by corporations about the financial burden and operational interference caused by independent monitors. Meanwhile, some monitors remain in place despite the review. Toronto-Dominion Bank’s U.S. subsidiary retained its monitor after becoming the first U.S. bank to plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy charges. Balfour Beatty Communities extended its monitorship until June 2026 after pleading guilty to defrauding the U.S. military. Particularly, the report highlighted the Boeing case controversies surrounding the monitor selection criteria. The Justice Department backtracked on imposing an independent monitor that included diversity and inclusion requirements, instead allowing Boeing to retain a compliance consultant rather than a certified monitor. Binance’s settlement negotiations occur amid broader crypto industry influence within the Trump administration. The sector donated heavily to Trump’s campaign . It supported crypto-friendly legislators, while the new administration appointed crypto-supportive agency heads and issued executive orders expanding banking access for digital asset companies. The cryptocurrency industry has donated over $26 million to @realDonaldTrump this year, according to newly released campaign finance filings. #Trump #Crypto https://t.co/mANxOneHxh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 2, 2025 From $4.3 Billion Fine to Potential Freedom Through Political Transformation The monitoring requirement stems from Binance’s November 2023 guilty plea to criminal charges, including Bank Secrecy Act violations, failing to register as a money transmitting business, and violating sanctions laws. The settlement required founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao to step down as CEO and serve four months in prison while paying a personal $50 million fine. The DOJ investigation revealed Binance failed to prevent transactions involving Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Al Qaeda, ISIS, money launderers, and ransomware attackers. The regulators insist that virtual currency exchanges must “ play by the rules ” to access the U.S. financial system. Ever since then, Binance has launched Binance.US to be compliant with the US regulations. Zhao’s legal troubles continued through multiple class action lawsuits alleging money laundering facilitation , with cases eventually transferred to the Florida federal court under the first-to-file rule. Despite the legal challenges, Zhao confirmed in May 2025 that he formally applied for a presidential pardon , citing Trump’s previous pardons of BitMEX executives. @cz_binance , the founder and former CEO of @Binance , has confirmed that he has formally applied for a presidential pardon. #Binance #CZ https://t.co/9owHRhfIhU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 Binance’s compliance efforts included assisting international law enforcement, notably helping India’s Enforcement Directorate dismantle a $47.6 million gaming scam through its Financial Intelligence Unit. Looking forward, if a deal is struck, the potential end of DOJ monitoring would be a significant milestone in Binance’s rehabilitation following one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history. However, the Treasury Department’s FinCEN monitor remains active, and final DOJ approval depends on satisfactory enhanced reporting arrangements that maintain regulatory oversight while reducing operational burden.

The world of decentralized finance and Web3 is constantly evolving, and projects like The Graph are at its core. If you’ve been wondering about The Graph price prediction for the coming years, you’ve come to the right place. We’ll dive deep into what makes GRT unique, analyze its past performance, and explore the factors that could shape its value from 2025 through 2030. Get ready to uncover the possibilities! What is The Graph (GRT) and Why Does it Matter for Web3 Data? Before we jump into price predictions, let’s clarify what The Graph is. Imagine the internet without search engines. Finding information would be nearly impossible. In the decentralized world of Web3, a similar challenge exists: how do you efficiently query and access data from blockchains? That’s where The Graph steps in. It’s a decentralized indexing protocol designed to make blockchain data accessible. Think of it as the Google for blockchains. Developers can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, to make blockchain data easily queryable. This is crucial for dApps (decentralized applications) that need to retrieve data quickly and reliably to function. Without The Graph, dApps would have to process vast amounts of raw blockchain data themselves, which is slow, expensive, and impractical. Key Benefits of The Graph: Efficient Data Access: Simplifies querying complex blockchain data for developers. Decentralization: Operates on a decentralized network, ensuring censorship resistance and reliability. Interoperability: Supports indexing data from various blockchains, enhancing the Web3 ecosystem. Developer Empowerment: Provides tools for creating powerful dApps that rely on organized, accessible data.

The Graph (GRT) launched its mainnet in December 2020, quickly gaining traction due to its critical role in the burgeoning Web3 space. Like many cryptocurrencies, GRT has experienced significant volatility since its inception. Initially, the token saw a surge in value as interest in decentralized applications and blockchain infrastructure grew. However, it has also faced periods of correction, influenced by broader market trends, regulatory news, and investor sentiment. Analyzing these historical price movements helps us contextualize future GRT price forecast scenarios. Important Milestones and Price Drivers: Mainnet Launch (2020): Marked the official start of The Graph’s decentralized indexing service. DeFi and NFT Booms (2021): Increased demand for reliable blockchain data, boosting GRT’s utility and price. Bear Markets (2022-2023): Broader crypto downturns impacted GRT, like most altcoins. Protocol Upgrades and Integrations: Continuous development and new blockchain integrations enhance The Graph’s value proposition. Factors Influencing The Graph Price Prediction Predicting cryptocurrency prices is complex, with numerous variables at play. For The Graph price prediction , several key factors will likely dictate its trajectory: 1. Web3 Adoption and Decentralized Indexing Demand The growth of the overall Web3 ecosystem is paramount. As more decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces emerge, the demand for efficient decentralized indexing services like The Graph will naturally increase.

The judgment follows a three-day bench trial where the court found the couple committed securities fraud by selling worthless tokens between June 2022 and April 2023. ‘False Prophets’ Weaponize Faith for Multi-Million Dollar Crypto Fraud Colorado Securities Commissioner Tung Chan called the Regalados “ 21st century false prophets who leveraged promising cryptocurrency technology to run an old-fashioned scam, victimizing their own congregants. ” The case gained international attention when Eli Regalado admitted in a viral YouTube video to using investor funds for personal expenses, including a “home remodel the Lord told us to do.” The Denver couple raised $3.4 million from more than 300 individuals despite having zero crypto experience and receiving a security audit score of 0 out of 10. They promised INDXcoin would trade on their Kingdom Wealth Exchange, which collapsed after one day of operation. The Regalados used investor money for luxury purchases, including jewelry, designer clothes, and a Range Rover. A Denver grand jury separately indicted both defendants on 40 criminal counts in July , adding to a growing pattern of faith-based crypto fraud targeting religious communities across the United States.

Back in August, federal courts awarded the CFTC $228.6 million against Eddy Alexandre , who exploited his church position and Haitian community standing to defraud over 25,000 investors of $262 million through his EminiFX scheme. Alexandre marketed EminiFX as an “investment club” promising 5% to 9.99% weekly returns through non-existent “robo-assisted advisor” technology. He enlisted congregation members to recruit additional investors, leveraging sacred relationships to expand the fraudulent operation across ethnic and religious communities. Court documents revealed Alexandre diverted at least $15 million in investor funds to personal accounts, purchasing luxury cars, including a BMW, while his trading platform lost money during 24 of its 30 weeks of operation. The fake technology claims centered on proprietary algorithms that never existed throughout the scheme’s eight-month duration. CFTC wins $228M judgment against pastor who ran crypto Ponzi promising 5-10% weekly returns, defrauding 25,000 investors. #Ponzi #Crypto https://t.co/2eLsOeMuMg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 20, 2025 Washington state witnessed similar exploitation when former Spanish-speaking church pastor Francier Obando Pinillo allegedly orchestrated a multiyear fraud, raising $5.9 million from over 1,500 investors. December last year, the CFTC alleges Pinillo promised up to 34.9% monthly profits through his “Solanofi” platform using proprietary trading bots he described as “risk-free.” Pinillo added multi-level marketing elements, offering 15% referral fees to customers who recruited friends and family. He provided fake online dashboards allowing investors to track supposed profits while operating a classic Ponzi scheme using later investor funds to pay earlier participants. Crypto Fraud Epidemic Religious Communities Through Social Engineering Colorado has emerged as a significant battleground against crypto fraud, with state investigators documenting a large number of crypto-related scams resulting in losses exceeding $81 million as of last year. Recent incidents include sophisticated law enforcement impersonation scams where fraudsters convinced victims to send Bitcoin under threats of arrest warrants. A Keystone resident lost over $6,000 in Bitcoin after scammers posed as deputies threatening arrest for missing jury duty, while a Denver woman lost nearly $5,000 following similar tactics. Scammers increasingly use caller ID spoofing to appear as official law enforcement agencies, as seen recently in a $2.8M UK theft case . These scammers exploit the irreversible nature of crypto transactions, which makes fund recovery nearly impossible. Bank staff have prevented additional losses by stopping residents from transferring thousands in crypto after receiving suspicious calls. Since last year, the FBI Denver office has issued public warnings highlighting cases where fraudsters specifically targeted religious communities, noting the aggressive and persuasive tactics employed by cryptocurrency scammers. In fact, during this first half of this year alone, crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and breaches, with phishing attacks accounting for $410 million across 132 incidents.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase is urging the DOJ to block state crypto laws that conflict with federal policy. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal says inconsistent state rules are harming innovation and legal clarity. The exchange points to Oregon’s lawsuit as a key example and backs federal legislation for uniform regulation. In a formal letter , the exchange asked federal authorities to preempt state laws it says are stifling innovation and hurting consumers. Coinbase CLO Slams State-Level Crypto Patchwork Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal criticized what he described as a confusing patchwork of state-level crypto rules, accusing states of relying on broad and inconsistent interpretations of securities law. He pointed to Oregon’s ongoing lawsuit against Coinbase as a prime example of the problem. “When Oregon can sue us for services that are legal under federal law, something’s broken,” Grewal said on social media, arguing that the current regulatory setup hampers progress and adds legal risk for businesses. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed suit against Coinbase in April, accusing the exchange of promoting unregistered securities in the state. This came just two months after the SEC dropped its own case against the company, which had alleged that Coinbase operated as an unregistered broker and exchange.

Coinbase is pushing back. In June, the company escalated the Oregon case to federal court and filed a separate lawsuit in July targeting Governor Tina Kotek, challenging the state’s authority in the matter. In its letter, Coinbase called on the DOJ to support federal legislation that would override conflicting state rules. Grewal cited pending bills like the CLARITY Act and the Responsible Financial Innovation Act as possible solutions that could deliver long-awaited clarity for the crypto industry. Coinbase Struggles to Stay Ahead of the Race As reported, Coinbase is racing to stay ahead of a wave of new competitors as it pivots from being a pure crypto exchange to a broader financial services platform. Founded in 2012, Coinbase entered the S&P 500 this year and now boasts a market cap of $83 billion. Its shares have surged 70% since Donald Trump’s election, thanks in part to his administration’s crypto-friendly stance. However, second-quarter earnings disappointed , and the stock dropped 15%, signaling investor caution. A growing concern is the company’s exposure to the price of Bitcoin. Trading fees, still the core of Coinbase’s revenue, rise and fall with crypto market volatility. Fee compression and competition from Asian exchanges are also eating into its margins. Coinbase has secured its position as custodian for eight of the top 11 US Bitcoin ETFs, earning $43 million in the last quarter of 2024 from that alone. However, new legislation could open the door for traditional custodians like State Street and BNY Mellon to enter the market , threatening Coinbase’s dominance. The firm is also eyeing tokenized stock trading and small business banking services, while leaning heavily into stablecoins and staking. Revenues from its USDC stablecoin partnership with Circle now trail only trading, while staking offers high-margin returns and defensibility. In its boldest move yet, Coinbase acquired crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion , signaling its intention to dominate that space. The company has also partnered with banks like JPMorgan and PNC to bridge crypto and traditional finance.
