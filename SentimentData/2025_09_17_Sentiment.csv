The $4 trillion digital asset space has grown little over the last few months, although the original crypto Bitcoin did hit a record peak of $124,128 last month. Beyond Bitcoin, major capital inflows are finding their way into both blue-chip altcoins and the best meme coins . Numerous projects have marked fresh all-time highs over the past year, showing the growing enthusiasm surrounding the sector. Adding momentum to this sentiment are two pivotal moves from Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, America’s inaugural comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins. Second, the SEC announced Project Crypto, a program aimed at updating and clarifying the application of securities laws to the digital asset industry. With confidence in the market climbing, let’s take a closer look at how the best altcoins like XRP, Cardano, and Shiba Inu could be positioning themselves for further gains. Ripple ($XRP): The Cross-Border Payments Leader and Best Performer among Altcoins in 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) hit a new peak of $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act became law, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40. It has since pulled back to about $3.05, down roughly 16% from that high. The appeal of XRP lies in its speed and affordability for cross-border transfers, often bypassing legacy payment systems like SWIFT. Its legitimacy is bolstered by endorsements from global bodies such as the UN Capital Development Fund and even acknowledgment from the White House. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also took part in a high-level presidential roundtable on crypto earlier this year. XRP gained renewed momentum in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled its retail sales were not securities violations, effectively ending a prolonged clash with the SEC. Over the past year, XRP has surged 429%, leaving Bitcoin’s 96% gains trailing behind. A mid-July breakout has kept the token around the psychologically significant $3 support level. While prices have dipped here and there, XRP has remained relatively stable throughout adverse market movements. With a relative strength index (RSI) around 54, the token is showing neutral momentum, suggesting traders are cautiously reentering following a temporary scare from softer U.S. inflation numbers. In mid-November, the US SEC will deliver verdicts on whether spot XRP ETFs will be approved for trading. If the verdicts are possible, we may see new momentum that could carry XRP to $4 or higher that same month. Cardano ($ADA): Eco-Friendly Ethereum Rival Prepping for 2026 Run-Up Cardano ($ADA) has ranked as one of the best altcoins for many years, and 2025 is no different. In the past 365 days, ADA climbed 159%, outpacing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Created in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is a smart contract platform that emphasizes sustainability through its Proof-of-Stake model and an academic, peer-reviewed development process, both of which later influenced Ethereum’s own direction. Currently valued at over $39.1 billion, ADA would need to triple its market cap to match Solana and begin challenging Ethereum for the number-two spot. ADA is trading at about $0.8701, reflecting a 1.1% rise over the last day, falling just short of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which rose 2.2% and 3.6% respectively. However, positive political and macroeconomic catalysts could push ADA toward $1.50 by autumn and potentially set the stage to retest its all-time high of $3.09 by year-end, a 255% increase from current levels. From a technical standpoint, ADA formed a bullish flag between December and March, hinting at more upside. Its RSI is downtrending from 52, which indicates its price is consolidating around current levels, with plenty of headroom for further growth in the near term. For now, resistance is near $1.15, while support remains firm around $0.85–$0.90. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Dogecoin Challenger with Real-World Utility and Huge Upside Potential Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in August 2020, has solidified its role as the second-largest meme coin, boasting a market cap of over $7.7 billion. In the past 24 hours, SHIB remains virtually unchanged despite a 4% drop on average across crypto’s $86.2 billion meme coin sector. Considering the fact that the collective $4.11 trillion crypto market actually grew 0.5% overnight, this is a strong signal that Shiba Inu is behaving more like a regular cryptocurrency. HIB currently trades around $0.00001311. Chart analysis points to possible further gains. In the past year, SHIB has shown two bullish formations: a descending wedge pattern from November through March and a flag formation emerging since mid-May. If SHIB breaks its primary resistance at $0.000022, a strong market rally could put it somewhere around $0.00003 before October ends. In a bull market, forecasts suggest a move between $0.00006 and $0.00009 by year’s end. Unlike most meme coins, SHIB offers tangible use cases through enhanced privacy features and Shibarium, its Ethereum-based Layer-2 scaling solution that lowers transaction fees and improves speed. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): First Bitcoin Layer 2 and One of 2025’s Hottest Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one of this year’s most talked-about presales, aiming to become the first Bitcoin Layer 2 that blends viral meme culture with scalability and community-driven development. The project’s goal is to enhance Bitcoin with faster transactions, smart contract capability, and community governance. So far, the presale has raised more than $16.2 million, with experts predicting potential post-launch gains exceeding 10×. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER supports ultra-fast smart contracts while keeping costs minimal. Its standout feature, the Canonical Bridge, enables near-instant BTC transfers while supporting dApps, meme tokens, and low-fee payments. A Coinsult audit confirmed the platform is free of vulnerabilities, further boosting confidence. The $HYPER token powers staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early presale participants can earn staking rewards of up to 70% APY, along with voting rights on future ecosystem updates.

51843473,https://cryptonews.com/?p=423782,1758061800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51843473.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 16 September – XRP, Solana, Pepe",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-16-september-xrp-solana-pepe/,"Major tokens have mounted a modest recovery today, with the crypto price prediction for XRP, Solana, and Pepe improving as we get closer to the FOMC’s much-anticipated meeting this week . The crypto market as a whole has seen its total cap rise by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, reaching $4.11 trillion as investors become more bullish in anticipation of a likely rate cut from the Fed. It’s in this context that we take a closer look at XRP, Solana and Pepe, which are now in a position where they could surge in the event of a rate cut tomorrow. We examine their fundamentals and technicals, and we offer predictions as to where they could be in the near and more distant future. Crypto Price Prediction Today 16 September XRP ($XRP): Incoming ETF Approval Could Push Alt to New ATH by October XRP has risen to $3.03 today, marking a 1.5% gain in 24 hours and a decent 8% increase in a fortnight. What’s also bullish is that the altcoin is still down by 3% in a month, implying that it still has plenty of space to rally further this week before entering an overbought position. There are numerous reasons to be optimistic about XRP right now, with the most immediate being the fact that we could see upwards of ten XRP ETFs gain SEC approval in the coming months. In fact, Bloomberg analysts have suggested that one XRP ETF – the REX-Osprey XRP ETF – could begin trading as early as this week, which could be massive for the coin’s price. This coincides with XRP reaching a very opportune position in its chart, which is showing a steady increase in momentum, just in time for bullish news (from the Fed and/or SEC). Source: TradingView XRP’s RSI (yellow) has climbed above 50 in recent days and looks ready to climb further, while its MACD (orange, blue) has also recently turned positive. When you combine these technicals with Ripple’s recent growth and expansion as a cross-border transfer business , they point to a rising XRP price. It could reach $3.50 by the end of the month, while a bull rally could see it top $5 in December. Solana ($SOL): Treasury Firms Can Push Token to New Highs Within Weeks Trading at the $235 level, Solana has risen by 7.5% in a week and by 22% in a month. This gives the altcoin plenty of momentum as we enter a key period for the crypto market, with Solana having benefited from lots of positive news recently. On the one hand, more institutions and/or public companies have announced SOL treasury strategies, including the Galaxy Digital-backed Forward Industries and Helius Medical . On the other hand, Solana continues to grow as a layer-one platform, as evidenced by Pump.fun’s ongoing growth in revenue , for example. This arguably makes SOL the most bullish alt in the market right now, with its chart today showing that it’s getting closer to a peak. Source: TradingView As such, we could see the Solana price rise strongly towards the end of the week, following the FOMC’s rate decision, before correcting a little over the weekend. Longer term, the prospect of SOL ETFs means that the crypto price prediction for Solana is very bullish, with the coin set to reach new all-time highs in Q4. It could potentially pass $300 by November, before crossing $400 by the New Year. Pepe ($PEPE): Whale Buys Indicate Incoming Pump for Meme Token As with several other coins, Pepe has moved sideways today, with its current price of $0.00001076 representing a very slight drop in 24 hours. However, PEPE remains up by 11% in a fortnight, and while it is down by 4% in a month, this presents an opportunity for further gains in the very near future. Its chart supports the view that the meme token remains in an oversold position and that a rebound is on its way. As we can see below, its indicators have only recently turned positive, having spent pretty much all of August in negative territory. Source: TradingView And it seems that whales have been stocking up on PEPE in recent days , in expectation of big rises in the weeks and/or months to come. This is an encouraging development as far as the crypto price prediction for PEPE goes, and it testifies to the meme token’s enduring popularity. We could therefore see the PEPE price reach $0.0000160 in the next few weeks, before climbing to $0.000030 by Xmas. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-to-Earn Token Raises $1.1 Million in Viral Presale The tokens above all have a good chance of rallying strongly as and when the crypto market enters a bull rally, yet traders may also wish to diversify into newer tokens. That’s because new and recently launched tokens can often outperform market averages, particularly when they gain exchange listings for the first time. This is something that happens to presale coins, which can generate lots of momentum during their sales, and they rally upon launch. The world’s first Mine-to-Earn meme coin is here. Yep you read that right. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/3j6C8mqmjW — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 16, 2025 One of the more interesting presale tokens around right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 coin that is offering a novel take on staking. PEPENODE has already raised $1.17 million in its presale, which it opened last month, and it’s quickly attracting new supporters. What’s exciting about PEPENODE is that it’s launching with a ‘mine-to-earn’ staking system, in which holders can build their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to buy more virtual nodes, users can earn bigger staking yields. This dynamic is likely to incentivize greater PEPENODE accumulation, which in turn could see the coin’s price rising steadily over time. Investors can join its presale and but it early by visiting the PEPENODE website , where the coin currently costs $0.0010617.

With its hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin was designed to be resistant to inflation and independent of central bank policy. Yet even after fifteen years, its claim to “digital gold” status remains unproven. Recent market action highlights the contrast: while traditional safe-haven assets climb steadily during uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to behave like a risk asset, rising and falling with liquidity cycles rather than shielding portfolios in times of stress. At the same time, the conversation about where true value lies in crypto is being reframed. While Bitcoin struggles to live up to its nickname, new projects are capturing attention in other ways. MAGACOIN FINANCE , a presale smashing fundraising records, is demonstrating that scarcity, cultural energy, and legitimacy can create value every bit as compelling as the “digital gold” narrative once promised. Institutional adoption, but lingering volatility The arrival of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 marked a milestone, drawing billions in institutional inflows. Pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers finally had an accessible vehicle for exposure. But with inflows came a reality check: volatility hasn’t disappeared. Instead of behaving like a hedge in times of economic stress, Bitcoin’s price action still mirrors risk assets such as high-growth tech stocks. This unresolved identity keeps Bitcoin from fully stepping into the “digital gold” role. Institutions may recognize its scarcity and network security, but many still hesitate to treat it as a true safe-haven asset. Until Bitcoin can consistently offer stability through crises, its crown remains aspirational rather than proven. A new definition of value Bitcoin’s volatility raises an important question: what defines value in the crypto world? If scarcity and institutional inflows aren’t enough, what else matters? Increasingly, analysts point to cultural relevance, community engagement, and the ability to capture imagination. These are elements gold doesn’t have and Bitcoin hasn’t mastered, but they are at the heart of new breakout projects. This is where the story shifts. Instead of chasing “digital gold” status, some tokens are redefining value entirely. They thrive not by replicating traditional assets but by offering something uniquely digital, built around scarcity, branding, and cultural firepower. The clearest current example is MAGACOIN FINANCE. In just weeks, the project has already raised more than $14 million , with presale rounds selling out at unprecedented speed. Thousands of investors are joining Telegram groups, stacking allocations, and amplifying buzz across social platforms. Whale inflows are complementing grassroots enthusiasm, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of momentum. What makes this story different is legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE has completed major audits , giving it structural credibility rarely seen in early presales. Combined with scarcity-driven tokenomics and bold cultural branding, the project has broken records not simply by hype, but by delivering the ingredients investors increasingly demand. According to many analysts MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a staggering 9,300% ROI, positioning it alongside the fastest-growing meme-driven altcoins of the last decade. Why the timing matters The timing of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise is no accident. With Bitcoin still searching for its identity as digital gold, traders are eager for assets that can combine scarcity with excitement. Presales thrive in this environment, offering both early access and the potential for asymmetric returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the embodiment of that trend: a project not weighed down by debates about hedging or institutional status, but celebrated for its real-time traction. By breaking fundraising records, it shows that crypto’s next stars may not come from mimicking gold, but from building entirely new definitions of value. The broader message for crypto markets Crypto’s evolution has always depended on dual narratives. On one side, Bitcoin pushes toward institutional legitimacy, battling to prove itself as a safe-haven asset. On the other, cultural projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE rise rapidly, powered by community energy and scarcity. This dynamic balance keeps the sector vibrant, attracting both cautious institutions and passionate retail investors. For the market, this coexistence is critical. Bitcoin’s quest for legitimacy provides the anchor regulators can engage with, while projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE keep the industry fresh, relevant, and fast-moving. Together, they ensure crypto remains one of the most dynamic asset classes in global finance. Conclusion Bitcoin has not yet earned its crown as “digital gold.” Despite ETFs and institutional inflows, its volatility keeps it tethered to risk-on assets rather than serving as a true hedge. But crypto doesn’t need to replicate gold to thrive. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving that value can also be defined by scarcity, community, and legitimacy. With more than $14 million raised , audits completed, and social momentum accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking records and rewriting what investors expect from presales. Where Bitcoin still seeks proof of concept, this project is already demonstrating traction. Together, they show that the future of crypto won’t be defined by a single narrative, but by multiple paths to value.

A truly remarkable event just unfolded, as a long-dormant Bitcoin whale , inactive for over a decade, suddenly sprang to life. This mysterious entity, holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin, executed a significant transfer that has caught the attention of market watchers globally. What could this sudden movement signify? Unveiling the Mysterious Bitcoin Whale’s Significant Transfer According to data from Whale Alert, a service tracking large cryptocurrency transactions, a Bitcoin whale that had been dormant for a remarkable 12 years recently moved 98.99 BTC. This transfer occurred just an hour ago, sending the funds to an anonymous address. For context, this whale originally held 1,000 BTC, making this latest move a substantial portion of its long-held stash. Such a lengthy period of inactivity for a wallet of this size is highly unusual. The sudden awakening of this particular Bitcoin whale naturally sparks numerous questions about its owner’s intentions and the potential ripple effects on the broader crypto market. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Whale and Why Do They Matter? In the world of cryptocurrency, a Bitcoin whale refers to an individual or entity that holds an exceptionally large amount of Bitcoin. While there isn’t an official threshold, holdings typically ranging from hundreds to thousands of BTC are often considered ‘whale’ status. These large holders play a crucial role in the market for several reasons: Market Influence: Their large transactions can significantly impact Bitcoin’s price and market sentiment. Liquidity: Whales often provide or withdraw significant liquidity from exchanges. Early Adopters: Many dormant whales are early adopters of Bitcoin, holding coins from its nascent days. Tracking the movements of these powerful players provides valuable insights into potential market shifts and trends. Their actions can often precede significant price movements, making their activity a key indicator for many investors. Why Did This Dormant Bitcoin Whale Finally Stir? The reasons behind this particular Bitcoin whale ‘s sudden activity after 12 years are purely speculative, given the anonymity of blockchain transactions. However, several common theories emerge when such dormant wallets awaken: Profit-Taking: The whale might be looking to realize substantial gains from their long-term investment, given Bitcoin’s incredible price appreciation over the past decade. Portfolio Rebalancing: The owner could be moving funds to diversify their holdings, perhaps into other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets. Security Upgrade: Transferring funds to a newer, more secure wallet or a different cold storage solution. Exchange Deposit: The funds might be moving to an exchange, potentially signaling an intent to sell. Lost Keys Found: In rare cases, owners who had lost access to their private keys might have finally recovered them. Without more information, the exact motivation remains a captivating mystery. However, the sheer duration of dormancy makes this event particularly intriguing. The Broader Implications for the Bitcoin Market The movement of nearly 99 BTC by a long-dormant Bitcoin whale can have several implications for the wider market. While 99 BTC might not be enough to crash the market, it’s the symbolism and potential for further action that creates interest. If the funds were moved to an exchange, it could signal an impending sell-off, potentially adding selling pressure. Conversely, if moved to a new cold storage address, it could indicate a long-term holding strategy, which is often seen as a bullish sign. On-chain analytics tools allow experts to trace these movements, providing a degree of transparency even with anonymous addresses. The crypto community will be closely watching for any subsequent transactions from this address or the remaining 901 BTC held by the original whale. What Can We Learn from This Bitcoin Whale’s Awakening? This event offers several valuable lessons for both seasoned and new crypto investors. Firstly, it underscores the incredible long-term holding power of some early Bitcoin adopters. Holding through multiple market cycles, including significant bear markets, demonstrates immense conviction. Secondly, it highlights the importance of staying informed about significant on-chain movements. While not always predictive, large transfers can act as indicators of shifts in sentiment or supply dynamics. For investors, understanding the behavior of a Bitcoin whale can offer a unique perspective on market trends and potential future price action. It encourages a deeper dive into market analytics beyond just price charts. In conclusion, the awakening of this 12-year dormant Bitcoin whale and its subsequent transfer of 99 BTC is a fascinating development. It serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic, often unpredictable, and always intriguing nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. While the ultimate intentions of this mysterious whale remain unknown, its actions provide valuable data points for those seeking to understand the complex forces shaping the future of Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically hundreds or thousands of BTC, whose transactions can significantly influence market prices and sentiment. Why do Bitcoin whale transfers matter? Their transfers matter because they can signal potential buying or selling pressure, affect market liquidity, and provide insights into the confidence or intentions of major holders, impacting overall market psychology. What does ‘dormant’ mean in the context of a crypto wallet? A dormant crypto wallet refers to a wallet address that has shown no outgoing transactions for a very long period, often several years, indicating that the funds have been untouched by their owner. Can these large Bitcoin transfers affect Bitcoin’s price? Yes, significant transfers, especially if moved to exchanges, can lead to increased selling pressure and potentially cause short-term price volatility. Conversely, movements to cold storage might be interpreted as a bullish long-term hold signal. How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track Bitcoin whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms and services like Whale Alert, which provide real-time notifications of large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. What are the typical reasons for a dormant Bitcoin whale to become active? Common reasons include profit-taking, rebalancing portfolios, moving funds to more secure wallets, preparing to sell on an exchange, or, in some cases, regaining access to lost private keys.

Lawmakers are actively considering a proposal to integrate the Anti-CBDC act into a broader, comprehensive digital asset market structure bill. This move could have profound implications for the future of digital currencies in America. This development, initially reported by Cointelegraph, signals a critical juncture for cryptocurrency regulation. If this measure passes, the combined legislation would then advance to the Senate for further deliberation. What is the Anti-CBDC Act and Why is it Crucial? At its core, the Anti-CBDC act aims to prevent the U.S. government from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is essentially a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Proponents of the Anti-CBDC act express significant concerns. They often highlight issues related to privacy, potential government surveillance, and the risk of increased financial control over citizens. The act seeks to safeguard individual financial freedom and limit government overreach in digital transactions. Many believe that a government-issued digital currency could pave the way for a ‘surveillance state,’ where every transaction is monitored. This perspective drives the urgent push for this protective legislation. A Pivotal Moment for Crypto Market Structure The proposed inclusion of the Anti-CBDC act is not happening in isolation. It is being considered as part of a larger digital asset market structure bill. This overarching legislation aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Establishing clear rules is vital for the growth and stability of the crypto market. Without proper guidelines, businesses and investors face uncertainty, which can hinder innovation and adoption. The market structure bill intends to address these regulatory gaps. Integrating the Anti-CBDC act into this bill means that the debate over central bank digital currencies is now firmly linked to the broader conversation about how digital assets will be regulated in the U.S. This connection elevates the importance of both legislative efforts. Past Battles and Future Prospects for the Anti-CBDC Act This isn’t the first time Republican lawmakers have attempted to ban the issuance of a central bank digital currency. Previously, they sought to include an anti-CBDC measure during a vote on the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill. While that specific attempt did not succeed within the stablecoin bill, the commitment to the cause remained strong. Subsequently, the Anti-CBDC act successfully passed the House as a standalone bill. This earlier success demonstrates significant support for the measure. Now, by attempting to attach it to a broader digital asset bill, lawmakers are looking for a more direct path to enactment. This strategy could increase its chances of becoming law, as it would be part of a larger package deemed essential for the crypto industry. What are the Core Concerns Surrounding CBDCs? The opposition to CBDCs stems from several key concerns: Privacy: Critics fear that a CBDC could eliminate financial privacy, allowing governments to track every transaction. Surveillance: There’s a worry that a CBDC could enable a ‘surveillance state,’ giving authorities unprecedented insight into citizens’ spending habits. Control: Some argue that a CBDC could give governments the power to freeze funds, implement negative interest rates, or even program spending, limiting individual economic freedom. Disintermediation: There are concerns that CBDCs could bypass commercial banks, fundamentally altering the financial system. These points form the bedrock of the arguments in favor of the Anti-CBDC act , emphasizing the need for safeguards against potential governmental overreach. The Road Ahead: From House to Senate If the U.S. House of Representatives successfully incorporates the Anti-CBDC act into the digital asset market structure bill, the journey is far from over. The comprehensive legislation would then be sent to the Senate for its own round of deliberations, debates, and votes. The Senate process can be complex and time-consuming, with potential amendments and further negotiations. The outcome in the Senate is not guaranteed, and strong advocacy from both sides of the CBDC debate is expected. Ultimately, for the Anti-CBDC act to become law as part of this broader bill, it must pass both chambers of Congress and receive presidential assent. This legislative path highlights the critical nature of the current discussions in the House. The ongoing debate in the U.S. House over the inclusion of the Anti-CBDC act in the digital asset market structure bill marks a truly pivotal moment for the future of finance and individual liberties. This legislative effort underscores a growing concern among lawmakers about the potential implications of central bank digital currencies. The outcome of these discussions will not only shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies but also determine the extent of government involvement in digital money. It’s a debate that touches upon fundamental questions of privacy, control, and the very nature of money in the digital age. Keeping an eye on these developments is essential for anyone interested in the evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)? A1: A CBDC is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are decentralized, a CBDC is centralized and controlled by the government. Q2: What is the primary goal of the Anti-CBDC act? A2: The primary goal of the Anti-CBDC act is to prevent the U.S. government from issuing a central bank digital currency, citing concerns about privacy, surveillance, and potential government control over individual finances. Q3: How does the Anti-CBDC act relate to the broader crypto market structure bill? A3: The Anti-CBDC act is being considered for inclusion in a larger bill designed to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. This means the debate over CBDCs is now tied to the overall regulation of the crypto industry. Q4: What are the main concerns opponents have about CBDCs? A4: Opponents primarily worry about the erosion of financial privacy, the potential for government surveillance of transactions, and the risk of governments gaining excessive control over citizens’ spending and financial activities. Q5: What happens if the Anti-CBDC act is included in the market structure bill and passes the House? A5: If included and passed by the House, the combined legislation, including the Anti-CBDC act , would then proceed to the Senate for further deliberation, debate, and a vote before potentially becoming law. Q6: Has the Anti-CBDC act been debated before? A6: Yes, Republican lawmakers previously attempted to include an anti-CBDC measure in a stablecoin regulation bill. The Anti-CBDC act also passed the House as a standalone bill prior to this current consideration.

Resistance at around $0.29 is being watched closely, and a breakout here could trigger further upside. Meanwhile, Remittix(RTX) is rising fast as the best crypto presale pick in 2025. Its team is now verified by CertiK, and its wallet beta is live with community testers. Compare Doge’s speculative momentum with Remittix’s foundational upgrades and the presale path looks increasingly attractive. Dogecoin’s Path To $0.50 Looks Possible Dogecoin is trading at around $0.26, with a resistance zone between $0.27 and $0.29. If DOGE holds support around $0.23 and volume picks up, this breakout could materialize perhaps by late Q4. Market volatility and weak macro signals might dampen momentum. Also, meme coin saturation and lack of new utility could limit upside. Still, many believe the risk-reward looks favorable if DOGE can clear the resistance and maintain bullish indicators. Why Remittix has Become the Best Crypto Presale Right Now Dogecoin’s possible rally is powered by sentiment and technicals, but Remittix is offering structural utility, verified security and strong community incentives. The project is fully verified by CertiK and is officially ranked #1 on CertiK for Pre-Launch tokens, which raises confidence among security-conscious investors. The wallet beta is live, and community users are actively testing, helping to uncover usability feedback and speed up product readiness. These updates give Remittix something more than charts; they give it substance. Demand metrics for Remittix underline its growing strength. It has sold over 664 million tokens. It is priced at $0.1080 per token. It has raised over $25,8 million. Those numbers show strong momentum, early adoption and that investors are backing the presale in size. Add the 15% USDT referral rewards and $250,000 giveaway and Remittix offers more utility-oriented upside for those seeking a presale opportunity. Here are features that boost Remittix’s case: Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries Global payout rails are integrated already and expanding The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency Early believers are already calling it “XRP 2.0” It is built for adoption, not speculation These factors contrast sharply with DOGE’s reliance on community sentiment and potential, but less on product rollout. With BitMart listing secured once over $20 million was raised, LBANK listing secured upon passing $22 million and a third CEX listing in view, Remittix is building real market access. Remittix Is Standing Out While Dogecoin Eyes Technical Upside Dogecoin has a path to $0.50 if it breaks well above $0.29 and holds support near $0.23. Technicals and sentiment favor the possibility. Yet Remittix is delivering verified security with CertiK, a live wallet beta under community test, strong metrics and incentive programs working now. For those asking, “What is the best crypto presale?” Remittix is looking like the strongest pick, offering both structural strength and upside that many DOGE bulls are hoping for but may not have in hand yet.

51844537,582600,1758063629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51844537.jpeg,American Express Turns Travel Memories Into NFT Passport Stamps,https://bitcoinist.com/american-express-turns-travel-memories-into-nft-passport-stamps/,"American Express has rolled out a new way for cardholders to collect travel memories: blockchain-backed passport stamps that live on a public ledger. The stamps are meant to be keepsakes, not investments, and they are tied to in-person spending while traveling. American Express Launches Passport Stamps According to company information and reports, the feature — called Amex Passport — issues NFT-style stamps as ERC-721 tokens on Base, an Ethereum layer-two network. Eligible cardholders must be US consumer cardholders with their cards linked to their online Amex account. Stamps are earned when a linked card is used in person in any of 130+ qualifying countries and regions, and past trips can be stamped retroactively for up to two years based on purchase records. What The Stamps Show Reports have disclosed that each stamp records simple details: the country or region visited, a date, and a short note such as a favorite meal or a memorable sight. The stamps can be viewed in the Amex Travel app’s Passport section and can be shared to social media or saved to a camera roll. They are non-transferable, which means users cannot sell or move them to other wallets; they are intended strictly as personal mementos. How Travelers Can Earn Stamps American Express Cardholders who pay with their Amex card, or via Apple Pay or Google Pay tied to that card, should trigger the stamp when they make qualifying purchases abroad. Based on reports, the smart contract implementing the program was deployed roughly 25 days before the public announcement, and more than 20,000 stamps had been issued soon after launch. That early uptake suggests some interest among frequent travelers who already use Amex while abroad. American Express: Privacy And Technical Notes According to published coverage, American Express aims to limit what goes on chain. Stamps avoid putting personal information such as names or exact purchase details into the public ledger. Still, the fact that entries live on a public blockchain means there are tradeoffs — some data about visits will be visible to anyone who inspects the contract. The company says privacy safeguards are in place, but users who are cautious about on-chain traces should be aware of those limits. What The Numbers Show A customer survey cited around 73% of respondents saying they want more digital ways to mark trips , while about 56% said they miss getting physical passport stamps. The initial list of eligible places covers 130+ countries and regions, and retroactive stamping reaches back two years. At launch the program applies only to US consumer cards; corporate accounts are not included.

As it stands, record stock valuations, resilient GDP growth, sticky inflation, and cracks are forming in the labor market, leaving the stage open for volatility in traditional markets that could spill over into the next explosive altcoin season. Fed Rate Cuts At Record Valuations Expectations are also high that the Fed will keep lowering rates at the next interest rate decision on Wednesday, September 17, 2025 and through the end of this year. According to a lengthy thread that was posted on the social media platform X, this could have long-term bullish effects on the crypto industry. Related Reading: Altcoin Market Completes Highest Monthly Close Ever: What This Means For Alt Season The Federal Reserve usually cuts rates in the face of economic weakness and depressed equity markets, but this time is different. As noted by The Kobeissi Letter, valuation metrics tracked by Bloomberg show US stocks are more expensive than ever, having surpassed even the 1929 pre-Depression peak and the dot-com bubble. Furthermore, the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio hit 5.3x in late August, its record level. Despite these extremes, policymakers are expected to cut by at least 25 basis points this week based on weakness in the labor market. History shows that when rate cuts occurred with stocks within 2% of all-time highs, as shown in 2019 and 2024, the S&P 500 delivered strong gains over the following year. This unusual mix could once again amplify capital flows into high-growth assets, including cryptocurrencies, in the last quarter of 2025. A Perfect Time For Altcoins Cutting rates into hot inflation adds liquidity fuel just as investors chase risk assets. That backdrop has always caused powerful surges for Gold, Bitcoin, and other major cryptocurrencies, as the return of these assets thrives when fiat returns come under question. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Index Sets New 2025 High, What This Means For The Crypto Market As The Kobeissi Letter framed it, the time has come. The Fed’s decision to cut rates with stocks at record highs, amid a 3% GDP growth and hot inflation 110 bps above the Fed’s long-term target, could be the driver of the next altcoin season. Gold and Bitcoin have already been priced in this new era of liquidity, as both are now up by 450% and 105%, respectively, since 2023. The setup is even better for altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Chainlink, and most especially cryptocurrencies involved in the growing AI niche. There could be more immediate-term volatility, but long-term asset owners will benefit the most from the rate cut. However, if the Federal Reserve opts for a slower pace of cuts than markets are currently pricing in, the disappointment could ripple through both equities and cryptocurrencies and cause short-term declines this week.

Fundamentals supported by Aptos expansion and Kraken Ink partnership. By Jainam Mehta Aave ( AAVE-USD ) is currently trading at $296.30, showing weakness after failing to defend the $300 psychological level and slipping below its short-term moving averages. The 20-day EMA sits at $303.0, the 50-day EMA at $305.9, the 100-day EMA at $307.5, and the 200-day EMA at $308.2, all clustering overhead as resistance. The immediate support is at $295.0–$292.0, with a deeper floor around $276.0 if bearish momentum persists. To shift sentiment, AAVE must reclaim the $300–$305 zone, which now acts as resistance. The RSI at 35.4 indicates oversold conditions, hinting at short-term exhaustion in selling pressure. Technical and on-chain picture On-chain flows reflect mixed signals. Netflows on September 16 recorded +$0.98M inflows, suggesting renewed deposits into exchanges. While this may point to profit-taking or near-term sell pressure, whale accumulation near the $290–$295 region has historically provided local support. AAVE’s market cap remains near $4.2B, securing its status as a top DeFi lending protocol, though it lags behind competitors in recent momentum. Aave price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technically, the loss of the rising channel structure and rejection from the EMA cluster confirm bearish momentum. Holding $295 support is now critical, as a break lower could expose the $276 zone, last defended in July. Conversely, reclaiming $300–$305 would restore confidence, with follow-through targets at $325–$330 if momentum builds. Fundamental positioning and outlook From a fundamentals standpoint, Aave continues to expand its ecosystem. The Aptos integration earlier this year marked its first non-EVM deployment, broadening the reach beyond Ethereum and its L2s. At the same time, the partnership with Kraken Ink is designed to channel institutional liquidity into regulated Aave-powered lending markets, positioning the protocol for long-term adoption. On the downside, regulatory risks tied to stablecoin yields and phishing campaigns targeting Aave users highlight short-term sentiment headwinds. Institutional engagement remains supportive, but retail appetite has weakened as staking yields declined. The V4 Liquidity Hub and Horizon RWA markets provide longer-term tailwinds by bridging DeFi and traditional finance, yet near-term market structure suggests Aave will remain dependent on Bitcoin-led flows. Short-term outlook Looking ahead, AAVE sits at a fragile juncture. If $295 holds, oversold RSI could spark a relief rally back into $305–$310, aligning with EMA resistances. A decisive break above $310–$315 would be needed to unlock medium-term targets at $325–$330. Conversely, failure to defend $295 risks further downside into the $276–$278 demand area. Broader altcoin weakness, fueled by rising Bitcoin dominance at 57.3%, will remain a key external driver. In earlier analysis, the $300–$305 zone was highlighted as the critical pivot. Current price action confirms its role as the key battleground for AAVE’s next directional move.

Whales staked more than $1.5 billion in SOL, reducing circulating supply. A breakout above $240 could accelerate gains toward $260 and $280. By Parshwa Turakhiya ​Solana ( SOL-USD ) is trading around $235.87, consolidating after briefly touching $237 earlier in the session. The token remains in a rising channel that has defined its uptrend since June, supported by strong inflows and whale accumulation that continue to underpin its structure. Technical barriers emerge at $240 The daily chart shows Solana holding comfortably above its 20-day EMA at $219 and 50-day EMA at $201. Broader support rests near the 200-day EMA at $176. The immediate challenge is the $240–$245 resistance zone, where the upper channel trendline aligns with a key Fibonacci cluster. A clean break above this barrier would likely expose the $260 and $280 levels, while a failure to defend $219 risks a slide toward $201 and $187. SOLUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Momentum indicators remain constructive. The RSI prints near 65, reflecting controlled consolidation rather than exhaustion. If RSI reclaims 70 while price sustains above $240, momentum buyers could trigger the next leg higher. Whale accumulation supports conviction On-chain flows highlight growing institutional involvement. Net inflows of $39.7 million entered exchanges on September 16, extending a trend of positive flows through September after months of stagnation. This suggests accumulation pressure is building, aligning with the price recovery. Whale wallets have been particularly active. More than $1.5 billion worth of SOL shifted through Coinbase Prime and Forward Industries staking accounts over the past week. Large tranches of nearly 987,000 SOL, worth about $237 million each, were staked, with additional transfers of 439,000 SOL (~$99 million each) sent into custody. These movements reduce circulating supply and signal long-term commitment rather than speculative rotation. Outlook hinges on breakout Solana’s near-term trajectory depends on whether it can overcome resistance at $240–$245. A confirmed close above this level could open a run toward $260 and $280, while rejection would likely send the token back to the $219 support cluster. Institutional staking and whale inflows provide a strong structural base, reinforcing conviction that Solana remains a leading candidate for outperformance in the current cycle. The scale of accumulation has also fueled speculation that SOL could reach far higher levels if momentum persists, though traders remain cautious near technical resistance. Previously, we noted that Solana’s outperformance against Ethereum was being reinforced by positive inflows and retail rotation into high-beta altcoins. The latest data on whale staking further validates this trend, suggesting that both institutional and retail forces are aligning to sustain the rally.

The strategic move by Chiliz OG Esports , a groundbreaking development, sees Chiliz (CHZ) making a significant foray into the competitive gaming landscape. This pivotal moment involves the acquisition of a 51% stake in the renowned esports organization OG Esports, as reported by Decrypt. It’s a clear signal that the convergence of blockchain technology and professional gaming is accelerating, promising exciting new opportunities for fans and stakeholders alike. What Does the Chiliz OG Esports Acquisition Mean for Fan Tokens? This isn’t Chiliz’s first interaction with OG Esports. Back in 2020, OG Esports was a pioneer, becoming the very first esports team to launch its fan token on the Socios platform. This early partnership laid the groundwork for the deeper integration we see today. The OG fan token has already demonstrated impressive growth, recently hitting an all-time high in market capitalization, soaring past the $100 million mark. Currently, the OG fan token is trading robustly. According to CoinMarketCap, it sits at $16.83, reflecting a healthy 10.23% increase. This strong performance underscores the inherent value and appeal of fan tokens, especially when backed by a popular and successful team like OG Esports. The Chiliz OG Esports acquisition will likely amplify this trend, potentially driving further engagement and utility for these innovative digital assets. How Will Chiliz’s Investment Shape the Esports Landscape? Chiliz, through its Socios.com platform, has been at the forefront of fan engagement in sports and esports globally. Acquiring a majority stake in OG Esports is a strategic move designed to deepen its roots within the dynamic esports ecosystem. This isn’t just about a financial investment; it’s about integrating Web3 technologies more intimately into team operations and enhancing fan experiences. Enhanced Fan Engagement: Expect more innovative ways for fans to interact with OG Esports, from voting on minor team decisions to gaining exclusive access and earning unique rewards. New Revenue Streams: The acquisition could unlock novel monetization strategies for OG Esports, leveraging blockchain’s transparency and efficiency. This provides sustainable growth opportunities. Broader Web3 Adoption: This significant move could serve as a blueprint for other esports organizations, encouraging wider adoption of fan tokens and comprehensive blockchain solutions across the industry. The vision behind the Chiliz OG Esports deal extends beyond simple ownership. It aims to create a more immersive and rewarding experience for the global fanbase, solidifying the role of digital assets in modern sports entertainment and community building. What Are the Future Prospects for Fan Tokens in Esports? The success of the OG fan token and the subsequent Chiliz acquisition paint a clear picture: fan tokens are here to stay and poised for significant growth. This development suggests a future where fan tokens are not just collectibles but integral tools for community governance, loyalty programs, and direct, meaningful interaction between teams and their ardent supporters. Consider the compelling potential benefits: Direct Influence: Token holders gain a tangible voice in minor team decisions, fostering a stronger sense of belonging and ownership. Exclusive Perks: Access to VIP events, limited-edition merchandise, and unique digital content can be directly tied to token ownership, rewarding loyalty. Community Building: Fan tokens facilitate a decentralized community where supporters have a shared stake in the team’s success, creating a powerful collective identity. The Chiliz OG Esports partnership is a testament to the evolving dynamics of sports and entertainment, where digital ownership and active community participation are becoming increasingly vital components of the fan experience. Driving Innovation: The Road Ahead for Chiliz and OG Esports This strategic alliance is set to drive significant innovation within both the blockchain and esports sectors. Chiliz’s established expertise in Web3 technology, particularly with fan tokens, combined with OG Esports’ competitive prowess and dedicated global fanbase, creates a powerful synergy. We can anticipate not only new product offerings and enhanced platform features but also potentially groundbreaking integrations that push the boundaries of what’s possible in fan engagement and digital ownership. However, this journey isn’t without its considerations. Integrating blockchain solutions into a traditional esports organization requires careful planning and execution. Ensuring user-friendliness for fans who might be new to crypto, managing tokenomics effectively, and navigating regulatory landscapes will be key challenges. Despite these, the potential for growth and the creation of a truly interactive fan ecosystem is immense. The Chiliz OG Esports partnership aims to overcome these hurdles, setting new industry standards. This is more than just a business transaction; it’s a statement about the future. It highlights the growing importance of decentralized technologies in mainstream industries. The partnership will undoubtedly inspire other teams and organizations to explore similar ventures, further legitimizing fan tokens and blockchain applications in the broader sports entertainment industry. The goal is to create a more direct, transparent, and rewarding relationship between teams and their most passionate supporters.

The drama will air on MBC, one of South Korea’s biggest terrestrial broadcast networks, in the prime-time 10 pm Friday and Saturday slot. The first episode will air on September 19, and the drama is based on a hit novel by Jang Ryu-jin. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the production team behind the drama explained that the three main characters, played by Lee, Jo (formerly of the K-pop group gugudan), and Ra, all share a common goal: To find wealth through crypto investment. A trailer for the upcoming Korean drama series To The Moon. Korean Drama To The Moon ‘Does Not Encourage Crypto Speculation’ The drama’s producers were keen to emphasize that “although the three main characters have a common interest in cryptocurrency investment, the drama does not encourage speculation.” At a media event on September 16, Oh Da-young, the drama’s chief producer, said: “We are not trying to tell viewers that they can make a lot of money from [crypto investment]. We aren’t trying to stoke speculation.” WATCH: #LeeSunBin , #RaMiRan , #JoAram , And #KimYoungDae Prepare To Board The Cryptocurrency Train In "" #ToTheMoon "" Teaser https://t.co/KEoy2W1A26 pic.twitter.com/K3KYTlPXZr — Soompi (@soompi) September 10, 2025 However, it appears that the drama’s cast members are no strangers to crypto. Ra said that she holds a small amount of Ethereum (ETH) . The veteran actress explained: “I actually have 500,000 won [$362] worth of Ethereum. Sometimes its value goes up to 600,000 won, and sometimes it goes down to 400,000 won. But I don’t know how to withdraw my money, so I just leave it alone. I’ll hold on to it until the day it reaches 500 million won [$361,721]!” The official poster for the South Korean drama series To The Moon. (Image: MBC/X) Drama’s Backdrop Is 2017-2018 Bitcoin Bull Market The drama is set in 2017-2018, at the time of the crypto bull market. At the time, crypto investment was entirely unregulated in South Korea, and media outlets were full of news stories about pensioners and schoolchildren investing their money in little-known altcoins. The action centers around three women from poor families who have grand dreams. However, they are frustrated by their low-salary office jobs at a large confectionery retailer. When one of the trio starts to see positive results from investing in crypto, she shares her experience with the other two, who also follow suit. A trailer for the series appears to show that the three women’s investment experience yields decidedly mixed results. “This is a story that will resonate very well with female office workers,” Oh said. 조아람-이선빈-라미란 '달까지 가자'[엑's HD포토] #달까지가자 #ToTheMoon #이선빈 #LeeSunbin #라미란 #RaMiran #조아람 #JOARAM https://t.co/nqcoCjgfvO — 엑스포츠뉴스 (@xportsnews) September 16, 2025 South Korean Scriptwriters’ Crypto Inspiration Crypto has proved a rich source of subject matter for South Korean drama producers and movie script writers in recent years. This appears to reflect the continuing rise of retail crypto investment in the country, as the domestic stock market remains stagnant and real estate prices remain prohibitively high. South Korean companies are still unable to buy crypto with their balance sheets. And this means that the country’s vibrant crypto scene remains purely retail-based.

(Source: CoinGecko) Earlier this year, the film Crypto Man, starring the late Song Jae-rim , proved a box office smash in South Korea. The movie, based loosely on the story of the Terra-LUNA/LUNC crash, told the tale of a man who exploited loopholes in government grant programs to fund his cryptocurrency project.

While there are several factors from analysts why the price prediction is changing, the rise of new competition is showing more strength. This is because a new pre-launch token has taken center stage lately as a threat to the XRP price prediction, with outlook seeing top analysts calling the new altcoin “XRP 2.0.” However, here is a quick look at why the XRP price prediction could keep changing in the coming weeks as the pre-launch token makes new progress. Analysis Of XRP Price Prediction In The Face Of Rising Competition Checking through the current XRP price predictions, these last few days show a decline in analysts’ sentiment. This is with the price projection seeing a downturn following rising competition in the payment and remittance sector of the crypto market. Furthermore, while the Ripple project has made landmark progress in cross-border partnerships for payment and remittance, the price remains on a slow climb. The price analysis with data from the last few days might give better insight into why the XRP price prediction is getting dull lately. According to the technical analysis of the price, there has been a struggle for the coin to beat the $3.08 resistance since mid-August. As this zone continues to pose a threat to a significant breakout, analysts are divided about what will be the main story this year for XRP. The XRP price prediction now stands between the coin breaking the $3.08 this year and making a new high. Remittix Launches First Live Product In Its Ecosystem The story around the Remittix project as an XRP competitor just got even more interesting today as it launches its first live product. This is with the launch of its much-anticipated wallet for beta testing, giving users a first-hand feel of the finished product. According to the projection from top analysts, this could see the Remittix coin gain another 5x from its current $0.1 as accumulation spikes. Following the project’s comparison to the Ripple coin, here are some features making Remittix the talk of the town right now: It has a low cap, which could fuel an instant doubling effect and upward move. The Remittix solution is introducing a new approach that could change cross-border payment with its over 30 fiat currencies payment to bank accounts using crypto assets New solution to crypto to fiat conversion with a faster, cheaper and easier transaction Furthermore, the introduction of the referral program is another eye-catching approach for users to earn more with Remittix.

The new fund is designed to provide business people with an alternative way to invest in two of the fastest-growing areas of crypto markets, stablecoins and tokenized assets, via a single product. If approved, it would be the first-ever US ETF focused on these themes, providing exposure through a dual-structured product that includes traditional equity investments alongside crypto-linked assets. The move reflects Bitwise’s desire to remain at the cutting edge of crypto investment innovation and leverage recent regulatory clarity and growing market demand for stablecoin- and tokenization-centric products. Bitwise builds a dual exposure model The fund is split evenly into two, one equities and the other crypto assets, according to a filing. The equity sleeve will zero in on businesses that have a direct play around stablecoins and tokenization. These include stablecoin creators, blockchain infrastructure companies, payment processors, exchanges, and even merchants that dabble with digital currencies. Bitwise has also established exposure limits to help control concentration risks. Tier 1 companies identified as having higher exposure could make up to 15% of the fund, Tier 2 companies 8%, and Tier 3 companies up to 3%. Bitwise anticipates selecting about 20 companies for the portfolio across Tier 1 and Tier 2, with as many as up to an additional 10 from Tier 3. The crypto asset sleeve will monitor exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to blockchain infrastructure and tokenization. To be eligible, the asset should make up at least 1% of the entire stablecoin or tokenization market. About 5% of the sleeve will be devoted to oracle tokens, cryptocurrencies that pull in data about the world from outside the blockchain to make smart contracts work. To prevent undue risk, the fund’s single largest crypto holding would be capped at 22.5%. The ETF is also scheduled to be rebalanced each quarter based on market movement. Bitwise’s decision to file the fund under the Investment Company Act could mean a less onerous SEC review path than what would be required for other fund structures. Analysts say this improves the chances of approval of the ETF. Regulation shapes market dynamics and launch timeline The filing is submitted at a time when the US is increasingly embracing stablecoins and tokenization. The draft bill to regulate stablecoins reduces the uncertainty and increases investor confidence that the GENIUS Act, passed in July, created. Meanwhile, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), including bonds and credit instruments, minted on blockchains have exploded in 2025, according to data from Chainalysis, reaching nearly $76 billion. Even stablecoins have experienced a surge. The stablecoin supply went from roughly $205 billion to $268 billion between January and August, a 23% increase. The market has since hit higher highs, and this week surged to nearly $290 billion, according to DefiLlama. These trends have contributed to institutional and retail demand for products with diversified exposure to stablecoins and tokenization. Bitwise already oversees more than $15 billion in its lineup of crypto funds and ETFs. The firm has stated that it sees itself as a leader in plans for crypto investment products, and this latest filing is part of its approach to combining traditional financial mechanisms with new blockchain offerings. Although Bitwise hasn’t revealed management fees for the proposed fund, analysts anticipate they’ll be competitive with so many rival products to choose from. There are already competitors, like Nicholas Wealth’s Crypto Income ETF (BLOX), that use equities for their crypto exposure. Still, Bitwise’s unusual two-sleeve structure could make it stand out in the market. Industry observers have said the SEC may rule on the filing this October or November. If approved, the fund is likely to come to market near Thanksgiving 2025, according to Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst with Bloomberg. That would place Bitwise ahead of competitors scrambling to roll out new products in a regulatory landscape that has evolved rapidly in digital assets’ favor since the start of the year.

Recently, a significant development emerged from South Korea that has caught the attention of investors globally. Parataxis Korea, a dedicated treasury platform for institutional investors, has made its historic first Bitcoin purchase of 50 BTC. This isn’t just another transaction; it marks a pivotal moment, showcasing the company’s commitment to providing robust, institutional-grade solutions for digital asset management. Why is Parataxis Korea’s Bitcoin Purchase a Game Changer? On August 7th, Parataxis Korea officially completed its initial acquisition of 50 BTC. This strategic move highlights a growing trend: traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring digital assets as part of their treasury management. For many institutional players, entering the crypto market can be complex due to concerns around security, compliance, and execution. Parataxis Korea aims to bridge this gap. Their decision to make a substantial Bitcoin purchase demonstrates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its potential as a legitimate treasury asset. It’s a clear signal that the demand for professional-grade crypto services is not just theoretical; it’s becoming a tangible reality for serious investors. Unveiling an Institutional-Grade BTC Treasury Platform: What Does It Offer? Beyond the actual Bitcoin purchase , Parataxis Korea announced a crucial achievement: the successful development of an institutional-grade BTC treasury platform. This platform is designed from the ground up to meet the stringent requirements of large-scale investors. What makes this platform stand out? It boasts: Proven Execution Capabilities: Ensuring large transactions are processed smoothly and efficiently. Robust Security Protocols: Protecting digital assets with advanced cryptographic measures and secure storage solutions. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to South Korean financial regulations, offering peace of mind to institutional clients. Dedicated Support: Providing specialized services tailored to the unique needs of corporate treasuries. This infrastructure is vital. It allows institutions to manage their digital assets with the same level of professionalism and security they expect from traditional financial markets. The development underscores a methodical approach to crypto adoption, focusing on reliability and trust. What’s the Broader Impact of Parataxis Korea’s Bitcoin Purchase? The ripple effects of Parataxis Korea’s Bitcoin purchase are likely to extend beyond the company itself. This move could inspire other institutional investors in South Korea and across Asia to seriously consider integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios. As more credible platforms emerge, the perceived risk of engaging with cryptocurrencies diminishes for established financial entities. However, challenges remain. Regulatory landscapes are still evolving, and market volatility is an inherent characteristic of digital assets. Despite these factors, the benefits are compelling: Increased Legitimacy: Institutional involvement helps solidify Bitcoin’s status as a serious asset class. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater participation from large players can lead to deeper and more stable markets. Innovation in Finance: Pushing the boundaries of traditional treasury management and investment strategies. This development marks a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of digital currencies, particularly for those managing substantial capital. In conclusion, Parataxis Korea’s inaugural Bitcoin purchase and the launch of its institutional-grade treasury platform represent a landmark achievement in the cryptocurrency space. It not only demonstrates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s potential but also provides the necessary infrastructure for other institutional investors to confidently enter the market. This strategic move is poised to accelerate the institutional adoption of digital assets, shaping the future of finance in South Korea and beyond. Keep an eye on how this pioneering step influences the broader crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Parataxis Korea?

New players earn a 200% match-up bonus of up to 10 ETH, 50 free spins, and a $5 sports bet. On the downside, the bonus has to be wagered 35 times to be withdrawable. TG casino also offers its gambling services on the social messaging platform Telegram. It is also unique because of its native token $TGC. Players receive 25% back on all net losses of bets made in $TGC. In addition, $TGC holders earn a percentage of platform profits, i.e., 60% of all profits are distributed to $TGC holders who have staked over 5,000 tokens. The profit is paid in ETH. Other promotions include a $7,000 weekend tournament, a highest odds tournament, and 40% extra for combo bets on sports.

Other than cryptocurrencies, TG casino also allows players to make payments in fiat using a crypto on-ramp feature that supports VISA and MasterCard.

However, this claim has a caveat: new accounts must meet a minimum wagering threshold of $69 to unlock withdrawals. This requirement also helps prevent money mixing, which is illegal. The sign-up process is straightforward. You can sign up with an email address and password or with the Telegram sign-in option. It’s hassle-free, and you can get your account up and running in minutes. The casino operated under a Curacao eGaming license. Initially launched as a single game platform, ToshiBet has quickly evolved and now hosts a variety of casino games, slots, and sports betting, with over 150,000 registered players.

CoinPoker: Our highest ranking choice for strategy plus chance games CoinPoker homepage CoinPoker is the go-to no-KYC casino for poker enthusiasts. At any given time, there are over 2,000 online players in the casino. Founded in 2017, the casino traces its roots to a community of poker lovers and crypto natives. Poker is a family of card games that combines elements of chance and skill, rewarding the best hand depending on the rules of the specific game. While it’s a poker favorite, the CoinPokercasino is also packed with other games. You can play slots, from classic three-reelers to video slots with bonus features and progressive jackpots. Others include fun crash games, table games, and sports betting—all no KYC. CoinPoker runs some of the most exciting promotions in the space. For one, they have a leaderboard that runs every four hours, with a $10,000 daily prize pool. While other casinos with similar promotions reset the leaderboard every 24 hours, CoinPoker’s is reset 6 times daily, giving you more winning chances. Concurrently, another leaderboard runs every week with a $5,000 prize pool. Away from the leaderboards, new players can claim a 150% deposit bonus of up to $2000 to stack up a bankroll. To qualify for the bonus, you must deposit at least $10. The other bonus includes a 33% weekly rakeback paid every Monday. One factor that stood out at CoinPoker was that the casino had a Proof of Reserves, a feature common in centralized exchanges. A Proof of Reserves means that the casino publicly displays the amount of funds in the spirit of transparency, which is essential in winning customer trust. The funds are stored in Fireblocks’ multi-authentication vaults, ensuring maximum protection. They also have a decentralized random number generator (RNG) that you can use to view the impact on the card shuffling. Supported cryptocurrencies USDT, CHP, BTC, POL, ETH, USDC, SOL No KYC limits None Other payment methods VISA, MasterCard, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Pix License Anjouan Internet Gaming license Operational since 2017 Support options Email Available games Poker, slots, live casino, sports Pros and cons Pros: Transparent, verifiable gameplay. Backed up by a dedicated team of poker enthusiasts. Completely KYC-free, no limits. Cons: The casino is only available as a downloadable application; you cannot play on your browser. High wagering requirements on bonuses. Degen Coin Flip: Top decentralized casino on Solana Playing Crash at Degen Coin Flip As the name suggests, Degen Coin Flip is a high-risk, high-reward anonymous online gambling casino for crypto degens. The casino is decentralized, meaning it runs on smart contracts. The smart contracts execute on predetermined conditions, and since they are coded on the Solana blockchain, they cannot be corrupted. The core mechanics of the game can be studied on the blockchain. The casino only accepts SOL, so you will need a Solana wallet: Phantom, Torus, Ledger, or Solflare. Once connected, you can now take your chances without making a deposit. The most popular game on Degen Coin Flip is Coi Flip. The game is provably fair, and you can double your SOL balance or lose it with a coin flip. Bets placed, wins, and losses are displayed publicly. My favorite, however, is the Crash game. Here, you place bets on how high you think a ‘token’ will go on the charts before crashing. During my time there, I consistently watched payouts go above 2X. A downside is that the casino, while fun, is not beginner-friendly. To play, you need prior knowledge of cryptocurrency wallets and transactions. With the knowledge, it is advisable to join their Discord group to stay updated on the latest updates and betting tips. The casino charges a 3.5% fee on every bet. Everything else is straightforward: no hidden charges, bonuses, or wagering requirements exist. However, the casino regularly runs challenges on its social media channels, X and Discord. Supported cryptocurrencies SOL No KYC limits No limits Other payment methods None License None Operational since 2021 Support options Discord Available games Coin flip, mini games including crash and coin dozer Pros and cons Pros: Decentralized and highly anonymous Transparent betting. Vibrant Discord community. Cons: Steep learning curve No bonuses Cryptorino: Top-ranking new casino Cryptorino lobby Cryptorino is a relatively new entrant in the crypto casino space, but continues to steal market share for its extensive game library and competitive bonuses. The sign-up process is simple; you only need an email address and a strong password, after which you are ready to go. Aside from this, the casino is available in over 10 languages, including French, German, and Spanish, catering to a global audience. Cryprorino is also a perfect choice for players looking for privacy and convenience. The casino sets the bar higher by being VPN friendly, meaning you can use a VPN service to mask your location when accessing the casino. The casino allows lightning-fast withdrawals for all payment methods. Deposits are also instant and are free. However, all deposits must be wagered at least 5 times to be withdrawable. This is aimed at preventing the use of the platform for mixing money. The only charge is blockchain fees, paid to miners who confirm crypto transactions. Being a crypto-friendly instant casino only increases its appeal for privacy-focused players. You can choose from many popular options, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether, as well as meme coins like SHIB and DOGE. For your first deposit of at least €10, Cryptorino rewards you up to 1 BTC or its equivalent in other currencies. While the bonus might be high, the casino requires you to meet its wagering requirements within the first 7 days to receive the bonus. Every Thursday, players can claim a free bet and 10% cash back on losses made every Monday, adding to the thrill of remaining loyal to the casino. Every week, Cryptorino runs a $10,000 tournament distributed to the top 50 players on the leaderboard. The scoring system includes points awarded based on your total win per bet minus your stake. You can also participate in the $7,000 pool tournament on selected games over the weekend. Other regular offers like odds boosts and prize drops keep the excitement going. The platform offers various options to casino game enthusiasts, from slots to instant wins and provably fair titles. You can find great game show options among the extensive suite of games, such as Pragmatic Play’s Snakes and Ladders and Dice City. You can also play Mini Roulette, which provides a minimalistic playing experience. There’s a fantastic choice of Mines, Crash, Plinko, and Hi-Lo titles and arcade-style releases such as Save the Princess. If you want a more premium experience, Cryptorino offers exclusive high-roller and private tables, such as Playboy Blackjack and Baccarat High Roller. I managed to play some excellent RNG table games and popular slot machines. Cryptorino’s VIP program is especially advantageous, particularly for loyal players. The VIP program is set in levels determined by the total amount of wagers you place; the higher your level, the better the perks. At the highest level, players become eligible for a personalized casino experience, which includes cashbacks, surprise spins, an account manager, and higher withdrawal limits.

Casinopunkz: Provably fair VPN friendly casino Casinopunkz bonuses Casinopunkz is a relatively new crypto casino offering a broad selection of games from top-tier providers like Playson, Slotmil, BGaming, and Hacksaw Gaming. The casino stands out for its punk-style theme characterized by pixelated images and wording, similar to the popular CryptoPunks NFT collection, adding a distinctive flair. Casinopunkz ensures user privacy by recommending VPN platforms, a feature I have not seen on any other casino. A VPN encrypts your internet connection and masks your real IP address. This means you can access the casino anywhere worldwide while staying protected from online threats and ISP monitoring. Their top VPN recommendations include NordVPN, Proton, and Express VPN. Casinopunkz welcomes new players with a 100% matchup bonus, meaning they double your initial deposit in bonuses. Other promotions include loot box drops, up to 15% cashback, and daily multiplier challenges with big prizes. The casino’s lobby features diverse categories such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and game shows. From the main page, you can switch between casino and live casino games, making it easy for users to locate their favorite games. The casino also features a search function and a section of new releases to keep the excitement alive for all gaming enthusiasts. If you’re more into strategic gameplay, you can explore hundreds of exciting RNG table games, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat, powered by top providers like Pragmatic Play and Evolution Gaming. The live dealer selection doesn’t hold back as well. The ‘Challenges’ section is particularly enticing, showcasing prizes on select games when you achieve the set milestones. For instance, you win €500 when you get 5,000x on the game Zeus by Hacksaw Gaming. When you hit 5,000x on Shaolin Panda by Octoplay with a minimum €10 bet, you win €2,000. I could count over 15 similar challenges running in parallel in the section. The Bonus Buy option, available within games from providers like Hacksaw Gaming, Pragmatic Play, and Playson, allows players to fast-track their way to bonus rounds and enhance their winning potential. Casinopunkz ensures fair play with its Provably Fair feature, giving players confidence in every spin and bet. Casinopunkz’s offers fair play, niche-themed games, and exclusive content.

Cons: Limited registration option Does not offer sports betting. What is a No KYC casino, and how does it work? A no KYC casino is a casino that does not require you to verify your identity to play on the platform. KYC stands for Know Your Customer or, in some settings, Know Your Client. No KYC casinos offer more privacy and anonymity, which helps prevent data breaches and identity theft. No KYC also means more inclusivity and faster account creation. However, it is important to note that non-KYC casinos can request identity verification if their systems flag your account for fraudulent or unusual activity, such as large withdrawal requests. Casinos with KYC requirements ask users to submit identity verification documents, which include a copy of a national identity card or a driving license, and, to some extent, utility bills as proof of residence. Casinos request KYC as a risk assessment measure to prevent fraudulent activity and to comply with local rules and regulations. Pros and Cons of using a no KYC casino Pros: Quick account set up The process of KYC verification can be lengthy and tiresome. The process involves uploading your identity documents and/ or utility bills to confirm your proof of address. You might also be required to upload a selfie holding your identity document. After submission, there is a turnaround time where you have to wait for your details to be verified. The waiting time can be costly, as you might miss the entry point for betting opportunities. Some casinos request KYC when you request a withdrawal, which is inconvenient, especially if you don’t have the documents. At no KYC casinos, you can create an account smoothly within minutes. Anonymity and privacy The casinos do not collect your information, meaning you can play freely without the fear of raising eyebrows from peers or regulatory authorities. Your wins and losses remain private. This is especially convenient for high-roller players who make big bets and regularly have big wins and losses. Accessibility and global reach Like the blockchain, which democratizes access to financial products, non-KYC casinos play a similar role to their KYC counterparts. The fact that you do not have to disclose your location means that anyone globally can sign up for an account without getting flagged. Some casinos go a step further and recommend VPN services that mask your location and IP address. Enhanced bonuses and promotions No-verification online casinos also tend to offer generous bonuses, promotions, and challenges. This is because they have lower operational costs as they don’t conduct KYC checks. The extra funds allow the casinos to splurge money on providing their clients with a more rewarding playing experience. Some casinos offer bonuses of up to 1BTC, while others do not require wagering requirements on bonuses. Reduced risk of data breaches There is always a risk associated with sharing personal and financial details over the Internet. Cases of impersonation and identity theft are rampant, especially with the growth of technology. No verification casinos safeguard their clients as they do not collect personal information, which is also known as anonymous gambling. The casinos assure players of data safety, winning their trust and confidence. Flexibility and freedom The fact that no verification betting sites do not require your verification documents means you get to have more flexibility and freedom. As an account holder, you are not limited to regional restrictions that may limit the amount of funds you transact. The casinos generally offer faster deposits and withdrawals than their KYC counterparts, as no extra checks are required. This gives you better control over your gaming experience. Crypto friendly All anonymous casinos are crypto-friendly. This is because cryptocurrencies share the same ethos of user privacy and anonymity. While crypto transactions can be monitored on the blockchain, they cannot be linked to an individual unless they are publicly declared. Players on the sites, therefore, enjoy better crypto support and faster transactions. Cons: Lack of regulatory oversight No-KYC casinos often operate in a grey area in terms of regulations. The state of crypto regulations across countries also differs, with some outright banning them. This conundrum becomes a challenge since anonymous casinos are known to operate globally with no restrictions on users who can play. For Compliance challenges Since casinos operate in a grey area, they can cause trouble for users who do not comply with local laws. Per their terms, customers must confirm whether the casino’s services are allowed in their jurisdictions. It can also be difficult for users to report taxes from non-KYC casinos. Potential customer support limitations Because these sites operate internationally, gamblers from all over the world are accessing them. That means when a player is wagering, the customer support team may not have assistance due to a language barrier or may not be available to assist due to time differences. Platform misuse Bad actors can mask illegal activity by taking advantage of the anonymity of no-verification casinos. Known bad actors can also use the system for money laundering without raising flags. A KYC check can help identify such threats quickly. Key factors to look for while choosing a no KYC crypto casino Licensing and regulation Anonymous crypto casinos require users to confirm the legality of accessing their services in their jurisdictions. Before engaging with a no KYC casino, checking with your regulator for compliance is important. This is because it is easier to receive assistance from local authorities if you have an issue with the casino. Compliant casinos also tend to be fairer and transparent, as it is a requirement to get licensed. Game selection There are hundreds of online game providers in the casino space. Check that the casino supports your favorite games and their variations, as there are thousands of games to choose from. Also, check whether the casino supports local leagues to avoid getting side-stepped on those fun football weekends. Customer support Before signing up, make a gesture to contact customer service through live chat and see how long it takes them to respond. Fast response times mean a chance to edit bets where you placed an extra zero or an opportunity to follow up on a withdrawal request that is taking too long to clear. Security measures Opt for casinos that offer two-factor authentication features, as they provide extra protection for your account. Some casinos go a step further and publish their proof of reserves as evidence that customer deposits are safely stored in their vaults. Check for features like SSL encryption, third-party accounts, and security audits. Payment methods Check with customer care if they support your payment method. Some gambling sites support fiat payment options like Revolut, Apple Pay, MasterCard, and VISA. For crypto, check whether your token, including the blockchain, is supported. Remember that when you deposit the wrong chain, you risk losing your funds. Also, confirm the casino’s withdrawal methods and limits. Reputation and reviews Reviews from third-party platforms like TrustPilot offer you a front-row seat to issues encountered by real customers. Check for low-rated reviews and follow up if the customer issues were resolved. Repeated negative reviews on the same issue are a red flag. Withdrawal limits and speed Some non-KYC casinos may flag your account if you request a huge withdrawal. Others have a limit on how much money you can withdraw. Check with support about their limits to confirm whether they align with your goals. High roller players may opt for casinos with high or no deposit and withdrawal limits. Low limits could also mean that you can’t withdraw your jackpot wins. Bonuses and promotions Bonuses and promotions are meant to reward player loyalty and keep you returning. Check for generous bonuses and perks like a percentage back on losses made. Some casinos offer rakebacks and cashbacks every other week. However, be wary of bonuses with high wagering requirements. While the requirements are implemented to prevent account misuse, they also prevent users from outrightly claiming their bonuses. Tips to stay anonymous while using a no-KYC crypto casino Fresh no-KYC linked wallets Crypto transactions are publicly displayed on the blockchain, meaning that with the right tools, it is possible to trace how funds move across known crypto wallets, e.g., exchanges, or public figures, to the casino. For this reason, it is advisable to use a new crypto wallet and address for online gambling. You should also regularly change your addresses to prevent leaving traces on the blockchain. Non-custodial wallets Some of the casinos allow users to sign in with their crypto wallets. In these instances, you do not deposit crypto to the casino; the casinos access your crypto in your wallet when you approve the transactions. Such wallets are known as non-custodial wallets. With such a wallet, the casino has limited access to your crypto balance and therefore cannot misuse it. Use VPN and proxy VPNs work by masking a client’s location and VIP address; this way, you can anonymously access the casino’s offerings. You can also access games that would otherwise be restricted in your jurisdiction by using a VPN. Choose a reputable no-KYC casino Check the casino’s reputation from third-party reviews and platforms like TrustPilot. You can also examine the reliability of its random number generators, which are crucial in ensuring fair play. Use privacy-focused crypto like Monero Use privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, Dash, Grin, and Zcash. These cryptocurrencies use special technology like zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, and stealth addresses that make them impossible to trace on the blockchain. Before signing up, check with the casino whether they support cryptocurrencies. Be mindful of transaction history Clear your transaction history on the casino. You can also request the casino for information they have stored about you. It can also help to regularly clear your cache and cookies, which leave traces of your activity on your devices. Also, as explained earlier, regularly switch to new wallet addresses to prevent getting traced. Be cautious of suspicious links or downloads Always be cautious of suspicious links and downloads. Phishing sites take advantage of a user’s ignorance to steal their personal information, which they can use to steal their identity, steal their funds, or perform illegal activity. Review the casino’s policy on anonymity and data policy Read the casino’s terms and conditions on anonymity and data policy. The terms will enlighten you on how they process user data and who they share their data with. Sometimes, the casino will request permission to share your data with third parties. Use a dedicated device for gambling A dedicated device will give you enhanced performance, a more immersive experience, and improved security. By using a separate device, you can prevent distractions and account breaches from other applications or services you access from the device. Also, in the case of an attack, you can contain the damage to the device. Stay updated on best practices With the advent of big data and artificial intelligence, technology is advancing rapidly. It is, therefore, important to keep yourself updated on best practices for staying anonymous while accessing crypto gambling sites through personal or peer-to-peer research. Conclusion No KYC casinos are rising in popularity for their benefits, which include better bonuses, promotions, and game offerings that rival their KYC counterparts and traditional casinos. As discussed, lower operational costs help the casinos provide their customers with a better playing experience. However, there are also significant disadvantages, such as operating without clear regulatory oversight. Our list has outlined ten of the best anonymous crypto and Bitcoin casinos, saving you the trouble. Note that these casinos still reserve the right to request KYC verification if they flag your account for suspicious activity. Check their requirements and local laws to ensure you don’t end up on the shorter end of the bargain. Also, explore responsible gambling tools, as gambling can be addictive.",Deep Dive - Crypto|Web3 & Market Insights,EN,0,0,SOL|USDT|BTC|ETH|DOGE|OTHER|ADA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-16 23:56:25

51846623,582141,1758067240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51846623.jpeg,"Bitcoin To Hit $750,000 By 2030 With ETH And SOL As Survivors, Says Pantera CEO",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-750000-by-2030-eth-sol-survive-pantera-ceo/,"Pantera Capital founder and CEO Dan Morehead told CNBC that Bitcoin could climb to $750,000 within four to five years, arguing the asset still represents only a “very low single-digit percentage of global wealth” and has historically “roughly doubled every year” across the firm’s 12 years in crypto. Morehead coupled the price call with a stark consolidation thesis: only a single-digit number of base-layer blockchains will endure—led by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Why Bitcoin, Ethereum And Solana Will Succeed Speaking on “ Squawk Box ,” Morehead framed Bitcoin’s upside as a function of its penetration into global portfolios rather than a speculative cycle. “I think it could go up to $750,000 in the next four or five years,” he said, reiterating that while a $1 million handle may be conceivable, it is a longer-dated prospect. The forecast extends a through-cycle view Pantera has pushed since launching what it describes as the first institutional bitcoin fund in 2013. The Pantera chief also dismissed “winner-take-all” narratives in smart-contract platforms, but he narrowed the field decisively. “There’s a single-digit number of layer ones… things like Bitcoin, Ethereum , Solana—not thousands, but definitely not one,” he said. In his view, these chains map to distinct use cases: “Bitcoin’s digital gold,” Ethereum anchors programmability, and Solana is “very good at the performance blockchain.” Morehead underscored Solana’s technical and market momentum to explain why it belongs alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in the long-run cohort. “Solana’s had better performance than even Bitcoin over the last four years,” he noted, adding that the network “could do 9 billion transactions a day,” a throughput he argued exceeds activity across traditional capital markets. While the exact comparative framing is debatable, the line reflects Pantera’s view that Solana’s execution capacity—combined with low fees—has crossed a threshold where “it’s not obvious you need a next thing” for high-speed on-chain finance. The interview doubled as a showcase for a new public-markets vehicle offering direct, unlevered exposure to SOL while capturing native staking yield for equity investors. Morehead cast the “digital asset treasury” structure as a bridge product in an era when large-cap crypto ETFs remain unevenly available. “Right now there’s no [spot US] ETF [for Solana]. It’s very difficult to get… For people with a brokerage account, this is the easiest way to get access,” he said, describing staking as “cumbersome” for typical retail users and positioning the listed vehicle to automate validator selection and reward capture. Pantera’s push fits a broader 2025 pattern: public companies raising capital to hold programmatic positions in major cryptoassets—often with staking overlays—and then listing on Nasdaq as equity proxies for tokens without spot ETFs. Just hours before Morehead’s appearance, Helius Medical Technologies announced an oversubscribed $500 million financing led by Pantera and Summer Capital to launch a Solana-backed treasury strategy, with an additional $750 million in warrants that could lift the vehicle’s size to roughly $1.25 billion. Helius said it would explore staking and conservative on-chain yield opportunities around its SOL reserves. Asked to arbitrate Ethereum versus Solana, Morehead avoided a binary call, returning to the same consolidation arc: multiple large-cap winners, but far fewer than the thousands of L1s launched over the last cycle. The market’s job now, he implied, is to price durable differentiation: Bitcoin as pristine collateral and macro hedge; Ethereum as the generalized settlement and execution layer for tokenized assets and DeFi; Solana as a high-throughput venue for consumer-scale and market-microstructure-intensive applications. “There would be lots of blockchains that are important,” he said, “but definitely not one.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $115,319.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin price prediction|btc|btc price|crypto|crypto news|Dan Morehead|ETH|Ethereum|SOL|solana,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 00:00:40

ETH Set Eyes On 77% Breakout Run,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-eyes-on-77-breakout/,"Ethereum has shown signs of strength after completing a healthy pullback. Having met and retested its $4,811 target, ETH is now holding firm, suggesting the correction phase may be over. If buyers regain control, the path could open for a powerful rally in the near term. Ethereum Pulls Back, But Bullish Signals Confirm Strength Javon Marks, in his most recent update, emphasized that ETH reached the $4,811.71 target before entering a pullback phase. Despite the temporary dip, bullish signals have re-emerged, indicating that ETH has regained strength and could soon retest this important level. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Looks Tired – Could Upside Momentum Fade Soon? He noted that surpassing the $4,811.71 zone would mark a decisive step forward for Ethereum. A confirmed breakout above this level could act as a catalyst, unlocking fresh buying pressure and signaling a continuation of the broader bullish trend. According to MARKS analysis, the bigger picture remains highly promising, as a sustained rally above this target could drive ETH toward $8,557.68, an impressive +77% move. Such a development would not only reinforce Ethereum’s dominance in the market but also underscore its ability to outperform as investor sentiment strengthens. Trendline Support Holds Firm, Strengthening Bullish Case According to Crypto King in a recent post, ETH looks to be preparing for its next decisive move in the market. After a period of consolidation, the price action has continued to show resilience, refusing to break down despite fluctuations across the broader crypto space. This behavior highlights the underlying strength of ETH and suggests that buyers are quietly accumulating while defending critical levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces September Profit-Taking Risks Despite $638M ETF Boost The analyst emphasized that ETH is firmly holding its ascending trendline, which has served as a strong backbone of support during recent pullbacks. Each time the price has tested this line, it has attracted renewed momentum, underscoring the importance of the trendline as a technical foundation. Now that the latest retest appears to be complete, Ethereum seems to be shifting toward another potential upside move. The structure of higher lows remains intact, showing that momentum is gradually building and buyers are preparing for a possible breakout attempt. If this bullish pressure continues, ETH could soon reclaim higher levels and aim for fresh targets in the coming sessions. Crypto King further noted that for traders or investors looking to position themselves for the next rally, this could be the ideal time to act. Should Ethereum follow through with a strong rally, the current price zone might be remembered as a key accumulation point ahead of its next major advance.

On Tuesday, Jim told investors on CNBC that he sees the bank as the first non-tech company to cross the $1 trillion market cap line. Right now, JPMorgan’s value is around $850 billion, but Jim thinks that’s just the beginning. He said, “JPMorgan’s got something special. It excels at so many things: lending, capital markets, trading, and perhaps most important, statesmanship, with CEO Jamie Dimon performing at a level that’s rare for any industry.” Jim added that: “JP Morgan has always been a top-quality bank, but it’s now become a fantastic place to work, and its global reach is unmatched. There’s a reason its market cap is so much bigger than the other major banks.” Banks push into trillion-dollar territory as sector rallies Jim made it clear this kind of growth isn’t easy. Only Berkshire Hathaway has made it to $1 trillion outside of tech, and it’s sitting just above that line at $1.05 trillion. Meanwhile, tech is bloated with trillion-dollar beasts. Nvidia is at $4.25 trillion, Microsoft at $3.78 trillion, Apple at $3.35 trillion, Alphabet at $3.04 trillion, Amazon at $2.50 trillion, Meta at $1.96 trillion, Broadcom at $1.70 trillion, and Tesla at $1.36 trillion. The bank isn’t just catching up in value, it’s pushing forward in performance too. JPMorgan just hit a new 52-week high on Tuesday and ended the day slightly up, rising 0.09%. So far this year, the stock has jumped 28.99%. That’s a hell of a move for a sector that’s usually ignored when tech is popping. Jim used a metaphor that works: JPMorgan is like “a horse that’s bided its time but is now at the far turn.” He sees the bank entering a new stretch of momentum, with the rest of the financial sector tagging along. He pointed out that Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are all making big moves too. But JPMorgan is the one leading. What’s driving this? Jim said the “real rocket fuel” is multiple expansion. In simple terms, Wall Street is starting to pay more for each dollar of bank earnings, and that’s not normal in this space. For years, banks have traded cheap. Now, those price-to-earnings ratios are finally climbing. “I’ve been waiting years for the banks to get higher price-to-earnings multiples,” he said . “They’re incredibly important to the broader market. When the banks are winning, it’s a terrific sign for the overall trading.” Jim added that this growth isn’t fragile. Even if the Fed shakes the market, this kind of shift doesn’t snap back easily. “Remember this tomorrow if the averages take a hit from the Fed, because once multiple expansion starts, it’s not easily reversed — we might be ok. These are hard-fought moves and I bet they’re just the beginning.” That’s the key point. Jim thinks JPMorgan’s valuation will keep climbing because earnings are growing, and investors are finally willing to pay more for it. If that trend holds, it means the stock doesn’t have to explode overnight. It just needs to keep moving up steadily. And compared to its peers, JPMorgan is already way ahead. Most other banks are still stuck under $300 billion in value. That gap shows up in investor confidence, deal flow, and stock performance. Jim sees this as validation, not hype.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to cut through the noise, offering a clear snapshot of prevailing market sentiment. Recently, this crucial indicator edged up to 53, holding steady in neutral territory. This reading, provided by cryptocurrency data provider Alternative, suggests a balanced market, where neither extreme fear nor overwhelming optimism dominates. Understanding what this index signifies can be a game-changer for your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a barometer for the cryptocurrency market. It quantifies the emotional state of investors, ranging from “Extreme Fear” (0) to “Extreme Greed” (100). When the index shows extreme fear, it often indicates that investors are too worried, potentially creating buying opportunities. Conversely, extreme greed might suggest the market is due for a correction, as prices could be unsustainably high. This index helps you identify when market participants are acting irrationally. It encourages a disciplined approach, urging you to “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The methodology behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is robust, incorporating several key factors to provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. Here’s a breakdown of its components: Volatility (25%): This measures current Bitcoin volatility and maximum drawdowns, comparing them with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals fear. Market Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a positive market can indicate strong bullish sentiment, while low volumes might suggest uncertainty. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes Bitcoin-related hashtags and mentions on social media, assessing the speed and quantity of interactions. A surge in mentions, especially with positive sentiment, can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Although paused currently, past surveys contributed to gauging investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often suggests fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. A decreasing dominance can signal greed, as money flows into riskier altcoins. Google Search Volume (10%): Analyzing search trends for Bitcoin-related terms provides insight into public interest. A sudden spike in search queries for “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin crash” indicates fear, while searches for “how to buy Bitcoin” might indicate growing interest or greed. What Does a Neutral 53 Reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Imply? A reading of 53, squarely in the “neutral” zone, suggests a balanced market sentiment. It means there isn’t an overwhelming consensus towards either fear or greed. Investors are neither panicking nor exhibiting excessive euphoria. This neutral stance can be interpreted in several ways: Uncertainty: The market might be awaiting a significant catalyst, or there could be conflicting signals pulling sentiment in different directions. Consolidation: Prices might be consolidating, forming a base before a potential move in either direction. Opportunity for Careful Analysis: A neutral reading encourages traders and investors to look beyond raw sentiment and delve deeper into fundamental and technical analysis. It’s a time for careful consideration, not impulsive decisions. Rather than reacting emotionally, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index score prompts a more strategic approach. How Can You Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Better Decisions? The primary benefit of monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is its ability to help you detach from emotional trading. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: When the index shows extreme fear, consider it a potential buying opportunity. When it signals extreme greed, it might be a good time to take profits or reduce exposure. Risk Management: Use the index as an additional data point for your risk assessment. High greed might warrant tighter stop-losses or smaller position sizes. Confirmation Tool: Combine the index with other technical indicators and fundamental analysis. If your analysis suggests a bullish trend but the index shows extreme fear, it could be a strong buy signal. Avoid FOMO and FUD: The index acts as a reminder not to succumb to the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) during greedy phases or Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) during fearful periods. Always remember, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive prediction tool. It works best when integrated into a broader investment framework. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently at a neutral 53, offers invaluable insight into the collective psychology of the cryptocurrency market. By understanding its components and implications, investors can make more informed, less emotional decisions. It’s a powerful reminder that while markets are driven by data, they are often swayed by human emotion. Use this index to stay grounded and navigate the volatile world of crypto with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Q1: What does a high score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A1: A high score (e.g., above 75) indicates “Extreme Greed.” This suggests that the market is overbought, and a price correction might be imminent as investors become overly optimistic. Q2: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only for Bitcoin? A2: While Bitcoin’s data heavily influences the index (especially dominance and search volume), the index reflects overall market sentiment, which generally applies to the broader cryptocurrency market. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A3: The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment. Q4: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as my sole trading indicator? A4: No, it is not recommended to use it as a sole indicator. The index is a sentiment tool and should be combined with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and sound risk management strategies for effective trading and investing. Q5: What factors cause the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to change? A5: Changes in Bitcoin’s volatility, trading volume, social media activity, Bitcoin dominance, and Google search trends for crypto-related terms all contribute to shifts in the index’s score.

51848160,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=810553,1758068897,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51848160.jpeg,Asia’s stock rally faces tariff shock as Trump levies bite into earnings,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/asias-stock-rally-tariff-shock-earnings/,"Asia’s stock markets are starting to feel the heat as Donald Trump’s tariff hikes begin cutting into corporate profits. Fund giants including T. Rowe Price and Franklin Templeton are warning that companies across the region, especially in South Korea and Taiwan, are more exposed than investors think. Export-heavy industries have enjoyed months of gains, but now the numbers aren’t adding up. And the White House isn’t backing down. According to Bloomberg, the warning signs are coming from all sides. Clarence Li, a senior portfolio analyst at T. Rowe Price in Hong Kong, said, “Current earnings and margins for exporters have not yet fully reflected the impact of the recent tariff agreements.” Clarence confirmed that they’ve already reduced their Asia and emerging market positions tied to exports. They’re not waiting around to see the damage unfold. Exporters face hit as profits fall short The rally has been huge. The MSCI Asia index has jumped more than 20% this year, way ahead of the 12% gain on the S&P 500. Investors rushed in, driven by cheap money, a weaker dollar, and the AI hype machine. That pushed the regional benchmark above its previous record from 2021. But now the policy change from Washington is cutting through the noise. Trump’s tariffs, announced in April, are targeting the region’s top exporters. The list is brutal: 34% tariffs on Chinese goods, 50% on India, 19% on Indonesia, and 15% on Japan. These aren’t symbolic. They’re aimed directly at countries with massive trade surpluses with the U.S., and almost all of them are in Asia. William Bratton, head of Asia Pacific cash equity research at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong, said the current earnings forecasts are “too optimistic.” He warned that markets still haven’t priced in the tariff risk properly. “We see continued risk of Asia’s export earnings materializing below current forecasts,” William said. He’s especially cautious about sub-sectors in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, all tightly tied to exports. It gets worse. Last year, over $1.3 trillion worth of goods flowed out of Asia to the U.S. China shipped $438.9 billion, Vietnam $136.6 billion, and South Korea $131.5 billion. Those numbers explain why analysts think the damage hasn’t shown up in full yet. The initial impact might be delayed, but it’s coming. Tech sector vulnerable as semiconductors targeted The problem goes beyond the visible tariffs. Christy Tan, an investment strategist at Franklin Templeton in Singapore, said supply chain disruptions and shrinking margins won’t show up right away. “Investors are expected to stay cautious over export-oriented companies and those exposed to tech sectors, as margin compression could be increasingly evident in months to come,” Christy said . There’s also concern about the semiconductor industry. It’s been one of Asia’s top-performing sectors this year. But that strength is exactly why it’s now in the firing line. Jerry Goh, investment director for Asian equities at Aberdeen Investments in Singapore, said, “There are concerns over potential tariffs on the semiconductor sector, which could weigh on Asia, given that it’s the center of the global semiconductor supply chain.” Jerry said Taiwan and Korea would face the biggest earnings pressure due to how much they rely on chips. Some regional data still looks okay on the surface. Manufacturing numbers in Thailand and Vietnam have been strong. Thai shipments grew by double digits in July. South Korean exports didn’t drop in August. But several managers say that’s just front-loading, companies rushing to export before the tariffs land. There’s still a chance that rate cuts by the Fed and other central banks could soften the hit. But that’s not guaranteed to offset the blow. The rally was built on liquidity and hype. Now it’s getting tested by policy. And the numbers aren’t lying. Everything points to one thing: Asia is vulnerable. The exposure to U.S. demand, the over-reliance on tech exports, and the delay in pricing in risks, it’s all catching up.

One moment, infrastructure projects are front and center; the next, retail momentum coins are dominating headlines. Over the past 48 hours, two stories have emerged: Chainlink (LINK) is showing technical strength that suggests a potential breakout, while Pi Coin (PI) is hovering dangerously close to historic lows. Both illustrate the contrast between projects building institutional confidence and those struggling to regain traction. But investors aren’t only focused on existing tokens. In the middle of this market reshuffling, a new presale has captured the imagination of retail and whale buyers alike. MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves with forecasts of 12,700% ROI , putting it in a class of its own for this cycle. If momentum holds, this presale may not just deliver profits, it could become one of the defining stories of the next bull run. Chainlink builds momentum for a breakout Chainlink has been quietly reasserting its role as a backbone of decentralized finance. According to analysis this week, LINK’s treasury reserves have grown 300% over the past month , underscoring the project’s reinvestment strength and financial discipline. This growth builds confidence that Chainlink can fund development even in choppier market waters. From a technical perspective, Chainlink has carved out a strong base of support. Analysts say this consolidation is laying the groundwork for a significant rally, with a push above resistance potentially opening the door to double-digit gains. Market chatter suggests that ETF discussions and rising institutional adoption of Chainlink’s oracle services are adding to the bullish setup. For investors looking for an established project with both adoption and technical potential, Chainlink offers one of the most compelling cases in the current market. Pi Coin struggles near historic lows On the other end of the spectrum sits Pi Coin. Once a hyped community-driven project, PI now trades around $0.345 , barely clinging to key support at $0.344. Analysts warn that a breakdown here could trigger a slide toward $0.322 , setting new all-time lows. The Pi Network has made progress, notably with the release of Version 23, which introduced decentralized KYC and touted 15 million verified users . Yet these milestones haven’t translated into meaningful price strength. Investor sentiment remains fragile, and without fresh capital inflows, Pi risks becoming another reminder that user numbers alone do not guarantee market traction. Pi Coin’s situation underscores a broader truth: crypto projects must balance community hype with tangible momentum and credible adoption. Without that balance, the downside risks remain acute. While Chainlink builds institutional credibility and Pi Coin faces existential price pressure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is writing a different story altogether. The presale has already attracted over $14 million , with allocations selling out at lightning speed as retail and whales compete for early access. Forecasts of 12,700% ROI reflect the scale of optimism building around this token. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its dual-threat positioning . On one side, it taps into meme culture, creating the kind of viral branding that spreads quickly across Telegram and X. On the other, it is rooted in legitimacy, with HashEx and CertiK audits completed , a rare badge of credibility at this stage of fundraising. Adding fuel to the fire is the PATRIOT50X bonus code , giving early participants 50% more tokens . This incentive not only accelerates adoption but also amplifies FOMO, as traders rush to lock in bigger allocations before rounds sell out. The combination of scarcity, legitimacy, and viral community energy has turned MAGACOIN FINANCE into one of the fastest-rising presales of the year. Features Driving Crypto Market Momentum Several elements explain why the broader crypto market is once again dominating conversations. Leading projects are focusing on credibility and security, with more protocols undergoing independent audits to strengthen investor confidence. Scarcity remains a major theme, as capped supply models across assets like Bitcoin and Chainlink ensure that increasing demand has a direct impact on price action. At the same time, whale participation is rising, with large-scale buyers entering alongside retail investors, a sign of growing institutional and grassroots alignment. Branding and cultural presence also matter more than ever, with projects that capture attention on social platforms often seeing faster organic adoption. Finally, strong fundraising and rapid sellouts in presales highlight that capital is flowing where investors see both narrative energy and structural resilience. Investor takeaways The current landscape offers a stark set of choices: Chainlink is building strength, supported by treasury growth and institutional adoption, and looks ready for a breakout. Pi Coin is testing critical levels, with real user growth but a fragile price structure that leaves little margin for error. MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining the presale model, blending meme culture, scarcity, and audits into a record-breaking story that could define the next bull run. For investors, the message is clear: balance safety with asymmetry. Established players like Chainlink offer measured upside, but the transformative gains of this cycle may come from projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Why timing matters Crypto thrives on cycles. Bitcoin consolidates near highs, Ethereum builds quietly through adoption, and infrastructure coins like Chainlink prepare for renewed rallies. But presales often hit their stride during these transitional phases, when investors want to secure asymmetric opportunities before the next wave of liquidity arrives. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE fits in. With macro headwinds pressuring traditional assets and established coins consolidating, presales with credibility and culture become magnets for capital. By combining legitimacy with hype at exactly this moment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is perfectly timed to ride the next market rotation. Conclusion Crypto markets are at a crossroads. Chainlink appears poised to surge as adoption strengthens, Pi Coin is flirting with breakdown as sentiment weakens, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is seizing the moment with a presale that has already broken records. With forecasts of 12,700% ROI , a PATRIOT50X bonus code boosting allocations, and demand that has allocations vanishing by the hour, it is shaping up as more than just a presale, it could become a defining story of the next bull run.

Employers are holding back, terrified of getting sued for offering higher-cost, harder-to-exit investments in retirement plans. The White House signed an executive order last month telling the Labor Department to cut down the legal risks. But legal experts say that won’t erase the threat. The rule that governs 401(k)s forces companies to act in the best interests of employees, a phrase so vague it’s fueled a nonstop wave of lawsuits for twenty years. Hundreds of companies have been dragged to court. Some, like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, paid millions to settle. It’s why most companies just stick to low-fee, basic investments. Offering hedge funds or crypto means getting slapped with a lawsuit, and no one wants to be the test case. Labor Department gets marching orders but can’t kill lawsuits Jennifer Doss, who leads the defined-contribution team at Captrust, said straight up, “The administration can only do so much to curb litigation.” The law’s too broad, and even new rules can’t promise immunity. Trump’s order gave the Labor Secretary six months to put out guidance for how to include alternative investments inside diversified 401(k) funds. The goal is a legal shield, a “safe harbor” rule. But even that can backfire. Lisa Gomez, who ran the Employee Benefits Security Administration under Biden, said employers could still be sued if they mess up any part of the procedure. Daniel Aronowitz, Trump’s pick to lead the EBSA now, told Congress in June he plans to “end the era of regulation by litigation.” He runs Encore Fiduciary, which sells lawsuit insurance to 401(k) plans. Aronowitz wants to give companies room to take on higher-return investments without worrying they’ll get sued if markets go sideways. But the courts won’t just bow to agency memos. Take what happened to Intel. The company dumped some employee funds into private equity and hedge funds about ten years ago. They got sued. They won. But the lawsuit dragged on for years and cost a fortune. That win didn’t give other companies any real confidence. Michael Kreps, who advises employers at Groom Law Group, said flat out: “Frustration over litigation has reached a boiling point.” New rules come fast, but courts still block employers The Labor Department has already started reversing Biden-era warnings. They pulled back on guidance that told small businesses not to offer private equity in their 401(k)s. They also tossed guidance that flagged crypto as a red flag for investigation. That doesn’t mean lawsuits are going away. In July, the agency filed a brief backing HP in court. Employees sued the company for using leftover matching contributions, money forfeited by workers who left early, to fund future matches. The plaintiffs said that money should’ve gone toward lowering costs. HP said they followed their plan documents and IRS rules. The Labor Department agreed with HP. Bradford Campbell, who led EBSA under George W. Bush, said the department is now backing companies more actively. But none of this fixes the deeper legal mess. In April, the Supreme Court made it harder for employers to get early dismissals in 401(k) lawsuits. That decision keeps cases alive longer and raises the cost of defending even if you win. Another Supreme Court ruling last year killed off the Chevron doctrine, which had forced courts to defer to agencies when laws weren’t clear. Douglas Tang, a partner at Patterson Belknap, said that change weakens any guidance that might come out of Trump’s executive order. Congress could change the law to add real safe harbor rules or make it harder for workers to sue, but Tang said, “there appears to be no momentum on such efforts.” So the lawsuits keep coming, and employers keep ducking risk. That’s where things stand.

Notably, this plan aligns with the nation’s aim to enhance its contribution to the AI ecosystem. The tech giant will collaborate with several partners currently developing their own Stargate UK data centers to achieve this tremendous objective. They include: Microsoft, CoreWeave, Nscale, and OpenAI. This initiative also aligns with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s vision of “sovereign AI,” which stands for developing AI purposefully to fulfill one’s needs and benefit them. Similar projects were initially introduced in France and the United Arab Emirates. Nvidia eyes the UK for AI expansion In a statement, Huang mentioned that the UK was creating the infrastructure needed for an AI-driven industrial revolution. Based on his explanation, this included enhancing science, transforming industries, and developing new economic opportunities. The CEO made these remarks when President Trump’s state had planned a visit to the country. To achieve Nvidia’s plan , Microsoft and Nscale have been assigned to create a superior supercomputer in Loughton, UK. This device will feature 24,000 Nvidia Grace Blackwell Ultra chips, essential to keep Microsoft’s Azure platform running in the country. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, weighed in on the topic of discussion. Nadella said they were committed to ensuring the US and the UK lead AI and cloud innovation globally. Therefore, based on his argument, they must work with NVIDIA to combine their international platform with their recent computing, software, and networking capabilities to achieve this goal. This is because innovators in these countries will acquire powerful tools to shape their future in AI. For Nscale, its contribution includes the installation of 60,000 Nvidia chips across the UK. The tech firm is collaborating with OpenAI to have its Stargate UK data center up and running by 2026. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, also commented on the situation. Altman pointed out the UK’s long history of leading in AI and its ability to attract high-ranked researchers, millions of ChatGPT users, and a government system that swiftly recognized the potential that this technology holds. He further explained that Stargate UK creates a strong base to accelerate science-based discoveries, improve productivity, and stimulate economic growth in the country. The CEO also acknowledged that this collaboration upholds their long-shared belief that with the right resources, AI can create various opportunities for individuals and businesses situated in the UK. Tech firms join forces to make significant advancements in the AI sector Apart from data centers focused on exploring AI, Nvidia has revealed a partnership with quantum computing firms OQC and Digital Realty to develop a Quantum AI center. On the other hand, ORCA Computing, Imperial College London, and Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center have joined forces to develop hybrid-quantum deep neural networks. At the same time, the University of Edinburgh centers its concentration on programs related to GPU-accelerated quantum error-correction. Other projects to contribute to advancing the AI sector include thorough research in robotics and several other fields. In the meantime, Microsoft pledged to invest approximately $30 billion in AI infrastructure and operations based in the UK in a blog dated September 16. According to the company, the plan will be effective from 2025 to 2028. This includes $15 billion specifically for the construction of cloud and AI infrastructure in the country.

Recently, South Korea’s Financial Security Institute (FSI) sounded an alarm, revealing sophisticated new crypto exchange hacking techniques . This isn’t just about simple phishing anymore; attackers are now employing cunning, multi-layered methods to breach security and steal valuable digital assets. Understanding these evolving threats is absolutely crucial for everyone in the crypto space, from seasoned traders to new investors. Understanding the Evolving Crypto Exchange Hacking Techniques Hackers are getting smarter, and their strategies are becoming increasingly elaborate. The FSI report highlights ""pretexting"" as a primary method in recent overseas crypto exchange hacks. But what exactly does this entail? Impersonation: Attackers often pose as recruiters or other legitimate professionals. Building Trust: They engage in seemingly innocent conversations to build rapport. Malware Delivery: The ultimate goal is to trick employees into installing malicious software on their computers. This malware then becomes the gateway, allowing infiltrators to gain an initial foothold within an organization’s network. It’s a social engineering masterclass, designed to bypass initial defenses and exploit human trust. How Hackers Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Once malware is successfully installed, hackers don’t stop there. Their next step involves exploiting ""supply chain vulnerabilities."" This sophisticated approach demonstrates an advanced understanding of network architecture. They target weaker links in the software, hardware, or services that a cryptocurrency exchange uses. By compromising a third-party vendor or a component within the exchange’s operational ecosystem, they can gain deeper access to the core network. This indirect infiltration strategy makes detection much harder, showcasing the growing sophistication of modern crypto exchange hacking techniques . The aim is always to move deeper into the system, often unnoticed, preparing for the final, devastating blow. The Peril of Blind Signatures and Obscure Laundering A particularly insidious method highlighted by the FSI involves ""blind signatures."" This technique is a significant threat to asset security: Deceptive Approvals: Employees are tricked into approving transactions without fully seeing or understanding their underlying details. Unauthorized Transfers: This allows hackers to authorize illicit transfers, effectively stealing assets directly from the exchange. After the theft, the stolen funds are quickly laundered to obscure their origin. Mixer protocols, like the infamous Tornado Cash, are frequently used to anonymize transactions. These mixers intentionally obscure the transaction trail, making stolen funds incredibly difficult to trace. Finally, the funds are converted into ""non-freezable coins"" and cashed out, disappearing without a trace. This entire process underscores the complex nature of these modern crypto exchange hacking techniques . Strengthening Defenses Against Advanced Crypto Exchange Hacking Techniques So, what can be done to counter these evolving threats? Vigilance and proactive security measures are paramount for both cryptocurrency exchanges and individual users. For Exchanges: Employee Training: Implement robust, ongoing training programs to educate staff about social engineering tactics. Supply Chain Audits: Conduct regular and thorough security audits of all third-party vendors and supply chain components. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Mandate MFA for all critical operations and employee access points. Advanced Threat Detection: Deploy sophisticated systems capable of identifying unusual network activity and potential breaches. Regular Security Audits: Perform frequent penetration testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them. For Users: Skepticism: Be highly skeptical of unsolicited communications, especially those requesting personal or sensitive information. Strong Security: Use strong, unique passwords and enable MFA on all your crypto accounts. Reputable Platforms: Only use well-established and reputable exchanges and wallets. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated on the latest scams and crypto exchange hacking techniques . Conclusion: A Call for Unwavering Vigilance The FSI’s revelations serve as a stark reminder of the ever-present dangers in the cryptocurrency world. As hackers continuously evolve their crypto exchange hacking techniques , our collective defenses must adapt and strengthen even faster. Staying informed, maintaining unwavering vigilance, and proactively implementing robust security measures are our best shields against these increasingly sophisticated threats. The security of your digital assets depends on it. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is pretexting in crypto security? Pretexting is a social engineering technique where attackers create a believable, fabricated scenario (a ""pretext"") to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security, such as installing malware. 2. How do supply chain vulnerabilities affect crypto exchanges? Supply chain vulnerabilities allow hackers to compromise an exchange indirectly by targeting a less secure third-party vendor or software component that the exchange relies on. This breach in the supply chain can then provide access to the exchange’s internal systems. 3. What are ""blind signatures"" and why are they dangerous? Blind signatures occur when an employee is tricked into digitally signing or approving a transaction without fully seeing or understanding the actual details of what they are approving. This can lead to unauthorized transfers of funds, as the employee unknowingly greenlights a malicious transaction. 4. How do hackers launder stolen crypto funds? Hackers typically launder stolen funds by routing them through ""mixer"" protocols (like Tornado Cash), which combine and shuffle various crypto transactions to obscure their origin. They then often convert these mixed funds into non-traceable cryptocurrencies before cashing them out. 5. What can I do to protect my crypto assets from these hacking techniques? Individual users should use strong, unique passwords, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), be wary of unsolicited communications, only use reputable exchanges, and stay informed about the latest security threats and scams.

The former CEO and co-founder of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, affectionately known as CZ, recently updated his profile description from “ex-@binance” to simply “@binance.” This seemingly small edit has fueled intense discussion: is CZ truly preparing to step back into the spotlight? What Signals a Potential Changpeng Zhao Binance Return? The recent change to CZ’s X profile is the primary catalyst for this wave of speculation. For many, this isn’t just a casual edit; it’s a deliberate signal. Following his legal challenges in the U.S. for violating anti-money laundering laws, and a period of imprisonment, the timing of this profile update is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a potential shift in his professional status or an upcoming announcement. Profile Update: Changing “ex-@binance” to “@binance” directly implies a renewed association. Industry Timing: Occurs after his legal obligations, raising questions about his future role. Community Reaction: The crypto world is highly sensitive to such signals from influential figures. Beyond the X profile, the broader context of Binance’s legal situation adds another layer to the narrative. Bloomberg recently reported that Binance is nearing a significant agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. This deal could potentially release the exchange from its obligation to retain a third-party compliance monitor. How Does Binance’s DOJ Agreement Impact CZ’s Future? An agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice is a major milestone for Binance. It signifies a move towards resolving past compliance issues and establishing a more stable regulatory footing. This development could pave the way for a more streamlined operation and potentially, a more welcoming environment for key figures like CZ to re-engage, even if not in a direct executive capacity initially. While CZ’s legal journey has been separate from Binance’s corporate entity in some respects, the fortunes of both are often intertwined in the public perception. A cleaner slate for Binance could indirectly facilitate a smoother path for any future involvement from its co-founder, making a Changpeng Zhao Binance return more plausible in the eyes of many. The crypto market thrives on anticipation and signals from its leaders. CZ’s influence on Binance, and indeed the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, remains substantial. His past requests for a pardon from President Donald Trump, made between April and May, also underscore his desire to re-enter the public and professional sphere without lingering legal shadows.

One key indicator that helps gauge these shifts is the Altcoin Season Index , which currently stands firm at 71. This reading, unchanged from the previous day, offers a fascinating snapshot of the market’s sentiment towards digital assets beyond Bitcoin. For many, the question isn’t just “what is this number?” but “what does it mean for my portfolio?” What Does the Altcoin Season Index at 71 Truly Indicate? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, serves as a barometer for market performance. It meticulously tracks whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies – excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens – have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A score nearing 100 unmistakably signals an “Altcoin Season,” a period where these alternative coins experience significant growth. Conversely, a lower score often points to a “Bitcoin Season,” where the pioneer cryptocurrency leads the charge. A steady score of 71 suggests a market in transition. While it’s not a full-blown Altcoin Season yet, it clearly indicates that a substantial number of altcoins are showing robust performance relative to Bitcoin. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it reflects sustained outperformance by a broad segment of the market. Investors often watch this metric closely to identify potential shifts in capital flows. Navigating the Crypto Landscape: Is a Full Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Given the current reading, many are wondering if a definitive Altcoin Season is just around the corner. Several factors could propel the Altcoin Season Index higher. For instance, major upgrades to prominent networks like Ethereum, or the emergence of compelling new narratives in decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), could draw significant capital into altcoins. These developments often spark renewed interest and investment. However, challenges remain. Bitcoin’s dominance can quickly reassert itself, especially during periods of market uncertainty or macro-economic shifts. A sudden surge in Bitcoin’s price could temporarily overshadow altcoin gains, pushing the index lower. Therefore, while 71 is promising, it’s not a guarantee. Smart investors will continue to monitor the broader market and specific project developments. Understanding the Dynamics: How the Altcoin Season Index Impacts Your Portfolio Recognizing the implications of the Altcoin Season Index is vital for strategic portfolio management. When the index climbs, it often signals opportunities for potentially higher gains in altcoins, which typically exhibit greater volatility and upside potential compared to Bitcoin during these periods. This can be an exciting time for those looking to diversify and capitalize on emerging trends. Conversely, misinterpreting the index can lead to risks. Chasing every altcoin without proper due diligence can result in significant drawdowns if market sentiment shifts rapidly. It’s crucial to remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Benefits: Identifying periods for potentially accelerated returns from altcoins. Challenges: Increased volatility and the risk of rapid market reversals. Examples: Historically, periods of high index scores have coincided with strong performances from sectors like DeFi tokens or Layer 1 solutions. Strategic Moves for Savvy Altcoin Investors in a 71-Point Market With the Altcoin Season Index holding at 71, what actionable insights can investors take? This reading suggests a selective approach is best. Research Diligently: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear utility. Don’t just follow the hype. Diversify Wisely: Spread your investments across different altcoin sectors to mitigate risk. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: A declining Bitcoin dominance chart often precedes or accompanies an Altcoin Season. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders. This dynamic environment demands continuous learning and adaptation. Staying informed about market narratives and technological advancements will be key to navigating the opportunities presented by the current Altcoin Season Index standing. The Altcoin Season Index at 71 serves as a compelling indicator of the crypto market’s current health and potential direction.

Standard Chartered has been cited with a year-end forecast of $7,500, while other market commentators and smaller research groups have floated targets as high as $8,500.

A pivot point near $4,811 was named by some analysts as the level that needs to clear for a larger advance to become more likely. Ethereum’s recent trading band has been roughly in the $4,400–$4,600 range in many charts, which means significant upside would be required to reach the lofty targets being discussed. What Would Need To Happen For $8,500 According to market commentary, several things would have to line up. Continued ETF inflows and steady institutional accumulation are key. Also important are clearer rules for ETF products and a soft macro backdrop that keeps risk appetite intact. Some analysts add that if Bitcoin moves higher — a move to roughly $150,000 has been used in scenarios — Ethereum could gain as investors reallocate across major crypto assets. Risks That Would Halt The Rally News cautions that the $8,500 concept is built on several positive developments occurring simultaneously. Policy shifts, softer ETF demand, or a change in macro sentiment might also stop a rally in a hurry.

51848793,582139,1758070833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51848793.jpeg,Shiba Inu Bulls Are Back: Here’s The 512 Billion SHIB Accumulation That Triggered A Spark,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bulls-are-back/,"Shiba Inu bulls are back, with on-chain data indicating heavy accumulation among the meme coin’s investors. Specifically, a 512 billion SHIB transfer has drawn the attention of the crypto community, sparking bullish sentiments towards the meme coin, which has underperformed so far. Shiba Inu Bulls Spark SHIB Accumulation Theory With 512 Billion SHIB Transfer Etherscan data shows that a Kraken hot wallet moved just over 512 billion SHIB ($7.14 million) to an unknown wallet (0x95a…4C4cE), sparking speculations that Shiba Inu bulls are actively accumulating the meme coin. Typically, a move from a hot wallet to what is possibly a cold wallet indicates that investors are looking to hold the crypto asset for the long term. Notably, thanks to this 512 billion transfer, the unknown wallet now ranks as the 38th largest Shiba Inu holder. Meanwhile, further on-chain data suggests that this wallet might be Kraken’s cold wallet , which stores its reserves. This wallet has made several transactions since then but still holds 1.47 trillion SHIB ($19.28 million), representing an increase from the initial 512 billion that was deposited. This confirms that Shiba Inu bulls have indeed been busy accumulating more SHIB even amid the sideways price action from the meme coin. This is a positive development, as it could trigger a supply shock, potentially leading to higher prices for SHIB. Meanwhile, Santiment data also shows that the exchange outflows are currently outpacing the exchange inflows. On September 15, 181.87 billion SHIB were taken off exchanges, while 87.37 billion tokens were moved into exchanges. This indicates that more Shiba Inu investors are currently leaning towards accumulating more SHIB rather than offloading their tokens. These investors are likely taking advantage of the dip opportunity as they anticipate higher prices for the meme coin despite its underperformance. SHIB is down almost 40% year-to-date (YTD). SHIB Could Still Rally 600% From Current Levels Crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the Shiba Inu price could rally by almost 600% from its current levels. He stated that the technicals point towards a near 6x happening in price to reach the $0.000081 target despite some bearish sentiments towards the meme coin. The analyst had earlier revealed that SHIB had confirmed a bullish pattern in a regular bull divergence with the MACD histogram. Fundamentals also present a bullish outlook for the Shiba Inu price. The SHIB team is about to roll out the LEASH v2 migration , which is positive for the entire Shiba Inu ecosystem. Meanwhile, ShibaSwap recently launched an upgrade to enable cross-chain access, further strengthening SHIB’s utility. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001306, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Shiba Inu|Coinmarketcap|etherscan|Javon Marks|Kraken|LEASH v2 Migration|MACD Histogram|meme coin|Santiment|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|ShibaSwap|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 01:00:33

In South Korea, a similar conversation is taking place, specifically concerning the potential introduction of a won-pegged stablecoin . The Bank of Korea, the nation’s central bank, is treading carefully, as highlighted by Governor Rhee Chang-yong’s recent remarks. Why the Caution Around a Won-Pegged Stablecoin? Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong recently shared his cautious perspective on a potential won-pegged stablecoin . Speaking at a special lecture at Seoul National University, Rhee expressed significant uncertainty regarding the benefits such a digital asset might bring to the Korean economy. His primary concern revolves around a crucial question: What tangible advantages would a domestic stablecoin offer that aren’t already addressed by existing financial mechanisms? Moreover, the Governor pointed out a significant risk: the potential for a won-pegged stablecoin to disrupt the nation’s established monetary system. Introducing a new form of currency, even one pegged to the national fiat, could have unforeseen consequences on: Monetary policy effectiveness Financial stability The existing banking infrastructure These are not trivial concerns for a central bank tasked with maintaining economic stability. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: Domestic vs. Dollar-Pegged One might assume that introducing a domestic won-pegged stablecoin would help stem the tide of foreign-pegged stablecoins, particularly those linked to the U.S. dollar. However, Governor Rhee believes this isn’t necessarily the case. He articulated that issuing a local stablecoin would not automatically prevent the influx or usage of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins within the Korean market. Why this distinction? The reasons are multifaceted: Global Liquidity: U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins often offer greater global liquidity and easier access to international markets. Investor Preference: Some investors might prefer the perceived stability and widespread acceptance of dollar-pegged assets, regardless of local alternatives. Regulatory Arbitrage: Different regulatory frameworks might incentivize the use of foreign stablecoins. Therefore, simply creating a won-pegged stablecoin does not solve the broader challenge of managing cross-border digital asset flows or the preferences of market participants. What Are the Potential Upsides of a Won-Pegged Stablecoin? (Even If Uncertain) While the Bank of Korea maintains a cautious stance, it’s worth considering the general arguments often made for stablecoins, even if their specific benefits for the Korean won are currently deemed uncertain by the Governor. Proponents often highlight: Payment Efficiency: Potential for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. Financial Inclusion: Greater access to financial services for underserved populations. Innovation: Fostering new financial products and services within the digital economy. However, Governor Rhee’s remarks suggest that for South Korea, these potential benefits are not yet compelling enough to outweigh the risks. The central bank’s primary role is to ensure stability, and any new financial instrument must clearly demonstrate its value without compromising this core mandate. The Bank of Korea’s stance reflects a pragmatic approach: prioritize stability and thoroughly assess the value proposition of new digital assets. The conversation around a won-pegged stablecoin is far from over, but for now, the emphasis remains on understanding its true impact before widespread adoption. As the digital finance landscape continues to evolve, central banks like the Bank of Korea will undoubtedly continue their careful evaluation, balancing innovation with the imperative of financial security. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a won-pegged stablecoin? A won-pegged stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won. This means its value should theoretically always be equivalent to one Korean Won. 2. Why is the Bank of Korea cautious about a won-pegged stablecoin? Governor Rhee Chang-yong expressed caution due to the uncertain benefits of such a stablecoin and its potential to disrupt the existing monetary system. The central bank prioritizes financial stability. 3. Will a won-pegged stablecoin stop the use of USD-pegged stablecoins in Korea? Governor Rhee believes that issuing a domestic won-pegged stablecoin would not necessarily prevent the influx or usage of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, citing factors like global liquidity and investor preference. 4. What are the general benefits often associated with stablecoins? Commonly cited benefits include improved payment efficiency, potential for greater financial inclusion, and fostering innovation in digital finance. However, the Bank of Korea questions if these apply compellingly to a won-pegged stablecoin in their context. 5. What is the Bank of Korea’s main priority regarding digital assets? The Bank of Korea’s primary goal is to ensure financial stability. Any new digital asset or financial instrument must clearly demonstrate its value without compromising this core mandate.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Polymarket and CME FedWatch are aligned: the Fed’s easing cycle begins tomorrow. Both have a 25 bps cut locked in for the next FOMC meeting, with odds building for a three-cut path through year-end. Polymarket traders leave more room for aggressive easing, while CME assigns steadier probabilities of 25 bps steps. Either way, markets see 75 bps in cuts as the baseline for 2025. Market conviction around the Fed pivot is already showing up on-chain, with BTC trading at $116,762, up 1.3% on the day and 4.7% on the week, while ETH sits at $4,502, up 4.3% on the week as traders price in the cuts. Now, some traders are sitting on the sidelines to see just how the market might react as the Fed announces cuts. In a recent report, CryptoQuant data shows bitcoin exchange inflows have dropped to a 7-day average of just 25,000 BTC, the lowest in more than a year and a half; the level seen in mid-July when BTC first crossed $120,000. The average BTC deposit size has also halved to 0.57 BTC, evidence that large holders are sitting idle rather than rushing to sell. ETH is seeing the same pattern: exchange inflows have fallen to a two-month low of 783,000 ETH, down sharply from 1.8 million in August. The average ETH deposit has declined to 30 ETH from 40–45 ETH earlier this summer, suggesting reduced sell-side activity from whales. If BTC and ETH are being hoarded, stablecoins are flowing in CryptoQuant writes in its report. USDT deposits into exchanges surged to $379 million at the end of August, the highest this year, and remain elevated at $200 million. The average daily USDT deposit has doubled since July, giving exchanges the “dry powder” needed to support a post-Fed rally. But the flows aren’t uniform. Altcoins are seeing a resurgence of exchange activity, with transaction deposits climbing to a 7-day total of 55,000, up from a flat 20,000–30,000 range earlier this year. That divergence signals possible profit-taking in higher-beta names even as BTC and ETH supply remains tight. ""September brings a wave of token unlocks totaling $4.5 billion, a dynamic that could pressure liquidity and test market absorption,"" OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin wrote in a note to CoinDesk. True opportunity lies beyond short-term volatility, Lin argued. ""Stablecoins are nearing $300 billion in supply, token unlocks are putting market depth to the test, and major infrastructure upgrades like Nasdaq’s move toward tokenized securities are signaling that crypto is becoming part of the global financial system, not an outlier,"" she wrote. The message is clear: the Fed pivot is nearly priced in. What matters now is whether crypto’s liquidity buffers, stablecoins, exchange inflows, and token unlocks can absorb the shocks and channel capital into the next leg higher for BTC. Market Movement BTC: BTC is trading above $116,500 as traders are optimistic about potential U.S. interest rate cuts. Technical factors such as the closing of futures gaps have added upward pressure. Some caution is setting in ahead of the Fed meeting. ETH: ETH is trading with modest strength, supported by overall crypto market momentum (dominated by BTC), but with some resistance as investors weigh macro risks and await clarity on policy from the Fed. Gold: Gold is hitting record highs, driven by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates, a weakening U.S. dollar, and heightened geopolitical or macroeconomic uncertainty. Safe‑haven demand from investors is strong. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks fell on Wednesday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.3%, as investors tracked Wall Street losses and awaited a likely Fed rate cut decision. S&P 500: The S&P 500 slipped 0.13% to 6,606.76 Tuesday as investors booked profits ahead of the Fed’s rate decision after touching a record high earlier.

The measure would block the Federal Reserve from creating or distributing a digital dollar before any such system is formally authorized. The proposal, known as the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and sponsored by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN), already cleared the House in July. Lawmakers aim to fold it into the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, the chamber’s flagship market structure legislation. The proposal emerged in a draft agenda from the House Rules Committee that seemingly would force the CBDC ban to be included in market structure legislation via an “engrossment.” That is, rather than play out in a standalone law, the ban would find its way into the final version of the market structure bill before it heads to the Senate. This will speed passage, lawmakers say. The standalone digital dollar legislation faced challenging margins, and packaging it within a broader digital assets package could give senators more ammunition to fend off objections. The bill is designed not only to bring clarity to the respective roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission but also to establish rules about trading, custody, and issuance for digital assets. With the CBDC ban folded in, it now sits squarely at the center of the U.S. crypto regulatory debate — especially in Discord circles. Lawmakers drive CBDC ban across several bills The CBDC ban is not just in the market structure bill, with lawmakers opting to push it through the once-a-year defense policy bil l, which is commonly referred to as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA is one of the must-pass pieces of legislation, establishing the Pentagon’s budget and defense priorities, which means it almost always gets passed by Congress. By grafting the CBDC ban onto this vehicle, lawmakers are opting for one of the surest pathways to ram through a contentious measure. This tactic also makes it harder for critics to prevent the provision from moving forward; voting against the NDAA would be perceived as standing in the way of military funds and defense planning at a time when tensions are escalating around potential international flash points. The provision included in the NDAA is unequivocal. It prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing, testing, or offering its own central bank digital currency. This ban is to work retroactively, blocking the startup of a potential future CBDC and any existing pilot programs or research projects. Supporters say the amendment sends a message to Congress against Fed policy in any administration. Privacy and competition battles heat up Proponents of the ban claim a CBDC could infringe on personal freedom. They caution that a digital dollar could enable the government to track, monitor, or restrict how citizens spend their money. They see a CBDC ban as a firewall against state surveillance and financial manipulation. Cynics, however, say that by banning a CBDC outright, the U.S. risks being left behind other major economies. China has already introduced its digital yuan, and the European Union is moving toward a digital euro. Economists and fintech experts warn that even the lack of an option for a CBDC leaves the U.S. in danger of losing its lead as global financial markets shift to new players .

A groundbreaking development recently emerged from the UK’s LMAX Group, a prominent fintech firm. They are now offering Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures trading with an astonishing up to 100x leverage, as reported by Bloomberg. This move signifies a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency landscape, providing sophisticated investors with powerful new tools. LMAX Group, known for processing an average of over $40 billion in daily spot trading volume, is not just dipping its toes; it’s making a bold leap. The company is launching cash-settled contracts specifically linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This initiative directly addresses the growing demand from institutional clients for more dynamic and leveraged access to the crypto market. What Are Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures and Why Now? Perpetual futures are a unique type of derivatives contract in the crypto space. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. LMAX Group’s decision to offer Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures stems from a clear understanding of market trends. They recognized that this market segment has been a core part of the crypto industry for the past four years, attracting significant retail and now institutional interest. Institutional investors are constantly seeking efficient ways to gain exposure to digital assets, manage risk, and potentially amplify returns. Leverage, in this context, allows them to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. For well-capitalized and risk-managed institutions, 100x leverage can be a powerful tool for strategic trading and hedging. LMAX Group’s Bold Move: A Catalyst for Institutional Crypto Growth? The introduction of such high-leverage Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures by a regulated entity like LMAX Group is a significant game-changer. It legitimizes and formalizes a product previously more associated with retail-focused, often unregulated, platforms. This move is not isolated; it reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption and the maturation of the crypto derivatives market. Consider these key impacts: Enhanced Market Liquidity: More institutional participation typically leads to deeper liquidity, making markets more efficient and less prone to sudden price swings. Sophisticated Risk Management: Institutions can strategically use these instruments for hedging existing crypto holdings, managing exposure, or speculating on price movements without direct ownership of the underlying assets. Increased Accessibility: For institutions, trading with a trusted and regulated provider like LMAX Group reduces counterparty risk and operational complexities, fostering greater confidence in the market. Competitive Landscape: This service follows similar launches, indicating a growing institutional appetite. Coinbase Financial Markets launched a comparable service in July, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has also announced plans for its own version in October, intensifying the race for institutional crypto market share. Navigating the Dynamics: Opportunities and Challenges for Institutional Crypto While the opportunities are significant, institutional clients engaging with Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures must also navigate potential challenges. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, combined with high leverage, means that positions can move dramatically in a short period. Robust risk management frameworks and a deep understanding of market dynamics are paramount for institutions utilizing these products. However, the opportunities for growth and innovation are equally compelling: Arbitrage Strategies: Institutions can capitalize on price discrepancies between spot markets and perpetual futures, generating profits from market inefficiencies. Capital Efficiency: Leverage allows institutions to deploy capital more efficiently across various strategies, optimizing their investment portfolios and maximizing potential returns. Market Maturation: The entry of established players like LMAX Group, alongside Coinbase and CBOE, signals the increasing institutionalization of the crypto derivatives market. This pushes the entire industry towards higher standards of compliance, regulation, and investor protection. This evolving landscape suggests a future where digital assets are more deeply integrated into global financial systems, offering diverse avenues for investment and risk management. LMAX Group’s launch of 100x leverage Institutional Crypto Perpetual Futures marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing demand from institutional investors for sophisticated, high-leverage trading products within a regulated framework. This move, alongside similar initiatives from other major financial players, is accelerating the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem. As the market continues to evolve, these offerings will undoubtedly shape how institutions interact with Bitcoin and Ethereum, paving the way for further innovation and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are perpetual futures in the context of cryptocurrency? A1: Perpetual futures are a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, without an expiry date. This means positions can be held indefinitely, unlike traditional futures contracts. Q2: How does 100x leverage work with perpetual futures? A2: 100x leverage means an investor can control a position worth 100 times their initial capital. For example, with $1,000, they could open a position worth $100,000. While this can amplify profits, it also significantly increases the risk of losses. Q3: Why is LMAX Group offering these products to institutions? A3: LMAX Group recognized a strong demand from institutional investors for leveraged market access to cryptocurrencies. They identified perpetual futures as a core part of the crypto industry that institutions want to engage with, within a regulated and secure environment. Q4: Which cryptocurrencies are supported for these perpetual futures?

This colossal shift, reported by the reputable on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, immediately sparked widespread discussion among market participants and analysts alike. What could this significant Bitcoin transfer signify for the future trajectory of the crypto market? Unpacking This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Event Just eight hours prior to the report, a fresh address, identified as starting with bc1qup, received a monumental Bitcoin transfer . Specifically, 5,816 BTC, valued at an astonishing $680 million, was moved from FalconX. As a prominent prime brokerage for institutional investors, FalconX’s involvement strongly suggests a meticulously calculated move by a major financial entity. Such a large-scale Bitcoin transfer naturally raises crucial questions about its underlying motivations. Who orchestrated this colossal transfer? FalconX’s role points towards an institutional entity or a high-net-worth individual. Why did this transfer happen now? The timing could be strategically linked to market conditions, portfolio rebalancing, or preparations for upcoming market events. What Does This Bitcoin Transfer Mean for the Market? A Bitcoin transfer of this immense magnitude rarely occurs without significant underlying activity or strategic intent. There are several compelling interpretations, each carrying different implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Firstly, it could represent a substantial institutional investor shifting funds into cold storage for long-term holding. This best practice secures digital assets away from online exchanges, reducing exposure to hacks or regulatory risks. If true, it could be a profoundly bullish signal, indicating strong conviction in Bitcoin’s enduring value. Secondly, this Bitcoin transfer might be the settlement of an over-the-counter (OTC) deal. Institutional players frequently execute large trades directly to prevent price slippage. The funds could be moving to a new custodian or directly to a buyer’s wallet following such a private transaction. Thirdly, the transfer could simply be an internal reorganization by FalconX or one of its major clients. Large financial institutions routinely rebalance their digital asset holdings across various wallets or custodians to optimize efficiency and enhance security. In this scenario, the Bitcoin transfer is more about internal asset management rather than a direct market indicator. Tracking Significant Bitcoin Transfers: Insights for Investors Observing and analyzing large Bitcoin transfer s offers invaluable insights into overall market sentiment and potential future price movements. Blockchain analytics firms, like Lookonchain, play an indispensable role in bringing transparency to these on-chain movements. By diligently tracking these “whale” transactions, experienced analysts can often infer whether major holders are accumulating, distributing, or simply securing their substantial investments. Key insights derived from monitoring large transfers: Market Sentiment: Consistent transfers to cold storage often suggest long-term bullish sentiment among large holders. Potential Price Impact: While this specific Bitcoin transfer did not directly involve an exchange deposit, any subsequent movements from the receiving address (bc1qup) to an exchange could potentially signal impending selling pressure. Institutional Adoption: The involvement of prime brokers like FalconX in these transactions strongly underscores the accelerating pace of institutional participation and confidence within the crypto ecosystem. Understanding these complex on-chain dynamics empowers investors to make more informed decisions, allowing them to anticipate potential market shifts rather than merely reacting to them. Navigating the Future After This Monumental Bitcoin Transfer The recent colossal Bitcoin transfer vividly underscores the continuous evolution of the cryptocurrency market. As more institutional capital flows into Bitcoin, we can expect similar large-scale movements to become increasingly common. These transfers, while sometimes mysterious, serve as a powerful testament to the growing maturity and sophisticated infrastructure now supporting digital assets globally. For everyday retail investors, the paramount lesson is to remain well-informed and to understand that not every large transfer signals an impending price crash or an immediate pump. More often than not, they are highly strategic, calculated maneuvers executed by sophisticated entities. This particular Bitcoin transfer , moving to a brand-new address from an established institutional platform, strongly leans towards a security-focused or long-term strategic holding narrative, rather than suggesting immediate selling pressure on the market. What key indicators to watch for next: Any subsequent movements or activity originating from the bc1qup address. Further detailed reports and analyses from leading on-chain analytics firms. The overall market reaction and prevailing sentiment in the wake of such a significant event. In conclusion, this monumental $680 million Bitcoin transfer from FalconX is a powerful and unmistakable reminder of the significant capital and strategic depth within the crypto ecosystem. While its exact purpose remains a subject of informed speculation, it undeniably highlights the deep pockets and calculated maneuvers of major players in the digital asset space. Keeping a close eye on such impactful events is absolutely crucial for anyone aiming to truly understand the pulse and direction of the Bitcoin market.

Each transfer needs context. Q4: How can I track large Bitcoin transfers? A: You can follow blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Whale Alert, or Glassnode, which specialize in monitoring and reporting significant on-chain movements. Q5: What is FalconX’s role in this transfer? A: FalconX is a prime brokerage that provides trading, credit, and clearing services for institutional investors in the digital asset space.

What Prompted the Yala Token Burn? The recent incident saw unauthorized YU tokens issued, raising concerns within the community.

By destroying the illicitly created YU tokens, the protocol effectively eliminates any supply that entered the ecosystem without proper authorization. This action is paramount for maintaining the integrity of the YU token’s economic model and preventing potential market instability caused by the unexpected supply. It also serves as a powerful signal to the community: Yala is proactive in neutralizing threats and preserving the legitimate value of its assets. This commitment builds confidence among users and investors, reinforcing the protocol’s reliability. Yala’s Proactive Stance: Beyond the Immediate Threat This incident highlights the constant vigilance required in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Yala’s rapid identification of the unauthorized tokens and the subsequent recovery efforts underscore its robust operational security. The protocol is not just reacting; it is setting a precedent for how a Bitcoin-native platform responds to external threats. Prioritizing asset security and user confidence is central to Yala’s operations. Users can take comfort in the fact that Yala’s core infrastructure and BTC holdings were unaffected, reinforcing its foundational strength. This proactive approach ensures long-term stability. The upcoming Yala token burn is a testament to this commitment, demonstrating that the protocol is actively working to protect its ecosystem from potential risks and maintain a secure environment for its participants. What Does the Future Hold After the Yala Token Burn? With the unauthorized tokens removed, Yala can focus squarely on its long-term vision for Bitcoin-native liquidity. The successful execution of the Yala token burn will likely restore and even strengthen community trust, demonstrating resilience and accountability in the face of adversity.

It showcases the importance of swift action and transparent communication when security breaches occur. Yala’s journey continues, building upon a foundation of security and innovation in the Bitcoin-native liquidity space. The protocol remains dedicated to advancing its mission and providing a reliable platform for its users. The upcoming Yala token burn is more than just a technical procedure; it’s a testament to the protocol’s dedication to security, transparency, and its community.

Koscom, a prominent financial IT firm, is making a significant move into the digital asset space, particularly with its sights set on a won-denominated Koscom stablecoin . This proactive step signals a strategic shift and highlights the growing importance of digital currencies in traditional finance. What’s Driving Koscom’s Stablecoin Ambition? The Korea Economic Daily recently reported that Koscom has filed five distinct trademark applications related to a won-denominated stablecoin. These applications, including names like “KSDC,” “KRW24,” “KRW365,” “KOSWON,” and “KORWON,” clearly indicate Koscom’s intent to establish a strong presence in this evolving market. It’s a clear signal that they are not just observing but actively preparing to launch their own digital currency offerings. Why is a Koscom stablecoin so important? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or, in this case, the Korean Won. This stability makes them ideal for various financial transactions, remittances, and even as a bridge between traditional finance and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Reorganizing for Digital Dominance: The New Task Force Koscom isn’t just filing trademarks; they’re also restructuring internally to support this ambitious venture. The company has elevated its Future Business Division, transforming it into a dedicated Digital Asset Business Promotion Task Force. This new task force now reports directly to the CEO, underscoring the strategic priority and company-wide commitment to digital assets. This organizational change aims to: Enhance Organizational Standing: Giving the digital asset initiative a direct line to top leadership. Strengthen Company-Wide Momentum: Ensuring resources and focus are aligned across departments. Reflect Growing Importance: Acknowledging the undeniable rise of stablecoins and other digital assets in the global financial arena. This strategic realignment demonstrates Koscom’s dedication to becoming a key player in the digital asset sector, particularly with its potential Koscom stablecoin . Why Are Stablecoins So Important Now? The global financial landscape is rapidly embracing digital innovation, and stablecoins are at the forefront of this transformation.

Accessibility: Stablecoins can provide financial services to a broader population, including those underserved by traditional banks. Innovation: They lay the groundwork for new financial products and services, driving further advancements in fintech. For South Korea, a won-denominated Koscom stablecoin could streamline domestic payments, enhance international trade, and position the nation as a leader in digital finance innovation. What Challenges Might Koscom Face? While the prospects for a Koscom stablecoin are exciting, the path ahead is not without its hurdles. Navigating the regulatory landscape will be paramount. South Korea has been cautious but progressive in its approach to digital assets, and any new stablecoin offering will need to comply with evolving financial regulations, including: Consumer Protection: Ensuring the security and stability of the stablecoin for users. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Implementing robust measures to prevent illicit activities. Market Stability: Addressing concerns about the potential impact on the broader financial system. Furthermore, competition from other stablecoin projects, both domestic and international, will require Koscom to differentiate its offering through unique features, robust technology, and strong partnerships. Koscom’s proactive stance with its trademark applications and internal restructuring signals a strong commitment to pioneering the future of finance in South Korea. The potential for a won-denominated Koscom stablecoin could unlock new efficiencies and opportunities, not just for the company but for the entire Korean economy. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, Koscom’s journey will be one to watch closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. It achieves this by pegging its value to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency (like the Korean Won or US Dollar), a commodity (like gold), or a basket of assets. What is Koscom’s main goal with these stablecoin trademark applications? Koscom’s main goal is to proactively enter the digital asset market, specifically with a won-denominated stablecoin. This move aims to leverage the stability of the Korean Won within the efficiency of blockchain technology for various financial applications. How will Koscom’s new Digital Asset Business Promotion Task Force impact its strategy? The new task force, reporting directly to the CEO, elevates the importance of digital assets within Koscom. It is designed to enhance organizational standing, strengthen company-wide momentum, and accelerate their entry and innovation in the digital asset sector, including the development of a Koscom stablecoin . What are the potential benefits of a won-denominated stablecoin for South Korea? A won-denominated stablecoin could offer benefits such as faster and cheaper domestic and international transactions, increased financial inclusion, and a foundation for innovative new financial products and services within South Korea’s economy. What challenges might Koscom face in launching a stablecoin? Key challenges include navigating complex and evolving regulatory frameworks in South Korea, ensuring robust security and consumer protection, and competing with existing or upcoming stablecoin projects in the market.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with an unprecedented event: a massive SOL accumulation by a suspected institutional investor. This significant move has seen an address withdraw a staggering 413,075 SOL, valued at an incredible $98.4 million, from various exchanges. This substantial withdrawal, reported by Lookonchain via FalconX, signals a potentially bullish outlook for Solana and warrants a closer look into its implications. Unveiling the Mystery: Who’s Behind This Massive SOL Accumulation? Over the past eight hours, a specific address, believed to belong to an institutional investor, executed a series of large withdrawals. This entity utilized FalconX, a prime brokerage platform, to consolidate its holdings. The sheer volume of this SOL accumulation suggests a calculated and strategic investment rather than a casual trade. Such significant movements often indicate high conviction from large players. Institutional investors typically conduct extensive due diligence before deploying such substantial capital. Therefore, this SOL accumulation could reflect a strong belief in Solana’s long-term potential and technological advancements. Why Does SOL Institutional Accumulation Matter? When institutions enter the market with such force, it often sends ripples throughout the entire ecosystem. Institutional SOL accumulation provides a crucial validation for the asset. It suggests that traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the value and stability of decentralized networks like Solana. Increased Confidence: Large investments by institutions can boost retail investor confidence, potentially attracting more capital. Market Stability: Institutional involvement can sometimes lead to greater market stability due to their typically longer investment horizons. Legitimacy: It lends further legitimacy to Solana as a serious contender in the blockchain space, moving beyond speculative retail interest. Demand Signal: A major SOL accumulation clearly signals a strong demand for the asset, which can influence future price action. Navigating the Waters: Potential Impacts of Significant SOL Accumulation This substantial withdrawal is not just a headline; it carries tangible implications for Solana’s market dynamics. Firstly, it reduces the circulating supply of SOL on exchanges, which can create upward price pressure if demand remains consistent or increases. Moreover, the sheer size of the transaction means a significant portion of available SOL has been moved into cold storage or private wallets, away from immediate selling pressure. However, it is also important to consider the potential for volatility. While initial reactions might be bullish, such large holdings can also exert selling pressure if the institution decides to liquidate in the future. Therefore, market participants should remain vigilant and observe subsequent on-chain activities. Price Appreciation Potential: Reduced supply on exchanges often correlates with price increases.

In his weekly “Market Outlook #51,” published on September 15, Nik Patel (@cointradernik) for Ostium Research maps out both long and short triggers around a tight cluster of resistance at $117.5k–$120k and a “line in the sand” support at $112k—frameworks he argues should contain BTC’s path through the FOMC and into quarter-end. How To Trade Bitcoin Into September FOMC Nik’s higher-timeframe read starts with a strong weekly close that reclaimed the August open near $115.3k and, crucially, kept price above $112k. “This is now the line in the sand for short-term bullishness,” he writes, warning that a weekly close back below would reopen the route to July’s local lows around $107k and, in a deeper flush, the $99k swing low. To the upside, he highlights $117.5k as the next inflection; a clean acceptance over $120k would set up a swift run at all-time highs, where $123k is the first major cap on the daily timeframe. Into the event, his directional bias remains conditional rather than dogmatic. On the long side, he favors a liquidity sweep early in the week: “On the long side you want to see a sharp flush lower… into $113.5k, where you could layer bids with invalidation on a daily close below $112k,” aiming for a reaction back to $117.5k (TP1) and $119k (TP2) into the FOMC. Related Reading: Analyst Raises Red Flags On Bitcoin Price: Allegations Of Market Manipulation Conversely, if BTC grinds higher without that flush, his short plan is to “short above $119k pre-FOMC,” then “add… on acceptance back below $117.5k post-FOMC,” with $112k as the first target and scope to trail for lower lows if structure weakens. The trader concedes the next couple of weeks are “a lot more unclear… with many variables,” but his base case still envisions “the second half of Q4 will be very strong.” The setup lands as BTC churns around $115k ahead of the decision—a zone multiple analysts have framed as pivotal. Heading into the weekly close, market commentary stressed that a sustained reclaim of ~$114k is a prerequisite for renewed momentum, with one widely tracked technician arguing, “The goal isn’t for Bitcoin to break $117k… The goal is for Bitcoin to reclaim $114k into support first.” Over the weekend and into Tuesday, BTC’s price action remained pinned in that band, keeping both the upside break toward $119k–$123k and the downside sweep into $113.5k–$112k on the table. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set For Short Squeeze Before Long Trap In October Macro context heightens the stakes. Markets broadly expect the Fed to cut its policy rate by 25 bps on September 17, shifting the target range from 4.50% to 4.25%—a baseline Nik explicitly builds into his calendar. Yet traders are equally focused on Chair Jerome Powell’s guidance and the updated “dot plot,” which will shape the path for additional cuts into year-end. While a cut is priced, the tone—whether the Fed signals a shallow or accelerated easing path—could be the catalyst that resolves BTC’s tight $114k–$119k coil. Positioning provides further texture to Nik’s plan. He flags three-month annualized basis and the split between Bitcoin and altcoin open interest, along with concentrated one-week and one-month liquidation pockets just below spot and above the recent range highs—context for why he prefers either reactive longs on a downside flush or fades into strength near $119k–$120k if derivatives chase the move. The framework leans heavily on acceptance/rejection around well-defined levels rather than attempting to front-run the policy outcome itself. Bottom line: in the Ostium playbook, bulls want a controlled dip that holds $112k on a daily closing basis and then forces a reclaim of $117.5k on the way to $119k–$123k; bears get their best shot if price runs late into $119k–$120k pre-FOMC and then loses $117.5k on the reaction. With BTC glued to the mid-$110ks and the market already bracing for a quarter-point cut, the catalyst may come down to Powell’s nuance. At press time, BTC traded at $115,427.

Symbiotic, Chainlink, And Lombard Team Up On Monday, staking protocol Symbiotic announced its partnership with decentralized oracle provider Chainlink and Bitcoin DeFi protocol Lombard to launch the industry’s first-of-its-kind guarantee layer for cross-chain Bitcoin transfers. The collaboration integrates Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to secure transfers of Lombard Staked Bitcoin (LBTC) across blockchains. Additionally, it introduces two new Symbiotic vaults, backed by a Symbiotic-powered monitoring network that verifies LBTC transfers via CCIP and issues alerts in case of discrepancies, the team detailed. One of the staking vaults will hold up to $100 million of Chainlink’s native token, LINK, while the other will have 20 million of Lombard’s upcoming native token, BARD. Notably, the Bitcoin DeFi protocol recently discussed the launch of its native token on X, stating, “Lombard is redefining how Bitcoin moves. At the core of this movement is BARD.” The protocol revealed that the tokenomics will be shared on September 16, while the airdrop and other participant allocation claims will take place on September 18. The integration will introduce immediate token utility for BARD holders, the announcement explained, by enabling staking into the vault via the Lombard App to secure cross-chain LBTC transfers while earning up to 15% APY. Moreover, Symbiotic’s modular architecture will allow Lombard and partners to dynamically customize protection levels, with value transferred and no disruption to ongoing operations, “positioning this model as foundational infrastructure for the next generation of cross-chain DeFi security.” ‘A New Standard’ For Cross-Chain Bitcoin Transfers According to the statement, the integration will deliver a “dual-layer protection system that scales with demand while setting a new standard for cross-chain Bitcoin derivatives” by combining Symbiotic’s permissionless restaking, CCIP’s modular security, and Lombard’s Bitcoin infrastructure . This collaboration not only reinforces LBTC’s position as the leading institutional-grade, yield-bearing Bitcoin asset trusted by top DeFi protocols, but also establishes a replicable framework for securing broader DeFi infrastructure such as oracles and settlement layers, creating systemic resilience that strengthens with network growth. Misha Putiatin, Symbiotic’s co-founder, affirmed that the protocol “turns passive crypto assets into modular, active security infrastructure,” adding that “Integrating our restaking framework with Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain LBTC transfers showcases how decentralized collateral can be deployed quickly and permissionlessly to reinforce cross-chain value flows and deliver tangible benefits to end users.” Meanwhile, Jacob Phillips, Lombard’s Co-founder, highlighted that LBTC is “a chain asset, meeting demand across networks rather than being confined to one.” He noted that holders seek the freedom to move their Bitcoin wherever the best opportunities are, but without compromising security. To address that, Phillips explained that “pairing CCIP’s modular architecture with Symbiotic’s restaked collateral gives our community stronger economic guarantees through staking. Each BARD staked reinforces the robustness of LBTC, aligning incentives and strengthening the integrity of our interoperability stack.”",Crypto News|bard|Bitcoin Transfers|btc|BTCUSDT|chainlink|cross-chain Bitcoin transfers|DeFi Bitcoin Protocol|Guarantee layer|LBTC|LINK|Lombard|Staking protocol|Symbiotic,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|LINK|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 02:00:40

This isn’t just another discussion; it’s a significant opportunity for the industry to directly engage with lawmakers shaping its future. Why This US Senate Crypto Meeting Holds Immense Importance Tomorrow morning, as reported by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, citing multiple sources, this high-stakes US Senate crypto meeting will commence. It brings together key players from both sides: innovative crypto executives and influential U.S. senators. The stakes are incredibly high, as the outcomes could dictate the regulatory landscape for digital assets for years to come. For too long, the crypto industry has grappled with regulatory uncertainty. Different agencies often have conflicting views, leading to a patchwork of rules that makes innovation and compliance challenging. This direct engagement offers a chance for clarity and a more unified approach. Key Discussion Points at the US Senate Crypto Meeting The agenda for this pivotal US Senate crypto meeting is packed with critical topics that have long been at the forefront of regulatory debates. These discussions are expected to delve into the fundamental nature of digital assets and how they should be classified under existing law. Classifying Securities and Commodities: A major point of contention has been whether specific cryptocurrencies should be treated as securities, subject to SEC oversight, or as commodities, falling under the CFTC’s purview. Clear definitions are essential for market participants. The Treatment of DeFi: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) presents a unique challenge due to its permissionless and often anonymous nature. Lawmakers are keen to understand how to regulate DeFi to protect consumers without stifling its innovative potential. Other Key Issues: Broader discussions will likely include stablecoin regulation, anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, and consumer protection frameworks. These conversations are not merely academic; they have real-world implications for how crypto businesses operate, how investors participate, and how the U.S. positions itself as a leader in financial innovation. Challenges and Opportunities Arising from the US Senate Crypto Meeting While the prospect of clearer regulation is exciting, this US Senate crypto meeting also highlights significant challenges. The crypto industry often operates on principles of decentralization and open access, which can clash with traditional regulatory models designed for centralized financial institutions. Challenges: Divergent Perspectives: Bridging the gap between the rapid pace of technological innovation and the often slow, deliberate process of legislative action is a monumental task. Risk of Over-Regulation: There is always a concern that overly stringent regulations could stifle innovation, pushing development offshore and limiting the U.S.’s competitive edge in the digital asset space. Opportunities: Enhanced Consumer Protection: A well-defined regulatory framework can build trust among mainstream investors, encouraging wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Market Stability: Clear rules can lead to more stable markets, attracting institutional capital and fostering greater confidence in the asset class. Innovation with Guardrails: Thoughtful regulation can provide the necessary guardrails for innovation to flourish responsibly, ensuring that new technologies serve the public good. The dialogue at this meeting is crucial for finding a balanced approach that protects consumers and financial stability while also fostering innovation. What’s Next After the US Senate Crypto Meeting? The immediate outcome of this US Senate crypto meeting might not be new legislation, but rather a deeper understanding and a pathway forward. These discussions are often the first step in a longer process of policy formulation. We can expect to see further hearings, white papers, and potentially draft legislation emerging in the coming months. For crypto firms, the actionable insight is clear: continued engagement with policymakers is vital. Staying informed and prepared for potential regulatory shifts will be key to navigating the evolving landscape. For investors, these developments signal a maturing industry, albeit one still finding its footing within established financial systems. This engagement between crypto leaders and U.S. senators is a testament to the growing influence and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. The outcomes of this US Senate crypto meeting will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of the industry, setting precedents for how innovation and regulation can coexist. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary purpose of the US Senate crypto meeting?

Investors in US spot ETH ETFs have just witnessed a notable shift, as these funds recorded net outflows, breaking a five-day streak of positive inflows. This sudden reversal has caught the attention of many, prompting questions about what might be driving this change and what it could mean for the broader Ethereum market. What Caused the Sudden Shift in US Spot ETH ETFs ? On September 16, a significant change occurred for US spot ETH ETFs . These investment vehicles collectively saw $61.84 million in net outflows. This figure, equivalent to approximately 85.4 billion Korean Won, marks a clear pivot from the trend observed over the preceding five trading days, which had all reported net inflows. The data, compiled by Trader T, highlights that not all funds experienced the same fate. The majority of the outflows were concentrated in two major players: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund experienced substantial outflows totaling $20.44 million. Fidelity’s FETH: Even larger outflows were recorded here, amounting to $48.15 million. Interestingly, one fund managed to buck the trend. Bitwise’s ETHW actually recorded net inflows, adding $6.75 million to its holdings on the same day. This mixed performance suggests a nuanced market environment rather than a uniform bearish sentiment across all US spot ETH ETFs . Why Do US Spot ETH ETFs Outflows Matter? The shift from inflows to outflows in US spot ETH ETFs is more than just a daily statistic; it can signal evolving investor sentiment. For five consecutive days, capital had been flowing into these Ethereum-backed exchange-traded funds, indicating growing institutional and retail interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. However, this recent outflow could suggest several possibilities: Profit-Taking: After a period of potential price appreciation, some investors might be cashing out to secure profits. Market Reassessment: Investors might be re-evaluating their positions in response to broader economic news, regulatory updates, or changes in the overall crypto market outlook. Short-Term Volatility: It could simply be a natural fluctuation in a highly dynamic market, where daily flows can swing significantly based on various factors. Understanding these movements is crucial because ETFs often act as a barometer for institutional adoption and broader market confidence. When major funds like BlackRock and Fidelity see outflows, it can influence market perception, even if it’s a short-term phenomenon. Navigating the Volatility: Insights for US Spot ETH ETFs Investors For those invested in or considering US spot ETH ETFs , such daily fluctuations are a reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. While a single day of outflows doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend, it does highlight the importance of staying informed and adopting a strategic approach. What should investors consider in light of these developments? Long-Term Perspective: Daily flows can be noisy. A long-term investment thesis for Ethereum and its ecosystem should ideally not be swayed by short-term movements. Diversification: As with any investment, diversifying your portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with specific assets or funds. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on broader market news, macroeconomic indicators, and regulatory changes that could impact the cryptocurrency space and, by extension, US spot ETH ETFs . The fact that Bitwise’s ETHW still saw inflows suggests that investor sentiment isn’t uniformly negative. Some investors might be shifting funds between different ETF providers, or new capital is entering certain funds while existing capital exits others. This dynamic interplay is typical of maturing markets. The recent net outflows from US spot ETH ETFs , ending a positive five-day streak, serve as a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH experienced significant withdrawals, Bitwise’s ETHW managed to attract new capital. This mixed picture underscores that market sentiment is complex and influenced by various factors, from profit-taking to broader economic considerations. For investors, these movements highlight the importance of a well-informed, long-term strategy, rather than reacting to every daily fluctuation. The journey of institutional adoption for Ethereum is still unfolding, and these ETFs will continue to be a key indicator of its progress. Frequently Asked Questions About US Spot ETH ETFs Here are some common questions regarding the recent performance and broader implications of US spot ETH ETFs. Q: What is a US spot ETH ETF? A: A US spot ETH ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Q: Why did US spot ETH ETFs see outflows after five days of inflows? A: The shift to outflows on September 16 could be due to several factors, including investors taking profits after a period of positive performance, a broader market reassessment influenced by economic news, or simply short-term market volatility. It indicates a change in immediate investor sentiment. Q: How do these outflows impact the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A: While direct causation is complex, significant outflows from US spot ETH ETFs can contribute to negative market sentiment, potentially putting downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. However, the overall impact depends on many other market factors and the scale of the outflows relative to the total market cap. Q: Are all US spot ETH ETFs experiencing the same trend? A: Not necessarily. As seen on September 16, while BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH experienced outflows, Bitwise’s ETHW recorded net inflows. This suggests that investor activity can vary across different funds, possibly due to fund-specific strategies, fees, or investor preferences. Q: Should investors be concerned about these outflows? A: A single day of outflows doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term problem. Investors should view these movements within a broader context, considering their own investment goals and risk tolerance. It’s crucial to focus on long-term trends and fundamental analysis rather than reacting to daily fluctuations. Found this analysis of US spot ETH ETFs insightful?

51853108,https://invezz.com/?p=2884808,1758075973,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Best crypto that should be in your portfolio, a utility token to explode 300x faster than SHIB did in 2021",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/17/best-crypto-that-should-be-in-your-portfolio-a-utility-token-to-explode-300x-faster-than-shib-did-in-2021/,"When meme coins were all the rage in 2021, SHIB’s meteoric rise, which saw it rise more than 300 times in only a few months, was one of the most talked-about tales. That surge was all hype, thanks to memes and commotion on social media. But the surge didn’t have any genuine use behind it, which is why traders frequently wonder what is going on with crypto now that might lead to such big gains, but with real fundamentals. Analysts say that the solution clearly goes to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility token that is building up to provide a comparable multiplier but with better mechanisms, more reasons to use it, and more real-world use. From meme hype to utility growth The SHIB rally in 2021 was a strange event that was fueled by speculation. Investors got in because they thought other people would, but there were no built-in ways to keep demand going for a long time, so it was just a one-time thing on crypto charts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is building its token on an ecosystem that is meant to keep demand high. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized stablecoin that is linked to $1 at its core. This stablecoin will only be made from assets that are overcollateralized, like ETH, SOL, or AVAX. There will be rigorous regulations for issuing it, and accounts will be capped, and smart contracts will be used to enforce them. Decentralized governance will set the borrowing costs, which will change automatically to keep the peg stable. Liquidations will happen automatically, which will keep both lenders and borrowers secure, even if the price of crypto crashes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) loans on top of this stablecoin technology. People will be able to borrow stablecoins against meme tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. Others will be able to get P2C loans against blue-chip tokens and stablecoins. This makes it appealing to a wide range of people, bringing together both serious and speculative investors into one ecosystem. The disparity in results is obvious when you look at instances of investors. Someone who took part in Phase 1 and put up $5,000 when MUTM was worth $0.01 got 500,000 tokens. That bag is worth $17,500 by Phase 6, when the token is worth $0.035. That’s 3.5X what it was worth before the platform was began. If you follow that same path along the 300x path that experts expect, you will get $1.5 million. This shows how a utility-driven token can beat meme currency hype by combining genuine usage with growth potential. The goal of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is to be efficient as well. Transactions will be quicker and cheaper with Layer-2 integration than with typical Layer-1 blockchains. This will make it more appealing for use in the real world. When it first comes out, a beta version of the loan and stablecoin minting platform will already be active, which will create demand for MUTM right away as people start testing it. Presale momentum and credibility anchors The presale stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving along quickly. Phase 6 is now open, and tokens cost $0.035 each. More than $15.85 million has already been raised, and 40% of the supply has been sold to more than 16,350 investors. The price will go up by 15% to $0.040 once Phase 7 starts. This means that this is the last chance for investors to buy tokens at a discount before they are listed. These reduced entry locations provide traders the best opportunity to make money on crypto investments. The strategy for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stresses trust and responsibility. CertiK did an outside audit of the project and gave it a score of 90.00 on Token Scan and 79.00 on Skynet, which shows that the smart contracts are secure and the ecosystem is strong. There is a live bug bounty program with incentives ranging from $200 for minor bugs to $2,000 for major bugs. This ensures that security improvements will continue. In addition to this, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on that rewards people for becoming involved in the community and spreading the word. Phase 4 of the roadmap will provide multi-chain growth, which will turn Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into a cross-network DeFi ecosystem. Along with the token listing, a beta version of the platform will be released. This will provide rapid pressure on early users to employ the borrowing, lending, and stablecoin minting features. Final words SHIB’s rise in 2021 demonstrated how quickly retail speculation can impact markets, but it didn’t really do anything useful. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering both a token linked to a real DeFi ecosystem and a development path that experts think will lead to 300X quicker adoption than SHIB’s hype run. MUTM is pitching itself as the greatest cryptocurrency to add to your portfolio this year. It has already doubled the profits of early investors, has innovative lending mechanisms, and a solid roadmap supported by audits and incentives. If you’re trying to figure out where the next big wave in crypto will come from, don’t look at meme coins. Look at utility tokens that are based on adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is that coin. It has the potential for huge growth and a way to be around for a long time.

It’s the foundation of decentralized finance, NFTs, tokenization, and Layer 2 scaling solutions. But beyond the headlines and price charts, there are elements of Ethereum’s story that most investors overlook. These details explain why ETH continues to dominate attention heading into the next bull market, and why it remains a pillar of the digital asset ecosystem. At the same time, history shows that every bull run produces new stars alongside established giants. Just as Ethereum once emerged from obscurity to define an era, new projects are positioning themselves to do the same today. One name leading that charge is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a presale whose forecasts are drawing comparisons to early ETH and even PEPE’s meteoric rise. With projections of 15,500% ROI , it is being hailed as one of the most explosive early-stage breakouts in modern crypto history. Fact 1: Ethereum wasn’t always meant to be money Unlike Bitcoin, which was created purely as digital cash, Ethereum began life as a world computer , a programmable blockchain for decentralized applications. Vitalik Buterin and the early team weren’t focused on making ETH a currency, but on enabling smart contracts and self-executing code. This distinction explains why Ethereum evolved into the bedrock of DeFi and NFTs, while Bitcoin stayed closer to its “digital gold” narrative. Fact 2: The Ethereum Foundation holds less ETH than you think Despite its central role in Ethereum’s development, the Ethereum Foundation controls less than 0.3% of all ETH in circulation . That’s far less than many assume, reflecting a deliberate effort to keep the ecosystem decentralized. Most of Ethereum’s supply is distributed across exchanges, long-term holders, staking pools, and DeFi protocols. This distribution helps reduce concentration risks and gives the network resilience that extends beyond any single entity. Fact 3: Ethereum dominates tokenization experiments While headlines focus on NFTs and DeFi, Ethereum has quietly become the backbone of real-world asset tokenization . From bonds and treasuries to real estate and commodities, financial giants are piloting projects that run on Ethereum. BlackRock’s foray into tokenized funds, for example, leverages Ethereum infrastructure. This dominance positions ETH as more than just a crypto asset, it’s becoming part of global financial plumbing. Ethereum’s history shows how transformative early entries can be. Investors who backed ETH in its infancy saw astronomical returns as it evolved into a pillar of crypto. Today, some analysts argue MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a similar asymmetry. Forecasts of 15,500% ROI have already put it in a league of its own. Unlike many presales, it has legitimacy through HashEx and CertiK audits , scarcity-driven tokenomics, and viral cultural branding. Demand is so intense that presale allocations are selling out within hours. The PATRIOT50X bonus code is adding fuel, giving early participants 50% more tokens and deepening the sense of urgency. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its dual-threat identity : meme energy that spreads fast across Telegram and X, paired with smart tokenomics designed to sustain momentum. For traders who missed early ETH or PEPE, the narrative is clear, this feels like a second-chance lottery ticket in the middle of a bull market. The fact that it’s even being compared to institutional favorites is creating a powerful narrative that this presale could defy every expectation. Fact 4: Ethereum’s energy use dropped by 99% The shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake during the 2022 Merge was one of the biggest technical upgrades in blockchain history. The result was a 99% reduction in energy consumption , instantly changing Ethereum’s environmental footprint. This move also positioned ETH more favorably with regulators and institutions increasingly sensitive to sustainability metrics. It is no exaggeration to say that the Merge preserved Ethereum’s long-term viability in an ESG-focused financial landscape. Fact 5: ETH supply can actually shrink Unlike Bitcoin’s strictly capped 21 million coins, Ethereum’s supply is dynamic. With EIP-1559 (implemented in 2021), every transaction burns a portion of ETH. Combined with proof-of-stake rewards, this mechanism means Ethereum can sometimes experience net negative issuance , in other words, its supply can contract over time. This “ultrasound money” narrative is one reason analysts remain bullish on ETH’s long-term price trajectory. Why timing matters now The crypto market is in a delicate balance. Bitcoin is consolidating, Ethereum is quietly strengthening its fundamentals, and liquidity expectations are rising as central banks prepare to ease policy. These are the conditions that often set the stage for altcoin breakouts. In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum is timely. It is capturing the exact moment when retail investors are hunting for high-upside plays, while whales are allocating to presales with structural credibility. This combination of timing, scarcity, and legitimacy explains why so many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the defining presale of 2025. Conclusion Ethereum remains the backbone of the crypto ecosystem, with hidden facts that highlight its strength: a programmable origin story, decentralized supply, massive energy savings, potential for deflation, and leadership in tokenization. But every bull cycle also brings new names into the spotlight. Right now, that spotlight is firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE . With forecasts of 15,500% ROI , a shrinking presale supply, and cultural branding that spreads like wildfire, it has already separated itself from the crowd. For traders looking to combine the lessons of Ethereum’s early days with the urgency of today’s market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be more than a presale, it could be the breakout story of the cycle.

Whales and institutions tend to stick with well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but regular investors looking for big gains are starting to look elsewhere. Safe options are all over the news, but there are also chances with asymmetric upside that are hidden among the rising prices of cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most talked-about names right now. It’s a DeFi project that experts think will provide them a 250x return on their investment. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional trust, retail limits People still think of Bitcoin (BTC) as the main currency in the crypto realm. Whales are buying more BTC to protect themselves from traditional markets. The market trusts it so highly that it is worth $4.0 trillion. It is also the most stable asset for anyone who wants to invest in crypto because it is like digital gold. This reliability is good for people who want to hang on to their investments for a long time, but it’s not good for retail investors who want to make a lot of money quickly. Most crypto predictions say that Bitcoin (BTC) will rise by 2x to 3x, which is a lot for its market size. That is strong by traditional measures, but when you look at crypto charts with tokens that are worth double or triple digits, Bitcoin (BTC) doesn’t have much room to grow. Institutions will still like BTC, but its ceiling makes it less appealing to individual investors with ambitious plans. Ethereum (ETH): DeFi backbone, but growth constrained Ethereum (ETH) is just as important. It has formed the backbone of DeFi, smart contracts, and tokenization projects run by big institutions. With a market valuation of more than $540 billion, it stands for confidence and stability in the crypto ecosystem as a whole. ETH is more than simply a money; it’s the base for many apps that are created on it. But this same strength makes it hard for it to give very high returns. Ethereum (ETH) will still be the most important cryptocurrency for investors, but its current value means that a 3x to 4x growth is the most likely outcome. That makes ETH popular with institutions, but it can’t give the uneven growth that lesser altcoins can. For individual investors, ETH’s story is one of dependability, not quick growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The altcoin for asymmetric growth This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. MUTM is still in presale, unlike BTC or ETH. This gives investors the option to buy into a project with huge potential before it becomes live on exchanges. The price is now $0.035 in Phase 6. 40% of the tokens have already been sold, $15.85 million has been raised, and more than 16,350 people are holding them. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% increase that makes people who are thinking about investing in crypto right now feel like they need to act quickly. MUTM is different from other altcoins that are just for speculation because it has real-world uses. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a loan and borrowing system that lets people get cash without having to liquidate their possessions. For instance, an investor who puts $10,000 worth of ETH into a P2C lending account can borrow $5,000 in USDC at a 50% loan-to-value ratio. This lets them preserve their ETH exposure while still getting access to cash. In P2P lending, you can even employ assets like DOGE or PEPE. This makes lending markets riskier while keeping the system safe. Staking mtTokens is another important feature. People who stake mtTokens will get MUTM rewards through a system that lets them buy and sell them. The platform will utilize the money it makes to purchase back MUTM tokens from the market and provide them to people who invest them. This keeps the buy side busy all the time and ties the performance of the platform directly to the rewards for investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have an even bigger edge if it runs on Layer-2. Lower transaction prices and faster speeds will make more people want to utilize the service, which will lead to more overall value locked. Every new transaction, whether it’s a loan, a repayment, or a liquidation, makes money that goes into the MUTM ecosystem. The roadmap for the future is just as big. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its beta version and offer it on exchanges. It will also work to get its stablecoin launched at the time of exchange listing. The goal of each milestone is to encourage people to use the service and reward those who use it for a long time. Conclusion You can already see the upside. In Phase 1, a $10,000 entry is worth $35,000 today in Phase 6. At $2 per token, that same amount of money will be worth $570,000, and at $3, it will be worth $855,000. This is exactly why experts say that MUTM has the potential for a 250x return on investment (ROI), which is not attainable with BTC or ETH at their current prices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the kind of opportunity that can make early investors very rich. Whales and banks still trust Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but retail investors seeking for the next big thing will find MUTM to be the best solution to the issue of what are the best cryptos to buy right now.

ETH is the foundation of decentralized apps, and SOL is known for being fast and able to grow. Both have established themselves as leaders in their fields, but their development has slowed down since their early years. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. It’s a penny altcoin that is still in presale and was created with the same goal of getting people to use it in the real world. Analysts think that it has the momentum and structure to provide investors a speedy 23x return on investment. This mix of usefulness and huge potential makes it stand out from other large-cap possibilities for traders looking at the crypto fear and greed index. Building utility with speed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) doesn’t want to compete with ETH or SOL on heritage. Instead, it is working on a new system where utility is directly tied to token demand and investor incentives. It has a stablecoin that is worth $1 and can only be created using assets that are worth more than they are worth, including ETH, SOL, and AVAX. Unlike initiatives that are based on hype, issuance is tightly managed by authorized accounts with set restrictions. This keeps things stable and secure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized governance will set borrowing rates and change them as needed to maintain crypto values in line with the peg. Liquidation procedures will immediately kick in to defend the system, keeping both lenders and borrowers safe. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers more than just collateralized lending. It also offers P2C lending, which lets users borrow stablecoins against blue-chip tokens and stablecoins themselves, as well as P2P financing for meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. This makes it easier for a lot of different types of users, from high-cap traders to speculative groups, to become involved. This increases the flow of liquidity in the ecosystem. A sample of an early Phase 5 investor illustrates how rapidly profits are growing. A $10,000 investment in crypto at $0.03 got you 330,000 tokens. In Phase 6, those tokens are valued $11,700, which is already a 16% increase before they ever hit the markets. That identical bag will increase to more than $230,000 if the estimated 23x ROI projection holds true. Neither ETH nor SOL can now deliver this kind of growth since their markets are already well-established. This is sped up even more by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s staking strategy. People who own mtTokens will be able to stake them in certain contracts and get MUTM payouts. The platform will utilize the money it makes to purchase back MUTM tokens on the open market, and the benefits will go straight to mtToken stakers. This cycle of buying and distributing puts ongoing pressure on buyers and rewards long-term users. Presale momentum, risk controls, and trust anchors The buzz surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale indicates how rapidly people are getting on board. Phase 6 is now live at $0.035. It has raised more than $15.85 million, sold more than 40% of its tokens, and has more than 16,350 holders. The presale price will go up 15% in Phase 7 to $0.040, which shows how important it is for investors to act quickly if they want to get in before the discount window expires. For anybody keeping an eye on crypto investing trends, getting in early at this point gives you the best chance to make big profits before the coins are listed on exchanges. The project’s comprehensive risk management structure makes this momentum even stronger. Stable interest rates will be dynamically managed to maintain the $1 peg. Collateral efficiency ensures that positions are overcollateralized, and limited collateralization lowers systemic risk. Liquidation triggers are automatic; thus, they work even in unstable markets. These structural features make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reliable for big investors while still giving penny coin returns. From the beginning, credibility has also been a big issue. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was audited by CertiK and got a score of 90.00 on Token Scan and 79.00 on Skynet, which are both good signs of security. A $50,000 bug bounty program has been set up to back this up. Rewards range from $200 for small bugs to $2,000 for major bugs. There is also a $100,000 giveaway going on right now, which is raising awareness and encouraging more people to become involved in the community during the presale phase. Conclusion ETH and SOL laid the groundwork for blockchain adoption based on usefulness. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that a new cent token can do the same thing, but much quicker. Stablecoin-backed lending, P2C and P2P mechanisms, mtToken staking and buybacks, and a presale that has already given double-digit profits are all examples of how it is producing both practical application and rapid development. MUTM is a unique opportunity for traders looking for the next big thing since it has both usefulness and a clear 23x ROI path. ETH and SOL showed what utility currencies can do. MUTM is the finest new crypto investment opportunity right now since it combines usefulness and speed in the crypto pricing tale.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-investors-xrp-looks-strong-for-the-day-heres-why/,"Crypto enthusiast Gonzo shared an update on XRP’s technical setup, noting that the asset displayed strength during the day’s trading. In his words, “$XRP looks strong for the day. It broke the trend line with a re-test of the outside, while holding the 50% level and holding the 50 SMA.” His post was accompanied by a chart illustrating the recent price action, trend structure, and Fibonacci retracement levels. $XRP looks strong for the day. It broke the trend line with a re-test of the outside, while holding the 50% level and holding the 50 SMA. pic.twitter.com/IhJY0CRsMS — Gonzo (@gonzo_3t) September 16, 2025 Breakout and Re-Test of the Trend Line The chart shows that XRP is trading just above the $3.00 level, closing near $3.0454 at the time of capture. A descending trend line that had contained price action for several weeks was recently broken, with XRP moving above it and then returning to re-test the breakout area. This re-test was held, which is the basis for Gonzo’s description of strength. Fibonacci Levels and the 50 SMA as Support In addition to the breakout, the chart highlights the importance of the 50% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). The 50% retracement is placed at $2.9415, while the 0.382 level sits just above at $2.9993. Both of these align with the moving average zone, providing a technical support range between $2.94 and $3.00. Gonzo pointed out that XRP held this zone while maintaining support on the 50 SMA, adding weight to the view that the breakout has been confirmed. Resistance and Support Levels Ahead Upside levels visible on the chart include resistance near $3.1865, with a further marker positioned higher at $3.3924. On the downside, the chart identifies a lower support zone around $2.6965. These price points indicate the next technical areas traders may watch should XRP either extend its move upward or face renewed selling pressure.

The emphasis is on the combination of the trend line break, the re-test that successfully held, and the continued support provided by the Fibonacci levels and the moving average. XRP’s price structure presently reflects a technical recovery from earlier declines, with the $3.00 zone acting as the immediate reference point for strength. Gonzo’s update suggests that as long as this zone remains intact, the outlook for the day favors stability above the breakout level, with attention shifting to resistance levels above.

The digital asset has officially reclaimed its coveted position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, successfully surpassing Solana (SOL). This dynamic shift highlights the intense competition and constant flux characterizing the top tiers of the crypto world, where the BNB market cap continues to be a key indicator of its strength. Understanding the Recent BNB Market Cap Shift The race for the fifth spot has been particularly captivating this month, with BNB and Solana frequently exchanging positions. This ongoing rivalry keeps investors and enthusiasts on the edge of their seats, watching every movement. According to recent data from CoinMarketCap, the BNB market cap impressively reached approximately $133.4 billion. This figure comfortably placed it ahead of Solana’s market capitalization, which stood at around $128.3 billion. Such significant numbers underscore the immense value and investor confidence associated with these leading digital assets. Currently, BNB is trading at $958.84, reflecting a robust 4.02% increase. In contrast, Solana is priced at $236.41, showing a more modest 0.84% gain. These price movements are crucial in determining the overall BNB market cap and its competitive standing. What’s Driving the BNB Market Cap Momentum? Several factors likely contribute to BNB’s recent surge and its ability to reclaim a higher ranking. The BNB Chain ecosystem continues to expand, fostering new decentralized applications (dApps) and projects that drive demand for the native token. Furthermore, investor sentiment often plays a significant role in market movements. An overseas media outlet recently reported that the return of Binance co-founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), appears to be imminent. While the exact timing and nature of his return are speculative, such news can generate considerable buzz and positively influence the perception of BNB, potentially boosting the BNB market cap . The utility of BNB within the Binance ecosystem, including trading fee discounts, participation in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and use in various DeFi protocols, consistently adds to its value proposition. This intrinsic utility provides a strong foundation for its market performance. BNB vs. Solana: A Dynamic Rivalry in Market Cap The competition between BNB and Solana is more than just a battle for market capitalization; it represents a clash of innovative blockchain ecosystems. Both platforms offer distinct advantages and attract different segments of the crypto community. BNB Chain: Known for its high transaction throughput and lower fees, it appeals to a broad base of users and developers. Its strong connection to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, provides unparalleled liquidity and user access. Solana: Celebrated for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and scalability, Solana has carved out a niche, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, often referred to as an ‘Ethereum killer.’ This back-and-forth in the rankings demonstrates the dynamic nature of the crypto market. It also highlights how quickly fortunes can change based on development updates, investor sentiment, and broader market trends affecting the BNB market cap and Solana’s standing. Navigating the Volatility: What Investors Should Consider For investors, understanding these market dynamics is paramount. While BNB’s recent performance is impressive, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile. Rankings can shift, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. It is always advisable to conduct thorough research and consider various factors beyond just market cap. Look into the project’s fundamentals, its development roadmap, community support, and the overall macroeconomic environment. Diversification across different assets can also help mitigate risks in such a fast-moving space. The continuous evolution of the BNB market cap and other major cryptocurrencies requires a well-informed and cautious approach. BNB’s remarkable surge to reclaim the fifth spot by market capitalization over Solana underscores its enduring strength and the vibrant, competitive spirit of the crypto market. While the immediate catalyst appears to be strong investor interest and possibly news surrounding Changpeng Zhao, the underlying utility and ecosystem growth of BNB Chain are fundamental to its success. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the race among top digital assets promises to remain an exciting spectacle for all involved. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is market capitalization in cryptocurrency? A: Market capitalization, or market cap, is the total value of all coins that have been mined or are in circulation. It’s calculated by multiplying the current price of a single coin by the total number of coins in circulation. It helps gauge an asset’s size and relative dominance. Q2: Why is the BNB market cap significant? A: The BNB market cap is significant because it reflects the overall value and investor confidence in the BNB ecosystem. A higher market cap typically indicates greater stability, liquidity, and broader adoption of the token and its underlying blockchain. Q3: What are the main differences between BNB and Solana? A: BNB (Binance Coin) is the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain, closely tied to the Binance exchange, offering utility for trading fees, staking, and dApps. Solana is a separate blockchain known for its high transaction speeds and scalability, popular for DeFi and NFTs. Q4: How does news about Changpeng Zhao (CZ) affect BNB? A: As the co-founder and former CEO of Binance, CZ’s activities and potential return can significantly influence investor sentiment towards Binance and, by extension, BNB. Positive news or developments related to him often lead to increased interest and a potential boost in the BNB market cap . Q5: Will BNB maintain its 5th market cap ranking? A: The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic. While BNB has reclaimed its position, rankings are fluid. Continuous development, market trends, and investor sentiment will determine if BNB can maintain its spot or if Solana, or another asset, will challenge it again.

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to make headlines, yet volatility around key price levels is seeing traders seek alternatives. Newer projects like Remittix, meanwhile, are attracting attention for their blend of utility, security and rapid presale momentum. The gap between legacy giants and disruptive newcomers opens the door to what could be a trend-setting narrative in 2025. Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Trends and Market Shifts The Bitcoin Price recently made an attempt at a major resistance level at $116,000 prior to rejection, trading at $114,703.81, 0.71% lower on the day. Ethereum also followed lower, dropping to $4,495.08, 2.13% lower on the day. Trading volumes for both assets, in spite of the drops, remain high, reflecting strong investor interest. The rejection of Bitcoin at resistance suggests near-term selling pressure, while Ethereum whales moving funds between wallets suggest a shift in strategy, possibly into promising presales like Remittix. Remittix: Presale That Is Luring Ethereum Whales Remittix (RTX) is a cross-chain DeFi solution for global remittances. The $0.1080 token has already raised $25,8 million and sold over 664 million tokens in presale. Remittix’s selling point is its focus on real-world use cases: direct crypto-to-bank transfer, decentralized exchange integration and wallet features currently in beta testing. The team has revealed upcoming listings on BitMart and LBANK, large centralised exchanges that will provide instant liquidity. The roadmap has placed RTX among the best crypto presale 2025 potentials, with Ethereum investors turning to early stage crypto investments. Learn more at Remittix.io. Security, Community and Growth One of the biggest confidence boosters was when Remittix team got verified by CertiK and ranked #1 pre-launch token on CertiK Skynet. The ranking demonstrates the security and transparency of the project something that is typically missing in the launch of new crypto tokens. Alongside its technical development, Remittix has also initiated a $250,000 giveaway and 15% USDT referral program, allowing early users to earn while they spur adoption. All these, along with strong presale momentum, are pointers to why Remittix is rapidly becoming one of the fastest growing crypto 2025 tokens. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction $25,8 Million+ raised and 664 Million+ tokens sold Verified by CertiK, #1 ranked pre-launch project Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBANK Real-world focus on crypto-to-bank payments Looking Ahead As Bitcoin Price struggles at resistance and Ethereum whales diversify, the focus on up-and-coming crypto projects intensifies. Remittix stands out not just as a top crypto under $1, but as a crypto solving real-world problems with transparent FX conversions, low fees and cross-chain capabilities.

Bitcoin Bull Score Index Is Back In Neutral Region In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno has talked about the latest trend in the analytics firm’s Bull Score Index. This indicator basically tells us about which phase of the market Bitcoin is in right now. The index combines the data of several key on-chain metrics to determine its value. Some of these indicators include the Market Value to Realized Cap (MVRV) Ratio, keeping track of average investor profitability on the network, and the Stablecoin Liquidity, measuring the amount of capital stored in the form of fiat-tied tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows In Last 1.5 Years Surpassed First 15 Years Combined: Data When the Bull Score Index has a value of 60 or higher, it means the majority of the underlying metrics are currently giving a bullish signal. On the other hand, the metric’s value being 40 or lower implies BTC is in a bear phase according to its indicators. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Bull Score Index over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Bull Score Index was sitting at a low of just 20 four days ago, but since then, its value has witnessed a sharp climb to the 50 level. This means that on-chain metrics are signaling neutral market conditions for the asset now. This shift comes just as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. BTC price itself has taken to sideways movement ahead of it, indicating that the market is divided about the event’s outcome. Analytics firm Santiment has shared in an X post about how social media users are reacting to the meeting. In the chart, Santiment has attached the data of the “Positive/Negative Sentiment,” an indicator that compares the bullish and bearish posts related to Bitcoin that are appearing on the major social media platforms. This metric has surged recently and hit the 1.77 mark, suggesting that there are 1.77 positive comments being made for every negative comment related to the cryptocurrency. This is the most bullish that retail traders have been on social media in around 10 weeks.

Upcoming XRP and Dogecoin ETFs Boost Optimism The XRP ETF (ticker: XRPR) and Dogecoin ETF (ticker: DOJE) are expected to debut within days, with Dogecoin’s listing scheduled for Thursday and XRP’s by Friday. This will be the first U.S. ETF for Dogecoin, providing traditional investors with access to the meme coin without the need for wallets or direct token ownership. For XRP, the launch signifies a milestone as it becomes the first major altcoin ETF after Ethereum to gain entry into U.S. markets. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas highlighted that the XRP fund will combine direct holdings of the token with exposure to other global spot ETFs. Meanwhile, James Seyffart noted that over 90 additional crypto ETF applications are currently awaiting SEC review, including those tied to Litecoin and Avalanche. What It Means for Altcoin Investors The arrival of XRP and Dogecoin ETFs signals growing institutional acceptance of altcoins, moving beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts believe these products could attract billions in inflows from retirement funds, brokerage platforms, and traditional investment accounts. For Dogecoin , the ETF marks a leap from meme culture into mainstream finance. Already, DOGE has seen price momentum around $0.26–$0.28, with whales accumulating heavily ahead of the launch. Some technical analysts argue Dogecoin is finalizing a bullish chart pattern that could push its price toward $0.35, $0.45, and even $1 if momentum holds. XRP , on the other hand, is positioned as a utility-driven altcoin with strong liquidity. Its ETF could accelerate inflows into Ripple’s ecosystem, especially if paired with dovish global monetary policies in the coming weeks. Broader Market Impact The timing of these ETF launches coincides with key central bank meetings. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, while the Bank of England and Bank of Japan will announce decisions within days. Analysts suggest that if multiple central banks coordinate easing, the result could spark a mega altseason, driving Bitcoin past $120,000 and Ethereum beyond resistance levels. For investors, the message is clear: XRP and Dogecoin ETFs are not just symbolic victories; they could transform altcoin adoption in traditional finance. Now we wait and see what may unfold over the next ten days.

This move will advance Meta’s augmented reality plans while the company is under scrutiny over social media protections for children. At the two-day event at Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Zuckerberg plans to introduce the company’s first commercially viable eyewear with a screen. Analysts expect the device to debut for about 800 US dollars. Internally, the project has been known as “Hypernova,” and the product is expected to reach the market as “Celeste.” The launch would extend Meta’s bid to keep pace in AI-powered hardware against rivals like OpenAI and Alphabet’s Google, though analysts say the price could weigh on demand. The glasses are expected to be far less advanced than “Orion,” a prototype highlighted at last year’s Connect, which Zuckerberg described as “the time machine to the future.” Orion is slated for release in 2027. Meta’s AI smart glasses glasses raise concerns about child safety Meta sells two AI-enabled eyewear lines built with Oakley and Ray-Ban. Those products offer cameras, voice-driven control, and the ability to livestream to Instagram and Facebook. Zuckerberg has directed over 60 billion US dollars since 2020 into the company’s AR divisiont. He has stated that smart glasses will be the main route to bring “superintelligence” into everyday life. In pursuit of AI leadership, he has also fueled an expensive talent contest by recruiting leading researchers from rival firm. Reuters reported that Meta’s artificial intelligence guidelines enabled chatbots to converse with children on topics such as race. Meta pushes ahead with new tech despite losses Along with the display-equipped glasses, Meta is expected to unveil a first-generation wristband that lets wearers control the eyewear using hand gestures. The company also plans to introduce a refreshed Ray-Ban line with better battery life and cameras and added AI features. Meta is one of the few big tech firms that progressed significantly in smart glasses, selling around 2 million pairs of the Ray-Ban model since 2023. According to CNBC the Hypernova glasses may carry Prada branding, since the Italian label’s wide frames can easily contain the electrical components. Even so, the expected price of $800 may be too much for most users, well above above the $299 starting price for the Ray-Ban line and $399 for the sport-focused Oakley glasses. Analysts estimate that the device could sell “a few hundred thousand units at most,” though the rollout could help attract more developers to build software around this new tech.

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with speculation surrounding Grayscale’s recent on-chain activities, suggesting a significant move towards future Grayscale ETH ETF staking . This development, highlighted by a prominent analyst, points to Grayscale potentially positioning itself for an innovative offering in the burgeoning Ethereum ETF landscape. For many investors, the prospect of combining the accessibility of an ETF with the yield-generating potential of staking represents an exciting evolution in digital asset investment. What Recent On-Chain Activity Signals About Grayscale’s Plans? According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, a notable transaction occurred recently that has sparked widespread discussion. Just hours ago, an address associated with the Grayscale ETH Mini Trust ETF executed a substantial transfer of Ethereum. Specifically, 214,400 ETH, valued at an impressive $967 million, was moved from this Grayscale address. These funds were then distributed across 67 newly created wallets, with each wallet receiving an identical allocation of 3,200 ETH. EmberCN’s analysis suggests a high probability that these meticulously divided funds are being prepared for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking. This strategic distribution indicates a methodical approach rather than a simple asset reallocation, strongly hinting at future operational readiness for Grayscale ETH ETF staking activities. Why is Grayscale Preparing for ETH Staking Now? The timing of Grayscale’s actions raises an intriguing question: why now? The analyst speculates that Grayscale might have received some form of advance information, prompting these preparatory steps. This could range from informal discussions with regulators to a strategic anticipation of future policy changes regarding spot ETH ETFs. Historically, market participants often make proactive moves when they foresee significant regulatory shifts. Grayscale’s apparent readiness for Grayscale ETH ETF staking could be a testament to their long-term vision for Ethereum-based investment products, aiming to be at the forefront once regulatory clarity emerges. Understanding the Appeal of Staking for ETH ETFs Staking is a fundamental component of the Ethereum blockchain’s security and operation, particularly since its transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. When you stake ETH, you essentially lock up your tokens to support the network’s validation process. In return, stakers earn rewards, typically paid in ETH. For an ETF, integrating staking offers several compelling advantages: Enhanced Returns: Staking rewards can provide an additional yield on the underlying ETH assets, potentially boosting the ETF’s overall performance. Increased Investor Interest: The ability to earn passive income from an ETF could attract a broader range of investors looking for yield in their crypto exposure. Network Participation: By staking, the ETF would actively contribute to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network, aligning with the ethos of the crypto community. The potential for Grayscale ETH ETF staking to generate extra value is a significant draw, differentiating it from traditional ETFs that simply track asset prices. The Regulatory Roadblock: Can US Spot ETH ETFs Stake? Despite the clear benefits, a major hurdle remains: the U.S. has not yet approved staking for spot ETH ETFs. This regulatory uncertainty is a critical factor. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, the approvals did not explicitly include provisions for staking the underlying ETH. The SEC’s stance on whether staking constitutes a security or falls under existing regulations for investment products is still evolving. This lack of explicit approval means that any preparations for Grayscale ETH ETF staking are currently speculative regarding their immediate implementation in the US market. However, Grayscale’s forward-thinking approach suggests they are either confident in future regulatory shifts or exploring all operational possibilities for their products. What This Means for the Ethereum Market and Investors If Grayscale ETH ETF staking eventually receives regulatory green light, the implications for the Ethereum market could be substantial. A large institutional player like Grayscale staking a significant amount of ETH would likely: Reduce Circulating Supply: More ETH locked in staking contracts could lead to a decrease in the available circulating supply, potentially impacting price dynamics. Increase Institutional Demand: The added yield from staking could make ETH ETFs even more attractive to institutional investors, driving further adoption. Strengthen Network Security: Greater participation from major entities in staking enhances the overall security and robustness of the Ethereum blockchain. For individual investors, this could mean access to a regulated product that offers both exposure to Ethereum’s price appreciation and the passive income potential of staking, all within a familiar investment vehicle. Grayscale’s reported preparations for Grayscale ETH ETF staking underscore a fascinating phase in the evolution of cryptocurrency investments. While regulatory approvals for staking within US spot ETH ETFs are still pending, these on-chain movements signal a proactive and strategic vision from a major player. As the regulatory landscape continues to unfold, the potential for yield-bearing ETH ETFs could redefine how traditional investors engage with the decentralized finance ecosystem, promising a future where innovation and traditional finance increasingly intertwine. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking? Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking is a mechanism where cryptocurrency holders lock up their tokens to help secure a blockchain network and validate transactions. In return for their participation, they earn rewards, typically in the form of new tokens. 2. Has the SEC approved staking for spot ETH ETFs in the US? No, while the SEC recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, the current approvals do not explicitly include provisions for staking the underlying ETH. The regulatory stance on this specific aspect is still under consideration. 3. What are the potential benefits of Grayscale ETH ETF staking? Potential benefits include enhanced returns for investors through staking rewards, increased investor interest due to passive income opportunities, and stronger network security for the Ethereum blockchain through greater institutional participation. 4. How much ETH did Grayscale transfer, according to the analyst? According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, a Grayscale ETH Mini Trust ETF address transferred 214,400 ETH, worth approximately $967 million, to 67 new wallets. 5. What could be the market impact if ETH ETF staking is approved? If approved, it could lead to a reduction in the circulating supply of ETH, increase institutional demand for Ethereum, and further strengthen the network’s security, potentially impacting ETH’s price dynamics and overall adoption.

In the case of XRP, one analyst has highlighted similarities between the 2017/2018 bull market and the current structure forming in 2025. The comparison suggests that XRP could be positioned for another substantial upward movement. Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent market analyst on X, posted a chart that compared XRP’s explosive rally in late 2017 to the ongoing cycle. Alongside the image, the analyst predicted that XRP holders are about to get mega-rich. All #XRP holders about to get MEGA RICH. Time to pay close attention! pic.twitter.com/4VwsU8Im7E — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 16, 2025 Lessons From the 2017/2018 Cycle The left side of the chart tracks XRP’s price action during the 2017/2018 cycle. At its peak, XRP achieved an extraordinary gain of over 40,000%. The rally took XRP from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $3.36 at the time, before a steep correction of approximately 74% followed, pulling the asset into a consolidation phase . That dramatic rise and subsequent decline remain one of the most notable moments in the asset’s market history. The highlighted data shows that XRP’s initial upward momentum was swift and intense, fueled by both retail and institutional interest. While the retracement was severe, the cycle established a precedent for how XRP behaves in a bull market. Analysts continue to use that cycle as a benchmark when evaluating XRP’s potential in new market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Current Trajectory On the right side of the chart, the analyst mapped the ongoing XRP cycle. According to the projection, XRP has already entered a growth phase, with the potential for gains reaching nearly 1,936% from current levels. The chart outlines a possible trajectory that could lift XRP’s price higher, with key levels extending above its all-time high of $3.65 and even pointing toward the $10 range. This perspective builds on the notion that, while XRP’s growth may not replicate the 40,000% of the 2017 cycle, the asset could still generate returns that stand out in the current market. The forecast reflects both the maturation of the cryptocurrency industry and XRP’s established position as a digital asset with ongoing demand from both institutions and retail investors. The chart positions XRP’s current cycle as one with meaningful upside potential. The direct comparison with the previous cycle highlights the belief that XRP continues to follow repeatable long-term patterns , and traders watching XRP may interpret these similarities as signs of another major rally approaching.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as South Korean exchange Bithumb announces its latest additions. These Bithumb crypto listings are set to bring two intriguing digital assets, Toshi (TOSHI) and Holoworld (HOLO), to its platform. Starting September 17th, traders will have the opportunity to engage with these new cryptocurrencies against the South Korean Won (KRW), opening fresh avenues for investment and portfolio diversification. This move underscores Bithumb’s commitment to expanding its offerings and catering to the dynamic interests of its user base. What’s Happening with These Bithumb Crypto Listings? Bithumb, a leading player in the South Korean crypto market, has officially confirmed the listing schedule. Toshi (TOSHI) trading will kick off first, becoming available at 6:00 a.m. UTC. Shortly after, Holoworld (HOLO) will join the fray, with its trading commencing at 7:00 a.m. UTC on the very same day. These back-to-back listings highlight a strategic push by the exchange to introduce promising new projects to its robust trading environment. For many investors, new Bithumb crypto listings represent significant opportunities to get in on the ground floor of potentially high-growth assets. Understanding the specifics of these listings is crucial for any trader. Both TOSHI and HOLO will be paired directly with the KRW, simplifying the trading process for local users. This direct pairing often leads to higher liquidity and more straightforward price discovery, which are beneficial factors for both seasoned traders and newcomers alike. Diving Deeper: Understanding Toshi (TOSHI) Toshi, often associated with the Base blockchain ecosystem, is a community-driven project that has garnered attention for its meme coin appeal and decentralized finance (DeFi) aspirations. Named after the cat of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, TOSHI aims to build a robust ecosystem around its token, focusing on utility and community engagement. While specific details on its long-term roadmap are still evolving, its presence on a major exchange like Bithumb suggests a growing recognition of its potential within the broader crypto landscape.

Why BullZilla Is the Best Crypto to Invest In Now,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/missed-bitcoin-why-bullzilla-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-now/,"The story of Bitcoin will forever be remembered as one of crypto’s most frustrating and exhilarating chapters. In 2009, a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper that barely caused a ripple beyond a small group of cypherpunks. At the time, a single Bitcoin was worth less than a cent. Skeptics dismissed it as “nerd money,” a fleeting internet experiment destined to fade. Yet as the years unfolded, Bitcoin defied every expectation. From pizza purchases at 10,000 BTC to its first big rally past $1,000, then a breathtaking surge to $20,000 in 2017 and a new all-time high above $69,000 in 2021, it transformed from a niche curiosity into digital gold. Early adopters turned pocket change into life-altering fortunes. Latecomers watched headlines scream about overnight millionaires, feeling the sting of missed opportunity. Stories of investors who once owned thousands of coins and sold too soon became cautionary legends. But crypto is nothing if not cyclical, and redemption is always just one bull run away. For every train you miss, another pulls into the station. Today, many see that fresh chance in the explosive rise of BullZilla , a new presale phenomenon capturing the same raw excitement Bitcoin once did. While no project can ever be “the next Bitcoin,” the lesson is clear: markets reward the bold and the early. Remembering the Missed Bitcoin Wave For many seasoned investors, the real lesson of Bitcoin isn’t just its meteoric price chart, it’s the power of conviction when everyone else doubts. Those who bought during the quiet bear markets, when headlines declared Bitcoin dead and friends scoffed, reaped the greatest rewards. That same dynamic drives today’s hunt for the next breakout project. BullZilla’s early presale stage echoes those early Bitcoin days: high risk, yes, but also high potential for those willing to research, commit, and hold through volatility. History shows that the crypto world rewards foresight far more than hesitation. BullZilla Presale: A Fresh Start for Investors The Bull Zilla Presale is the centerpiece of the top meme coin presale to buy now, attracting both retail and seasoned investors. The presale price sits at $0.00005908, with 26 B tokens sold and over 1,500 holders. Early participants have already locked in a staggering 8,822.49% ROI to the projected listing price of $0.00527. Another 11.27% price hike is expected as Stage 3B approaches. Investors see BullZilla as the best crypto to buy today, combining the virality of meme coins with tokenomics designed for sustainability. The promise of the BullZilla best crypto to invest is drawing whales who missed earlier mega-runs like Shiba Inu and PEPE. A unique Progressive Price Engine increases the presale price every 48 hours or after $100k raised, creating urgency. The Roar Burn Mechanism further reduces supply, helping long-term holders. Upcoming Stage 3B signals an 11.27% price surge, a major reason analysts call it the BullZilla best crypto to invest and one of the best crypto to buy today. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Set Up a Wallet: Install a Web3 wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Purchase ETH from exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site: Connect your wallet to the official BullZilla ($BZIL) presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL: Select the amount you want to invest and confirm. Your allocation is instantly secured and claimable once the presale ends. Why BullZilla Could Be the Best Crypto to Invest Meme coins live and die by their ability to capture attention, and BullZilla ($BZIL) is already proving it has the narrative strength to rise. Its presale momentum is fueled by rapid funding milestones, viral exposure, and a narrative of strength and power, something the meme coin crowd deeply resonates with. When you consider Bitcoin’s past and compare it with BullZilla’s trajectory, the similarities are clear: low entry pricing, strong branding, and an eager investor base. These are exactly the conditions that made Bitcoin skyrocket. That’s why many now label BullZilla as one of the top early-stage crypto Investments. Conclusion The harsh reality of crypto is that most only realize potential after the gains are gone. Bitcoin reminded everyone of that fact. But BullZilla offers a chance to apply those lessons, getting in early before mainstream hype arrives. This is the cycle that creates legends in the meme coin world: hesitation leads to regret, but decisive moves toward Early Presale Crypto projects can change lives. Investors who recognize this pattern may find BullZilla to be their moment of redemption. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) FAQs What is BullZilla? BullZilla is a meme coin currently in presale, raising over $350K so far, and is gaining attention as one of the best crypto to invest. Why is BullZilla compared to Bitcoin? Because many see it as a “second chance” after missing Bitcoin, with similar low entry pricing and hype potential. What stage is BullZilla Presale in? It’s currently in Stage 2C, priced at $0.00004575. How do I buy BullZilla? You’ll need Ethereum, connect your wallet to the presale site, and swap ETH for $BZIL tokens. Could BullZilla become the best crypto to invest Meme Coin? While nothing is guaranteed, early momentum and funding success suggest it has that potential. Summary Bitcoin created millionaires, but only for those who acted early. For everyone else, it was a bitter reminder of what hesitation costs. Now, with BullZilla gathering massive presale momentum, investors are being handed a second chance. With its organized presale, growing hype, and low entry point, BullZilla is quickly establishing itself as one of the best crypto to invest and a leading name among best crypto to invest.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the BTC price has officially soared past the remarkable $117,000 mark, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This significant movement, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, signals a vibrant period for the digital asset. As BTC price reaches this new high, many are asking: what’s fueling this incredible rally, and what does it mean for the future of crypto? What’s Driving This Monumental BTC Price Surge? This latest surge in the BTC price isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s often the result of several underlying market forces converging. Understanding these drivers can provide valuable context for investors navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Several factors typically contribute to such a powerful upward trajectory for the BTC price : Increased Institutional Adoption: Major corporations and investment funds are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, seeing it as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against inflation. Positive Macroeconomic Outlook: A generally optimistic global economic sentiment or specific policy decisions, like interest rate cuts, can push investors towards riskier, higher-growth assets such as Bitcoin. Technical Breakouts: Chart analysts often point to key resistance levels. When the BTC price breaks above a significant threshold, it can trigger a wave of buying activity from traders using technical indicators. Halving Cycle Influence: While not immediate, the long-term effects of Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, contribute to its scarcity and can drive up its value over time. Understanding the Significance of the $117,000 BTC Price Mark Reaching a BTC price of $117,000 is more than just a number; it carries substantial weight for market participants. For many, it represents a psychological victory and a reinforcement of Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. This milestone often leads to: Renewed Investor Confidence: A strong upward move can attract new investors and re-engage existing ones, fostering a positive feedback loop. Media Attention: Higher prices naturally draw more mainstream media coverage, further increasing public awareness and potentially bringing in more retail investors. Validation of Bitcoin’s Role: Each new high reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ and a viable alternative to traditional financial assets. As reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, the BTC price is actively trading at $117,000 on the Binance USDT market, indicating robust liquidity and active participation from a global investor base. Navigating the Market: What Should Investors Consider with the Current BTC Price? While the current surge in BTC price is undoubtedly exciting, it’s crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and informed decision-making is key. Here are some considerations for investors: Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Volatility can lead to rapid price swings, so understand your risk tolerance. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your investment strategy is geared towards short-term gains or long-term holding. Bitcoin’s history shows significant long-term appreciation despite short-term fluctuations. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio across different assets, not just cryptocurrencies, to mitigate overall risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic trends that can influence the BTC price . Resources like Bitcoin World provide valuable insights and timely updates. The incredible climb of the BTC price above $117,000 marks a significant moment in the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market.

The BTC price is influenced by a combination of factors including institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions (like inflation concerns or interest rate changes), regulatory news, technological advancements in the crypto space, and market sentiment.

Their current behavior could define the trajectory of the ongoing cycle. Repeat 2021-Style Cycle Top? In the 2021 cycle, long-term holders began their main distribution phase between November 2020 and March 2021. In the process, this cohort of BTC holders trimmed their supply by 13.5% just before Bitcoin’s April 2021 peak, which Michael Nadeau, founder of The DeFi Report, argues was the “true” cycle top. These coins were transferred to short-term holders (STHs) and introduced new liquidity into the market. However, LTHs soon re-accumulated, finishing the year with larger positions than they began with, which explains why the second top in November 2021 was relatively muted as it lacked the influx of new capital and was largely fueled by repositioning of existing holdings. Interestingly, the same structure is unfolding in the present cycle according to the latest findings by Nadeau. LTHs reduced their supply by 12.4% into what may have been the first “true” top earlier this year (in the first quarter Q1 2025). Since then, the re-accumulation trend has returned, which is quite similar to the post-April 2021 phase. Despite this, unlike in earlier cycles, the participation from short-term holders (STH) remains low, and there was minimal evidence of new money entering the market. Nadeau said that this muted demand could cap the strength of future rallies, echoing the two-top structure of 2021, where LTH behavior and time-driven holder transitions, rather than broad inflows, shaped late-cycle price action. BTC Market Remains Vulnerable Glassnode’s data also pointed in the same direction. The analytics platform found that despite modest signs of recovery, fragility lingers beneath the surface, which has left Bitcoin vulnerable if fresh demand fails to make a comeback. While the spot market momentum is strong enough to push RSI into overbought territory, conviction looks shallow, owing to flat volumes and weakening CVD, suggesting sellers continue pressing into strength. Futures markets reflected high activity, as evidenced by open interest and aggressive buy-side flows driving perpetual CVD higher, though softer funding highlighted reduced long demand and a more cautious outlook. Options markets told a similar story: open interest climbed, but volatility spreads narrowed and skew dropped sharply, which means less hedging and greater complacency, thereby increasing the risk of sharp reactions if volatility resurfaces. On-chain signals were mixed. BTC addresses trended toward cycle lows while transfer volumes rose, pointing to capital inflows without broader user growth. Fees declined, reflecting weak block space demand and muted speculative pressure. With profitability metrics improving, investors are broadly in profit, but increasing profit-taking hints at potential demand exhaustion.

Then you’ve likely noticed the buzz around Solana. The ecosystem is truly thriving, and recent reports highlight an incredible milestone: Solana app revenue has seen an explosive surge, reaching an impressive $190 million in August. This isn’t just a small bump; it represents a staggering 126% increase year-over-year, painting a vibrant picture of growth and innovation within the Solana network. Solana App Revenue: An Unprecedented Surge The latest figures from a Step Finance report reveal a remarkable story for Solana. Applications built on the high-performance blockchain generated $190 million in revenue during August alone. This significant jump clearly demonstrates the increasing utility and adoption of the Solana platform. Such substantial year-over-year growth signals strong underlying demand and a maturing ecosystem, solidifying Solana’s position in the competitive blockchain space. This impressive revenue isn’t spread thinly across thousands of apps. Instead, a concentrated effort from a few key players is driving the majority of this success. The report indicates that the top 10 applications are responsible for over 86.5% of the total revenue, showcasing the immense power and popularity of established and innovative platforms within the Solana sphere. This concentration suggests that while the ecosystem is growing, certain applications have found strong product-market fit. What’s Driving This Remarkable Solana App Revenue Growth? Understanding the catalysts behind this impressive Solana app revenue surge is crucial for anyone interested in the blockchain’s future. Several standout applications are leading the charge, each contributing significantly to the overall financial health of the ecosystem. Let’s look at the top performers and their impact: Axiom: This platform led the pack, bringing in a substantial $49.1 million. Axiom’s focus on innovative financial products and services, often involving structured products and yield generation, has clearly resonated with users seeking advanced DeFi opportunities. Its strong performance highlights the demand for sophisticated financial tools on Solana. pump.fun: Following closely, pump.fun contributed $41 million. This platform’s unique approach to enabling quick, fair, and decentralized token launches has attracted a significant user base, especially those interested in meme coins and community-driven projects. It proves the appeal of novel social and financial experimentation on Solana. Phantom: The popular self-custody wallet for Solana users secured $22.3 million. Phantom’s essential role in facilitating secure transactions, managing digital assets, and providing a seamless gateway to dApps underscores its critical importance to the entire ecosystem. Its revenue reflects widespread user adoption and trust in its services, directly impacting overall Solana app revenue . These applications, along with others in the top ten, highlight diverse use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to social applications and essential infrastructure. Their collective success underscores the versatility, robust nature, and growing user base of the Solana blockchain. Beyond the Numbers: Understanding Solana’s Ecosystem Strength The impressive revenue figures are more than just numbers; they reflect the fundamental strengths of the Solana ecosystem itself. Key benefits that attract both users and developers include: High Throughput: Solana’s ability to process thousands of transactions per second makes it ideal for high-demand applications. Low Transaction Fees: Users benefit from significantly lower costs compared to many other blockchains, enhancing affordability and accessibility. Rapidly Expanding Developer Community: A growing pool of talent building innovative solutions ensures continuous advancement and new applications. This combination fosters an environment where innovative applications can thrive and generate substantial value. The growing Solana app revenue indicates increased user engagement and a healthy economic cycle within the network. More users mean more transactions, which in turn drives revenue for applications and validators. This positive feedback loop is vital for long-term sustainability and continued expansion, signaling a vibrant and active community. Challenges and Future Outlook for Solana App Revenue While the growth is undoubtedly exciting, it’s also important to consider the broader landscape. The cryptocurrency market can be inherently volatile, and competition among layer-1 blockchains is fierce. Solana, like any other platform, faces challenges such as maintaining network stability, ensuring robust security, and the need for continuous innovation to stay ahead. However, the current trajectory, backed by strong development and user adoption, suggests a resilient foundation. Looking ahead, the future of Solana app revenue appears remarkably promising. Continued core protocol development, strategic partnerships, and a relentless focus on enhancing user experience are likely to sustain this upward trend. For users, developers, and investors, closely monitoring the performance of key applications and overall ecosystem health will provide valuable insights into Solana’s enduring potential and its capacity for future growth. In conclusion, the astounding 126% year-over-year increase in Solana app revenue to $190 million in August is a powerful testament to the network’s burgeoning strength and innovation. Led by key players like Axiom, pump.fun, and Phantom, Solana is clearly demonstrating its capability to host a vibrant and economically successful decentralized application landscape.

But while assets that get a lot of attention are frequently in the news, the ventures that will really succeed in the long run are the ones that combine new ideas with long-term viability. Early investors realize that good fundamentals and tokenomics are what make wealth grow, and it’s what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out. Analysts say that this cryptocurrency will provide investors a 1200% return by 2026, making it the best one to purchase this month for those who want to see beyond the hype. Staking, buybacks, and roadmap confidence for 1200% The mtToken stake and repurchase strategy is another thing that makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out. Users may stake their mtTokens in certain smart contracts to get MUTM payouts. The platform will also use the money it makes to buy back MUTM straight from the open market. Then, these tokens will be given back to stakers, creating a feedback loop of demand that rewards those who hold on to their tokens for a long time and makes prices more stable. This strategy is what changes MUTM from a speculative play into an asset that pays interest. Another way to tell whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is real is by looking at its roadmap. Phase 1 has already done important presale tasks, community advertising, monitoring platform listings, and an outside audit. The next steps will involve building the core smart contracts and DApps, the back-end infrastructure, the risk management systems, and the analytics tools. Before the presale ends, there will be beta testing, final audits, and ensuring that all rules are followed. After that, the platform will be live, the MUTM token will be listed on exchanges, and the staking and claim procedures will start. In Phase 4, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also roll out institutional collaborations, multi-chain growth, and platform improvements. This will make it a whole ecosystem. Security has also been made a top priority. The CertiK audit gave the project a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00, which made investors feel more confident. There is a $50,000 bug bounty program in place, with payouts of up to $2,000 for serious problems and as little as $200 for less serious ones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving away $100,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 people, each of whom will get $10,000 worth of tokens. This is to get more people involved in the community. Stablecoin utility and presale growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating an ecosystem around its decentralized stablecoin, which will always try to stay at a $1 peg. This stablecoin is different from meme assets that go up and down in value. It is created only when users borrow against collateral like ETH, AVAX, or SOL, and it is burnt when loans are paid back or sold. Only issuers who have been authorized will be able to mint, and there will be constraints to keep systemic risk in check. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s protocol will set the interest rates for borrowing the stablecoin to safeguard the peg. When the stablecoin trades for more than $1, rates will go down, and when it trades for less than $1, rates will go up. Arbitrage possibilities will help bring the price back down, and all loans will be overcollateralized and immediately paid off when required. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has an advantage over ventures that just depend on speculative demand since it has governance, arbitrage, and collateral safety nets. This is the type of thing that helps explain why more and more people are investing in crypto initiatives that provide depth and sustainability instead of just hype. The project is in Phase 6 of its presale right now, with a price of $0.035. It has already generated more than $15.85 million, sold 40% of its supply, and brought on more than 16,350 holders. There can only be 4 billion tokens in total. The next phase, Phase 7, will raise the price of the token by 15% to $0.040. This means that this is the final opportunity for investors to acquire MUTM at this discounted price. The tokenomics are set up to provide value, as the platform’s earnings will be utilized for open-market buybacks that help the price rise over time. An investor who bought $2,500 worth of MUTM at $0.01 in previous rounds now possesses $8,750, and the same bag is expected to be worth $300,000 when the token hits $2. The presale success gives further weight to crypto projections that say MUTM would provide investors more than 1200% profits by 2026. While the market talks about stories about a crypto ETF or daily price swings, this initiative shows that disciplined token economics and steady growth are what really drive gains. Conclusion Whether you’re an investor who wants to know whether crypto is a solid investment right now, the answer is that time and choosing the right projects are more important than anything else. Meme coins do well when there is a lot of buzz, but they don’t last long. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting the stage for long-term development, and the presale is going to move to a higher price, so the chance to get MUTM at an inexpensive price is running out quickly. As SHIB and other meme currencies continue to make news, the sharpest investors are transferring their money to ventures that have a legitimate basis. When 1200% growth becomes genuine in 2026, anyone who bought in today for $0.035 will have shown that actual DeFi innovation, not hype, is where big profits come from.

Recently, one particular event has captured the attention of traders and investors alike: ETH liquidations . Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) has unfortunately led the charge in crypto liquidations, experiencing a staggering $60.45 million wiped out from perpetual futures positions. This substantial figure underscores the volatile nature of digital assets and highlights crucial market dynamics that every participant should understand. What Are ETH Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the crypto derivatives space, the term ""liquidation"" can sound intimidating. Simply put, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when the market moves against their prediction, and they can no longer meet the margin requirements to keep the trade open. The recent surge in ETH liquidations is particularly significant because Ethereum is a major player in the crypto ecosystem. Its price movements and associated liquidations can often signal broader market sentiment and potential future trends. Understanding these events is vital for anyone looking to navigate the complex world of crypto trading. A Closer Look at the Recent Market Wipeout The past 24 hours saw considerable turbulence across various cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial liquidations. Let’s break down the key figures: Ethereum (ETH): Topping the list, ETH saw a massive $60.45 million in liquidations . A striking 69.88% of these were long positions, meaning traders betting on a price increase were caught off guard by a downturn. Bitcoin (BTC): Not far behind, Bitcoin experienced $25.38 million in liquidations. Interestingly, the majority here were short positions, accounting for 75.39%. This suggests that while ETH longs were suffering, some BTC shorts were also squeezed, perhaps indicating a nuanced market movement rather than a uniform crash. Dogecoin (DOGE): The popular meme coin also felt the pressure, with $11.08 million in liquidations. Similar to ETH, long positions were dominant, making up 61.11% of the total. These figures paint a clear picture of heightened volatility and the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. The sheer volume of ETH liquidations alone indicates a significant price movement that impacted a large number of bullish traders. Decoding Long vs. Short Liquidations: What Does It Mean? The distinction between long and short liquidations is crucial for interpreting market sentiment. When long positions are liquidated, it implies a downward price movement that caught bullish traders off guard. Conversely, short liquidations suggest an upward price movement that squeezed bearish traders. For Ethereum, the dominance of long liquidations (nearly 70%) means that a significant number of traders who expected ETH’s price to rise were forced to close their positions. This often creates further selling pressure, potentially cascading into more liquidations. In contrast, Bitcoin’s majority short liquidations suggest a brief upward bounce or resistance to further downside, catching those betting on a deeper fall. These opposing trends in BTC and ETH liquidations highlight the complex interplay between different assets in the market and underscore the need for careful analysis. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors The recent wave of liquidations, particularly the large volume of ETH liquidations , serves as a powerful reminder of market risks. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Risk Management is Key: Always use stop-loss orders when engaging in leveraged trading. This helps limit potential losses and protects your capital from sudden market shifts. Understand Leverage: While leverage can amplify gains, it also significantly amplifies losses. Be conservative with your leverage ratios, especially in volatile markets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different assets can help mitigate risks associated with single-asset volatility. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data. Understanding the broader context can help anticipate potential price movements. Avoid Emotional Trading: Liquidations often trigger fear and panic. Make decisions based on analysis, not emotion. By adopting a disciplined approach and prioritizing risk management, investors can better navigate the unpredictable nature of the crypto market, even amidst significant events like widespread ETH liquidations . In summary, the past 24 hours have been a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency perpetual futures market, with Ethereum leading the pack in liquidations. The substantial $60.45 million in ETH liquidations , predominantly from long positions, signals a challenging period for bullish traders. While Bitcoin and Dogecoin also saw significant liquidations, the specific distribution between long and short positions offers nuanced insights into market sentiment. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, understanding these liquidation events and adopting robust risk management strategies will be paramount for sustained participation and success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about cryptocurrency liquidations: What exactly is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against them, and their collateral (margin) is no longer sufficient to maintain the trade. This prevents further losses beyond the initial margin. Why did ETH liquidations lead the market recently? ETH liquidations were highest primarily because Ethereum experienced significant price volatility, leading to a substantial number of leveraged long positions being closed out. Traders betting on a price increase were particularly affected by a downward price movement. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when a trader betting on a price increase (a ""long"" position) is forced to close due to a price drop. Short liquidations occur when a trader betting on a price decrease (a ""short"" position) is forced to close due to a price increase. How can I protect myself from liquidations? Effective risk management is crucial. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, manage your leverage responsibly, diversify your portfolio, and stay informed about market conditions. Avoid over-leveraging and emotional trading. Do liquidations always mean a market crash? Not necessarily. While large-scale liquidations can contribute to downward price pressure, they are a normal part of leveraged markets. They can indicate significant volatility or a shift in sentiment, but don’t always precede a sustained market crash. Did you find this analysis of ETH liquidations helpful?

However, while traders focus on volatile meme coins, Remittix (RTX) is steadily climbing its way to the top, becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Shiba Inu is currently trading around $0.00001298, following a sharp drop that shocked investors. The decline was partly driven by a $2.4 million hack on the Shibarium bridge , shaking market confidence. On Saturday, SHIB recorded a massive spike in activity, with over 7.17 trillion tokens transferred in a single day, according to Etherscan. From a technical perspective, the failure to stay above the 200-day EMA has made many traders lose confidence in the token. According to some analysts, SHIB is capable of falling to $0.000012 and if it does, it may fall to $0.000010. Others are more optimistic and they are projecting an upward price of $0.00003150 or even up to $0.000081 in the months ahead. source: @ramseycrypto on X For now, the Shiba Inu price prediction suggests a period of uncertainty, with SHIB caught between bearish technical signals and bullish long-term speculation, including rumors of a Shiba Inu ETF. Pepe Coin Faces Consolidation PEPE is currently priced around $0.00001061. A single wallet purchase of 1.52 trillion PEPE tokens , worth nearly $16 million, sent shockwaves through the market. This is among the biggest individual deals in the history of the token. Presently, PEPE is experiencing a narrow range between $0.00000941 and $0.00001340, which is an indication of consolidation. Analysts feel this may be quiet before the storm and there may be a great breakout or a great breakdown in the near future. Support lies at $0.00001035, with resistance just slightly above at $0.00001064. While some analysts see cooling momentum as a sign of exhaustion, others believe PEPE is simply building a base for another leg higher. source: FX_Professor on TradingView Remittix: The Token Taking The Spotlight Remittix is the best crypto under $1 , raising over $25,8 million, selling more than 664 million tokens at $0.1080 each.

XRP was one of the longest runners in cross-border payments, but there is competition, regulatory challenges, and market volatility to consider whether it is in its own good.

XRP Price Prediction and Market Climate XRP has been an established remittance player globally for several years now and is among the most sought-after cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. At a sale price of $3.05, market capitalization of $181.09 billion, and 24-hour trading volume of $5.02 billion (down 15.34%), XRP remains among the most traded cryptocurrency. For XRP to be a real possibility at $100, though, it would need enormous market growth and adoption both in the institutional and retail spaces. Although its role in cross-border payments is monopolistic, the crypto universe is today full of upcoming crypto initiatives offering faster settlement, lower fees, and higher integration flexibility. XRP’s trajectory is also highly dependent upon regulation clarity. In the United States, judicial proceedings have decelerated momentum, whereas other regions keep testing out regulations that would benefit or injure its progress. The Rise of Utility-First Projects The crypto space is moving towards real-world utility. Low gas fee crypto projects, decentralized exchanges, and new altcoins with payment use cases are making large headlines. Investors are more concerned with hype coins now and are instead focusing on crypto with real utility, long-term sustainability, and practical adoption. This shift creates space for platforms that do not only guarantee innovation but have even working solutions. While XRP is fighting to push banking adoption, rivalry from the next big altcoin 2025 players is tough. Among such projects creating buzz is Remittix (RTX), a cross-chain DeFi platform bridging crypto and fiat payments. The Forces Powering Remittix’s Rise Remittix ( $0.1080 per token ) has already secured more than $25.9 million, selling 664Million+ tokens in presale. It solves a $19Trillion payments problem by allowing users to pay crypto straight to bank accounts in 30+ nations. Unlike most early-stage crypto investments, Remittix already possesses a real-world use case which is already being trialed through its wallet beta. Important project highlights are: Ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens First CEX listing confirmed with BitMart and second with LBank $250,000 giveaway active for presale supporters 15% USDT referral incentives paid every day Over $25.9Million raised in one of the best crypto presales 2025 With CertiK auditing, Remittix is a secure, open DeFi project and is increasingly viewed as the next altcoin 2025. Final Thoughts on XRP Price Prediction Whereas XRP is one of the top cryptos to invest in today for others, reaching $100 would require historic adoption and growth in the market. The cryptocurrency market is evolving at a fast pace, and investors are diversifying into low cap crypto gems and future cryptos that have real-world effects. Remittix provides a fresh perspective by integrating cross-border payments with blockchain effectiveness, and therefore it is among the most realistic crypto presales that are currently running. Be it XRP hitting $100 or not, the advent of projects like Remittix is an indication that the future of crypto lies in offering practical solutions and not speculation.

According to reports, the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) of Israel flagged 187 wallet addresses and asked platforms and service providers to take action. Immediate freezes were limited, and most of the funds appear to have been moved before they could be held. Israel Names Wallets And Asks For Action The NBCTF supplied a list of 187 addresses it believes are tied to the IRGC . Tether responded by blacklisting 39 of the flagged wallets, which blocked those addresses from further on-chain transactions. Reports indicate that only about $1.5 million is presently frozen or held, while the larger sum — roughly $1.5 billion in incoming transfers over time — has largely been shifted through other addresses and services. Questions Remain Over Ownership And Flows Reports have disclosed that blockchain analytics firms have urged caution about attributing direct ownership of every flagged address to the IRGC. Companies like Elliptic have said that some wallets could belong to exchanges or third-party services used by many different users, which complicates claims of direct control. Tracing crypto flows is possible but messy, and the distinction between transaction volume through a wallet and direct ownership matters in legal terms. How The Funds Were Handled On-Chain Israeli authorities say they tracked large USDT flows into the flagged network over months. While a small portion was located and frozen, most of the tokens were reported to have been moved before enforcement steps could be completed. Tether’s decision to blacklist some wallets shows one way stablecoin issuers can act, but the moves do not recover funds that have already left the flagged addresses. The situation highlights how quickly assets can be shifted among many addresses. Why It Matters For Sanctions And Crypto Compliance According to market and regulatory coverage, the case illustrates the ongoing challenge of stopping sanctioned actors from using crypto to move value. Stablecoins like USDT are widely used for cross-border transfers, and their scale makes them attractive for many users. Lawmakers and regulators will likely watch how exchanges, wallets, and issuers respond, since cooperation by private firms can make enforcement more effective.

Binance Ethereum Trading In Neutral Zone According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Ethereum trading on Binance during September 2025 is witnessing a period of relative calm compared to other months. Notably, there has been a decline in the imbalance between ETH spot and perpetual volumes. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record 36 Million ETH, Driving Structural Supply Shock Commenting on ETH’s recent price surge, which saw it jump from $2,127 on June 15 to around $4,500 at the time of writing, Arab Chain noted that this rally was not supported by strong momentum. Neither the spot market nor leveraged speculators contributed to the price appreciation. The CryptoQuant contributor brought attention to ETH’s Z-score, which has oscillated between 0.0 and -1.0 for most of September. Such a Z-score typically signifies the asset trading in a neutral zone, with a slight tilt toward the spot market. For the uninitiated, a Z-score measures how far a data point is from the mean, expressed in units of standard deviation. In trading, it’s used to identify whether a value – like volume or price – is unusually high or low compared to its historical average. In essence, ETH’s current Z-score means that perpetual contracts are slowly losing their dominance in trading volume. This could be due to multiple reasons, such as speculators exiting the market or due to increased dependence on real buy/sell orders from actual investors. The decline in perpetual trading volume is significant compared to the period between June and August. As a result, the appetite for leveraged speculation has dwindled too, a sign of growing caution in the market. Arab Chain added: Despite this decline, the spot market also showed limited strength, reflecting a general lack of investor engagement. Spot volume remained below the 500K–1M range, which is significantly lower than the peaks recorded in July and June. The analyst cautioned that although the lack of strong imbalances between the spot and perpetual markets may seem positive at first, it could also mean there is heightened uncertainty and stagnation pertaining to the direction of ETH’s price. Is ETH Preparing For A New Rally? Although ETH appears to be stuck in limbo due to its sluggish price action, some analysts are confident that the digital asset is likely to resume its bullish trajectory in the near term. For example, ETH reserves on exchanges continue to deplete at a rapid pace.

At press time, ETH trades at $4,439, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

The promotion, running from 10:00 (UTC) on September 16 to 10:00 (UTC) on September 30 and rewards users for their trading activity. Participants must register and achieve specific trading volume thresholds. Rebates are calculated based on new daily trading volume using a tiered system, with higher percentages applied to higher volumes. All rebates will be distributed in HTX tokens, with a maximum of $20,000 worth of $HTX per user. During the event, trades made through spot trading bots, isolated margin, and cross margin will be counted toward the total spot trading volume. Participants’ new daily trading volume will be calculated using the following formulas: ● New Daily Trading Volume = Daily trading volume during the event − Average daily trading volume in the 30 days prior to the event. ● Actual Daily Rebate Amount = Daily net spot trading fees × Rebate coefficient. Daily New Trading Volume (Per user) Rebate Coefficient Reward (in $HTX) ≥1 million USDT 10% net trading fees ≥ 5 million USDT 15% net trading fees ≥ 10 million USDT 25% net trading fees ≥ 20 million USDT 35% net trading fees ≥ 50 million USDT 50% net trading fees Example: Suppose User A’s average daily spot trading volume in the past 30 days before the event was 8 million USDT: On September 18, User A’s spot trading volume reaches 20 million USDT, then User A’s daily new trading volume is therefore 12 million USDT. According to the rebate rules, if the rebate coefficient for that day is 25%, then User A’s rebate = Net spot trading fees from 20 million USDT * 25% in equivalent $HTX; On September 23, User A’s spot trading volume reaches 60 million USDT, then User A’s daily new trading volume is therefore 52 million USDT. According to the rebate rules, if the rebate coefficient for that day is 50%, then User A’s rebate = Net spot trading fees from 60 million USDT * 50% in equivalent $HTX. HTX is committed to delivering a secure, convenient, and efficient digital asset trading experience for users worldwide. The platform continues to strengthen its technology and risk management to safeguard assets and transactions. It also enhances product features and user experience, making trading accessible for investors at all levels.

The price is now recovering losses and faces hurdles near the $3.080 zone. XRP price is consolidating losses after declining below the $3.120 resistance. The price is now trading below $3.080 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the price clears the $3.080 zone. XRP Price Attempts Recovery XRP price started a fresh decline below the $3.120 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $3.020 level to enter a short-term bearish zone. There was a move below the $3.00 pivot level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A low was formed at $2.957 and the price recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.186 swing high to the $2.957 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $3.060 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls protect the $3.00 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.060 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.186 swing high to the $2.957 low. A clear move above the $3.080 resistance might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.180 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.060 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.00 level. The next major support is near the $2.950 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.950 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.880. The next major support sits near the $2.840 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.

Today, a significant development has unfolded on one of the largest crypto exchanges, Binance, with the announcement of new Binance perpetual futures listings. This move opens up fresh avenues for traders looking to capitalize on price movements of emerging digital assets. What Exactly Are Binance Perpetual Futures? For those new to the concept, perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract in the crypto market that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without actually owning it. Unlike traditional futures, these contracts have no expiry date, meaning you can hold them indefinitely as long as you meet margin requirements. This flexibility makes them incredibly popular. Here are some core aspects of Binance perpetual futures : No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions as long as they maintain sufficient margin. Leverage: They enable traders to amplify their potential returns (and risks) by trading with borrowed funds. Funding Rates: A unique mechanism that ensures the perpetual futures price stays anchored to the spot price. Binance, as a leading exchange, continually adds new assets to its perpetual futures lineup, providing a diverse range of trading instruments for its global user base. This expansion keeps the market dynamic and responsive to emerging tokens. Diving Into TOSHI and STBL: New Binance Perpetual Futures Pairs Binance has officially announced the immediate addition of two new perpetual futures pairs: TOSHI/USDT and STBL/USDT. These listings are set to go live today, offering traders new frontiers for speculation and portfolio diversification. The TOSHI/USDT pair will commence trading at 5:30 a.m. UTC, quickly followed by the STBL/USDT pair at 5:45 a.m. UTC. Let’s look at the specifics for these new Binance perpetual futures : TOSHI/USDT: This pair will offer an impressive leverage of up to 75x. Such high leverage allows for significant exposure with a relatively smaller capital outlay, though it also magnifies potential losses. STBL/USDT: Traders can access up to 50x leverage for this pair. While slightly lower than TOSHI, 50x leverage still presents substantial opportunities for amplified trading strategies. These additions reflect Binance’s commitment to expanding its derivative offerings, catering to the growing demand for diverse trading instruments in the fast-paced crypto market. The inclusion of these tokens suggests a growing interest and liquidity around them. Why Do These Binance Perpetual Futures Listings Matter? The introduction of TOSHI and STBL as Binance perpetual futures is more than just a routine update; it carries significant implications for the broader crypto ecosystem and individual traders alike. Firstly, it enhances market liquidity for these specific tokens. When an asset is listed on a major platform like Binance for futures trading, it typically sees increased trading volume and visibility. Moreover, these listings offer traders: Diversification: New pairs mean more options to spread risk and explore different market segments. Price Discovery: Futures markets often play a crucial role in price discovery, helping to establish fair market values for assets. Hedging Opportunities: Holders of TOSHI or STBL in their spot portfolios can use these futures contracts to hedge against potential price declines. For the projects behind TOSHI and STBL, this Binance listing is a massive vote of confidence, potentially attracting more users and developers to their respective ecosystems. It signifies a maturation and increased acceptance of these digital assets within the institutional trading landscape. Navigating the World of Crypto Perpetual Futures: Risks and Rewards While the prospect of high leverage and new trading pairs can be exciting, it’s crucial to approach Binance perpetual futures with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. Leverage, while offering amplified gains, also significantly increases the potential for rapid losses, sometimes exceeding initial capital if not managed properly. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies further compounds these risks. Here are some actionable insights for traders: Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Never trade with more capital than you can afford to lose. Education: Understand how perpetual futures work, including funding rates, margin calls, and liquidation mechanisms. Market Analysis: Conduct thorough technical and fundamental analysis before entering any trade. Start Small: Especially when dealing with new, potentially less liquid assets like TOSHI and STBL, begin with smaller position sizes. Responsible trading is paramount. The thrill of potential gains should always be balanced with a disciplined approach to risk. By staying informed and cautious, traders can better navigate the complexities of these powerful financial instruments. The addition of TOSHI and STBL to Binance’s perpetual futures lineup marks an exciting development for the crypto derivatives market. It offers traders fresh opportunities to engage with emerging assets, leveraging Binance’s robust platform and liquidity. However, as with all high-leverage trading, understanding the risks and implementing sound risk management strategies are essential for success. This expansion underscores Binance’s continuous effort to remain at the forefront of the digital asset trading landscape, providing diverse tools for its global community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the maximum leverage offered for TOSHI/USDT perpetual futures? A1: Binance will offer up to 75x leverage for the TOSHI/USDT perpetual futures pair. Q2: When will the STBL/USDT perpetual futures pair go live on Binance? A2: The STBL/USDT perpetual futures pair is scheduled to go live at 5:45 a.m. UTC today. Q3: Do Binance perpetual futures contracts have an expiry date? A3: No, Binance perpetual futures contracts do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as margin requirements are met. Q4: What are the main risks associated with trading Binance perpetual futures with high leverage? A4: High leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses, meaning traders can lose their capital very quickly. Market volatility further increases these risks, making robust risk management crucial. Q5: Why is Binance listing new perpetual futures pairs like TOSHI and STBL? A5: Binance lists new pairs to expand its derivative offerings, enhance market liquidity for these assets, provide more diversification options for traders, and respond to growing market interest in emerging tokens.
