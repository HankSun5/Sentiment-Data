However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170. In November, and December the decline continued with SOL ending the year at the $125 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 18:40:50

Why Market Strategist Cut 10% BTC Exposure Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, has dropped a 10% allocation to Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, from his model portfolio. In his latest “Greed & Fear” newsletter release, the market strategist highlighted the rise of quantum computing as the reason behind this move. Wood highlighted his fears that the advances in quantum computing could threaten Bitcoin’s place and reputation as a dependable store of value, especially in the long term. As the expert said in his newsletter, the market is currently riddled with the fear that quantum computing could be just a few years away. This growing concern borders on quantum computers being hypothesized to have the capacity to breach the Bitcoin network’s cryptographic technology. It is believed that these computers can enable attackers to reverse-engineer private keys from public ones, thereby tampering with the integrity of blockchain transactions. Wood, who was an early institutional supporter of BTC , initially added the premier cryptocurrency to his model portfolio in December 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, the Jefferies global head of equity strategy expanded this Bitcoin allocation to 10%. However, the market expert appears to now be viewing the flagship cryptocurrency with a little bit of skepticism, as he believes that the Quantum threat is potentially existential, undermining its status as a store of value and “digital alternative to gold.” Hence, Wood refocused his model portfolio on older assets, splitting the 10% BTC allocation equally between physical gold and gold mining stocks. While there is no clear timeline for when quantum computers will reach the market, Wood is not the only one who has recently expressed concerns about the Quantum threat. In the past week, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has also discussed how Bitcoin has decoupled from global liquidity due to the quantum threat. Edwards wrote on X: The timeframe to a non-zero probability of a quantum machine breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is now less than the estimated time it will take to upgrade Bitcoin. Money is repositioning to account for this risk accordingly. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $95,370, reflecting a 0.3% dip in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Quantum Computing Threat|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 19:00:51

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/real-estate-investor-xrp-bulls-are-set-for-massive-rally-heres-the-signal/,"The cryptocurrency market is waking up to a fresh wave of excitement as XRP shows signs of breaking free from its previous consolidation phase. Early 2026 has already delivered notable gains for the digital asset, and analysts are now pointing to structural technical developments that could catalyze a major rally. Traders and investors are closely watching key price levels, volume trends, and market behavior for confirmation that XRP is transitioning from range-bound movement to a bullish uptrend. Gordon Highlights the Breakout On X, web3 investor Gordon drew attention to XRP’s recent price action, directly challenging bearish sentiment and highlighting a critical technical signal that could spark further upside. XRP Bulls are about to PRINT. Imagine being bearish here pic.twitter.com/r09tnWOBVJ — Gordon (@GordonGekko) January 17, 2026 He showcased a three-day XRP/USD chart on Binance illustrating a decisive breakout above a descending trendline , accompanied by rising trading volume. Gordon’s analysis emphasized that buyers have gained control, setting the stage for a potential surge that could catch hesitant bears off guard. Technical Analysis: Trendline Break and Volume Surge XRP’s breakout comes after months of a descending trend that had capped price movement. The breakout aligns with increased trading volume, signaling strong market conviction rather than a fleeting spike. Momentum indicators such as the 50- and 100-day EMAs now act as support, reinforcing the bullish case and suggesting that XRP has the technical foundation to pursue higher levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Support and Resistance Levels The current price structure shows that previous resistance zones around $2.00 have transformed into support, while near-term targets include the $2.88 region, derived from standard technical modeling. Sustaining momentum above these levels could propel XRP into an extended discovery phase, especially if institutional inflows and market demand remain robust. Market Context: A Favorable Environment for XRP XRP’s technical strength coincides with broader market resilience. Leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have maintained upward momentum, creating a supportive environment for altcoins. Reduced exchange supply , ETF-related inflows , and rising market confidence further reinforce the conditions for XRP to build on its early 2026 gains. Bulls Prepare for Potential Upside With a confirmed trendline breakout, rising volume, and supportive market dynamics, XRP bulls appear poised for a significant rally. While market volatility always presents risk, current indicators suggest that XRP has positioned itself for meaningful upward movement, rewarding traders who recognize the early signs of bullish momentum.

The 50-period moving average has crossed below the 200-period moving average, signaling potential weakness in the short-term trend. The development marks a sharp reversal from the optimistic sentiment that characterized early January. SHIB currently trades at $0.00000853, up 2.64% over the past 24 hours despite a bearish technical signal. Early 2026 Rally Proves Unsustainable Shiba Inu began the year with significant momentum. The token surged to $0.00001017 within the first few days of January, riding a wave of enthusiasm sweeping the meme coin market. The rally proved short-lived. Between January 6 and January 12, SHIB declined in six consecutive sessions out of seven trading days. Profit-taking activity accelerated as early buyers locked in gains from the initial price spike. A brief recovery attempt saw the token climb to $0.00000912. Bears quickly regained control, pushing prices lower once again. The subsequent sell-off drove SHIB down to $0.00000815, marking a two-day losing streak. Meme coins have struggled to maintain upward momentum. Traders appear increasingly willing to sell into strength rather than accumulate positions. The absence of new catalysts has left the sector vulnerable to quick reversals. Technical Patterns Show Mixed Signals The current hourly death cross is not the first such occurrence in recent weeks. SHIB experienced a similar pattern on December 31, 2025, as the previous year drew to a close. That bearish signal was quickly negated. A golden cross appeared on the hourly chart as 2026 began, coinciding with the strong price rally that followed. The rapid shift between bearish and bullish crossovers highlights the volatility inherent in short-term technical indicators. Source: TradingView Hourly moving average crossovers can signal important shifts in fast-moving markets. Their predictive value remains limited in many cases. The Shiba Inu price action demonstrates how quickly these patterns can reverse, particularly in high-volume, speculative assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 19:19:53
57251667,https://timestabloid.com/?p=95250,1768677697,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Challenge of Finding Regulated Operators for Niche Cryptocurrency Holders,https://timestabloid.com/the-challenge-of-finding-regulated-operators-for-niche-cryptocurrency/,"You’re likely always on the hunt to find out how to increase utility. Your digital portfolio extends far beyond the trading strategies. The move to utilize assets such as XRP or Shiba Inu for entertainment is a natural progression. It’s among many investors who desire real-life applications for their coins. The situation is complicated, however, as regulatory frameworks haven’t kept pace. They’ve struggled with the rapid spread of niche cryptocurrencies. Even though you have to go through a field of hay, BonusFinder makes it easier to find a reliable site. It ranks the operators according to particular requirements concerning coin support and licensing. You don’t want to entrust your online money to a site that hasn’t undergone stringent scrutiny by experts in the field. The abundance of new platforms emerging monthly means you can’t manually review them one by one. It’s impossible unless you’re professionally guided to do so. The Growing Demand for Utility Among Altcoin Holders Likely, you’ve already observed a significant change in the market for digital assets . They’re no longer regarded as pure stores of value nowadays. The owners of niche coins are also seeking platforms enabling them to make transactions directly. They won’t have to convert them to fiat currency. The need for speed necessitates this, along with reduced transaction costs and, to a certain degree, anonymity. They’re all key features of blockchain technology. Using your crypto directly has the advantage of saving time in the traditional banking system because it’s faster. You’ll keep all your money until you choose to use a service. This ensures your assets retain their long-term value, provided conditions don’t shift. You can use them where the context stays stable. Why Finding Regulated Operators Is a Major Challenge The primary issue is that even stringent regulatory authorities in jurisdictions like the United Kingdom or Malta lag. They’re extremely slow in licensing niche altcoins for use in regulated gaming. The vast majority of licensed operators are likely to remain in Bitcoin or Ethereum. It’s because compliance processes for these instruments are more developed. This leaves a considerable gap in the market on your hold should you own lesser market-cap coins. It’s common to be compelled to seek business elsewhere, beyond the highly controlled circles, to find operators that’ll accept your particular tokens. Such a search subjects you to a gray marketplace where the line between a legitimate business and a scam is fragile. The Hidden Dangers of Using Unlicensed Crypto Sites Whenever you decide to work on an unregulated site, you’re entering a digital world with no safety net whatsoever. The potential is much greater than losing a round in a game. You risk drowning because the software was rigged, and winning was merely a statistical impossibility. Moreover, unregulated services may not have the legal authority to accommodate withdrawal requests. Therefore, your money may be held without a reason. Another factor worth considering is the security of personal data, as these sites often use less secure protocols. Encryption and data protection aren’t as robust as those of licensed counterparts. The security breach may compromise the wallet address, allowing bad actors to access it. It’s exposing the transaction history on a disregarded site. Utilizing Verification Tools to Ensure Your Safety That’s when you consider the third-party verification to be a critical component of your plan. You’ll need a mechanism for sifting through the noise and identifying platforms to trust. Ensure they’re thoroughly audited in terms of fairness and security. Aggregator sites conduct the due diligence that you may not have the time to perform on your own. They verify that one of the operators is licensed and assess the responsiveness of customer service. They ensure that the random number generators in games are genuine and unbiased. With such resources, you can ease the burden of verifying your choice on your own. You’ll come across a list of approved, safe options that store your particular cryptocurrency.

Market participants are watching closely to see if the uptrend can continue or if the weekend liquidity will trigger a test of lower levels. The next few sessions could define BTC’s short-term trajectory. Key Support Holds: $94,630 Remains Crucial According to a recent post by Kamile Uray, Bitcoin is still holding strong above the $89,326 support level, and as long as it remains above this zone, the possibility for the uptrend to continue remains intact. This level continues to act as a critical foundation for bulls, keeping the market structure aligned with potential further gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Near-Identical Fractal Before The 2021 Bull Run Started If BTC manages to break through the $98,200 resistance, the next key target at $107,500 comes into focus. At this level, a decisive move will determine whether the current uptrend is complete or push Bitcoin even higher. A daily close above $107,500 would mark the first higher high on the daily chart relative to the last downward wave, signaling a potential continuation of the bullish trend. However, if BTC is rejected at resistance and falls back below $89,326, the downtrend could resume. Should a reversal form within the $83,822–$82,477 support zone, Bitcoin may attempt another upward push, giving bulls a chance to regain control. If BTC closes below $82,477, further downside is expected, potentially testing the $74,496–$71,237 region. This zone has historically served as a strong support area, and any confirmed reversal from here could set the stage for another bullish leg. Bitcoin Weekend Liquidity Ahead: Expect Range-Bound Action Crypto expert Lennaert Snyder outlined that Bitcoin is holding the key $94,630 support level, which also serves as the crucial H4 level to hold. On Friday, BTC retraced and briefly swept this low before stabilizing, reinforcing the importance of this zone for short-term market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Compresses Below $94K, But Possible Repeat Of 2025 Breakout Looms As we enter the weekend liquidity, Bitcoin is likely to trade within a defined range until Sunday evening or Monday. For bullish traders, the plan is to hold the low and watch for a market structure break above $95,820. Once this occurs, long positions could target the $97,960 monthly high. In anticipation of continued upside, only part of the position may be closed at the monthly high, letting 30%-40% run to capture further gains if momentum persists. However, if BTC loses the $94,630 support on the H4 and falls back into the previous range, a continuation toward lower lows becomes more likely. In that scenario, short positions would be considered after confirmation on a retest, giving traders a structured approach to managing risk and potential downside.

On Saturday, he woke up bright and early to announce that goods from eight NATO countries will face new tariffs , starting at 10% on February 1, and jumping to 25% by June 1, unless they agree to sell Greenland to the United States. The list includes Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Finland. In a Truth Social post, Trump wrote, “Until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” these tariffs will stay. He said this was a direct response to those countries sending troops to Greenland, something he clearly saw as an unwanted move into what he thinks should be American territory. Trump didn’t exactly explain why those countries were sending troops, but said, “They have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown.” He added , “This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.” Europe responds as Trump leans on tariff threat A day before posting the new tariff plan, Trump said he was considering using a similar strategy he used against foreign drug companies. “I may do that for Greenland too,” he said during a White House appearance Friday. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security.” The eight European countries didn’t waste time reacting. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen blasted the move. “We choose partnership and cooperation,” she said on Bluesky. “We choose our businesses. We choose our people.” She framed the tariffs not just as a trade issue but as a bigger threat to Western unity. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also responded, saying on Thursday that the defense of Greenland is a “common concern” for all NATO members. The timing of Trump’s announcement is not random. The U.S. military has been showing more interest in Greenland for months. Now, these European countries are doing the same. That seems to be what triggered Trump’s response. He’s trying to stop what he sees as others getting in the way of America’s Arctic plans. Senators challenge Trump’s claims and urge calm On the same day Trump posted about the tariffs, two U.S. senators landed in Copenhagen to try to cool things down. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska met with officials to push back on Trump’s narrative. “There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,” Coons told reporters Saturday. He said the trip was meant to “restore a sense of trust” with the region and challenge the idea that European troop deployments are part of some conspiracy. Both Coons and Murkowski said they viewed the presence of NATO troops in Greenland as a good sign, not a threat. “Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth… we should take as an encouraging signal,” Coons said. Murkowski also rejected the idea that the president’s position represents all of Washington. “You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,” she said. “Support for our friends and allies… should not be.” Trump’s new strategy may suggest that he’s stepping away from using military action to grab the island. But he’s not letting go of the idea. Greenland is still very much on his radar, and tariffs are now his weapon of choice. Behind the scenes, there’s also a legal fight brewing. Trump has been using a special law that gives presidents economic powers during emergencies. That’s how he’s been pushing out these tariffs. But the Supreme Court could rule on that law as early as next week, deciding if the whole thing holds up or not. Trump has used tariffs more than any president in modern history. He sees them not just as taxes, but as a tool to control what other countries do. Greenland is now just the latest battleground.

The meme coin made gains of over 100x, and this made several people crypto millionaires. However, for those who missed this investment opportunity, there is a new DeFi cryptocurrency that is currently creating a buzz during its presale, and this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Many people consider this to be the best cryptocurrency to buy at this moment since it is accumulating a strong community and has a genuine utility-based roadmap. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance’s DeFi lending and borrowing platform is expected to ensure that there is continuous on-chain demand, and this will enable those who are investing during its presale to enjoy tremendous gains through asymmetric growth potential. In fact, it is being predicted that an investment of $150 could multiply to gains of over 100x soon. Shiba Inu’s Consolidation Although Shiba Inu was one of the best performers in the previous cycle, it seems to have been stagnant since the start of 2026. The price of SHIB has begun an accumulation phase after touching the downside levels, meaning that it is no longer facing so many sell pressures, although it is also lacking momentum. The next major move for Shiba Inu could be experienced in the year 2026, targeting levels of $0.00014-$0.00039. Although there is some speculative use for SHIB, Mutuum Finance seems more attractive for investors looking for some useful value along with high growth potential. Presale Rewards Early Investors The presale of Mutuum Finance has already started yielding returns for early investors, starting at $0.01 in early 2025, rising to $0.04 in Phase 7, a massive 300% increase. Phase 8 is anticipated to start at $0.045, further reinforcing the importance of investing in the project at this early juncture. For example, an investor with $1,500 in the current price structure will see it rise to $1,800 when Phase 8 starts, securing a $300 profit before the market even begins. When Mutuum Finance finally enters the market with a price of $0.06, this particular investment will grow in value to $2,250, securing a $750 profit. Market experts believe that once it establishes itself in the market, even a meager investment of $150 in this phase could see it rise in value to $15,000 or more, making it the best cryptocurrency to purchase. Community Rewards The presale is also aided by an excellent community incentive structure. In a $100,000 giveaway , ten individuals will win $10,000. In addition, there is a $500 MUTM bonus for the top daily buyer. This has managed to attract interest in this project at an earlier stage, with potential to be the next crypto to explode. Dual Lending System: Flexibility and Returns The two-lending structure of Mutuum Finance is one of the important components of this project. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses automated liquidity pools that have variable interest rates. For example, if one invests $4,000 in ETH, it might generate an interest rate between 8% and 12% per annum. In this manner, without doing anything else, it is possible to generate an additional $320 to $480 per annum. The Peer-to-Peer system, on the other hand, lets users set interest rates by themselves. A lender might seek a higher interest rate in a volatile asset such as Shiba Inu. Security & Transparency Security is also a key part of this platform. The smart contract of this platform is audited by both Certik and Halborn Security. The contract also has safety features against liquidation and collateral. MUTM is set to be the next crypto to explode with its distinct lending mechanisms and a scalable and secure system. What Makes MUTM Stand Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) symbolizes much more than another cryptocurrency in an already saturated market. Its low entry fee of only $0.04, presale growth, dual lending platform, and Layer-2 scalability solution combine to represent an unprecedented investment opportunity for those looking to invest in the next crypto to explode. MUTM has all the right elements to bring growth-hungry investors to the table in a way that was represented in SHIB. As such, it has become known as the best crypto to buy today because of its perceived ability to be one of the next cryptos to explode.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-breaking-out-of-6-month-descending-wedge-heres-the-implication/,"XRP is capturing attention in early 2026 as price action nears a critical inflection point . After months of consolidation, the digital asset has compressed within a tightening structure, hinting at a potential breakout that could redefine short-term momentum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring key technical levels, anticipating a move that could unlock renewed upside and attract both retail and institutional participation. Bird Highlights the Wedge Breakout Potential On X, crypto analyst Bird (@Bird_XRPL) spotlighted XRP’s six-month descending wedge on Binance, with price trading around $2.07, roughly 15% below the wedge’s upper resistance near $2.38. Bird suggested that a single strong green candle could flip the chart’s structure bullishly, potentially accelerating XRP toward its all-time high of $3.84 from 2018. His observations reflect a broader consensus among technical traders that XRP sits on the cusp of a decisive move. XRP is ~15% from breaking out of this 6 month wedge. One strong green candle flips structure and opens the path toward all time highs very fast imo. This MAY VERY WELL be the moment. Hold your breath. Count to three. pic.twitter.com/IWwoK3jLGI — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 17, 2026 Technical Structure: Descending Wedge Dynamics A descending wedge forms when price makes progressively lower highs and lower lows that converge, indicating weakening selling pressure. In technical analysis, this pattern often precedes trend reversals to the upside. XRP’s wedge displays classic characteristics: diminishing volatility, contracting ranges, and steady accumulation, signaling that buyers may soon overpower sellers. To confirm the breakout, the price must move above the wedge’s upper boundary with increasing volume, ensuring genuine market conviction supports the advance. Current Price Action and Market Context Since late 2025, XRP has consolidated around the $2.00 mark while broader market factors—including institutional inflows and overall crypto market strength—have supported price stability. Early January 2026 saw XRP rally toward $2.34, demonstrating resilience and reinforcing the potential for the wedge breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Indicators such as rising on-chain activity, accumulation patterns, and alignment with other short-term bullish structures suggest that XRP’s price is primed for a swift upward trajectory once resistance yields. Implications of a Breakout A confirmed breakout above $2.38 would invalidate the six-month descending trend, creating a structural shift that could accelerate momentum toward higher targets. This scenario may attract renewed attention from both retail traders and institutional participants, amplifying buying pressure and potentially triggering a rapid advance. Conversely, failure to clear the resistance may maintain price within the wedge, prolonging sideways action but still preserving the setup for a future breakout. XRP’s current positioning within this descending wedge represents a pivotal moment for the asset’s short-term narrative, with the potential to catalyze a meaningful rally if buyers assert dominance.

Metaplanet recently purchased $632.5 million worth of Bitcoin and plans to accumulate 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, while Bitmine currently holds over 4.2 million ETH and aims to own 5% of all Ethereum in existence. Metaplanet’s Gerovich explains why companies choose Bitcoin Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, noted earlier today that most management teams do not discuss Bitcoin, and the few teams that do consider it must be willing to be misunderstood by the markets for years while they build their positions. In January 2026, Metaplanet made its largest Bitcoin purchase yet, buying 5,419 BTC for approximately $632.5 million, bringing its total holdings to 25,555 BTC. Metaplanet is now the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. The company is following a new strategy called the “555 Million Plan.” The goal is to accumulate 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. This would represent 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Metaplanet has since launched a U.S. subsidiary called Metaplanet Income Corp. that will focus on “Bitcoin income generation,” using financial tools like derivatives to create more value from their holdings. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum, controlling about 3.45% of the token’s total supply. Tom Lee’s ultimate goal, which Bitmine calls the “Alchemy of 5%,” is to own 5% of all Ethereum in circulation. The company’s Chairman, Thomas Lee, also known for his work at Fundstrat, believes Ethereum will see a major breakout in 2026. Standard Chartered also recently predicted that Ethereum could reach a price of $7,500 to $12,000 by 2026. If Ethereum reaches $12,000, Bitmine projections suggest its share price could rise significantly to $500. As Cryptopolitan reported during the week, Bitmine is investing $200 million into Beast Industries, the company founded by the famous YouTuber MrBeast. Bitmine plans to integrate DeFi services into MrBeast’s upcoming financial platforms, targeting those in his audience of over 450 million subscribers who are already comfortable with digital technology. Strategy, ETFs, and other corporate BTC, ETH reserves in 2026 Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, has continued with its “HODL” strategy in 2026, and as of January 12, it reported total holdings of 687,410 BTC. Financial analysts at TD Cowen recently raised their acquisition forecasts for the firm, predicting that Strategy will purchase approximately 155,000 Bitcoins during the 2026 fiscal year. In mid-January 2026, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a single-day inflow of $843.62 million, pushing total net inflows for these funds above $58 billion. Ethereum ETFs also raked in $175 million in a single day this month. Massive inflows of cash into the market have helped stabilize it, with Bitcoin trading near $95,000 and Ethereum at $3,367 as of January 17. Bitmine revealed that it plans to generate between $402 million and $433 million in annual pre-tax income through “staking” its Ethereum. The process will be done through the “Made in America Validator Network” (MAVAN), set to be launched in the first quarter of 2026. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

What was once viewed as a niche interest among tech enthusiasts is now gaining traction across broader segments of the state’s population. As residents become more curious about digital assets, conversations are shifting from speculation to understanding how BTC works and what it could mean for personal and regional economic resilience. Bitcoin As A Tool For Regional Economic Growth West Virginia has been making headlines in the Bitcoin space recently, particularly with fresh legislative moves as of January 2026. MartyParty revealed on X that the biggest current development is Senator Bill 143 (SB143), which was introduced this week by State Senator Chris Rose. This is officially titled the Inflation Protection Act of 2026, which would allow the state’s Board of Treasury Investment to allocate up to 10% of public funds into precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum. The bill requires any qualifying digital asset to have maintained an average market capitalization of at least $750 billion over the prior year, which qualifies only BTC. In addition, the bill also allows for regulated stablecoins , but only the US federal or state regulators can approve the assets. However, the bill frames this as a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation, and empowering the state treasurer to invest in BTC without directly naming it in most of the statute. Although the purpose section explicitly mentions empowering investment in gold, silver, and BTC. These assets would need to be made through qualified custodians, ETFs, or other secure frameworks. What Pension Funds And Endowments Think About Bitcoin The Bitcoin price prediction by funds indicates a bullish outlook for 2026. CryptoRank.io has mentioned that the institutional analysts are pricing in a bullish scenario for BTC in 2026. The average target across the forecasts shown is around $150,000 per BTC, implying roughly 75% upside from current levels. At the same time, longer-term valuation models assume a more gradual growth path . Popular asset manager VanEck predicts BTC could reach approximately $2.9 million by 2050, which equates to around 15% annualized growth broadly in line with the BTC historical long-term performance as a macro asset. In contrast to institutional forecasts, prediction markets maintain a more conservative outlook. On Polymarket , the pricing base-case range between $110,000 to $130,000. This consensus could shift toward the institutional targets if spot ETF inflows remain strong and if the US regulatory uncertainty continues to decline, including initiatives such as the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Chris Rose|CryptoRank.io|gold|Inflation Protection Act of 2026|Platinum|Polymarket|SB143|Senator Bill 143|silver|Spot ETF|Stablecoins|US Regulatory Uncertainty|vaneck,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 21:00:00

Although the second-largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the $3,300 price level, it could not break above $3,400 to continue its path towards higher price levels. As it stands, it appears that the Ether token is taking on a short-term bearish structure. However, an on-chain evaluation has recently been put out, which suggests that market participants might be gearing up for a significant move in the near-term. Related Reading: The Ethereum MACD Crossover That Could Lead To A Massive Bull Wave Ethereum Futures Activity Reaches Monthly High Following Market Inactivity In a recent QuickTake post on the CryptoQuant platform, analytics group Arab Chain reveals that there has recently been a spike in futures trading activity on the Binance derivatives market. This revelation is based on the Binance: ETH Futures Daily Volume metric, which monitors the total value of Ethereum futures contracts being traded on Binance each day, hence reflecting market activity, trader participation, and potential leverage exposure. The latest reading of the metric has highlighted a major shift, with trading volume climbing as high as $21.7 billion. According to Arab Chain, this reading marks the highest level since mid-December, reflecting that strong momentum has returned to the futures market. Notably, the spike in futures trading volume was preceded by a period of relative decline in the second half of December. This event coincides with a period of price stability, alongside a tapering risk appetite among traders. Interestingly, institutional investors also contributed prevalent aversion to risk. Arab Chain explains that the decline is a typical sign that market participants want to “wait and see,” instead of speculatively opening large positions. However, the present scenario — where futures volume surged — paints an opposing story. As the futures trading volume reflects levels above its mid-December high, it becomes apparent that interest among Ethereum traders is being rekindled. This is because increasing futures volume “is typically associated with higher leverage usage, hedging activity, and speculative positioning” — a line up which indicates that the market is preparing for significant movement. The reason for this spike could also be attributed to traders who are reacting to key technical levels or shifting expectations around near-term price action of a potential trend reversal. In the grand scheme, however, the Ethereum price reacts to this activity, depending on the alignment of spot demand with derivatives activity. Till such a definite sign comes up, the market stands at a point of uncertainty.

Commentators have noted that unlike previous spikes characterized by lower trading volumes, this surge seems to be backed by considerable trading activity and bullish market sentiments. Axie Infinity’s AXS is up over 100% in the past week According to data from Coingecko , Axie Infinity’s token $AXS went on a run today, surging by about 64% to approximately $2.02 and topping charts as the leader in the broader GameFi sector . Today’s rally comes after months of bearish movements and is happening as interest in the gaming sector is returning with multiple gaming tokens turning green, much to the delight of traders and investors. The price surge of the AXS token comes amid a marked improvement in daily trading volume, with the past 24 hours pulling in over $997M while the overall market cap stands at over $346M, indicating increased investor engagement. Analysts have attributed this positive price action to a return of investor appetite for high volatility sectors like GameFi as well as futures market activity and staking adjustments. The futures trading volume has exceeded $500M with open interest hovering around $44M, signaling short coverings and the creation of new positions. All that is happening amid recent changes to the project’s staking program as well as the introduction of new incentives, including an Axie Score rewards experiment scheduled for this year. More about Axie Infinity’s score reward The score reward is a metric that will reportedly reflect a player’s contributions to the Axie Infinity community, influencing governance and rewards. According to recent announcements, that reward will be transitioned into an app token version of AXS (bAXS). The token will be able to be spent in Axie core as well as staked. The team plans to integrate Axie’s reputation, the Axie score, into the selling mechanic. There will also be a variable fee, paid to the treasury, that gets charged to a seller of the token, with the fee reduced for those with higher tiers of Axie score. “A good day for $AXS, but the true story here is the structural changes to supply that we’re making this year,” the project’s cofounder wrote on X. According to more recent updates, bAXS (Bonded AXS) will be backed 1:1 by AXS and designed to keep value circulating within the ecosystem and rewarding its citizens. “This is the start of a transformative year for Axie Infinity, something is coming and the strongest will survive by working together as one digital nation,” one X post shared via the Axie Infinity account on X read. Which GameFi tokens are doing well in 2026? The GameFi sector is witnessing a resurgence in interest. The overall sector’s market cap is currently around $7 billion, up 6.3% in the past 24 hours. While Axie Infinity is leading the charge, it is not the only GameFi project witnessing bullish movement. Based on data from Coingecko , other tokens doing well in the GameFi sector include Ronin (RON), the Sandbox (SAND), Smooth Love Potion (SLP), Decentraland (MANA), and Illuvium (ILV). RON’s price has gone up by about 20% in the past 24 hours and 28% in the past seven days; SAND’s is up 30% in the past 24 hours and 32% over the past 7 days; SLP is up 14% in 24 hours and 16% over the past week; MANA is also up 21% in 24 hours and 18% over the past seven days and ILV is up 15% in 24 hours and 14% over the past seven days.

The records cover closed-door debates from 2020 and show how the Fed chair pushed hard for clear promises on interest rates , even as several officials warned the move could box the central bank in later. Those warnings stayed mostly private at the time. The September 2020 meeting took place six months into the pandemic, with rates already pinned near zero since March. Powell argued the moment demanded blunt guidance. He wanted the Fed to spell out exactly what had to happen before rates could rise again. The goal was to support a recovery he believed would take years, not months. Some policymakers objected. Most fell in line. Powell forces rate guidance through internal resistance The transcripts show Powell pressing for language that tied rate hikes to two conditions. One was maximum employment. The other was inflation reaching 2 percent and moving above that level for a period of time. That language went into the public statement after the meeting. At the time, inflation sat at 1.3 percent using the Fed’s preferred gauge. The median forecast showed inflation not hitting 2 percent until 2023. That forecast proved wrong. Inflation surged the next year and peaked at 7.2 percent in mid-2022. Still, many officials, including Powell, described the jump as transitory and waited to react. Two policymakers dissented in September 2020. Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan opposed locking in near-zero rates. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari wanted an even stronger commitment. Others shared Kaplan’s concern but did not vote. Those included Eric Rosengren in Boston, Tom Barkin in Richmond, and Raphael Bostic in Atlanta. Voting members Patrick Harker from Philadelphia and Loretta Mester from Cleveland also raised concerns. Mester called the new liftoff rules very significant. She said she would have preferred more discussion before making such a change. She still supported the final decision. Powell rejected waiting. He told colleagues the expansion was underway and policy messaging needed to support the long path back. He said delays could damage the Fed’s credibility after holding steady for six months. Powell said weaker guidance would repeat eight years of old Fed behavior The September debate followed a major policy overhaul announced a month earlier. The Fed changed how it handled inflation and jobs. Officials moved away from raising rates early just because unemployment fell. That old playbook had failed for years, as low joblessness did not spark inflation. The transcripts show Powell worried that markets and the public did not believe the Fed would stick to the new framework. He warned that weak guidance would sound like the same reaction function used for eight years. He pushed for strong wording to show the shift was real. Five years later, those conversations became public. The Fed releases edited minutes three weeks after each meeting, but full transcripts come out only after five years. Critics now argue that the firm guidance slowed the Fed’s response when inflation took off. In November 2022, after rate hikes were already underway, Powell publicly acknowledged regret. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, he said the guidance tying liftoff to both jobs and inflation was the one decision he would not repeat. He said it was not tied directly to the inflation surge, but still would not do it again. The transcripts also show Powell spotting COVID risks early. On March 2, 2020, before the virus hit the U.S. hard, he described rising concern after a G‑20 meeting in Riyadh. He said the virus was likely to spread worldwide. He told officials markets needed a clear signal that central banks understood the threat and would act fast to prevent tighter financial conditions. That day, the Fed cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

White House Could Withdraw Support For CLARITY Act The White House has threatened to withdraw its support for the crypto market structure bill following Coinbase’s sudden withdrawal. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, the White House is beside itself over Coinbase’s decision to withdraw its support for the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, calling the move a “unilateral action that blindsided the administration.” Terrett stated in a post on X, “The White House is said to be furious with Coinbase’s “unilateral” action on Wednesday, which it apparently was not notified of in advance, calling it a “rug pull” against the White House and the rest of the industry.” Terrett claimed her source believes the Trump administration may fully abandon the bill unless Coinbase returns to the negotiating table and agrees to a compromise on stablecoin yield provisions that would satisfy banking interests. The source added, “This is President Trump’s bill at the end of the day, not Brian Armstrong’s.” Visit the following links for more information on Husky Inu: Website: Husky Inu Official Website Twitter: Husky Inu Twitter Telegram: Husky Inu Telegram Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The bots tried to empty the wallet after it detected the deposited funds. The compromised wallet’s private key is a transaction identifier (txid). Specifically, it’s the coinbase txid of block 924,982. Bots exploit exposed private key On-chain data shows that Bitcoin bots drained funds from the compromised wallet within minutes. The SegWit wallet received 0.00020305 BTC through two transactions. However, it ended up with a zero balance and no unspent outputs left. Every incoming BTC transfer was quickly spent by bots. The first transaction sent 0.00018209 BTC to the address. At the same timestamp, the funds were spent out in a separate transaction with a fee rate of 12.8 sat/vB. The spending speed indicates an automated sweep. The second deposit added 0.00002096 BTC. The funds were again removed almost immediately. The bot paid 4.80 sat/vB then sent 0.00001572 BTC to an external address. Bots continuously monitor Bitcoin’s mempool for deposits sent to wallets derived from weak or publicly known private keys. A bitcoin mempool is a waiting area for unconfirmed transactions. Once funds appear, the bots already control the private key and can instantly sign withdrawal transactions. Bots instantly send replace-by-fee (RBF) transactions to compete by raising fees for miners to approve a withdrawal. An RBF or replace by fee, is a node policy that allows bots to replace an unconfirmed transaction with a new transaction that pays a higher fee to miners. On-chain fee data shows sudden jumps in satoshi-per-byte (sat/vB) rates. This indicates transactions being replaced with higher-fee versions. Only one transaction ultimately confirms, while competing versions are dropped or replaced. The balance history of the compromised BTC wallet. Source: mempool.space . Watching greedy bots send more aggressive RBF transactions can be somewhat entertaining. “Sometimes I send small transactions to compromised wallets, just to see the beauty in this automated RBFs,” said Brevsolution on X. But some people send larger amounts to compromised wallets, and the reason is unclear. “I’d really like to know why that happens,” said Ottosch on X. Such transactions could be a mistake from the sender’s side. In November, $70,000 was carelessly sent to a wallet linked to a predictable private key. Brevsolution explained that bots react instantly and use RBF to reduce transactions down to one satoshi. This causes the bots to pay almost 100% of the deposited BTC in fees. Bitcoin private keys could be compromised Weak private keys and seed phrases could be hacked. They are predictable like easy passwords. Storing the private key securely is essential to protect BTC. Exposing it or any other related data often leads to quick theft by hackers. Using a txid to hash a private key does not provide enough entropy to secure the private keys. Bitcoin private keys are just numbers. It is possible to derive a public address and private keys from block hashes and transaction IDs (txids). Any txid or block hash is a valid 256-bit number and can technically be used as a private key. Bots exploit this by precomputing addresses from known public data. Then they watch those addresses forever and drain them instantly. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Those looking to invest in projects that are in their early stages of development, Mutuum Finance provides substantial potential for growth, compared to Cardano’s ADA. With a total investment close to $20 million, along with over 18,800 supporters, this project has all it takes to exceed the projected growth of Cardano’s ADA. Cardano (ADA): Stable, Yet Limited Momentum Cardano recently bounced out of its $0.32-$0.34 support area, retesting nearby levels of consolidation to make a small higher low on rising volume. Current levels for support are $0.38-$0.39, and a breakout above $0.45-$0.46 may place ADA on a steady course for $0.48-$0.50. Although this is a sign of strength, the current short-term momentum is decidedly measured, reflecting the fact that ADA may have far more conservative investment potential than Mutuum Finance. Investors seeking a new crypto with strong growth potential find MUTM far better than Cardano. MUTM Price Prediction: Could It Reach $1? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now at Phase 7 of its presale stage at a price of $0.04, having increased from $0.01, thus realizing a 300% profit for those who invested during the first stage. Additionally, with the launch price at $0.06, those who participate in the presale today can look forward to realizing additional gains before it even reaches the exchanges. This new crypto represents one of the most promising avenues for investors seeking outsized returns in 2026. As the dual-lending protocol gains more adoption, MUTM may reach $1. This will be an astonishing 2,400% jump from the current $0.04 per token price. Those who invest in the presale will greatly benefit from this potential upside. Take, for instance, an investment in Phase 7 valued at $3,000; this will be able to rise to $4,500 upon the launch of the marketplace, yielding an instant profit of $1,500. With MUTM potentially hitting $1 in value, this investment will be able to rise to $75,000. Such returns make it the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for enormous gains. Layer 2 Integration Makes DeFi More Accessible Historically, gas prices have been an issue for small investors in the Ethereum network. Take, for example, an individual locking $2,000 worth of ETH to borrow stablecoins in Mutuum Finance. The total cost of deposit, borrow, repay, and withdraw would easily surpass $20. In this regard, Mutuum Finance’s Layer-2 and multi-chain focus will make this entire process cost less than a dollar. The cost savings will enable small investors to participate in DeFi with ease.

Lots of developers spent their holiday break testing the newest version, Claude Opus 4.5, which runs on their computers. Tech firms have been using code-writing AI for years, and the older ones worked about as well as a new hire. What people are seeing now feels different. Malte Ubl runs technology at Vercel, which helps build and host websites for people using Claude Code. He finished a tough project in one week that he says would have taken him a year on his own. Ubl worked 10 hours every day during his vacation, making new software. He compared the good feeling from each win to pulling a slot machine lever in Vegas. Google has been getting most of the attention lately after showing off a really good AI model and tools. But people who follow this stuff closely are still talking about what Anthropic just put out. Claude’s website traffic more than doubled in December compared to last year, and daily visitors on computers went up 12 percent around the world versus last month. That’s based on numbers from Similarweb and Sensor Tower. The AI agent revolution finally arrives Tech experts have been saying for a while that AI “agents” would be able to do almost anything for us, but that hasn’t really happened yet. For lots of users, Claude Code was the first time they saw this kind of AI work. It gave them an idea of what might be coming. People are using it to look at government money data, fix broken wedding photos, build websites from nothing, answer tons of emails, or get food delivered. My annual MRI scan gives me a USB stick with the data, but you need this commercial windows software to open it. Ran Claude on the stick and asked it to make me a html based viewer tool. This looks… way better. pic.twitter.com/6bAR7N4Vt6 — tobi lutke (@tobi) January 11, 2026 Shopify’s CEO Tobias Lütke wrote on X that he used it to make software that looks at his MRI scan. Boris Cherny, who’s in charge of Claude Code, said one person hooked up a camera and watched their tomato plants grow with it. “It’s just so different than the AI that came before,” Cherny said. Since so many regular people wanted to try it, Cherny and his team made a version called Cowork. Instead of the old-school command line screen that the main version has, Cowork looks friendlier and easier to use. They built it in about 10 days, using Claude Code. Anthropic’s market position strengthens Anthropic, which people think will go public this year , has always focused on making AI that’s really good at coding first, then at “tooling”, which means the AI can use different software without much help from people. Most tests show it’s the best at coding, and it’s also one of the best at tooling, based on research from UC Berkeley. Now people want to know what happens next . “The bigger story here is going to be when this goes beyond software engineering,” said David Hsu, who runs Retool, a business-AI startup.

The data points to a sharp concentration of activity on one network, even as most other Ethereum scaling chains struggled to clear $5,000 in fees over the same 24-hour period. Base Pulls Ahead as Fee Data Shows Widening Gaps CryptoRank said Base’s share of total Ethereum L2 revenue was nearing 70% based on the January 14 snapshot, while all other L2s combined brought in just over $15,000. Linea posted around $4,500 in fees, Optimism $2,400, Unichain $2,000, Ink $1,500, zkSync $900, and Scroll $600, showing how thin fee generation remains outside the top tier. The fee figures quickly set off debate on social media, especially after some users pointed to Polygon’s much higher revenue on the same day. Crypto analyst Vadim and X user New York Pascal both posted that Polygon recorded about $155,000 in daily fees, slightly above Base’s total, based on a network-wide revenue table from DefiLlama shared within hours of CryptoRank’s post. That comparison led to questions about how Polygon should be classified. X user Thorex asked whether Polygon is an L2 at all, reflecting a long-running discussion in the community about Polygon’s mix of scaling solutions, including its proof-of-stake chain and newer zero-knowledge products. The distinction matters because CryptoRank’s post focused specifically on Ethereum L2s, while Polygon’s revenue figures often include activity from its broader ecosystem. DefiLlama’s revenue table showed Tron at the top across all chains with more than $1 million in daily fees, followed by Polygon, Base, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and Arbitrum. Within that wider context, Base still ranked near the top for Ethereum-aligned networks, even if it was not the highest-earning chain overall. Ecosystem Growth Adds Context to Base’s Fee Strength Base’s recent fee performance comes as Coinbase continues to expand products built on the network. Late last year, the exchange launched its tokenized “Everything app,” a rebranded version of Coinbase Wallet that blends social content, trading, and payments in one interface. The company said the app, now live in more than 140 countries, is built on Base and uses tokenized posts and assets that can be traded directly from a social-style feed. The launch introduced new ways for users to interact on-chain, including earning from content engagement and settling rewards instantly to their wallets. While Coinbase has not published a direct link between the app and daily fee totals, the timing helps explain why Base continues to attract activity compared with other L2s that lack a similar consumer-facing funnel.

According to a technical analysis shared by CasiTrades on X, XRP may still have one more bullish push ahead before the structure turns lower. The chart showing the analysis outlines a developing Elliott Wave sequence that could first lift XRP’s price higher, then open the door to a breakdown if support levels fail. Related Reading: Ethereum On Fire: User Growth Sparks Massive Activity Spike B Wave Dips Hint At Coming Wave C Surge Technical analysis of XRP’s price action on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart by CasiTrade proposes an interesting outlook that shows XRP might end up correcting below $2 in the coming days. This correction, however, will only play out after XRP finishes a Wave C move that takes its price above $2.2. The wave C, in turn, is expected to play out after the recent pullback to $2.03 in the past 48 hours. According to CasiTrades, XRP’s recent pullback unfolded as a deeper B wave than initially expected. Instead of forming a tight consolidation, price traced out a full ABC move and fell into the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement around $2.09. This depth, however, does not invalidate the structure. Such a move is consistent with a B wave in the Elliott Wave theory. This retracement coincides with clustered Fibonacci levels and prior intraday support, and the next possible move from here is the next leg higher within the larger Wave 2 structure. Now that the B wave is likely in place, the attention is towards the anticipated C wave push. CasiTrades identifies the golden retracement near $2.26 as the primary upside target, with a possible extension into the $2.28 region where the golden pocket and the 1.236 extension converge. The chart highlights this zone as a dense resistance area, reinforced by prior reaction highs and overlapping Fibonacci projections. This C wave is expected to subdivide into five smaller waves. If this plays out as expected, XRP’s price action should feel bullish through its clean subwave development. However, the way price behaves as it approaches and reacts to the $2.26 to $2.28 band will be critical for confirming the broader outlook and if a correction is next. XRP Price Chart. Source: @CasiTrades on X A Post-C Rejection Could Drag XRP To $1.65 The current focus is on a possible push higher, but there’s still a downside risk after the C wave is complete. The analyst expects a rejection that could become the beginning of a larger Wave 3 move to the downside after XRP reaches the projected levels around $2.26 to $2.28. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record Levels As Buterin Urges Builders To Deliver Real Apps If that rejection materializes cleanly, XRP could begin a sustained move lower, with the macro support region around $1.65 coming back into focus. Confirmation of this bearish path, however, depends on how the C subwaves form and whether price delivers a decisive rejection.

This has sparked questions on whether this was just a mere bear market rally or the bull run is back on track. Here’s what CryptoQuant, which called the bear market earlier, has to say about the latest Bitcoin price rally. BTC Still In Bear Market Despite Improving Conditions: CryptoQuant On Friday, January 16, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant revealed in its latest report that the Bitcoin demand conditions are becoming less negative following the recent rally above $97,000. This on-chain observation comes a few weeks after the firm said the BTC apparent demand — at the time — was pointing to the start of a bear market. The confirmation of the bear market came after the price of Bitcoin fell below the 365-day moving average — a level that has historically determined bull and bear phases. However, the premier cryptocurrency has been on an upward trajectory since breaking beneath this level, up by approximately 21% since late November 2025. In its research report, CryptoQuant noted that while the price of BTX is approaching the 365-day moving average, it has yet to reclaim the technical level, which currently lies around $101,000. The analytics firm further mentioned acts as a “regime boundary” during bear markets — as seen in past cycles, triggering price rejections before renewed downside. In addition to the technical hurdles, CryptoQuant noted that while the Bitcoin demand conditions have improved “at the margin” , they still signal market weakness. “US spot indicators such as the Coinbase Premium briefly turned positive, while U.S. ETFs merely paused net selling after offloading ~54K BTC in November, rather than showing sustained accumulation,” the firm added. CryptoQuant also highlighted that on-chain spot demand continues to decline, with apparent demand down by about 67,000 BTC over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund inflows have broadly remained below levels often correlated with durable bullish market recoveries. At the same time, the rising BTC exchange inflows do not spread optimism but rather increase downside risk. Data from CryptoQuant shows that transfers to centralized exchanges climbed to a 7-day average of approximately 39,000 BTC, the highest level since late November. According to the firm, this is a tell-tale sign of increasing sell-side pressure after relief rallies . Going by this, it appears that while the market conditions are somewhat improving favorably for price, Bitcoin is still in the bear cycle that started less than two months ago.

The ability to sustain strength after recent gains highlights improving market structure, suggesting that buyers remain in control. As long as ETH stays supported above its critical trend levels, the broader upside narrative remains intact despite near-term hesitation. Daily Bull Market Support Band Holds As Key Reversal Zone Luca, in a recent ETH update shared on X, pointed out that Ethereum’s market structure has strengthened considerably over the past several days. The price has been able to hold above the 1D Bull Market Support Band, a level that has acted as a reliable reversal zone multiple times over the last couple of months. This sustained hold suggests improving market confidence and a reduction in immediate downside risk. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Pushes Toward Breakout Levels, Bulls Smell Opportunity Alongside this structural improvement, ETH successfully reclaimed the 0.618 Fibonacci point of interest around the $3,100 region. This level is often viewed as a critical threshold in corrective phases, and holding above it typically signals that buyers are gaining the upper hand. Despite the positive developments, Ethereum has not moved higher without hesitation. ETH’s price recently faced rejection near the 0.5 Fibonacci level around $3,400, an outcome Luca noted was largely expected. Historically, this area has acted as a significant decision point, often attracting selling pressure and temporary pullbacks before the market decides on its next direction. Looking forward, Luca believes the overall outlook remains constructive as long as ETH continues to trade above the 1D Bull Market Support Band and the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Maintaining these supports would keep the path open for renewed upside attempts, even if short-term consolidations occur, and the analyst’s positioning remains unchanged. ETH Above Daily 200MA, Structure Remains Constructive According to a recent post by Daan Crypto Trades, Ethereum is still advancing gradually while respecting the Daily 200-day moving average against Bitcoin. This type of slow, methodical grind often signals strength beneath the surface, suggesting that buyers remain in control even without aggressive momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Q1 Outlook: Analyst Shares Historical Setup As Price Nears Key Resistance The analyst explained that prolonged consolidations and steady climbs like this typically resolve with an acceleration phase. Should ETH break out with stronger upside momentum, it could serve as a trigger for renewed interest across the altcoin market, helping lift sentiment and price action. However, the structure remains conditional. Holding the Daily 200MA, highlighted in purple, is critical to maintaining this constructive setup. In parallel, Bitcoin must stay above the $94,000 level to maintain the broader low-timeframe bullish structure. As long as these conditions are met, the path of least resistance continues to favor further upside.

The move was fueled by increasingly positive sentiment about US legislation on cryptocurrencies and ongoing inflows into XRP spot ETFs. Volatility remains high, however. News out of the US Senate about the Market Structure Bill led to profit-taking after the rally, highlighting how XRP will continue to be at the mercy of political and judicial news for a while longer. As the price nears $2.5 and beyond, many seekers of the best cryptocurrency to buy now are turning attention to a new token in the vicinity of $0.04 offering significantly higher upside potential. XRP Rally Faces Resistance XRP has moved further on headlines than on consolidated, organized growth. The asset was up about 15% after initial development on US cryptocurrency laws, only to retreat after legislators developed cold feet over expanding regulatory purview. Bulls continue to defend the $2 level, but risks persist. Moving from $2.30 to $3 would represent less than a $1 profit per coin, which, for smaller investors looking to maximize returns, minimizes the gains that can be achieved. In this environment, traders looking at what cryptocurrency to buy now are delving deeper than large-cap assets. While XRP as an asset remains important, due to its scale and political factors, the near-term potential for profits is more muted compared with the cheapest cryptocurrency to buy now. Presale Growth at $0.04 Mutuum Finance is a novel cryptocurrency, which is relevant due to its rising stability. The project has been able to raise $19,800,000 in funds since the presale started and claimed 18,820 holders. Phase 7 is in operation and is selling well at the price of $0.04 per unit. Its price has already risen nearly 300% from the first stage costing $0.01. Phase 8 will be at $0.045 where buyers who paid $0.04 will be offered an opportunity to gain early value. The present value of a 200-dollar investment would allow the investment to provide 5,000 tokens. Assuming that the price increases 30 times within 90 days this will be equivalent to $6,000. This high potential makes Mutuum one of the best cryptocurrencies to purchase at the moment. Mutuum Finance is also introducing a lending platform that will enable individuals to make income without selling their properties. A user is able to provide $4,000 in stablecoins and earn 12% per year, which is approximately $480 within a twelve month time period. On the other hand, a borrower can access a loan of $4,200 with a $6000 collateral on an asset like Ethereum at a 70% loan-to-value ratio, which meets their expenses without the necessity to sell the ETH. Rewards and Supply Management The supply of tokens is 4 billion with 45% being in the presale. The number of the sold tokens exceeds 850 million. Mutuum protocol will do buybacks and allocate rewards. Part of the protocol revenue will be allocated to repurchasing tokens on the market and re-distributing them to stakers. An individual who has staked $5000 in Mutuum Finance’s safety module, would for instance be awarded $500 in additional MUTM, a model that awards long-term commitment to the project. Security & Transparency Indicators To further bolster interest, security and transparency have been improved. An independent audit by Halborn Security has been completed, with the team implementing all recommendations in preparation for the release. Industry insiders report that many DeFi projects which failed did not pass audits, making this relevant. Mutuum has also introduced a dashboard complete with a top-50 holder leaderboard along with a $500 MUTM bonus for the top daily MUTM buyer. These are just some of the improvements to ensure ongoing activity and growth. XRP has the potential to reach $3 or higher if the legislative developments go its way, but upside seems limited for new entrants. With a more favorable entry point, explicit mechanisms for rewarding holders, and better growth economics, Mutuum Finance ranks as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now and, in particular, the best affordable option to consider as 2026 progresses, at $0.04 in Phase 7.

57258397,658132,1768698009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57258397.jpeg,Crypto Regulation: Nigerian SEC Raises Capital Requirement For Exchanges To N2 Billion,https://bitcoinist.com/nigerian-sec-capital-crypto-exchanges-to-n2-billion/,"Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, is paying vast attention to its rapidly developing cryptocurrency industry marked by a string of new regulations. In the latest development, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shared a revised minimum capital for all regulated market entities, including operators in the digital asset market. Nigerian Regulator Hikes Minimum Capital For Crypto Exchanges By $1.05M On January 16, 2026, the Nigerian SEC released a circular communicating changes in the minimum capital (MC) requirements for major financial entities, namely: core and non-core capital market operators, market infrastructure institutions, capital market consultants, financial technology (FinTech) operators, virtual asset service providers (VASPs), and commodity market intermediaries. The securities regulator has explained that the revised MC framework is to boost operational resilience, align capital adequacy, promote market stability, and support innovation in nascent market segments such as the cryptocurrency industry. In relation to VASPs, the minimum capital for digital asset exchanges (DAX) and digital asset custodians has been increased from N500 million ($352,000) to N2 billion ($1.4 million). Meanwhile, all digital assets offering platforms (DAOP) responsible for issuance and primary sale of digital assets to the public are expected to meet a capital threshold of N1 billion ($704,111). Notably, the Nigerian SEC’s new circular expands its recognition of multiple VASPs that had been operating in a regulatory void. These include the ancillary virtual assets service providers (AVASPs) who provide auxiliary services such as blockchain analytics tools, etc who are now mandated to operate with a minimum capital of N300 million ($211,200). Under the new regime, the base capital requirements for both digital assets intermediary (DAI) and digital assets platform operators (DAPO) have also been placed at N500 million ($352,000). In new additions, real-world assets tokenization and offering platforms (RATOP) now have a set minimum capital requirement of N1billion ($704,111). According to the SEC, all concerned entities are advised to comply with the new regime on or before June 30, 2027, as failure to do so will result in penalties, including suspension or withdrawal of registration, as determined by the Commission. Nigeria Government Increases Focus On Crypto Industry Aside from the SEC’s recent circular, other developments indicate that the Nigerian government is increasing its participation in the cryptocurrency market. Notably, the new Nigeria Tax Administration Act (2025) now requires all digital asset activity to be linked to Tax Identification Numbers (TIN) and National Identification Numbers (NIN), effectively capturing the nascent industry as a new tax base. These recent measures follow a recent partnership by the SEC and the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) focused on cracking down on Ponzi scheme operators and other similar scams.",Crypto regulation|crypto exchanges|digital asset exchanges|minimum capital requirements|Nigeria|Nigerian SEC|VASPs,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|DAI|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-18 01:00:09

He said the claim was false and blasted The Wall Street Journal for publishing it without asking him. Trump also said Jamie isn’t fit for the position and slammed JPMorgan for how they treated him after the January 6th Capitol protest. “There was never such an offer,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story.” He said the meeting never happened and accused Jamie of pretending it was some joke. Trump also said that:- “Also, one was led to believe that I offered Jamie Dimon the job of Secretary of the Treasury, but that would be one that he would be very interested in. The problem is, I have Scott Bessent doing a fantastic job, A SUPERSTAR — Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either.” Trump plans lawsuit against JPMorgan over account closure Trump also said he will sue JPMorgan Chase for shutting down his accounts after January 6th, calling it “inappropriate and incorrect debanking.” He said the protest was justified and added, “The Election was RIGGED!” The lawsuit, he said, will be filed within two weeks. Back in August 2025, Trump signed an executive order telling banks they can’t reject clients based on their political or religious views. He has said banks have targeted him personally. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America both refused to take his deposits after his first term ended. He gave no proof but said it was all political. JPMorgan responded by saying they don’t shut accounts over political beliefs. Bank of America wouldn’t comment on individual clients but said they would welcome clearer rules from regulators. This isn’t the first time Trump and his family have called out banks. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said they had trouble accessing regular banking services. That, he said, is what pushed them into crypto. “So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, ‘hey, this is the next cool thing,’ we got into it out of necessity,” Donny Jr. said. Now Trump is going after JPMorgan in court, but he’s also been going after the banks in policy. He wants a hard cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. The banking sector reacted fast. JPMorgan shares dropped around 5% over the last week, even though the company beat expectations in its latest earnings report. Other major bank stocks also fell after Trump gave them until January 20 to comply. The Wall Street Journal had claimed Trump offered the Federal Reserve job to Jamie during a meeting at the White House months ago. Jerome Powell’s current Fed chair term ends on May 15,.

According to technical analysis, if BTC fails to continue its uptrend, it could repeat the bear-market crash from past cycles, potentially dragging its price down by double-digit percentages. Bitcoin Price To Repeat 2022 Bear Market Crash? Crypto analyst Tyrex believes that Bitcoin may be approaching a critical turning point if the current uptrend fails to hold. In his latest BTC price outlook on X, he compares the current market structure to the April 2022 cycle, when Bitcoin made an ATH and then crashed hard for weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum On Fire: User Growth Sparks Massive Activity Spike Tyrex disclosed that Bitcoin dropped roughly 45% from its all-time high in 2022 before entering an extended consolidation phase that lasted nearly four months. The accompanying chart shows that during that period, prices respected clear horizontal boundaries, creating a false sense of strength and stability, all while underlying weakness continued to build. That consolidation eventually led to an upside fakeout, with the Bitcoin price briefly breaking resistance before reversing sharply. Unfortunately, the rejection triggered a continuation of the broader downtrend that year, resulting in another aggressive price crash that wiped out remaining bullish confidence. According to Tyrex, BTC’s current chart structure closely mirrors the same historical setup from 2022. Bitcoin has once again pulled back sharply after reaching an all-time high of over $126,000. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has spent roughly two months consolidating within a defined range, repeatedly stalling at resistance levels. Tyrex warns that Bitcoin is barely holding above $95,000, which aligns with the resistance zone shown on the chart. If price fails to recover and continues to stall near this level, the move higher could turn out to be a fakeout, potentially leading to another sharp dump— just as it did in 2022. The red-shaded area on the chart shows how far BTC could crash if the uptrend breaks, with the analyst projecting an 11.04% drop to the $86,000-$84,000 range. Bitcoin Set For March ATH And May Flash Crash Another forecast from market expert CryptoXLarge outlines where Bitcoin could be headed over the next four months. The analyst bases the outlook on historical market behavior, suggesting the current cycle may be replicating past cycle peaks. CryptoXLarge points to January 2026 as a phase of quiet accumulation with controlled price action and muted volatility. February is expected to bring a powerful rally as momentum builds rapidly and buyers push the BTC price higher. This surge could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high around $240,000 in March.

The forecast concludes with a warning of a flash crash in May 2026, during which prices could pull back to fresh lows.

In a detailed note shared on X, Bons noted that Bitcoin is moving toward total collapse within the next seven to 11 years, which is going to be caused by the way the network pays for its security and the continued fall of block rewards. Reduced Miner Payouts To Cause Complete Bitcoin Collapse? Bitcoin is known for its halving cycle, which reduces the block rewards given to miners by about 50% every 210,000 blocks, which comes up to about roughly four years. Bons’ critique focuses on this event as the reason why Bitcoin’s network security will finally fail and cause a complete collapse of the leading cryptocurrency. As each halving cuts the block rewards further, Bons believes Bitcoin is drifting toward a point where it can no longer reliably fund the miners who protect the network, setting off a chain of risks that become harder to ignore with every cycle. Many Bitcoin proponents will argue that the Bitcoin network is still highly secure due to the rising hashrate. However, according to Justin Bons, hashrate can rise even while real security is weakening because advances in mining hardware reduce the cost of producing hashes. The most important thing is how much money is actually being made by miners , since that figure represents the profitability and the cost an attacker would have to match or exceed. Charts tracking block rewards and miner revenue show that, in economic terms, Bitcoin’s security is already lower than it was several years ago. Keeping security at current levels, he says, would require either transaction fees so high that users would simply stop using the network or the price of Bitcoin to double every four years at a pace that would quickly outpace the size of the global economy. Bitcoin Miner Revenue. Source: @Justin_Bons on X Prediction: Bitcoin To Plunge In Two To Three Halvings The seven to 11-year timeframe Bons outlined for Bitcoin’s collapse is tied directly to its halving schedule. According to the industry expert, the cost of attacking the Bitcoin network for a sustained period could fall into territory that makes such attacks financially attractive within two to three more halvings. If miner payouts are low enough, Bons believes the potential rewards from hitting multiple exchanges or protocols could outweigh the cost of carrying out the attack. The most realistic scenario for this to happen is through double-spend attacks against exchanges. An attacker controlling 51% of the entire mining power could deposit Bitcoin, trade it for another asset, withdraw those funds, and then roll back the blockchain to reclaim the original coins. He also highlights data showing that Bitcoin’s security budget relative to its total market value has been trending downward for years. This means Bitcoin does not automatically become safer as it grows larger. Bitcoin Security Budget as % of Market Cap. Source: @Justin_Bons This leaves Bitcoin facing an eventual breaking point. From here, it is either the network increases its fixed 21 million supply cap to restore miner incentives, a move that would likely split the chain, or the entire Bitcoin ecosystem accepts the risk of double-spend attacks.
