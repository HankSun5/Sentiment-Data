However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170. In November, and December the decline continued with SOL ending the year at the $125 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-17 18:40:50

Why Market Strategist Cut 10% BTC Exposure Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, has dropped a 10% allocation to Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, from his model portfolio. In his latest “Greed & Fear” newsletter release, the market strategist highlighted the rise of quantum computing as the reason behind this move. Wood highlighted his fears that the advances in quantum computing could threaten Bitcoin’s place and reputation as a dependable store of value, especially in the long term. As the expert said in his newsletter, the market is currently riddled with the fear that quantum computing could be just a few years away. This growing concern borders on quantum computers being hypothesized to have the capacity to breach the Bitcoin network’s cryptographic technology. It is believed that these computers can enable attackers to reverse-engineer private keys from public ones, thereby tampering with the integrity of blockchain transactions. Wood, who was an early institutional supporter of BTC , initially added the premier cryptocurrency to his model portfolio in December 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, the Jefferies global head of equity strategy expanded this Bitcoin allocation to 10%. However, the market expert appears to now be viewing the flagship cryptocurrency with a little bit of skepticism, as he believes that the Quantum threat is potentially existential, undermining its status as a store of value and “digital alternative to gold.” Hence, Wood refocused his model portfolio on older assets, splitting the 10% BTC allocation equally between physical gold and gold mining stocks. While there is no clear timeline for when quantum computers will reach the market, Wood is not the only one who has recently expressed concerns about the Quantum threat. In the past week, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has also discussed how Bitcoin has decoupled from global liquidity due to the quantum threat. Edwards wrote on X: The timeframe to a non-zero probability of a quantum machine breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is now less than the estimated time it will take to upgrade Bitcoin. Money is repositioning to account for this risk accordingly. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $95,370, reflecting a 0.3% dip in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Quantum Computing Threat|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 19:00:51

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/real-estate-investor-xrp-bulls-are-set-for-massive-rally-heres-the-signal/,"The cryptocurrency market is waking up to a fresh wave of excitement as XRP shows signs of breaking free from its previous consolidation phase. Early 2026 has already delivered notable gains for the digital asset, and analysts are now pointing to structural technical developments that could catalyze a major rally. Traders and investors are closely watching key price levels, volume trends, and market behavior for confirmation that XRP is transitioning from range-bound movement to a bullish uptrend. Gordon Highlights the Breakout On X, web3 investor Gordon drew attention to XRP’s recent price action, directly challenging bearish sentiment and highlighting a critical technical signal that could spark further upside. XRP Bulls are about to PRINT. Imagine being bearish here pic.twitter.com/r09tnWOBVJ — Gordon (@GordonGekko) January 17, 2026 He showcased a three-day XRP/USD chart on Binance illustrating a decisive breakout above a descending trendline , accompanied by rising trading volume. Gordon’s analysis emphasized that buyers have gained control, setting the stage for a potential surge that could catch hesitant bears off guard. Technical Analysis: Trendline Break and Volume Surge XRP’s breakout comes after months of a descending trend that had capped price movement. The breakout aligns with increased trading volume, signaling strong market conviction rather than a fleeting spike. Momentum indicators such as the 50- and 100-day EMAs now act as support, reinforcing the bullish case and suggesting that XRP has the technical foundation to pursue higher levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Support and Resistance Levels The current price structure shows that previous resistance zones around $2.00 have transformed into support, while near-term targets include the $2.88 region, derived from standard technical modeling. Sustaining momentum above these levels could propel XRP into an extended discovery phase, especially if institutional inflows and market demand remain robust. Market Context: A Favorable Environment for XRP XRP’s technical strength coincides with broader market resilience. Leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have maintained upward momentum, creating a supportive environment for altcoins. Reduced exchange supply , ETF-related inflows , and rising market confidence further reinforce the conditions for XRP to build on its early 2026 gains. Bulls Prepare for Potential Upside With a confirmed trendline breakout, rising volume, and supportive market dynamics, XRP bulls appear poised for a significant rally. While market volatility always presents risk, current indicators suggest that XRP has positioned itself for meaningful upward movement, rewarding traders who recognize the early signs of bullish momentum.

The 50-period moving average has crossed below the 200-period moving average, signaling potential weakness in the short-term trend. The development marks a sharp reversal from the optimistic sentiment that characterized early January. SHIB currently trades at $0.00000853, up 2.64% over the past 24 hours despite a bearish technical signal. Early 2026 Rally Proves Unsustainable Shiba Inu began the year with significant momentum. The token surged to $0.00001017 within the first few days of January, riding a wave of enthusiasm sweeping the meme coin market. The rally proved short-lived. Between January 6 and January 12, SHIB declined in six consecutive sessions out of seven trading days. Profit-taking activity accelerated as early buyers locked in gains from the initial price spike. A brief recovery attempt saw the token climb to $0.00000912. Bears quickly regained control, pushing prices lower once again. The subsequent sell-off drove SHIB down to $0.00000815, marking a two-day losing streak. Meme coins have struggled to maintain upward momentum. Traders appear increasingly willing to sell into strength rather than accumulate positions. The absence of new catalysts has left the sector vulnerable to quick reversals. Technical Patterns Show Mixed Signals The current hourly death cross is not the first such occurrence in recent weeks. SHIB experienced a similar pattern on December 31, 2025, as the previous year drew to a close. That bearish signal was quickly negated. A golden cross appeared on the hourly chart as 2026 began, coinciding with the strong price rally that followed. The rapid shift between bearish and bullish crossovers highlights the volatility inherent in short-term technical indicators. Source: TradingView Hourly moving average crossovers can signal important shifts in fast-moving markets. Their predictive value remains limited in many cases. The Shiba Inu price action demonstrates how quickly these patterns can reverse, particularly in high-volume, speculative assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-17 19:19:53
57251667,https://timestabloid.com/?p=95250,1768677697,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Challenge of Finding Regulated Operators for Niche Cryptocurrency Holders,https://timestabloid.com/the-challenge-of-finding-regulated-operators-for-niche-cryptocurrency/,"You’re likely always on the hunt to find out how to increase utility. Your digital portfolio extends far beyond the trading strategies. The move to utilize assets such as XRP or Shiba Inu for entertainment is a natural progression. It’s among many investors who desire real-life applications for their coins. The situation is complicated, however, as regulatory frameworks haven’t kept pace. They’ve struggled with the rapid spread of niche cryptocurrencies. Even though you have to go through a field of hay, BonusFinder makes it easier to find a reliable site. It ranks the operators according to particular requirements concerning coin support and licensing. You don’t want to entrust your online money to a site that hasn’t undergone stringent scrutiny by experts in the field. The abundance of new platforms emerging monthly means you can’t manually review them one by one. It’s impossible unless you’re professionally guided to do so. The Growing Demand for Utility Among Altcoin Holders Likely, you’ve already observed a significant change in the market for digital assets . They’re no longer regarded as pure stores of value nowadays. The owners of niche coins are also seeking platforms enabling them to make transactions directly. They won’t have to convert them to fiat currency. The need for speed necessitates this, along with reduced transaction costs and, to a certain degree, anonymity. They’re all key features of blockchain technology. Using your crypto directly has the advantage of saving time in the traditional banking system because it’s faster. You’ll keep all your money until you choose to use a service. This ensures your assets retain their long-term value, provided conditions don’t shift. You can use them where the context stays stable. Why Finding Regulated Operators Is a Major Challenge The primary issue is that even stringent regulatory authorities in jurisdictions like the United Kingdom or Malta lag. They’re extremely slow in licensing niche altcoins for use in regulated gaming. The vast majority of licensed operators are likely to remain in Bitcoin or Ethereum. It’s because compliance processes for these instruments are more developed. This leaves a considerable gap in the market on your hold should you own lesser market-cap coins. It’s common to be compelled to seek business elsewhere, beyond the highly controlled circles, to find operators that’ll accept your particular tokens. Such a search subjects you to a gray marketplace where the line between a legitimate business and a scam is fragile. The Hidden Dangers of Using Unlicensed Crypto Sites Whenever you decide to work on an unregulated site, you’re entering a digital world with no safety net whatsoever. The potential is much greater than losing a round in a game. You risk drowning because the software was rigged, and winning was merely a statistical impossibility. Moreover, unregulated services may not have the legal authority to accommodate withdrawal requests. Therefore, your money may be held without a reason. Another factor worth considering is the security of personal data, as these sites often use less secure protocols. Encryption and data protection aren’t as robust as those of licensed counterparts. The security breach may compromise the wallet address, allowing bad actors to access it. It’s exposing the transaction history on a disregarded site. Utilizing Verification Tools to Ensure Your Safety That’s when you consider the third-party verification to be a critical component of your plan. You’ll need a mechanism for sifting through the noise and identifying platforms to trust. Ensure they’re thoroughly audited in terms of fairness and security. Aggregator sites conduct the due diligence that you may not have the time to perform on your own. They verify that one of the operators is licensed and assess the responsiveness of customer service. They ensure that the random number generators in games are genuine and unbiased. With such resources, you can ease the burden of verifying your choice on your own. You’ll come across a list of approved, safe options that store your particular cryptocurrency.

57251837,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=876289,1768678234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/57251837.jpeg,"Bitcoin Holds Key Support As Weekend Liquidity Sets In — $98,200 And $107,500 In Focus",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-holds-key-support/,"Bitcoin remains anchored above key support as weekend trading unfolds, keeping $98,200 and $107,500 in focus. Market participants are watching closely to see if the uptrend can continue or if the weekend liquidity will trigger a test of lower levels. The next few sessions could define BTC’s short-term trajectory. Key Support Holds: $94,630 Remains Crucial According to a recent post by Kamile Uray, Bitcoin is still holding strong above the $89,326 support level, and as long as it remains above this zone, the possibility for the uptrend to continue remains intact. This level continues to act as a critical foundation for bulls, keeping the market structure aligned with potential further gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Near-Identical Fractal Before The 2021 Bull Run Started If BTC manages to break through the $98,200 resistance, the next key target at $107,500 comes into focus. At this level, a decisive move will determine whether the current uptrend is complete or push Bitcoin even higher. A daily close above $107,500 would mark the first higher high on the daily chart relative to the last downward wave, signaling a potential continuation of the bullish trend. However, if BTC is rejected at resistance and falls back below $89,326, the downtrend could resume. Should a reversal form within the $83,822–$82,477 support zone, Bitcoin may attempt another upward push, giving bulls a chance to regain control. If BTC closes below $82,477, further downside is expected, potentially testing the $74,496–$71,237 region. This zone has historically served as a strong support area, and any confirmed reversal from here could set the stage for another bullish leg. Bitcoin Weekend Liquidity Ahead: Expect Range-Bound Action Crypto expert Lennaert Snyder outlined that Bitcoin is holding the key $94,630 support level, which also serves as the crucial H4 level to hold. On Friday, BTC retraced and briefly swept this low before stabilizing, reinforcing the importance of this zone for short-term market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Compresses Below $94K, But Possible Repeat Of 2025 Breakout Looms As we enter the weekend liquidity, Bitcoin is likely to trade within a defined range until Sunday evening or Monday. For bullish traders, the plan is to hold the low and watch for a market structure break above $95,820. Once this occurs, long positions could target the $97,960 monthly high. In anticipation of continued upside, only part of the position may be closed at the monthly high, letting 30%-40% run to capture further gains if momentum persists. However, if BTC loses the $94,630 support on the H4 and falls back into the previous range, a continuation toward lower lows becomes more likely. In that scenario, short positions would be considered after confirmation on a retest, giving traders a structured approach to managing risk and potential downside.

On Saturday, he woke up bright and early to announce that goods from eight NATO countries will face new tariffs , starting at 10% on February 1, and jumping to 25% by June 1, unless they agree to sell Greenland to the United States. The list includes Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Finland. In a Truth Social post, Trump wrote, “Until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” these tariffs will stay. He said this was a direct response to those countries sending troops to Greenland, something he clearly saw as an unwanted move into what he thinks should be American territory. Trump didn’t exactly explain why those countries were sending troops, but said, “They have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown.” He added , “This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.” Europe responds as Trump leans on tariff threat A day before posting the new tariff plan, Trump said he was considering using a similar strategy he used against foreign drug companies. “I may do that for Greenland too,” he said during a White House appearance Friday. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security.” The eight European countries didn’t waste time reacting. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen blasted the move. “We choose partnership and cooperation,” she said on Bluesky. “We choose our businesses. We choose our people.” She framed the tariffs not just as a trade issue but as a bigger threat to Western unity. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also responded, saying on Thursday that the defense of Greenland is a “common concern” for all NATO members. The timing of Trump’s announcement is not random. The U.S. military has been showing more interest in Greenland for months. Now, these European countries are doing the same. That seems to be what triggered Trump’s response. He’s trying to stop what he sees as others getting in the way of America’s Arctic plans. Senators challenge Trump’s claims and urge calm On the same day Trump posted about the tariffs, two U.S. senators landed in Copenhagen to try to cool things down. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska met with officials to push back on Trump’s narrative. “There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,” Coons told reporters Saturday. He said the trip was meant to “restore a sense of trust” with the region and challenge the idea that European troop deployments are part of some conspiracy. Both Coons and Murkowski said they viewed the presence of NATO troops in Greenland as a good sign, not a threat. “Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth… we should take as an encouraging signal,” Coons said. Murkowski also rejected the idea that the president’s position represents all of Washington. “You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,” she said. “Support for our friends and allies… should not be.” Trump’s new strategy may suggest that he’s stepping away from using military action to grab the island. But he’s not letting go of the idea. Greenland is still very much on his radar, and tariffs are now his weapon of choice. Behind the scenes, there’s also a legal fight brewing. Trump has been using a special law that gives presidents economic powers during emergencies. That’s how he’s been pushing out these tariffs. But the Supreme Court could rule on that law as early as next week, deciding if the whole thing holds up or not. Trump has used tariffs more than any president in modern history. He sees them not just as taxes, but as a tool to control what other countries do. Greenland is now just the latest battleground.

The meme coin made gains of over 100x, and this made several people crypto millionaires. However, for those who missed this investment opportunity, there is a new DeFi cryptocurrency that is currently creating a buzz during its presale, and this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Many people consider this to be the best cryptocurrency to buy at this moment since it is accumulating a strong community and has a genuine utility-based roadmap. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance’s DeFi lending and borrowing platform is expected to ensure that there is continuous on-chain demand, and this will enable those who are investing during its presale to enjoy tremendous gains through asymmetric growth potential. In fact, it is being predicted that an investment of $150 could multiply to gains of over 100x soon. Shiba Inu’s Consolidation Although Shiba Inu was one of the best performers in the previous cycle, it seems to have been stagnant since the start of 2026. The price of SHIB has begun an accumulation phase after touching the downside levels, meaning that it is no longer facing so many sell pressures, although it is also lacking momentum. The next major move for Shiba Inu could be experienced in the year 2026, targeting levels of $0.00014-$0.00039. Although there is some speculative use for SHIB, Mutuum Finance seems more attractive for investors looking for some useful value along with high growth potential. Presale Rewards Early Investors The presale of Mutuum Finance has already started yielding returns for early investors, starting at $0.01 in early 2025, rising to $0.04 in Phase 7, a massive 300% increase. Phase 8 is anticipated to start at $0.045, further reinforcing the importance of investing in the project at this early juncture. For example, an investor with $1,500 in the current price structure will see it rise to $1,800 when Phase 8 starts, securing a $300 profit before the market even begins. When Mutuum Finance finally enters the market with a price of $0.06, this particular investment will grow in value to $2,250, securing a $750 profit. Market experts believe that once it establishes itself in the market, even a meager investment of $150 in this phase could see it rise in value to $15,000 or more, making it the best cryptocurrency to purchase. Community Rewards The presale is also aided by an excellent community incentive structure. In a $100,000 giveaway , ten individuals will win $10,000. In addition, there is a $500 MUTM bonus for the top daily buyer. This has managed to attract interest in this project at an earlier stage, with potential to be the next crypto to explode. Dual Lending System: Flexibility and Returns The two-lending structure of Mutuum Finance is one of the important components of this project. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses automated liquidity pools that have variable interest rates. For example, if one invests $4,000 in ETH, it might generate an interest rate between 8% and 12% per annum. In this manner, without doing anything else, it is possible to generate an additional $320 to $480 per annum. The Peer-to-Peer system, on the other hand, lets users set interest rates by themselves. A lender might seek a higher interest rate in a volatile asset such as Shiba Inu. Security & Transparency Security is also a key part of this platform. The smart contract of this platform is audited by both Certik and Halborn Security. The contract also has safety features against liquidation and collateral. MUTM is set to be the next crypto to explode with its distinct lending mechanisms and a scalable and secure system. What Makes MUTM Stand Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) symbolizes much more than another cryptocurrency in an already saturated market. Its low entry fee of only $0.04, presale growth, dual lending platform, and Layer-2 scalability solution combine to represent an unprecedented investment opportunity for those looking to invest in the next crypto to explode. MUTM has all the right elements to bring growth-hungry investors to the table in a way that was represented in SHIB. As such, it has become known as the best crypto to buy today because of its perceived ability to be one of the next cryptos to explode.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-breaking-out-of-6-month-descending-wedge-heres-the-implication/,"XRP is capturing attention in early 2026 as price action nears a critical inflection point . After months of consolidation, the digital asset has compressed within a tightening structure, hinting at a potential breakout that could redefine short-term momentum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring key technical levels, anticipating a move that could unlock renewed upside and attract both retail and institutional participation. Bird Highlights the Wedge Breakout Potential On X, crypto analyst Bird (@Bird_XRPL) spotlighted XRP’s six-month descending wedge on Binance, with price trading around $2.07, roughly 15% below the wedge’s upper resistance near $2.38. Bird suggested that a single strong green candle could flip the chart’s structure bullishly, potentially accelerating XRP toward its all-time high of $3.84 from 2018. His observations reflect a broader consensus among technical traders that XRP sits on the cusp of a decisive move. XRP is ~15% from breaking out of this 6 month wedge. One strong green candle flips structure and opens the path toward all time highs very fast imo. This MAY VERY WELL be the moment. Hold your breath. Count to three. pic.twitter.com/IWwoK3jLGI — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 17, 2026 Technical Structure: Descending Wedge Dynamics A descending wedge forms when price makes progressively lower highs and lower lows that converge, indicating weakening selling pressure. In technical analysis, this pattern often precedes trend reversals to the upside. XRP’s wedge displays classic characteristics: diminishing volatility, contracting ranges, and steady accumulation, signaling that buyers may soon overpower sellers. To confirm the breakout, the price must move above the wedge’s upper boundary with increasing volume, ensuring genuine market conviction supports the advance. Current Price Action and Market Context Since late 2025, XRP has consolidated around the $2.00 mark while broader market factors—including institutional inflows and overall crypto market strength—have supported price stability. Early January 2026 saw XRP rally toward $2.34, demonstrating resilience and reinforcing the potential for the wedge breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Indicators such as rising on-chain activity, accumulation patterns, and alignment with other short-term bullish structures suggest that XRP’s price is primed for a swift upward trajectory once resistance yields. Implications of a Breakout A confirmed breakout above $2.38 would invalidate the six-month descending trend, creating a structural shift that could accelerate momentum toward higher targets. This scenario may attract renewed attention from both retail traders and institutional participants, amplifying buying pressure and potentially triggering a rapid advance. Conversely, failure to clear the resistance may maintain price within the wedge, prolonging sideways action but still preserving the setup for a future breakout. XRP’s current positioning within this descending wedge represents a pivotal moment for the asset’s short-term narrative, with the potential to catalyze a meaningful rally if buyers assert dominance.

Metaplanet recently purchased $632.5 million worth of Bitcoin and plans to accumulate 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, while Bitmine currently holds over 4.2 million ETH and aims to own 5% of all Ethereum in existence. Metaplanet’s Gerovich explains why companies choose Bitcoin Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, noted earlier today that most management teams do not discuss Bitcoin, and the few teams that do consider it must be willing to be misunderstood by the markets for years while they build their positions. In January 2026, Metaplanet made its largest Bitcoin purchase yet, buying 5,419 BTC for approximately $632.5 million, bringing its total holdings to 25,555 BTC. Metaplanet is now the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. The company is following a new strategy called the “555 Million Plan.” The goal is to accumulate 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. This would represent 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Metaplanet has since launched a U.S. subsidiary called Metaplanet Income Corp. that will focus on “Bitcoin income generation,” using financial tools like derivatives to create more value from their holdings. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum, controlling about 3.45% of the token’s total supply. Tom Lee’s ultimate goal, which Bitmine calls the “Alchemy of 5%,” is to own 5% of all Ethereum in circulation. The company’s Chairman, Thomas Lee, also known for his work at Fundstrat, believes Ethereum will see a major breakout in 2026. Standard Chartered also recently predicted that Ethereum could reach a price of $7,500 to $12,000 by 2026. If Ethereum reaches $12,000, Bitmine projections suggest its share price could rise significantly to $500. As Cryptopolitan reported during the week, Bitmine is investing $200 million into Beast Industries, the company founded by the famous YouTuber MrBeast. Bitmine plans to integrate DeFi services into MrBeast’s upcoming financial platforms, targeting those in his audience of over 450 million subscribers who are already comfortable with digital technology. Strategy, ETFs, and other corporate BTC, ETH reserves in 2026 Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, has continued with its “HODL” strategy in 2026, and as of January 12, it reported total holdings of 687,410 BTC. Financial analysts at TD Cowen recently raised their acquisition forecasts for the firm, predicting that Strategy will purchase approximately 155,000 Bitcoins during the 2026 fiscal year. In mid-January 2026, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a single-day inflow of $843.62 million, pushing total net inflows for these funds above $58 billion. Ethereum ETFs also raked in $175 million in a single day this month. Massive inflows of cash into the market have helped stabilize it, with Bitcoin trading near $95,000 and Ethereum at $3,367 as of January 17. Bitmine revealed that it plans to generate between $402 million and $433 million in annual pre-tax income through “staking” its Ethereum. The process will be done through the “Made in America Validator Network” (MAVAN), set to be launched in the first quarter of 2026. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

What was once viewed as a niche interest among tech enthusiasts is now gaining traction across broader segments of the state’s population. As residents become more curious about digital assets, conversations are shifting from speculation to understanding how BTC works and what it could mean for personal and regional economic resilience. Bitcoin As A Tool For Regional Economic Growth West Virginia has been making headlines in the Bitcoin space recently, particularly with fresh legislative moves as of January 2026. MartyParty revealed on X that the biggest current development is Senator Bill 143 (SB143), which was introduced this week by State Senator Chris Rose. This is officially titled the Inflation Protection Act of 2026, which would allow the state’s Board of Treasury Investment to allocate up to 10% of public funds into precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum. The bill requires any qualifying digital asset to have maintained an average market capitalization of at least $750 billion over the prior year, which qualifies only BTC. In addition, the bill also allows for regulated stablecoins , but only the US federal or state regulators can approve the assets. However, the bill frames this as a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation, and empowering the state treasurer to invest in BTC without directly naming it in most of the statute. Although the purpose section explicitly mentions empowering investment in gold, silver, and BTC. These assets would need to be made through qualified custodians, ETFs, or other secure frameworks. What Pension Funds And Endowments Think About Bitcoin The Bitcoin price prediction by funds indicates a bullish outlook for 2026. CryptoRank.io has mentioned that the institutional analysts are pricing in a bullish scenario for BTC in 2026. The average target across the forecasts shown is around $150,000 per BTC, implying roughly 75% upside from current levels. At the same time, longer-term valuation models assume a more gradual growth path . Popular asset manager VanEck predicts BTC could reach approximately $2.9 million by 2050, which equates to around 15% annualized growth broadly in line with the BTC historical long-term performance as a macro asset. In contrast to institutional forecasts, prediction markets maintain a more conservative outlook. On Polymarket , the pricing base-case range between $110,000 to $130,000. This consensus could shift toward the institutional targets if spot ETF inflows remain strong and if the US regulatory uncertainty continues to decline, including initiatives such as the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Chris Rose|CryptoRank.io|gold|Inflation Protection Act of 2026|Platinum|Polymarket|SB143|Senator Bill 143|silver|Spot ETF|Stablecoins|US Regulatory Uncertainty|vaneck,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-17 21:00:00

Although the second-largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the $3,300 price level, it could not break above $3,400 to continue its path towards higher price levels. As it stands, it appears that the Ether token is taking on a short-term bearish structure. However, an on-chain evaluation has recently been put out, which suggests that market participants might be gearing up for a significant move in the near-term. Related Reading: The Ethereum MACD Crossover That Could Lead To A Massive Bull Wave Ethereum Futures Activity Reaches Monthly High Following Market Inactivity In a recent QuickTake post on the CryptoQuant platform, analytics group Arab Chain reveals that there has recently been a spike in futures trading activity on the Binance derivatives market. This revelation is based on the Binance: ETH Futures Daily Volume metric, which monitors the total value of Ethereum futures contracts being traded on Binance each day, hence reflecting market activity, trader participation, and potential leverage exposure. The latest reading of the metric has highlighted a major shift, with trading volume climbing as high as $21.7 billion. According to Arab Chain, this reading marks the highest level since mid-December, reflecting that strong momentum has returned to the futures market. Notably, the spike in futures trading volume was preceded by a period of relative decline in the second half of December. This event coincides with a period of price stability, alongside a tapering risk appetite among traders. Interestingly, institutional investors also contributed prevalent aversion to risk. Arab Chain explains that the decline is a typical sign that market participants want to “wait and see,” instead of speculatively opening large positions. However, the present scenario — where futures volume surged — paints an opposing story. As the futures trading volume reflects levels above its mid-December high, it becomes apparent that interest among Ethereum traders is being rekindled. This is because increasing futures volume “is typically associated with higher leverage usage, hedging activity, and speculative positioning” — a line up which indicates that the market is preparing for significant movement. The reason for this spike could also be attributed to traders who are reacting to key technical levels or shifting expectations around near-term price action of a potential trend reversal. In the grand scheme, however, the Ethereum price reacts to this activity, depending on the alignment of spot demand with derivatives activity. Till such a definite sign comes up, the market stands at a point of uncertainty.

Commentators have noted that unlike previous spikes characterized by lower trading volumes, this surge seems to be backed by considerable trading activity and bullish market sentiments. Axie Infinity’s AXS is up over 100% in the past week According to data from Coingecko , Axie Infinity’s token $AXS went on a run today, surging by about 64% to approximately $2.02 and topping charts as the leader in the broader GameFi sector . Today’s rally comes after months of bearish movements and is happening as interest in the gaming sector is returning with multiple gaming tokens turning green, much to the delight of traders and investors. The price surge of the AXS token comes amid a marked improvement in daily trading volume, with the past 24 hours pulling in over $997M while the overall market cap stands at over $346M, indicating increased investor engagement. Analysts have attributed this positive price action to a return of investor appetite for high volatility sectors like GameFi as well as futures market activity and staking adjustments. The futures trading volume has exceeded $500M with open interest hovering around $44M, signaling short coverings and the creation of new positions. All that is happening amid recent changes to the project’s staking program as well as the introduction of new incentives, including an Axie Score rewards experiment scheduled for this year. More about Axie Infinity’s score reward The score reward is a metric that will reportedly reflect a player’s contributions to the Axie Infinity community, influencing governance and rewards. According to recent announcements, that reward will be transitioned into an app token version of AXS (bAXS). The token will be able to be spent in Axie core as well as staked. The team plans to integrate Axie’s reputation, the Axie score, into the selling mechanic. There will also be a variable fee, paid to the treasury, that gets charged to a seller of the token, with the fee reduced for those with higher tiers of Axie score. “A good day for $AXS, but the true story here is the structural changes to supply that we’re making this year,” the project’s cofounder wrote on X. According to more recent updates, bAXS (Bonded AXS) will be backed 1:1 by AXS and designed to keep value circulating within the ecosystem and rewarding its citizens. “This is the start of a transformative year for Axie Infinity, something is coming and the strongest will survive by working together as one digital nation,” one X post shared via the Axie Infinity account on X read. Which GameFi tokens are doing well in 2026? The GameFi sector is witnessing a resurgence in interest. The overall sector’s market cap is currently around $7 billion, up 6.3% in the past 24 hours. While Axie Infinity is leading the charge, it is not the only GameFi project witnessing bullish movement. Based on data from Coingecko , other tokens doing well in the GameFi sector include Ronin (RON), the Sandbox (SAND), Smooth Love Potion (SLP), Decentraland (MANA), and Illuvium (ILV). RON’s price has gone up by about 20% in the past 24 hours and 28% in the past seven days; SAND’s is up 30% in the past 24 hours and 32% over the past 7 days; SLP is up 14% in 24 hours and 16% over the past week; MANA is also up 21% in 24 hours and 18% over the past seven days and ILV is up 15% in 24 hours and 14% over the past seven days.

The records cover closed-door debates from 2020 and show how the Fed chair pushed hard for clear promises on interest rates , even as several officials warned the move could box the central bank in later. Those warnings stayed mostly private at the time. The September 2020 meeting took place six months into the pandemic, with rates already pinned near zero since March. Powell argued the moment demanded blunt guidance. He wanted the Fed to spell out exactly what had to happen before rates could rise again. The goal was to support a recovery he believed would take years, not months. Some policymakers objected. Most fell in line. Powell forces rate guidance through internal resistance The transcripts show Powell pressing for language that tied rate hikes to two conditions. One was maximum employment. The other was inflation reaching 2 percent and moving above that level for a period of time. That language went into the public statement after the meeting. At the time, inflation sat at 1.3 percent using the Fed’s preferred gauge. The median forecast showed inflation not hitting 2 percent until 2023. That forecast proved wrong. Inflation surged the next year and peaked at 7.2 percent in mid-2022. Still, many officials, including Powell, described the jump as transitory and waited to react. Two policymakers dissented in September 2020. Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan opposed locking in near-zero rates. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari wanted an even stronger commitment. Others shared Kaplan’s concern but did not vote. Those included Eric Rosengren in Boston, Tom Barkin in Richmond, and Raphael Bostic in Atlanta. Voting members Patrick Harker from Philadelphia and Loretta Mester from Cleveland also raised concerns. Mester called the new liftoff rules very significant. She said she would have preferred more discussion before making such a change. She still supported the final decision. Powell rejected waiting. He told colleagues the expansion was underway and policy messaging needed to support the long path back. He said delays could damage the Fed’s credibility after holding steady for six months. Powell said weaker guidance would repeat eight years of old Fed behavior The September debate followed a major policy overhaul announced a month earlier. The Fed changed how it handled inflation and jobs. Officials moved away from raising rates early just because unemployment fell. That old playbook had failed for years, as low joblessness did not spark inflation. The transcripts show Powell worried that markets and the public did not believe the Fed would stick to the new framework. He warned that weak guidance would sound like the same reaction function used for eight years. He pushed for strong wording to show the shift was real. Five years later, those conversations became public. The Fed releases edited minutes three weeks after each meeting, but full transcripts come out only after five years. Critics now argue that the firm guidance slowed the Fed’s response when inflation took off. In November 2022, after rate hikes were already underway, Powell publicly acknowledged regret. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, he said the guidance tying liftoff to both jobs and inflation was the one decision he would not repeat. He said it was not tied directly to the inflation surge, but still would not do it again. The transcripts also show Powell spotting COVID risks early. On March 2, 2020, before the virus hit the U.S. hard, he described rising concern after a G‑20 meeting in Riyadh. He said the virus was likely to spread worldwide. He told officials markets needed a clear signal that central banks understood the threat and would act fast to prevent tighter financial conditions. That day, the Fed cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

White House Could Withdraw Support For CLARITY Act The White House has threatened to withdraw its support for the crypto market structure bill following Coinbase’s sudden withdrawal. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, the White House is beside itself over Coinbase’s decision to withdraw its support for the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, calling the move a “unilateral action that blindsided the administration.” Terrett stated in a post on X, “The White House is said to be furious with Coinbase’s “unilateral” action on Wednesday, which it apparently was not notified of in advance, calling it a “rug pull” against the White House and the rest of the industry.” Terrett claimed her source believes the Trump administration may fully abandon the bill unless Coinbase returns to the negotiating table and agrees to a compromise on stablecoin yield provisions that would satisfy banking interests. The source added, “This is President Trump’s bill at the end of the day, not Brian Armstrong’s.” Visit the following links for more information on Husky Inu: Website: Husky Inu Official Website Twitter: Husky Inu Twitter Telegram: Husky Inu Telegram Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The bots tried to empty the wallet after it detected the deposited funds. The compromised wallet’s private key is a transaction identifier (txid). Specifically, it’s the coinbase txid of block 924,982. Bots exploit exposed private key On-chain data shows that Bitcoin bots drained funds from the compromised wallet within minutes. The SegWit wallet received 0.00020305 BTC through two transactions. However, it ended up with a zero balance and no unspent outputs left. Every incoming BTC transfer was quickly spent by bots. The first transaction sent 0.00018209 BTC to the address. At the same timestamp, the funds were spent out in a separate transaction with a fee rate of 12.8 sat/vB. The spending speed indicates an automated sweep. The second deposit added 0.00002096 BTC. The funds were again removed almost immediately. The bot paid 4.80 sat/vB then sent 0.00001572 BTC to an external address. Bots continuously monitor Bitcoin’s mempool for deposits sent to wallets derived from weak or publicly known private keys. A bitcoin mempool is a waiting area for unconfirmed transactions. Once funds appear, the bots already control the private key and can instantly sign withdrawal transactions. Bots instantly send replace-by-fee (RBF) transactions to compete by raising fees for miners to approve a withdrawal. An RBF or replace by fee, is a node policy that allows bots to replace an unconfirmed transaction with a new transaction that pays a higher fee to miners. On-chain fee data shows sudden jumps in satoshi-per-byte (sat/vB) rates. This indicates transactions being replaced with higher-fee versions. Only one transaction ultimately confirms, while competing versions are dropped or replaced. The balance history of the compromised BTC wallet. Source: mempool.space . Watching greedy bots send more aggressive RBF transactions can be somewhat entertaining. “Sometimes I send small transactions to compromised wallets, just to see the beauty in this automated RBFs,” said Brevsolution on X. But some people send larger amounts to compromised wallets, and the reason is unclear. “I’d really like to know why that happens,” said Ottosch on X. Such transactions could be a mistake from the sender’s side. In November, $70,000 was carelessly sent to a wallet linked to a predictable private key. Brevsolution explained that bots react instantly and use RBF to reduce transactions down to one satoshi. This causes the bots to pay almost 100% of the deposited BTC in fees. Bitcoin private keys could be compromised Weak private keys and seed phrases could be hacked. They are predictable like easy passwords. Storing the private key securely is essential to protect BTC. Exposing it or any other related data often leads to quick theft by hackers. Using a txid to hash a private key does not provide enough entropy to secure the private keys. Bitcoin private keys are just numbers. It is possible to derive a public address and private keys from block hashes and transaction IDs (txids). Any txid or block hash is a valid 256-bit number and can technically be used as a private key. Bots exploit this by precomputing addresses from known public data. Then they watch those addresses forever and drain them instantly. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Those looking to invest in projects that are in their early stages of development, Mutuum Finance provides substantial potential for growth, compared to Cardano’s ADA. With a total investment close to $20 million, along with over 18,800 supporters, this project has all it takes to exceed the projected growth of Cardano’s ADA. Cardano (ADA): Stable, Yet Limited Momentum Cardano recently bounced out of its $0.32-$0.34 support area, retesting nearby levels of consolidation to make a small higher low on rising volume. Current levels for support are $0.38-$0.39, and a breakout above $0.45-$0.46 may place ADA on a steady course for $0.48-$0.50. Although this is a sign of strength, the current short-term momentum is decidedly measured, reflecting the fact that ADA may have far more conservative investment potential than Mutuum Finance. Investors seeking a new crypto with strong growth potential find MUTM far better than Cardano. MUTM Price Prediction: Could It Reach $1? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now at Phase 7 of its presale stage at a price of $0.04, having increased from $0.01, thus realizing a 300% profit for those who invested during the first stage. Additionally, with the launch price at $0.06, those who participate in the presale today can look forward to realizing additional gains before it even reaches the exchanges. This new crypto represents one of the most promising avenues for investors seeking outsized returns in 2026. As the dual-lending protocol gains more adoption, MUTM may reach $1. This will be an astonishing 2,400% jump from the current $0.04 per token price. Those who invest in the presale will greatly benefit from this potential upside. Take, for instance, an investment in Phase 7 valued at $3,000; this will be able to rise to $4,500 upon the launch of the marketplace, yielding an instant profit of $1,500. With MUTM potentially hitting $1 in value, this investment will be able to rise to $75,000. Such returns make it the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for enormous gains. Layer 2 Integration Makes DeFi More Accessible Historically, gas prices have been an issue for small investors in the Ethereum network. Take, for example, an individual locking $2,000 worth of ETH to borrow stablecoins in Mutuum Finance. The total cost of deposit, borrow, repay, and withdraw would easily surpass $20. In this regard, Mutuum Finance’s Layer-2 and multi-chain focus will make this entire process cost less than a dollar. The cost savings will enable small investors to participate in DeFi with ease.

Lots of developers spent their holiday break testing the newest version, Claude Opus 4.5, which runs on their computers. Tech firms have been using code-writing AI for years, and the older ones worked about as well as a new hire. What people are seeing now feels different. Malte Ubl runs technology at Vercel, which helps build and host websites for people using Claude Code. He finished a tough project in one week that he says would have taken him a year on his own. Ubl worked 10 hours every day during his vacation, making new software. He compared the good feeling from each win to pulling a slot machine lever in Vegas. Google has been getting most of the attention lately after showing off a really good AI model and tools. But people who follow this stuff closely are still talking about what Anthropic just put out. Claude’s website traffic more than doubled in December compared to last year, and daily visitors on computers went up 12 percent around the world versus last month. That’s based on numbers from Similarweb and Sensor Tower. The AI agent revolution finally arrives Tech experts have been saying for a while that AI “agents” would be able to do almost anything for us, but that hasn’t really happened yet. For lots of users, Claude Code was the first time they saw this kind of AI work. It gave them an idea of what might be coming. People are using it to look at government money data, fix broken wedding photos, build websites from nothing, answer tons of emails, or get food delivered. My annual MRI scan gives me a USB stick with the data, but you need this commercial windows software to open it. Ran Claude on the stick and asked it to make me a html based viewer tool. This looks… way better. pic.twitter.com/6bAR7N4Vt6 — tobi lutke (@tobi) January 11, 2026 Shopify’s CEO Tobias Lütke wrote on X that he used it to make software that looks at his MRI scan. Boris Cherny, who’s in charge of Claude Code, said one person hooked up a camera and watched their tomato plants grow with it. “It’s just so different than the AI that came before,” Cherny said. Since so many regular people wanted to try it, Cherny and his team made a version called Cowork. Instead of the old-school command line screen that the main version has, Cowork looks friendlier and easier to use. They built it in about 10 days, using Claude Code. Anthropic’s market position strengthens Anthropic, which people think will go public this year , has always focused on making AI that’s really good at coding first, then at “tooling”, which means the AI can use different software without much help from people. Most tests show it’s the best at coding, and it’s also one of the best at tooling, based on research from UC Berkeley. Now people want to know what happens next . “The bigger story here is going to be when this goes beyond software engineering,” said David Hsu, who runs Retool, a business-AI startup.

The data points to a sharp concentration of activity on one network, even as most other Ethereum scaling chains struggled to clear $5,000 in fees over the same 24-hour period. Base Pulls Ahead as Fee Data Shows Widening Gaps CryptoRank said Base’s share of total Ethereum L2 revenue was nearing 70% based on the January 14 snapshot, while all other L2s combined brought in just over $15,000. Linea posted around $4,500 in fees, Optimism $2,400, Unichain $2,000, Ink $1,500, zkSync $900, and Scroll $600, showing how thin fee generation remains outside the top tier. The fee figures quickly set off debate on social media, especially after some users pointed to Polygon’s much higher revenue on the same day. Crypto analyst Vadim and X user New York Pascal both posted that Polygon recorded about $155,000 in daily fees, slightly above Base’s total, based on a network-wide revenue table from DefiLlama shared within hours of CryptoRank’s post. That comparison led to questions about how Polygon should be classified. X user Thorex asked whether Polygon is an L2 at all, reflecting a long-running discussion in the community about Polygon’s mix of scaling solutions, including its proof-of-stake chain and newer zero-knowledge products. The distinction matters because CryptoRank’s post focused specifically on Ethereum L2s, while Polygon’s revenue figures often include activity from its broader ecosystem. DefiLlama’s revenue table showed Tron at the top across all chains with more than $1 million in daily fees, followed by Polygon, Base, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and Arbitrum. Within that wider context, Base still ranked near the top for Ethereum-aligned networks, even if it was not the highest-earning chain overall. Ecosystem Growth Adds Context to Base’s Fee Strength Base’s recent fee performance comes as Coinbase continues to expand products built on the network. Late last year, the exchange launched its tokenized “Everything app,” a rebranded version of Coinbase Wallet that blends social content, trading, and payments in one interface. The company said the app, now live in more than 140 countries, is built on Base and uses tokenized posts and assets that can be traded directly from a social-style feed. The launch introduced new ways for users to interact on-chain, including earning from content engagement and settling rewards instantly to their wallets. While Coinbase has not published a direct link between the app and daily fee totals, the timing helps explain why Base continues to attract activity compared with other L2s that lack a similar consumer-facing funnel.

According to a technical analysis shared by CasiTrades on X, XRP may still have one more bullish push ahead before the structure turns lower. The chart showing the analysis outlines a developing Elliott Wave sequence that could first lift XRP’s price higher, then open the door to a breakdown if support levels fail. Related Reading: Ethereum On Fire: User Growth Sparks Massive Activity Spike B Wave Dips Hint At Coming Wave C Surge Technical analysis of XRP’s price action on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart by CasiTrade proposes an interesting outlook that shows XRP might end up correcting below $2 in the coming days. This correction, however, will only play out after XRP finishes a Wave C move that takes its price above $2.2. The wave C, in turn, is expected to play out after the recent pullback to $2.03 in the past 48 hours. According to CasiTrades, XRP’s recent pullback unfolded as a deeper B wave than initially expected. Instead of forming a tight consolidation, price traced out a full ABC move and fell into the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement around $2.09. This depth, however, does not invalidate the structure. Such a move is consistent with a B wave in the Elliott Wave theory. This retracement coincides with clustered Fibonacci levels and prior intraday support, and the next possible move from here is the next leg higher within the larger Wave 2 structure. Now that the B wave is likely in place, the attention is towards the anticipated C wave push. CasiTrades identifies the golden retracement near $2.26 as the primary upside target, with a possible extension into the $2.28 region where the golden pocket and the 1.236 extension converge. The chart highlights this zone as a dense resistance area, reinforced by prior reaction highs and overlapping Fibonacci projections. This C wave is expected to subdivide into five smaller waves. If this plays out as expected, XRP’s price action should feel bullish through its clean subwave development. However, the way price behaves as it approaches and reacts to the $2.26 to $2.28 band will be critical for confirming the broader outlook and if a correction is next. XRP Price Chart. Source: @CasiTrades on X A Post-C Rejection Could Drag XRP To $1.65 The current focus is on a possible push higher, but there’s still a downside risk after the C wave is complete. The analyst expects a rejection that could become the beginning of a larger Wave 3 move to the downside after XRP reaches the projected levels around $2.26 to $2.28. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record Levels As Buterin Urges Builders To Deliver Real Apps If that rejection materializes cleanly, XRP could begin a sustained move lower, with the macro support region around $1.65 coming back into focus. Confirmation of this bearish path, however, depends on how the C subwaves form and whether price delivers a decisive rejection.

This has sparked questions on whether this was just a mere bear market rally or the bull run is back on track. Here’s what CryptoQuant, which called the bear market earlier, has to say about the latest Bitcoin price rally. BTC Still In Bear Market Despite Improving Conditions: CryptoQuant On Friday, January 16, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant revealed in its latest report that the Bitcoin demand conditions are becoming less negative following the recent rally above $97,000. This on-chain observation comes a few weeks after the firm said the BTC apparent demand — at the time — was pointing to the start of a bear market. The confirmation of the bear market came after the price of Bitcoin fell below the 365-day moving average — a level that has historically determined bull and bear phases. However, the premier cryptocurrency has been on an upward trajectory since breaking beneath this level, up by approximately 21% since late November 2025. In its research report, CryptoQuant noted that while the price of BTX is approaching the 365-day moving average, it has yet to reclaim the technical level, which currently lies around $101,000. The analytics firm further mentioned acts as a “regime boundary” during bear markets — as seen in past cycles, triggering price rejections before renewed downside. In addition to the technical hurdles, CryptoQuant noted that while the Bitcoin demand conditions have improved “at the margin” , they still signal market weakness. “US spot indicators such as the Coinbase Premium briefly turned positive, while U.S. ETFs merely paused net selling after offloading ~54K BTC in November, rather than showing sustained accumulation,” the firm added. CryptoQuant also highlighted that on-chain spot demand continues to decline, with apparent demand down by about 67,000 BTC over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund inflows have broadly remained below levels often correlated with durable bullish market recoveries. At the same time, the rising BTC exchange inflows do not spread optimism but rather increase downside risk. Data from CryptoQuant shows that transfers to centralized exchanges climbed to a 7-day average of approximately 39,000 BTC, the highest level since late November. According to the firm, this is a tell-tale sign of increasing sell-side pressure after relief rallies . Going by this, it appears that while the market conditions are somewhat improving favorably for price, Bitcoin is still in the bear cycle that started less than two months ago.

The ability to sustain strength after recent gains highlights improving market structure, suggesting that buyers remain in control. As long as ETH stays supported above its critical trend levels, the broader upside narrative remains intact despite near-term hesitation. Daily Bull Market Support Band Holds As Key Reversal Zone Luca, in a recent ETH update shared on X, pointed out that Ethereum’s market structure has strengthened considerably over the past several days. The price has been able to hold above the 1D Bull Market Support Band, a level that has acted as a reliable reversal zone multiple times over the last couple of months. This sustained hold suggests improving market confidence and a reduction in immediate downside risk. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Pushes Toward Breakout Levels, Bulls Smell Opportunity Alongside this structural improvement, ETH successfully reclaimed the 0.618 Fibonacci point of interest around the $3,100 region. This level is often viewed as a critical threshold in corrective phases, and holding above it typically signals that buyers are gaining the upper hand. Despite the positive developments, Ethereum has not moved higher without hesitation. ETH’s price recently faced rejection near the 0.5 Fibonacci level around $3,400, an outcome Luca noted was largely expected. Historically, this area has acted as a significant decision point, often attracting selling pressure and temporary pullbacks before the market decides on its next direction. Looking forward, Luca believes the overall outlook remains constructive as long as ETH continues to trade above the 1D Bull Market Support Band and the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Maintaining these supports would keep the path open for renewed upside attempts, even if short-term consolidations occur, and the analyst’s positioning remains unchanged. ETH Above Daily 200MA, Structure Remains Constructive According to a recent post by Daan Crypto Trades, Ethereum is still advancing gradually while respecting the Daily 200-day moving average against Bitcoin. This type of slow, methodical grind often signals strength beneath the surface, suggesting that buyers remain in control even without aggressive momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Q1 Outlook: Analyst Shares Historical Setup As Price Nears Key Resistance The analyst explained that prolonged consolidations and steady climbs like this typically resolve with an acceleration phase. Should ETH break out with stronger upside momentum, it could serve as a trigger for renewed interest across the altcoin market, helping lift sentiment and price action. However, the structure remains conditional. Holding the Daily 200MA, highlighted in purple, is critical to maintaining this constructive setup. In parallel, Bitcoin must stay above the $94,000 level to maintain the broader low-timeframe bullish structure. As long as these conditions are met, the path of least resistance continues to favor further upside.

The move was fueled by increasingly positive sentiment about US legislation on cryptocurrencies and ongoing inflows into XRP spot ETFs. Volatility remains high, however. News out of the US Senate about the Market Structure Bill led to profit-taking after the rally, highlighting how XRP will continue to be at the mercy of political and judicial news for a while longer. As the price nears $2.5 and beyond, many seekers of the best cryptocurrency to buy now are turning attention to a new token in the vicinity of $0.04 offering significantly higher upside potential. XRP Rally Faces Resistance XRP has moved further on headlines than on consolidated, organized growth. The asset was up about 15% after initial development on US cryptocurrency laws, only to retreat after legislators developed cold feet over expanding regulatory purview. Bulls continue to defend the $2 level, but risks persist. Moving from $2.30 to $3 would represent less than a $1 profit per coin, which, for smaller investors looking to maximize returns, minimizes the gains that can be achieved. In this environment, traders looking at what cryptocurrency to buy now are delving deeper than large-cap assets. While XRP as an asset remains important, due to its scale and political factors, the near-term potential for profits is more muted compared with the cheapest cryptocurrency to buy now. Presale Growth at $0.04 Mutuum Finance is a novel cryptocurrency, which is relevant due to its rising stability. The project has been able to raise $19,800,000 in funds since the presale started and claimed 18,820 holders. Phase 7 is in operation and is selling well at the price of $0.04 per unit. Its price has already risen nearly 300% from the first stage costing $0.01. Phase 8 will be at $0.045 where buyers who paid $0.04 will be offered an opportunity to gain early value. The present value of a 200-dollar investment would allow the investment to provide 5,000 tokens. Assuming that the price increases 30 times within 90 days this will be equivalent to $6,000. This high potential makes Mutuum one of the best cryptocurrencies to purchase at the moment. Mutuum Finance is also introducing a lending platform that will enable individuals to make income without selling their properties. A user is able to provide $4,000 in stablecoins and earn 12% per year, which is approximately $480 within a twelve month time period. On the other hand, a borrower can access a loan of $4,200 with a $6000 collateral on an asset like Ethereum at a 70% loan-to-value ratio, which meets their expenses without the necessity to sell the ETH. Rewards and Supply Management The supply of tokens is 4 billion with 45% being in the presale. The number of the sold tokens exceeds 850 million. Mutuum protocol will do buybacks and allocate rewards. Part of the protocol revenue will be allocated to repurchasing tokens on the market and re-distributing them to stakers. An individual who has staked $5000 in Mutuum Finance’s safety module, would for instance be awarded $500 in additional MUTM, a model that awards long-term commitment to the project. Security & Transparency Indicators To further bolster interest, security and transparency have been improved. An independent audit by Halborn Security has been completed, with the team implementing all recommendations in preparation for the release. Industry insiders report that many DeFi projects which failed did not pass audits, making this relevant. Mutuum has also introduced a dashboard complete with a top-50 holder leaderboard along with a $500 MUTM bonus for the top daily MUTM buyer. These are just some of the improvements to ensure ongoing activity and growth. XRP has the potential to reach $3 or higher if the legislative developments go its way, but upside seems limited for new entrants. With a more favorable entry point, explicit mechanisms for rewarding holders, and better growth economics, Mutuum Finance ranks as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now and, in particular, the best affordable option to consider as 2026 progresses, at $0.04 in Phase 7.

57258397,658132,1768698009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57258397.jpeg,Crypto Regulation: Nigerian SEC Raises Capital Requirement For Exchanges To N2 Billion,https://bitcoinist.com/nigerian-sec-capital-crypto-exchanges-to-n2-billion/,"Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, is paying vast attention to its rapidly developing cryptocurrency industry marked by a string of new regulations. In the latest development, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shared a revised minimum capital for all regulated market entities, including operators in the digital asset market. Nigerian Regulator Hikes Minimum Capital For Crypto Exchanges By $1.05M On January 16, 2026, the Nigerian SEC released a circular communicating changes in the minimum capital (MC) requirements for major financial entities, namely: core and non-core capital market operators, market infrastructure institutions, capital market consultants, financial technology (FinTech) operators, virtual asset service providers (VASPs), and commodity market intermediaries. The securities regulator has explained that the revised MC framework is to boost operational resilience, align capital adequacy, promote market stability, and support innovation in nascent market segments such as the cryptocurrency industry. In relation to VASPs, the minimum capital for digital asset exchanges (DAX) and digital asset custodians has been increased from N500 million ($352,000) to N2 billion ($1.4 million). Meanwhile, all digital assets offering platforms (DAOP) responsible for issuance and primary sale of digital assets to the public are expected to meet a capital threshold of N1 billion ($704,111). Notably, the Nigerian SEC’s new circular expands its recognition of multiple VASPs that had been operating in a regulatory void. These include the ancillary virtual assets service providers (AVASPs) who provide auxiliary services such as blockchain analytics tools, etc who are now mandated to operate with a minimum capital of N300 million ($211,200). Under the new regime, the base capital requirements for both digital assets intermediary (DAI) and digital assets platform operators (DAPO) have also been placed at N500 million ($352,000). In new additions, real-world assets tokenization and offering platforms (RATOP) now have a set minimum capital requirement of N1billion ($704,111). According to the SEC, all concerned entities are advised to comply with the new regime on or before June 30, 2027, as failure to do so will result in penalties, including suspension or withdrawal of registration, as determined by the Commission. Nigeria Government Increases Focus On Crypto Industry Aside from the SEC’s recent circular, other developments indicate that the Nigerian government is increasing its participation in the cryptocurrency market. Notably, the new Nigeria Tax Administration Act (2025) now requires all digital asset activity to be linked to Tax Identification Numbers (TIN) and National Identification Numbers (NIN), effectively capturing the nascent industry as a new tax base. These recent measures follow a recent partnership by the SEC and the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) focused on cracking down on Ponzi scheme operators and other similar scams.",Crypto regulation|crypto exchanges|digital asset exchanges|minimum capital requirements|Nigeria|Nigerian SEC|VASPs,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|DAI|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-18 01:00:09

He said the claim was false and blasted The Wall Street Journal for publishing it without asking him. Trump also said Jamie isn’t fit for the position and slammed JPMorgan for how they treated him after the January 6th Capitol protest. “There was never such an offer,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story.” He said the meeting never happened and accused Jamie of pretending it was some joke. Trump also said that:- “Also, one was led to believe that I offered Jamie Dimon the job of Secretary of the Treasury, but that would be one that he would be very interested in. The problem is, I have Scott Bessent doing a fantastic job, A SUPERSTAR — Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either.” Trump plans lawsuit against JPMorgan over account closure Trump also said he will sue JPMorgan Chase for shutting down his accounts after January 6th, calling it “inappropriate and incorrect debanking.” He said the protest was justified and added, “The Election was RIGGED!” The lawsuit, he said, will be filed within two weeks. Back in August 2025, Trump signed an executive order telling banks they can’t reject clients based on their political or religious views. He has said banks have targeted him personally. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America both refused to take his deposits after his first term ended. He gave no proof but said it was all political. JPMorgan responded by saying they don’t shut accounts over political beliefs. Bank of America wouldn’t comment on individual clients but said they would welcome clearer rules from regulators. This isn’t the first time Trump and his family have called out banks. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said they had trouble accessing regular banking services. That, he said, is what pushed them into crypto. “So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, ‘hey, this is the next cool thing,’ we got into it out of necessity,” Donny Jr. said. Now Trump is going after JPMorgan in court, but he’s also been going after the banks in policy. He wants a hard cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. The banking sector reacted fast. JPMorgan shares dropped around 5% over the last week, even though the company beat expectations in its latest earnings report. Other major bank stocks also fell after Trump gave them until January 20 to comply. The Wall Street Journal had claimed Trump offered the Federal Reserve job to Jamie during a meeting at the White House months ago. Jerome Powell’s current Fed chair term ends on May 15,.

According to technical analysis, if BTC fails to continue its uptrend, it could repeat the bear-market crash from past cycles, potentially dragging its price down by double-digit percentages. Bitcoin Price To Repeat 2022 Bear Market Crash? Crypto analyst Tyrex believes that Bitcoin may be approaching a critical turning point if the current uptrend fails to hold. In his latest BTC price outlook on X, he compares the current market structure to the April 2022 cycle, when Bitcoin made an ATH and then crashed hard for weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum On Fire: User Growth Sparks Massive Activity Spike Tyrex disclosed that Bitcoin dropped roughly 45% from its all-time high in 2022 before entering an extended consolidation phase that lasted nearly four months. The accompanying chart shows that during that period, prices respected clear horizontal boundaries, creating a false sense of strength and stability, all while underlying weakness continued to build. That consolidation eventually led to an upside fakeout, with the Bitcoin price briefly breaking resistance before reversing sharply. Unfortunately, the rejection triggered a continuation of the broader downtrend that year, resulting in another aggressive price crash that wiped out remaining bullish confidence. According to Tyrex, BTC’s current chart structure closely mirrors the same historical setup from 2022. Bitcoin has once again pulled back sharply after reaching an all-time high of over $126,000. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has spent roughly two months consolidating within a defined range, repeatedly stalling at resistance levels. Tyrex warns that Bitcoin is barely holding above $95,000, which aligns with the resistance zone shown on the chart. If price fails to recover and continues to stall near this level, the move higher could turn out to be a fakeout, potentially leading to another sharp dump— just as it did in 2022. The red-shaded area on the chart shows how far BTC could crash if the uptrend breaks, with the analyst projecting an 11.04% drop to the $86,000-$84,000 range. Bitcoin Set For March ATH And May Flash Crash Another forecast from market expert CryptoXLarge outlines where Bitcoin could be headed over the next four months. The analyst bases the outlook on historical market behavior, suggesting the current cycle may be replicating past cycle peaks. CryptoXLarge points to January 2026 as a phase of quiet accumulation with controlled price action and muted volatility. February is expected to bring a powerful rally as momentum builds rapidly and buyers push the BTC price higher. This surge could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high around $240,000 in March.

The forecast concludes with a warning of a flash crash in May 2026, during which prices could pull back to fresh lows.

In a detailed note shared on X, Bons noted that Bitcoin is moving toward total collapse within the next seven to 11 years, which is going to be caused by the way the network pays for its security and the continued fall of block rewards. Reduced Miner Payouts To Cause Complete Bitcoin Collapse? Bitcoin is known for its halving cycle, which reduces the block rewards given to miners by about 50% every 210,000 blocks, which comes up to about roughly four years. Bons’ critique focuses on this event as the reason why Bitcoin’s network security will finally fail and cause a complete collapse of the leading cryptocurrency. As each halving cuts the block rewards further, Bons believes Bitcoin is drifting toward a point where it can no longer reliably fund the miners who protect the network, setting off a chain of risks that become harder to ignore with every cycle. Many Bitcoin proponents will argue that the Bitcoin network is still highly secure due to the rising hashrate. However, according to Justin Bons, hashrate can rise even while real security is weakening because advances in mining hardware reduce the cost of producing hashes. The most important thing is how much money is actually being made by miners , since that figure represents the profitability and the cost an attacker would have to match or exceed. Charts tracking block rewards and miner revenue show that, in economic terms, Bitcoin’s security is already lower than it was several years ago. Keeping security at current levels, he says, would require either transaction fees so high that users would simply stop using the network or the price of Bitcoin to double every four years at a pace that would quickly outpace the size of the global economy. Bitcoin Miner Revenue. Source: @Justin_Bons on X Prediction: Bitcoin To Plunge In Two To Three Halvings The seven to 11-year timeframe Bons outlined for Bitcoin’s collapse is tied directly to its halving schedule. According to the industry expert, the cost of attacking the Bitcoin network for a sustained period could fall into territory that makes such attacks financially attractive within two to three more halvings. If miner payouts are low enough, Bons believes the potential rewards from hitting multiple exchanges or protocols could outweigh the cost of carrying out the attack. The most realistic scenario for this to happen is through double-spend attacks against exchanges. An attacker controlling 51% of the entire mining power could deposit Bitcoin, trade it for another asset, withdraw those funds, and then roll back the blockchain to reclaim the original coins. He also highlights data showing that Bitcoin’s security budget relative to its total market value has been trending downward for years. This means Bitcoin does not automatically become safer as it grows larger. Bitcoin Security Budget as % of Market Cap. Source: @Justin_Bons This leaves Bitcoin facing an eventual breaking point. From here, it is either the network increases its fixed 21 million supply cap to restore miner incentives, a move that would likely split the chain, or the entire Bitcoin ecosystem accepts the risk of double-spend attacks.

He emphasized that discussions on the legislation are still ongoing. In addition, Armstrong dismissed rumors that the Trump administration is unhappy with Coinbase. In a statement to further elaborate on this point, the CEO mentioned that, “The White House has been very helpful. They asked us to see if we can work out an agreement with the banks, and we are currently doing that.” Eleanor Terrett exposes the current situation in the crypto ecosystem The disagreement between the crypto exchange Coinbase and the Trump administration was first made public by Eleanor Terrett, a journalist and co-host of the Crypto In America podcast, on Friday, January 16. Following her report, the White House threatened to halt its backing for the market structure bill if talks with the exchange remained frozen. Terrett discovered this just after Coinbase publicly announced it had withdrawn support for the CLARITY Act this week, expressing concerns that the legislation could negatively impact the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, impose restrictions on tokenized stock trading, and hinder clients from maximizing returns from stablecoins. When the exchange was embracing this decision to halt its support on the bill, Armstrong shared a statement highlighting that, “We’d prefer no bill over a bad bill. We hope to create a better version together.” He made these remarks while outlining key industry risks connected to the recently released draft of the bill. On the other hand, reports from reliable sources indicate that the US Senate Banking Committee decided to postpone the planned markup of the market structure bill due to uncertainties surrounding the bill raised in the crypto industry at the moment. This markup was scheduled for Thursday, January 15. Concerning this delay, sources noted that the US Senate Banking Committee wants lawmakers and the crypto industry to secure an agreement on favorable terms. With this argument in mind, Coinbase expressed its belief that a new bill markup will be settled sooner than expected. According to Armstrong, the rules displayed in the halted version of the bill were disastrous for clients, citing worries shared by several industry leaders in the crypto ecosystem. The crypto community expressed mixed reactions over the CLARITY Act As uncertainties surrounding the fate of the CLARITY Act continued to escalate, reports noted that the bill brought about mixed reactions in the crypto ecosystem. To support this claim, these reports mentioned that some industry executives anticipated that the market structure bill would be a game-changer for the Industry despite its drawbacks. However, others perceived the bill as a major obstacle in the crypto industry. This finding ignited heated discussions among individuals. To address this controversy, sources close to the situation disclosed that the main problem is the ongoing debate over whether to permit stablecoin returns to be shared with clients, a move the recently released version of the bill opposes. In the meantime, critics raised concerns that the CLARITY Act prioritizes the interests of banks over those of the crypto Industry, therefore, acting as a barrier to progress in financial technology.

In a recent meeting with the NPF, the Commission’s Director-General (DG), Dr. Emomotimi Agama, communicated to the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kayode Egbetokun, concerns over malicious actors in the financial markets who exploit investors’ trust for personal gains. Dr. Agama said: They cloak their deceit in the glamorous but misunderstood language of cryptocurrency and forex trading. They target the vulnerable, the optimistic, and the simply unsuspecting, leaving behind a trail of shattered lives, depleted pensions, and broken trust. This is not just a financial crime; it is a social menace that erodes public confidence in our entire financial system. Currently, there is a gap, a seam between identification and enforcement that these scammers exploit. Today, we aim to close that gap permanently. In particular, the SEC DG is proposing the formation of a specialized SEC-NPF team with members who bring understanding of the financial principles and operations and the tactical intelligence to curb these investment frauds and protect the Nigerian cyberspace. The IGP approved the collaboration request while also stating a strong commitment to help the SEC achieve its aims. Crypto Fraud In Nigeria Notably, Nigerians have been victims of several cryptocurrency investment scams in the past few years. The most prominent of these is the Crypto Bridge Exchange (CBEX) platform , which crashed in April 2025, losing over N1.3 trillion ($916 million) in user funds. The Nigerian SEC is strongly committed to reducing such menace as shown by the recent collaboration with the NPF alongside other measures such as a revised minimum capital requirements for VASPs and a published list of all identified fraudulent crypto and financial investment businesses. Notably, Nigeria remains one of the fastest-growing crypto hubs globally. According to data from TripleA, approximately 10.34% of Nigeria’s population, i.e., 22 million people, hold one digital asset or the other, therefore indicating the need for an effective regulatory oversight and protection system.",Crypto scam|CBEX|Crypto Fraud|Nigeria|Nigeria Police Force|Nigerian SEC|Ponzi Scheme,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-18 04:00:09

Atkins delivered this statement before the Consensus event in Hong Kong. Analysts later noted that while institutional interest in crypto has continued to grow throughout 2025, limited market liquidity remains a key barrier, preventing large Wall Street players from entering without causing price disruptions. This situation prompted Atkins to publish a statement alleging that markets cannot conclude that institutional investors want to participate in their activities if the factors required to make this possible are absent. According to him, the primary question is whether these markets can handle the significant institutional demand. “It’s one thing to say, ‘we’ve convinced them to come now,’” Atkins added. “It’s another to ask, ‘Do you have enough room for everyone?’” Auros’s Atkins raises concerns about liquidity status in the crypto markets As this discussion hit headlines, Atkins still insisted that liquidity has become a key issue in the crypto markets, mainly due to fading market interest. He further explained that substantial sell-offs, such as the October 10 crash , that have outpaced the speed at which traders and leverage can return to the market, are the factors behind this trend. To better understand this point, industry executives highlighted that liquidity providers shifted their focus from demand generation to demand fulfillment. This statement indicated that reduced trade activity triggers market makers to lower their risk, thereby heightening volatility, which in turn leads to tighter risk protocols and reduced market liquidity. In the meantime, Atkins argued that this situation cannot be solved when institutions serve as stabilizers while markets remain weak. The incident demonstrates that the market lacks a natural safety net in difficult times. As a result, a cycle is established in which volatility, caution, and illiquidity reinforce one another, thereby suppressing market performance, even as long-term yields are strong. At this point, Atkins highlighted that volatility itself does not scare off major investors, but the problem arises when volatility meets weak markets. He also acknowledged that it is difficult to handle volatility in thin markets, as safeguarding one’s investment is challenging, and selling them off is even more difficult. Institutions face significant challenges in the crypto industry Atkins’ statement illustrated that the current situation in the crypto markets is substantially greater for institutions than for individual traders. Moreover, it is worth noting that major investors have adopted stringent rules for capital preservation, implying they are limited in their ability to accept liquidity risk. “At that level of wealth, or if you are a huge institution,” he said, adding that, “it’s not just about getting the highest returns. It’s about getting the best returns while keeping your capital safe.” Atkins also expressed disapproval of the idea that money is transferred from crypto to AI, arguing that these two sectors are at contrasting stages of development. Following his argument, reports highlighted that, while artificial intelligence has existed for some time, the recent heightened interest in AI has never been seen before and is not causing funds to leave the crypto ecosystem.

According to ChartNerd, Kitao has confirmed that banks are set to begin adopting XRP for international payments within the current year. This development is presented as being aligned with SBI Holdings’ previously announced initiative to provide XRP-based incentives to its shareholders, reinforcing the firm’s long-standing involvement with digital assets and payment infrastructure. ChartNerd’s post highlights this confirmation as a continuation of SBI’s strategic direction rather than a sudden shift. The analyst emphasizes that the planned adoption by banks reflects ongoing efforts to integrate XRP into practical financial use cases, particularly in cross-border transactions where efficiency and settlement speed remain central concerns for financial institutions. $XRP : The chairman of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao, has confirmed that banks will begin adopting XRP for international payments this year, in line with the announcement of XRP incentives for SBI shareholders. pic.twitter.com/Mriz4VaSSD — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 16, 2026 Connection to SBI’s Shareholder Incentive Program The tweet also links the expected bank adoption to SBI Holdings’ shareholder benefits program, which was publicly detailed in February 2025 . At that time, SBI announced it would again offer XRP as part of its rewards to eligible shareholders, a move that signaled continued corporate support for digital assets within a regulated framework. ChartNerd references this context to underline that the anticipated banking adoption is consistent with prior corporate actions rather than an isolated announcement. Under the 2025 program, shareholders recorded in SBI’s register as of March 31 were given options that included receiving XRP or selecting products from SBI ALApromo Co., Ltd., a subsidiary specializing in health and consumer goods. The structure of the program varied depending on the number of shares held and the duration of ownership, allowing long-term shareholders to receive a higher value of XRP compared to newer or smaller investors. Regulatory Compliance and Distribution Mechanism ChartNerd’s commentary implicitly points to the regulatory considerations surrounding these initiatives. Distribution of XRP to shareholders is managed through SBI VC Trade Co., Ltd., SBI Holdings’ cryptocurrency trading subsidiary. This arrangement ensures that all allocations are conducted in line with Japanese regulations, with eligibility restricted to domestic residents aged 18 or older who hold, or can open, an account with the platform. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By highlighting both the incentive program and Kitao’s comments on bank adoption, ChartNerd presents a narrative of continuity. The analyst suggests that SBI’s approach demonstrates a coordinated effort to normalize the use of XRP across both retail shareholder engagement and institutional banking channels. Implications for Financial Infrastructure In summarizing the tweet’s message, ChartNerd positions SBI Holdings as a key corporate actor advancing the practical use of XRP within established financial systems. The confirmation attributed to Kitao is portrayed as a signal that discussions around digital asset integration are moving beyond pilot concepts to actual implementation by banks While no specific institutions or timelines beyond the current year were detailed, the analyst’s report underscores that, in SBI’s case, shareholder incentives and banking adoption are presented as parts of the same strategic framework.

57263308,https://nulltx.com/?p=153060,1768715560,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Top 4 Next Big Presale Crypto Projects 2026: ZKP, Maxi Doge, BMIC, LiquidChain You Can’t Ignore",https://nulltx.com/top-4-next-big-presale-crypto-projects-2026-zkp-maxi-doge-bmic-liquidchain-you-cant-ignore/,"Identifying the next big presale crypto before it becomes mainstream is every investor’s goal. Stories of Bitcoin bought for mere dollars or Ethereum purchased before global adoption show the value of early insight. These investors did not rely on luck alone; they recognized real potential before hype took over. Today’s market presents a similar chance for those who actively monitor emerging launches. Finding a top presale crypto is challenging. Thousands of new coins appear daily, and not all are backed by substantial innovation. Success comes to projects solving real-world issues, such as improving privacy, strengthening security, or connecting multiple blockchain networks. This guide highlights four projects in early 2026 showing the strongest signs of growth and investor appeal. 1. Zero Knowledge Proof: $100 Million Investment Builds Real Network Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) has quickly become the most discussed project this year due to its unconventional strategy. While most projects request funding before building, ZKP invested $100 million of its own resources first. They developed a full network and manufactured physical hardware prior to launching their presale auction. This demonstrates financial strength and dedication rarely seen in the crypto space. The Zero Knowledge Proof presale auction operates daily with a projected fundraising goal of $1.7 billion. To maintain fairness, purchases are capped at $50,000 per day, ensuring no single investor dominates the market. A $5 million giveaway further attracts thousands of users daily, creating continuous demand that supports token value. A major attraction is ZKP’s Proof Pods, physical devices that secure the network while generating rewards. These pods are already being shipped, confirming the technology is real and operational. With an established product and a solid economic model, ZKP stands out as the next big presale crypto, offering both innovation and stability in a competitive market. 2. Maxi Doge: Aggressive Meme Coin Staking Rewards Maxi Doge (MAXI) is redefining the meme coin niche by presenting itself as a stronger, more dynamic alternative to Dogecoin. Unlike coins focused purely on humor, Maxi emphasizes high energy and aggressive token mechanics. The project has already raised nearly $4.5 million, showing there is demand for a meme coin with a bold approach. Current investors can enter at roughly $0.000278 per token, but the primary appeal lies in staking rewards. Early holders enjoy an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) exceeding 70%, encouraging token retention over quick selling. The combination of community excitement and attractive returns positions Maxi as a top choice for those seeking the next big presale crypto with a speculative edge. 3. BMIC: Post-Quantum Wallet Secures Investments Safely BMIC (BMIC) addresses a future challenge few projects consider: quantum computing threats to digital wallets. As quantum technology evolves, conventional security may become insufficient. BMIC is creating a Post-Quantum wallet system designed to withstand these advanced attacks, giving investors confidence in long-term safety. The token trades around $0.049, and while the presale auction has raised $300,000, the concept is compelling. BMIC mitigates “harvest now, decrypt later” risks, appealing to investors prioritizing security over rapid gains. Its focus on future-proof protection makes BMIC a strong contender for the next big presale crypto, especially for those concerned about preserving digital assets safely over time. 4. LiquidChain: Layer Three Bridge Simplifies Transactions LiquidChain (LIQUID) tackles the challenge of transferring funds between Bitcoin and Solana efficiently. Current methods are slow and expensive, but LiquidChain acts as a Layer-3 bridge, enabling fast and cost-effective transactions without technical obstacles. The token is priced near $0.0135, with more than $360,000 raised during its presale auction. The project draws investors interested in blockchain interoperability and offers high APY staking options. For those who believe in seamless cross-chain transactions, LiquidChain ranks as a promising next big presale crypto with long-term relevance. Closing Note: Strategies for Early Invest ors These four projects highlight diverse opportunities for investors today. ZKP offers strong infrastructure and innovation. Maxi Doge provides speculative excitement. BMIC ensures quantum-proof security, while LiquidChain focuses on smooth blockchain connections. Each caters to different investment strategies. Presale auctions carry risks, and patience is essential as networks grow and mature. Yet, early stages often deliver the highest potential returns. By analyzing projects like ZKP and understanding their goals, investors can make informed decisions and potentially secure a stake in the next big presale crypto destined for success.

57263505,658168,1768716011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57263505.jpeg,Crypto Bank Anchorage Digital Targets $400M Funding Ahead Of IPO,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-bank-anchorage-digital-targets-400m-funding-ahead-of-ipo/,"Anchorage Digital, a New York–based crypto bank, is moving to raise fresh capital as it prepares to enter public markets. According to Bloomberg , people familiar with the matter say the firm is looking to secure between $200 million and $400 million in new funding. Anchorage Seeks Major Funding Reports say the Firm is exploring a $200M–$400 million round to strengthen its business before a possible public listing. The plan would put Anchorage among a small group of crypto-native companies that have tried to list on stock markets after building regulated services for institutions. The company’s bank affiliate holds a federal charter, a status that gives it a different footing compared with many crypto firms. That federal backing is often cited by investors as a reason Anchorage can offer custody and other services seen as safer by big clients. Based on reports, Anchorage last raised capital in a previous round that valued the business at over $3 billion, and the fresh funding is viewed as a runway toward a public debut. Anchorage Digital, whose affiliate is the first federally chartered US digital-asset bank, is seeking to raise fresh capital as it explores a potential public listing, according to people with knowledge of the matter https://t.co/6xLNEJN54W — Bloomberg (@business) January 16, 2026 Regulatory Edge And Product Push Some reports say the bank is also growing teams tied to stablecoin work and exploring partnerships that would widen its product set for large customers. These moves appear aimed at making the company more attractive to public investors. Market observers note that crypto firms have been considering public listings more often as regulation clears up in certain areas and as institutional demand for custody and regulated rails grows. Anchorage’s timing comes while other custody and asset firms weigh similar steps, a trend that could reshape how big investors access crypto services. The atmosphere is cautious, but there is clear interest in regulated players. Market Reaction And IPO Timing According to market chatter, the bank could seek a listing as soon as next year, although some coverage says 2027 is also possible. Sources quoted by Bloomberg gave a range of potential timing, and Anchorage has not provided a public comment on the plans. If Anchorage completes a successful raise and goes public, the event would signal confidence in firms that combine crypto services with bank-style oversight. Investors will be watching how the company uses the proceeds — whether to build new products, hire staff, or boost its balance sheet ahead of scrutiny that comes with public ownership. The next few months are likely to reveal more details as underwriting and investor talks advance.

His message was clear in its intent: the main issue surrounding XRP is not its current price level, but the limited awareness of what is being built around it. The statement suggests that much of the public conversation remains focused on short-term valuation, while significant technical and institutional developments continue with little mainstream attention. In Squire’s view, this disconnect has led to widespread misunderstanding about XRP’s long-term direction. The problem with $XRP isn’t the price. It’s that very few understand what’s coming. — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) January 15, 2026 XRP Ledger Development Moves Beyond Payments Squire’s position reflects the ongoing evolution of the XRP Ledger as a financial network with expanding capabilities. Development efforts are increasingly centered on extending the ledger’s functionality rather than maintaining its original role as a fast settlement system alone. Engineers and contributors are advancing features that support more complex financial activity, including programmability, interoperability, and on-ledger financial tools. One of the key areas of progress is the introduction of smart contract compatibility through sidechain solutions . This enables developers to deploy applications while benefiting from the XRP Ledger’s transaction efficiency and reliability. At the same time, native lending features and automated liquidity tools are being introduced directly on the ledger. These changes indicate a shift toward enabling financial activity within the network itself, rather than relying on external systems. Institutional Use Cases Take Priority The tweet also aligns with the increasing involvement of institutional participants using the XRP Ledger for real-world financial products. Tokenized assets, including regulated debt instruments and stablecoins, are being issued and settled on the network. This activity focuses on practical financial use rather than speculative trading. Institutions typically prioritize infrastructure that supports compliance, transparency, and operational efficiency, all of which are areas receiving sustained attention in XRP Ledger development. Alongside asset issuance, efforts are underway to ensure the network meets regulatory and operational requirements. Privacy-focused transaction options designed for regulated entities, combined with permission-based access controls, signal that institutional adoption is a central objective. These types of developments tend to progress quietly, often without immediate visibility to retail market participants. Utility Over Short-Term Valuation Squire’s message emphasizes XRP’s function within the ecosystem rather than its market price. As activity on the XRP Ledger grows, XRP plays a direct role in transaction processing, liquidity movement, and settlement operations. This ties the asset’s relevance to usage and network activity rather than short-term sentiment or speculative cycles.

Network upgrades, institutional integration, and financial product deployment often take time to influence market behavior, even as they reshape the underlying system. A Shift in How XRP Is Viewed John Squire’s statement encourages a reassessment of how XRP is understood. Rather than treating it as a purely speculative asset, his viewpoint points to its emerging role within a developing financial network. The changes taking place suggest that the most significant developments may still be ahead, and that understanding XRP requires attention to infrastructure, adoption, and real-world use rather than price alone.

Hyperliquid’s token has also formed numerous risky patterns, pointing to more downside in the near term. HYPE crypto price technicals points to more downside The daily timeframe chart shows that the HYPE crypto price has dropped in the past few months. This retreat happened after it peaked at $60 in September. It retreated after forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, a common bearish reversal sign. The token has dropped below the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level at $28.5, confirming the bearish outlook. It has also dropped below all moving averages, a sign that bears remain in control for now. Hyperliquid price has also formed a bearish flag pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and an ascending channel. This pattern often leads to more downside. It also remains below the Supertrend indicator. Therefore, the most likely HYPE price forecast is bearish, with the next target being at $20. This target is about 22% below the current level. On the other hand, a move above the key resistance level at $28 will invalidate the bearish outlook. HYPE price chart | Source: TradingView Hyperliquid’s perpetual DEX is facing stiff competition The main reason why the HYPE crypto price has crashed in the past few months is that Bitcoin and other altcoins have been in a strong downtrend. Bitcoin has dropped from the year-to-date high of $126,200 in October to the current $95,000. Other top altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano have all slumped. Meanwhile, key Hyperliquid metrics have deteriorated in the past few months, partly because of the ongoing crypto market crash and the rising competition in the perpetual futures market. Data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that the volume in the perpetual futures market has dropped from last year’s high of $1.32 trillion in October to this month’s $521 billion. Hyperliquid’s volume has dropped from a high of $396 billion in August to this month’s $94 billion. As a result, its monthly fees have tumbled to $36 million, down from last year’s high of $144 million. More data shows that competition in the network has continued rising, with most of it coming from Aster, Lighter, and Grvt. Aster network handled over $123 billion in the last 30 days, while Lighter’s volume was $118 billion. Grvt handled $40 billion, and Hyperliquid processed transactions worth over $145 billion. In the past, Hyperliquid was the most dominant player in the industry. Hyperliquid’s metrics have deteriorated in the past few months. For example, the total value locked (TVL) in its layer-1 network has plunged to $2.65 billion from the all-time high of $8.35 billion. Also, the stablecoin supply in the network has dropped to $4.9 billion from the all-time high of $6.2 billion. All these metrics have affected the number of HYPE token buybacks and token burns. That is because the network uses its fees to burn HYPE tokens and repurchase them, which helps to reduce the supply.

The transaction, validated successfully on the XRPL, involved the movement of approximately 589.5 billion units of an issued token while requiring only a small amount of XRP to process. The focus of the information shared was strictly on the transaction data itself, offering a factual look at the network’s performance during a high-volume transfer. BREAKING: A 589.5 billion unit payment was just successfully validated on XRPL with a fee of only 0.000012 XRP. • Lightning fast settlement • Near zero transaction cost Someone transferred a non-XRP token on XRPL XRP was only used to pay the network fee pic.twitter.com/QnKRZvoe37 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) January 16, 2026 Confirmation of the Transaction on the XRP Ledger The images attached to Xaif Crypto’s post show the transaction summary as recorded on the XRP Ledger . The payment status is marked as successful, with the ledger index and transaction sequence confirming final settlement. The delivered amount shown in the ledger matches the full 589.5 billion-unit figure, indicating that the transfer was completed without partial delivery or failure. Despite the size of the transaction, the network fee recorded was only 0.000012 XRP. This fee represents the amount of XRP required to submit and validate the transaction on the ledger and was not part of the asset being transferred. The timestamp and ledger details shown in the transaction summary further confirm that the settlement occurred quickly and was finalized within a single ledger close. Non-XRP Token Transfer Using XRPL Infrastructure A central point emphasized by Xaif Crypto is that the asset moved in this transaction was not XRP . Instead, the XRP Ledger was used as the underlying infrastructure to transfer a different token issued on the network. XRP’s involvement was limited to paying the network fee, which is a standard requirement for processing transactions on the XRPL. This distinction highlights how the XRP Ledger supports the issuance of assets at scale. Participants can move vast quantities of tokens while relying on the ledger’s speed and low transaction costs, without needing XRP to function as the asset being exchanged. The transaction serves as a practical example of this capability, supported by visible and verifiable ledger data.

Instead, it centers on what can be directly observed from the ledger. A transfer involving hundreds of billions of token units was processed successfully, finalized quickly, and completed with a fee that remains extremely low by industry standards. By pointing to a confirmed transaction rather than projections or commentary, the post presents a straightforward case of how the XRP Ledger continues to operate under high-volume conditions. The ledger data shows that large issued-token transfers can be executed efficiently, with XRP serving its role as a fee mechanism rather than the asset being moved.

The EU’s response was immediate, while US Democrats have pushed to introduce legislation to block Trump’s proposed tariffs. Despite all this drama, BTC’s price has remained stable, even though it’s the only financial asset available for trading during the eventful weekend. Latest Developments As reported yesterday, the newly announced tariffs against Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland will be effective from February 1. The taxation will be 10% on all goods sent to the US, but if there’s no deal reached by June 1, the percentage will increase to 25%, said Trump. Shortly after, reports emerged that the EU plans to halt approval of the trade deal with the US after the latest threats. The lawmakers also scheduled an emergency meeting for today. According to analysts from the Kobeissi Letter, who said they spent 12 months researching Trump’s tariff playbook, this is the fourth step in the trade war. They believe financial markets will open lower on Sunday evening and Monday, but Trump will continue to play “hardball.” Unlike the recent US-China bout, they noted that the Greenland situation will require more time because such a potential acquisition “can’t happen overnight and the EU remains highly opposed to even the idea of such a transaction.” The Democrats were quick to move on US soil, reportedly planning to introduce legislation to block the POTUS’s proposed tariffs on EU countries. BTC Stands Still The trade wars have impacted the primary cryptocurrency in previous instances, especially the first one that unraveled in April 2025. At the time, BTC tumbled from $110,000 to $75,000. However, it has been more resilient during the subsequent tariff battles, and the situation seems similar now, at least so far. Although the cryptocurrency markets are the only ones trading 24/7 and are open during this volatile weekend, BTC’s price has remained stable at just over $95,000. Nevertheless, more fluctuations are expected later today as new developments unravel, the EU holds the meeting, and the futures markets open. BTCUSD Jan 18.

Mustafa Suleyman, who heads Microsoft’s artificial intelligence division and previously founded his own tech companies, shared his thoughts in comments posted on X. He thinks these digital companions will be able to understand users better than current technology allows. Understanding users on a deeper level “In five years’ time, everybody will have their own AI companion who knows them so intimately and so personally that they will come to live life alongside you,” Suleyman said . The executive explaine d th ese companions will observe what users observe, listen to what they listen to, and understand their circumstances, preferences, and what motivates them. He described the experience as having a friend or assistant constantly available to help navigate major challenges in life. People online had mixed reactions to his statement. Some expressed enthusiasm about what’s coming, while others were not convinced. Kirk Patrick Miller commented that he would prefer unrestricted technology that can speak freely rather than limited versions. David Shapiro suggested that a five-year timeline means development is moving too slowly. Someone else thought it would happen faster than Suleyman predicted. Sarbjeet Johal pointed out the practical side, such devices would likely need charging every day and cost thousands for regular updates. From Inflection AI to Microsoft Suleyman’s previous work provides insight into why he is interested in this type of technology. Before joining Microsoft , he co-founded Inflection AI alongside Reid Hoffman and Karen Simonyan. That company developed Pi, a chatbot designed for emotional support and conversation instead of just getting jobs done. The program emphasized empathy and understanding. About one million people used Pi daily before Suleyman and his colleagues moved to Microsoft in 2024. Now at Microsoft, Suleyman continues to push for what he describes as humanist superintelligence. His approach centers on ensuring powerful technology remains aligned with human values and serves people’s interests. He stresses containment and setting clear limits so advanced systems help rather than hurt humanity. Technology has already invaded many sectors of society, such as offices, factories, and physical labor machines. However, Suleyman thinks that it will eventually migrate into more personal areas, becoming something people deal with on a daily basis. The question remains whether his five-year prognosis is true, or if technology arrives sooner than expected. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Key Takeaways: Steak ’n Shake made its first $10M Bitcoin treasury purchase after adopting crypto payments. All customer-paid Bitcoin now flows into a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve tied to sales growth. The move reflects a consumer-driven Bitcoin strategy, not a balance-sheet accumulation play. The acquisition, equal to roughly 105 BTC at current market prices, marks the company’s first disclosed direct allocation since it began accepting crypto payments in May 2025. Steak ’n Shake Formalizes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Tied to Sales Growth The move formalizes what the restaurant chain calls a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” a system that channels all Bitcoin received from customers directly into its treasury rather than converting it into cash. In a post on X , Steak ‘n Shake said the approach ties rising same-store sales to long-term reserve growth, creating what it described as a self-sustaining model. Steak ’n Shake enabled Lightning Network payments across all US locations in mid-May, a rollout publicly backed by Jack Dorsey. The company reported transaction fee savings of nearly 50% compared with credit cards, alongside a roughly 15% increase in same-store sales in the months following the launch. The treasury strategy was formalized on Oct. 31 through a partnership with Fold Holdings, which offered customers $5 worth of Bitcoin when purchasing branded menu items such as the “Bitcoin Burger.” As part of the rollout, Steak ‘n Shake will donate 210 satoshis for every “Bitcoin Meal” sold, with funds directed to OpenSats to support Bitcoin Core and open-source development. The promotion tied consumer incentives directly to crypto adoption rather than speculative investment. Eight months ago today, Steak n Shake launched its burger-to-Bitcoin transformation when we started accepting bitcoin payments. Our same-store sales have risen dramatically ever since. All Bitcoin sales go into our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Today we increased our Bitcoin… — Steak 'n Shake (@SteaknShake) January 17, 2026 Steak ’n Shake is owned by Biglari Holdings, led by Sardar Biglari. The parent company has not said whether Bitcoin will play a role in its broader balance-sheet strategy. The restaurant’s approach stands apart from capital-market-driven plays popularized by firms such as Strategy, which raise funds to accumulate Bitcoin. While more than 200 companies now hold Bitcoin, Steak ’n Shake’s $10 million position remains small, signaling a cautious but notable entry from a legacy consumer brand. Steak ’n Shake Expands to El Salvador In November last year, Steak ‘n Shake revealed that it is expanding into El Salvador , marking a symbolic move into the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The announcement followed the chain’s participation in the Bitcoin Histórico event in San Salvador, where the company signaled deeper engagement with the country’s crypto-centered economy. The company briefly faced backlash in October after floating the idea of accepting Ether payments , prompting sharp criticism from Bitcoin-focused customers. Steak ’n Shake quickly reversed course and reaffirmed its commitment to Bitcoin, a stance that appeared to resonate with its core audience as sales momentum continued into the second half of the year.

Investors Favor This New Altcoin Under $1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-crypto-to-buy-now-with-600-investors-favor-this-new-altcoin-under-1/,"The crypto cycles have a tendency of rewarding the assets that accumulate behind the scenes before they become noticeable to a large number of people. Such a trend has been repeated in the market with such tokens as ADA, SOL, and XRP. Their awareness started at low levels followed by expansion to wider adoption levels. This is a similar visible change to one new altcoin, under $1, analysts now say is beginning. It is not a meme token and is not motivated by a social hype. Rather, it is developing using a well mapped roadmap that investors think will be significant in 2026. What Mutuum Finance Has Been Constructing The asset is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It is an Ethereum-based lending protocol. Smart contracts will enable users to provide and borrow assets once they are alive. Two lending paths are introduced with the protocol. The common market will enable deposits to gain interest and increase with time. The distant market enables one to borrow a greater amount of volatile assets with explicit collateral policies and liquidation rationale. Such a design resembles the functioning of adult DeFi lending systems. V1 is the milestone that analysts indicate as the key one. As per the official X of the project, V1 protocol is getting ready to deploy on the Sepolia testnet prior to the mainnet activation. This is the point at which the theoretical lending flows start coming out in real usage information. In the case of most DeFi projects, it is a time when valuation models turn not only hopeful but also verifiably valuable. Growth That Occurred Recently The most recent area of interest has not been marketing, it is accumulation behavior. Mutuum Finance has since surpassed by far the amount raised by 18,800 early holders to over $19.8 million. Each of these numbers never spiked overnight. Rather, the two expanded gradually over the last months as the presale was progressing in consecutive steps. This is what analysts refer to as the pre-visibility accumulation window during which informed investors would place themselves before the mainstream attention flows in. It is the trend that existed in a number of DeFi crypto names in past cycles. During the development and the preparation of the infrastructure, early capital flows in instead of following the events of the launch. The Supply Is in the Spotlight In Phase 7 of the presale, MUTM is currently selling at $0.04. The total number of supply units of 4 billion tokens, 45.5% (approximately 1.82 billion tokens) out of the total supply amount are to be sold off-hand. Over 830 million tokens have been sold in all stages. The presale began in early 2025 at $0.01. Between Phase 1 and Phase 7 MUTM had increased by 300%. The price which is impacted is confirmed at $0.06. This is the reason why analysts declare that the stage of tightening of supply positioning has been reached. The tokens at lower cost levels are increasingly fewer as the phases progress. To someone who will spend $600 at the present price this will be equivalent to 15,000 tokens prior to launch. System-Level Demand Mutuum Finance has a yield system, as well, whose implementation is based on mtTokens. In cases where users place assets as deposits, they are rewarded with mtTokens which increase with interest payment by borrowers. This makes suppliers have organic holding incentives. The second tier is the revenue mechanic. The part of protocol fees will be utilized in purchasing MUTM in the open market when the system becomes operational. MUTM bought in the marketplace is re-examined to users who put in place the mtTokens in the safety component. The model relates buy pressure to the use of protocols and not hype. Collateral valuation will also be supported by the use of Oracle pricing. Chainlink feeds with fallback will be employed in Mutuum Finance. The volatility requires correct pricing during liquidation and risk management, and control in volatility. Analysts argue that these three mechanics form the core of what they call the “utility repricing phase.” In their base scenario, MUTM could reach a valuation between $0.30 and $0.40 within 24 to 36 months, which would represent a 650% to 900% increase from the current $0.04 presale level. They note that this projection depends on adoption, stablecoin borrowing and revenue activation once V1 goes live. What Is Special about This Moment Compared to Earlier Stages Phase 7 has been selling faster than preceding phases. Increases in the size of wallets have been seen over the same time and analysts attribute this to whale positioning before the visibility increases. A 24 hour leaderboard will be provided to the best daily contributor that gives them a reward of $500 in MUTM. Card payments have increased onboarding friction to new participants, making the pool larger than skilled crypto users. This infrastructure preparedness, supply squeeze, and future deployment of V1 is what made MUTM come to investor watchlists as one of the potential best crypto opportunities under $1 as it moves into Q2 2026. The window within which the asset was resting in poor visibility is narrowing down and the visibility is starting to move towards the basic establishment that has been accumulated behind the scenes.

A representative from Cyprus, which now holds the EU Council chair, confirmed the meeting with NBC News. Trump’s Saturday declaration attracted sharp criticism from legislators on both sides of the Atlantic, with many rejecting both the threatening tariffs and his desire to seize control of Danish territory. European leaders condemn tariff threats Roberta Metsola, who leads the European Parliament and hails from Malta, questioned the wisdom of targeting NATO partners. She shared her concerns on X , stating that the actions announced against allies would not strengthen security in Arctic waters. Instead, she warned, such moves could backfire by giving confidence to shared adversaries who want to undermine common principles and lifestyles. Metsola emphasized that both Greenland and Denmark have been clear in their position: the territory cannot be purchased, and its sovereignty must be honored. She stressed that no tariff intimidation would alter this reality. Kaja Kallas, who represents Estonia as vice president of the European Commission and serves as the EU’s top diplomat, suggested that China and Russia would be celebrating Trump’s decision . These nations are the sole beneficiaries when rifts develop between allied countries. Kallas proposed that if concerns about Greenland’s security exist, NATO provides the proper forum for discussion. She cautioned that tariffs would diminish prosperity on both continents and hurt the economies of Europe and America. Kallas also urged that disagreements should not divert attention from the critical mission of supporting Ukraine in ending Russia’s military aggression. Multiple European officials indicated interest in stopping the final ratification of a trade agreement between the EU and the United States that was negotiated last summer. Though portions have already been implemented, the deal still needs European Parliament approval to become fully binding. Bernd Lange, who has long chaired the European Parliament’s international trade committee, expressed his disbelief at the new American tariffs on several countries. In his X post, Lange declared that this approach fails to reflect how partners should treat each other, calling the situation unacceptable and statin g a boundary had been violated. Lange accused Trump of weaponizing trade for political pressure. He argue d th e EU cannot proceed with routine business under these circumstances. The German official demanded that progress on implementing the trade agreement stop until America withdraws its threats. American lawmakers push back on tariffs American legislators also reacted to Trump’s tariff statement. Senators Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, lead the Senate NATO Observer Group together. They released a statement from Copenhagen, where a bipartisan group of congressional members was conducting meetings with Danish officials, hoping to strengthen ties after Trump’s ongoing remarks about Greenland. The senators noted that with many Americans already worried about living expenses, these tariffs would increase costs for households and businesses. They encouraged the administration to abandon threats and pursue diplomatic solutions instead. They reminded that the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway stand as America’s strongest allies. These NATO partners have served in combat alongside Americans, suffered casualties together, and contributed to American security and economic success. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, announce d Sa turday that Democrats plan to present legislation blocking Trump’s European tariffs before they inflict additional harm on the American economy and European partnerships. Schumer criticized Trump’s misguided tariffs for already increasing prices and harming the economy, with current actions making matters worse. He found it remarkable that Trump wants to compound his errors by imposing tariffs on close allies for his unrealistic Greenland takeover attempt . The Senate has approved similar measures limiting Trump’s tariff authority before, with support from both parties, since they require just 51 votes. But even if it passes the Senate, this legislation faces dim prospects in the House. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Ripple’s cross-border token became one of the top performers during the first week, going from under $1.90 to $2.40 in the span of days. However, it was rejected there and now struggles below $2.10, which means a minor decline on a weekly scale. To gain a further perspective on its potential for the week ahead, we decided to ask four of the most popular AI solutions about their take. What’s Next, XRP? OpenAI’s answer to the artificial intelligence boom said that the base case scenario for the week ahead is continued consolidation after a period of strong volatility. Consequently, it believes XRP will remain above the $2.00 psychological support, which has attracted buyers multiple times in recent sessions, and below the $2.30 resistance that aligns with certain rejection levels. In this consolidation phase, XRP will “frustrate” certain traders as it awais for a clearer directional signal from Bitcoin and the broader market, said ChatGPT. Grok’s predictions were a little more concerning for the Ripple bulls. It noted that there’s a major risk for XPR if it dips and closes below $2.00. Then, the bears would reassert their dominance and could drive the asset south to its 2026 starting point of under $1.90. However, it explained that this would be considered a “healthy correction within the larger structure,” but it would likely dampen bullish sentiment in the short term. For the Bulls Perplexity’s forecast stands in the opposite corner. It believes XRP has the strength to reclaim the $2.20-$2.25 resistance with “strong volume,” especially if the inflows into the spot Ripple ETFs continue or even accelerate. If buyers manage to flip that zone into support, then the underlying asset could attempt a recovery toward $2.40-$2.50, especially if BTC stabilizes or pushes higher. Interestingly, Gemini’s take on the matter was quite identical. It believes XRP could retest the $2.40 peak reached on January 6 if it goes beyond $2.22. In fact, it referred to this level as XRP’s “ceiling,” and added that if the asset reclaims it, it would mean that the Q4 correction is over. “The week ahead will likely be a battle to defend $2.00. As long as XRP stays above that price, the monthly uptrend remains intact. If you see it cross $2.15 with high volume, we are likely heading back to the monthly highs,” concluded Gemini.

The results sho w Go ogle search traffic fel l 33 % globally and 38% in America over the past year, according to a report shared by the University of Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. AI overviews may be driving the decline A big part of this decline came after Google started using AI Overview search results. These computer-generated answer s ap pear at the top of search pages and give users several paragraphs of information. People often need to click extra times just to find links to the original sources Google used for those answers. The drop is much worse than what another industry group found. Digital Context Next said in August that Google search traffic to their member websites went down about 10%. Nic Newman works as a senior research associate at the Reuters Institute. He said experts are not sure how much of the traffic loss connects directly to the AI overviews. He also noted that different types of news sites may see different results. Charts tracking US traffic actually showed increases for several months after Google launched the AI search feature. Newman explained that Google has mostly kept AI overviews away from hard news topics, possibly because the system sometimes creates false information called hallucinations. Websites focused on lifestyle content like weather forecasts, television schedules, or horoscopes appear more likely to lose traffic. Google responde d by questioning the findings. The company sent a statement saying their own numbers do not match the sharp declines described in the report. Google raised concerns about which websites Chartbeat chose to study and mentioned an August report from the same company that showed stable search traffic to news sites. Google also pointed out that the study left out traffic numbers from Google News, a detail mentioned in small print under each chart. The company highlighted recent changes, including a new feature letting users select Preferred Sources in Google News and efforts to make links more visible in AI-generated results. Social media traffi c al so falling sharply The Chartbeat information reveals another problem area. Traffic from Google Discover dropped 21% worldwide and 29% in the United States. Google Discover shows suggested links when Android phone users swipe from left to right on their screens. This matters because Google Discover now sends more visitors to news sites than regular Google searches do. Chartbeat found that Discover accounts for 13% of referral traffic globally, compared to just 7.3% from Google search . Social media platforms are also sending fewer readers to news websites. Since May 2023, traffic from Facebook has dropped 43% worldwide and 35% in America. Traffic from X fell even faster, declining 46% globally and 45% in the United States. These numbers paint a difficult picture for newsrooms that depend on outside sources to bring readers to their websites. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/billions-of-xrp-about-to-be-locked-up-in-vaults-heres-the-latest/,"At a time when price performance remains a point of frustration for many market participants, crypto commentator Zach Rector has directed attention to a different set of metrics he believes deserve closer examination. In a recent post accompanied by a short video, Rector argued that large and growing amounts of XRP are being vaulted through exchange-traded products, digital asset treasury companies, and decentralized finance structures. His remarks focused less on short-term market movement and more on how XRP supply dynamics may be evolving behind the scenes. Rector opened by acknowledging the apparent disconnect between price action and structural developments. While XRP’s price has remained under pressure, he stated that the quantity of XRP placed into vault arrangements tied to ETF-related products has continued to increase . According to his figures, more than 800 million XRP have already been vaulted in connection with XRP ETFs, a level he said is rapidly approaching one percent of the total XRP supply. He emphasized that this trend has progressed independently of recent market volatility. Billions of XRP about to be locked up in vaults for ETFs, DATs & DeFi pic.twitter.com/UY7ZEUgAGV — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) January 16, 2026 Projected Growth Across ETFs, DATs, and DeFi Expanding on the data, Rector suggested that the current numbers represent an early stage rather than a plateau. He projected that this process will extend through 2026, with billions of XRP potentially being allocated across ETFs, digital asset treasury companies, and XRP-focused DeFi applications. While he cautioned against prematurely declaring an immediate supply shock, he maintained that a forward-looking assessment supports the idea that circulating supply may become tighter over time as these mechanisms expand. Rector noted that when these different forms of vaulting are considered together, the available circulating XRP may be lower than commonly assumed. His argument rested on aggregation rather than a single structure, proposing that the cumulative effect of ETFs, institutional treasury strategies, and DeFi participation could materially alter perceptions of supply availability. Debate Over the Use of “Locked Up” The terminology used in Rector’s commentary prompted pushback from at least one respondent. An X user, CryptoBiff, challenged the repeated use of the phrase “locked up,” arguing that ETF-held XRP can be sold just as easily as it can be purchased. The commenter suggested that such language could be misleading, even while acknowledging that Rector’s broader analytical points may still hold merit. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This exchange highlighted a recurring debate within digital asset markets regarding how vaulting, custody, and liquidity should be described. While Rector described these developments as reducing effective circulation, critics emphasized that financial products do not permanently remove assets from the market in the same way as irreversible mechanisms might. Focus Shifts Toward Supply Visibility Despite differing views on terminology, Rector’s central claim remained consistent. He argued that attention should not be limited to price movements alone, but should also include monitoring how XRP is allocated across emerging financial structures. In his view, understanding where XRP resides and how it is utilized may become increasingly relevant as institutional products and on-chain systems continue to expand.

According to the police, seven individuals were arrested in the Da Nang region. Vietnam police claimed the suspects were arrested for carrying out scams using computer networks. In its statement on Saturday, the Vietnamese police mentioned that the suspects operated a cryptocurrency scam from their base in Cambodia. The scam allegedly imitated the Nasdaq exchange, and the suspects misappropriated VND14 billion ($532,800). The police mentioned that the suspects also had a strong telecommunications network and electronic means to carry out the illicit activities from the property in the Da Nang region. Vietnam police arrest five individuals in a crypto scam ring According to the Vietnam police statement, the five suspects arrested as a result of their investigations include Nguyen Van Chung, Nguyen Duc Loong, Ong Khac Ming, Vu Tri Huy, Cap BA Nam Viet, Nguyen Anh Do, and Ta Van Ba. The police mentioned that all the suspects were residents of the northern province of Bac Ninh. Investigators claimed the scam came to light after several people reported the criminals to their local police station. The first police report was filed by a 36-year-old woman in Da Nang’s An Khe Ward, who mentioned that she was scammed by the suspects while investing in digital assets on a trading platform that she claimed was called Nasdaq. The Vietnamese police soon saw reports from several others in the region, claiming that the group had sold investments on the trading platform to them as a sure way to make profits and change the lives of their family. Nasdaq is the world’s second-largest stock exchange, based in the United States. It is known for listing tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. According to a preliminary investigation, the group started out in early 2024 after Chung went to Cambodia and colluded with a Chinese national named A Long to organise a scam operation based in the Kim Sa 3 area of the Cambodian border city of Bavet. The group recruited Vietnamese, who were assigned roles in an organized manner. According to reports, the group set up the fake Nasdaq trading website after completing its recruitment and filling all the available administrative positions in the network. The group used Zalo and Telegram groups with dozens of fake accounts to post false trading activities, impersonate investment experts to lure victims into investing their funds, and report false profits. After misusing the funds, the money was routed through several bank accounts and then converted to crypto to conceal its source. Police say investigations remain ongoing Early findings showed that the group scammed people out of more than VND14 billion, with the Vietnam police claiming that two victims lost more than VND1.1 billion. The police mentioned that they carried out a raid on the location after several reports from locals in the area. They were able to seize a large amount of evidence, which included USB drives containing fraud scripts, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and more than VND5.2 billion in cash. The police also added that they uncovered other foreign currencies, dozens of gold-colored metal rings, six land title deeds, and relevant electronic data. While the investigation remains ongoing in the case, the police have warned the public to remain vigilant against online investment offers that look too good to be true. The Vietnamese police claimed that these investments always promise high returns and low risks on social media. In addition, users should refrain from transferring funds to unlicensed websites or applications and report all suspicious signs to authorities. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000561, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000415. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 764,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2026 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price faced minor selling around recent highs. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra low around $0.00000576. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000006 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2026? The Pepe price prediction for 2026 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000025. Will Pepe price reach $0.0001? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.0001 mark by the end of 2031. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2060. Recent news Whale transactions for PEPE surged 620% this week, per Santiment data tracking transfers over $100k. PEPE Price Prediction January 2026 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000004 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.00001. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) January 2026 0.000004 0.00001 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2026 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. In 2026, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000004. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000025, with an average trading price of $0.000015 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses.

The comments followed a report from journalist Eleanor Terrett alleging a clash between Coinbase and the administration of Donald Trump, suggesting officials were unhappy with Coinbase’s decision to step back from the bill. Coinbase withdrew its support earlier this week , arguing that the latest draft of the CLARITY Act could undermine decentralized finance, restrict tokenized stock trading, and block firms from sharing stablecoin yield with users. Armstrong said the exchange would rather see the bill delayed than passed in its current form. He described several provisions as harmful to consumers and innovation, calling the draft “catastrophic” while expressing hope that lawmakers and the industry can reach a more workable compromise. Coinbase has circulated a list of objections to the most recent version of the bill, focusing on its impact on DeFi and stablecoin-based products. In general, love your posts, but this is not accurate. The White House has been super constructive here. They did ask us to see if we can go figure out a deal with the banks, which we're currently working on. Actually, we've been cooking up some good ideas on how we can help… https://t.co/t1bK48oRc0 — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 17, 2026 Those concerns prompted the US Senate Banking Committee to postpone a planned markup of the CLARITY Act, giving lawmakers additional time to negotiate changes with industry participants. Armstrong said he expects a revised version of the bill to return for consideration within the next few weeks. The debate has exposed rifts within the crypto sector itself. Some executives argue the CLARITY Act would provide long-sought regulatory clarity, even with compromises, while others see it as a concession to traditional banking interests. The sharpest divide centers on stablecoin yield, with critics warning that banning revenue sharing could stifle competition and limit consumer choice. Crypto Regulation Turns Political The past week underscored how crypto regulation has moved beyond technical rulemaking into a broader political struggle over institutional independence, enforcement power, and surveillance authority. From central bank pressure to legislative gridlock, the policy environment around digital assets remains unstable and increasingly shaped by political dynamics. That tension came into sharp focus after Jerome Powell publicly warned that a Justice Department probe tied to his congressional testimony risked undermining the independence of the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, momentum on federal crypto legislation slowed as the US Senate Agriculture Committee delayed markup of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act amid unresolved disputes over DeFi, stablecoin yield, and regulatory jurisdiction. Concerns deepened after Galaxy Digital warned that a Senate Banking draft could grant the Treasury sweeping “Patriot Act–style” powers, raising fears that aggressive surveillance authorities could chill innovation and push crypto activity offshore.

The Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office filed the civil forfeiture action to recover the funds in stablecoin Tether. According to reports, the DOJ claimed that the funds were lost to the criminal after he lied to his victim on Tinder that he was a financial advisor who worked as a crypto investment expert. The agency mentioned that the scam had all the markings of a pig butchering scam, where scammers build trust with their victims through friendship or romantic relationships before luring them to invest in fake crypto investments. Usually, some victims realize after their first investments, while others realize after losing all their funds. DOJ seeks to recover $200k in USDT in Tinder crypto scam According to the DOJ affidavit supporting the forfeiture request filed this month by FBI Special Agent Hannah Wong, the unnamed victim met a man on the dating app Tinder. The man claimed his name was “Nino Martin,” which could be an alias, as these criminals refrain from giving up their real names due to the chance that they might be caught in the act. After matching with her on Tinder, the suspect asked to move things to WhatsApp, where he claimed they could talk better. The pair moved things to WhatsApp, and they hit it off quite well. During introductions, the victim said Martin claimed to be a financial advisor who helps people make money through several crypto investments. He mentioned that he could also help her make money through crypto investments, telling her that they could make more than enough profits and be set for life. After several discussions, the victim was convinced and asked that they set up her account. Marin told the victim that he had set up a Coinbase account for her, asking the victim to send funds into the account. A while later, he told her that he would move the funds to a separate platform called onechainnm(dot)com, but the victim accidentally told Martin that they had a balance of about $500,000 in their bank account. According to the affidavit, the victim sent $384,4133 to several unhosted wallets they believed were connected to the platform that Martin suggested. The agency says it will attempt a civil forfeiture The victim claimed that they never met in person, as Martin always gave several excuses that sounded genuine because of the nature of his work. On one occasion, the DOJ said Martin told her that he had to fly to Florida to give a presentation, so they couldn’t meet. However, in March 2025, the investment platform had to change its name to onechainiy(dot)com, and the victim was restricted from their Coinbase accounts due to “sending suspicious transfers.” A while after, unknown individuals claiming to be customer service from the investment platform allegedly then gave her a way to work around Coinbase and keep investing in the platform by wiring money from their bank account to account numbers they provided. The customer service said the victim could keep investing, leading them to send $112,253 in additional funds over the next few days, around the end of March 2025. In April, the fake customer service agents claimed the victim owed an IRS tax of $200,000, which made the victim suspicious, so she stopped sending any money. In total, the victim claimed they transferred more than $500,000 to the platform, a figure that comprised most of their savings. The crypto account connected to the scheme was seized last June. Now, the DOJ is seeking to seize and recover most of these funds. The DOJ can seize properties or earnings if it is determined to be tied to criminal activities.

The assessment was shared alongside a weekly XRP/USD chart, emphasizing what the analyst described as a measured move structure forming across an extended time horizon. Rather than focusing on intraday volatility, the analysis centers on multi-year price behavior and structural patterns visible on higher time frames. According to the projection, XRP could reach $9 or $10 within the coming weeks, followed by $122 in the coming months or years. The distinction between these two phases is central to the analyst’s view, with the shorter-term move described as a continuation within an established structure and the higher target positioned as the eventual outcome of that same formation playing out fully over time. #XRP measured move to $9-10 in the next weeks and $122 in the coming months and years! pic.twitter.com/czcUMUSVM9 — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 16, 2026 Weekly Chart Pattern Underpins the Projection The chart attached to the post shows XRP’s price action plotted on a one-week time frame against the U.S. dollar. The visual analysis highlights a broad, rounded structure spanning several years, with price compressing and then advancing toward the upper boundary of a long-established range. CryptoBull’s markings suggest that XRP has already completed the base of this structure and is now advancing along its latter stages. Within this context, the $9–$10 zone is presented as a measured move aligned with prior resistance levels visible on the weekly chart. The higher $122 level is shown as a longer-term extension, derived from the same structural framework rather than a separate or unrelated forecast. The emphasis of the analysis remains on technical positioning rather than external catalysts, fundamentals, or macroeconomic developments. Community Pushback Focuses on Timelines and Certainty The projection drew immediate responses from other market participants, some of whom questioned not the possibility of higher prices, but the timelines attached to them. One commenter argued that while a triple-digit valuation might be viable over several years, assigning such an outcome to a window of months risks creating unrealistic expectations. Another response criticized the lack of precise timing, suggesting that broad references to days, weeks, months, and years weaken the credibility of price forecasts and can contribute to confusion among less experienced participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These reactions underscore an ongoing tension within technical analysis commentary, where long-term projections often coexist with short-term expectations in the same narrative. While CryptoBull’s analysis attempts to separate them, critics remain wary of how such projections may be interpreted when shared publicly. Projection Remains Anchored to Chart-Based Reasoning Despite the criticism, the post itself remains focused on chart-derived reasoning. The analyst does not present guarantees or certainties; it frames the targets as outcomes of the current technical structure as it continues to develop as anticipated. As with all technical projections, the scenario depends on market conditions remaining favorable and key levels holding over time.

He believes that if the network stopped evolving, it would simply not survive. He noted on X: “Solana needs to never stop iterating. It shouldn’t depend on any single group or individual to do so, but if it ever stops changing to fit the needs of its devs and users, it will die.” Buterin’s previous assertion that Ethereum must be able to stand on its own over the long term, without relying on continual input from its developers, was the premise for his post. Yakovenko insists the blockchain needs to remain useful to both users and developers In his post, Yakovenko said the Solana network needs to provide practical value or risk vanishing altogether. From his perspective, the chain needs to be valuable enough to users and profitable enough for developers to help push ongoing upgrades to the open-source protocol. He argued that for any protocol to survive, it must always be useful, and that upgrades should resolve specific problems with users or developers, not try to do everything. He also insisted that there would always be another version of Solana, even if that version didn’t come from Anza, Solana Labs, or the foundation, and that future SIMD votes might provide the fuel for the GPUs that develop the code. In contrast, Buterin had earlier shared that Ethereum would prioritize decentralization, privacy, and self-sovereignty , even if that limits broader adoption. On Friday, the network founder asserted , “In 2026, no longer. Every compromise of values that Ethereum has made up to this point – every moment where you might have been thinking, is it really worth diluting ourselves so much in the name of mainstream adoption – we are making that compromise no longer.” However, he affirmed that there’s still much more Ethereum must accomplish before a hands-off approach is feasible. He pushed that the network must implement quantum resistance, improve scalability, and adopt a block-building design that resists centralization to stand the test of time. Yakovenko’s supporters say failing to adapt could kill the network So far, Buterin supporters have argued that adding more features would increase technical risk and create more room for centralization. Yet supporters of Yakovenko’s philosophy argue that not evolving fast enough could leave chains behind that move more quickly. Nonetheless, some users, however, expressed skepticism about Yakovenko’s idea that future Solana releases may not necessarily come from Anza, Labs, or the foundation, if it means evolution. One X user pointed out that without one of the three leading the upgrade, progress would be painfully slow—essentially causing the network to ossify. He gave Bitcoin as an example, noting that it still implements changes, but they take years to navigate through the community’s internal politics. Though some argued that the network must continue iterating and adapting, regardless, because a blockchain that stops adapting will eventually die. Although they have pursued different development strategies, Ethereum and Solana continue to lead the layer-1 blockchain industry. Ethereum wins for decentralization and tokenized assets, while Solana is known for its high-speed network, consumer app popularity, and fee revenue. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

He argued that Solana must keep evolving to survive, even as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin pushes for blockchains to outlive active developer influence. Yakovenko shared his view after Buterin discussed the idea that Ethereum should eventually pass a longevity benchmark. That benchmark would allow the chain to run for decades with minimal developer involvement. However, Yakovenko said that mindset risks turning a blockchain into something outdated. He emphasized that networks must keep adapting to developers and users, or they lose relevance. Significantly, Yakovenko framed upgrades as a survival requirement, not a luxury. He said protocol improvements should focus on solving practical problems for developers and users. At the same time, he suggested teams must reject most feature requests. Hence, Solana should stay focused on usefulness rather than broad approval. AI Development Could Become Solana’s Next Growth Engine Additionally, Yakovenko described a future where transaction activity creates enough economic value to fund continuous development. He suggested Solana’s fee model could help developers support upgrades over time. Moreover, he pointed to AI-assisted coding as a tool that could speed up improvements across the ecosystem. He also signaled that Solana should never rely on one team for progress. Consequently, he expects new contributors to build future versions as the chain matures. He even suggested governance mechanisms could eventually fund the computing power needed to produce upgrades. SOL Slips as Traders Watch Key Zones Source: CoinCodex Solana’s price moved lower in the last 24 hours. SOL traded near $142.27 with a daily decline of 1.28%. However, weekly performance stayed positive with a 4.62% increase. The token held a market cap near $80.4 billion with 570 million in circulation. According to INSIDER, the chart setup still supports a bullish local outlook. The analyst said Solana broke a weekly downtrend line after a sharp selloff. Consequently, the next area of interest sits between $160 and $170. Traders may take profits there due to prior supply pressure. Source: X Analysts Compare SOL’s Phase to ETH’s Past curb.sol compared Solana’s long consolidation to Ethereum’s cycle before its major run. The analyst said SOL has ranged between $100 and $300 for nearly two years. Consequently, the pattern reminded him of ETH’s 2019 to 2020 base. curb.sol said he used that period to accumulate Ethereum and now takes the same approach with Solana. Moreover, he repeated a long-term view that SOL can eventually reach $1000.

In a new twist to the GainBitcoin cryptocurrency fraud case, an official of the audit firm appointed by the Pune Police and Cyber Police investigating the case has been arrested by the Mumbai police. According to reports, the official of the audit firm was arrested for stealing seized digital assets worth about Rs. 30 crore ($3.3 million), in alleged collusion with police personnel. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) released a statement saying it arrested an official of the Indian audit firm Gaurav Harish Mehta, and is looking for other co-conspirators, including officers attached to the investigations whose identities have cropped up in the investigation that spanned from Mumbai to Pune. Indian director held in connection with stolen crypto The case originated from the GainBitcoin fraud case that was popular in India around 2018. The case was registered at Nigdi and Dattawadi police stations in Pune, under various sections of the IPC, MPID Act, and the Information Technology Act. Mehta’s lawyer, Aftab Qureshi, argued in a court sitting that the police merely falsely implicated Mehta. He claimed that his client was called in to assist with the investigations and arrested him in the process. Qureshi argued that the police lied to Mehta, pretending that he was going to assist them with the case, but instead, they are making him the scapegoat. Despite his claims that his client had been falsely accused, the 47th Metropolitan Magistrate Court refused his plea and asked that Mehta be remanded in police custody as investigations continue and new information continues to unfold. It remains unknown if Mehta will be eligible for bail later in the year. The GainBitcoin scam involved several unscrupulous elements luring Indian investors with the promises of high returns through cryptocurrency investments. Like most crypto scams, the perpetrators targeted Indian residents with little or no knowledge about how crypto worked, but were hoping to make profits through the investments. However, things didn’t go as planned for everybody as investors discovered that they had all been dragged into fake crypto investments, which eventually led to the police being involved. After several back-and-forths with investigations, the police were able to raid the location of the scammers, get their hands on sensitive forensic materials, and subsequently appointed an Indian audit firm to help investigate the fraud. Now, the police are accusing the firm that they hired of siphoning more than Rs. 30 crore. According to the Indian police, the force appointed advocate Ravindranath Patil, who had worked as a director with KPMG, as a technical expert in the case. Police continue investigations into the stolen assets Patil acted as the technical expert when the Indian police engaged KPMG in August 2018 to conduct a forensic audit of the seized cryptocurrency wallets. Subsequently, another firm was appointed to act as an independent forensic auditor. During this process, crypto hardware wallets seized from the accused persons were provided for technical examination. Investigations claimed that instead of safeguarding the seized digital assets, officials of the audit firm embezzled the funds. Investigators attached to the Indian police claimed that the officials colluded with a few police officers, physically moving digital assets from the wallets and diverting the funds to private exchanges and hardware wallets. The embezzlement was discovered during a technical and digital footprint analysis carried out by the Indian police. DCP Sangramsingn Nisandar confirmed the incident and claimed the Indian police seized several electronic devices in raids at different locations in Mumbai and other cities. The Indian police mentioned that the probe has revealed several large crypto transactions carried out that have been linked to the accused. They mentioned that the case is expected to widen, as they anticipate the inclusion of more officers of the Indian police.

Now analysts are monitoring a new DeFi altcoin with a valuation below $1 and that is in an initial stage of valuation when expectations start becoming visible. Many investors are questioning whether the token will be among the top-ranking crypto performers by 2027 and be able to provide the percentage expansions as the previous DeFi cycles. What Mutuum Finance is Creating Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a decentralized lending protocol that will enable users to lend and borrow crypto assets in smart contracts in the future. Suppliers will be interest-earning and get both the yield and principal-tracked mtTokens. It is the borrowers who will put down collateral and pay interest in order to access liquidity but not by offloading long term holdings. This model is desirable when the markets are in bull phases and the traders require leverage and capital efficiency. MUTM is yet to be listed on exchanges. The token is already trading in its structured presale at $0.04. The sale opened in early 2025 and since that time, more than $19.8 million has been raised and more than 18,800 holders have already taken positions. The tiered pricing is employed in the allocation system. The current amount of 4 billion total supply is split into 45.5% presale distribution and over 830 million tokens were sold. The established launch price is $0.06, which implies that the first entrants were at a price below the estimated publications. V1 Protocol Activation As per the official X statement , the V1 protocol is on the way to being deployed on the Sepolia testnet preceding mainnet. This is where the lending volumes, repayments and liquidation information starts to emerge. Movies analysts observe that DeFi lending platforms tend to reprice in these windows since the valuation moves from narrative to quantifiable usage. The roadmap has also included security preparation. Halborn Security audited the V1 codebase. CertiK scored MUTM to 90 out of 100 in its Token Scan. There is a bug bounty of $50,000 that is underway to find vulnerabilities prior to the actual assets being attached to the protocol. This price scenario is supported by this combination of testnet activation and security validation. Other analysts envisage MUTM between $0.10 and $0.18 in its initial initial period of use. Based on the present presale price of $0.04, it is a 2.5x-4.5x window in case the adoption scales by Q3 2026. Post-Launch Price Mechanics Once the mainnet has been turned on, price movement will possibly revert to normal when yield incentives and protocol revenue start to affect the pattern of holding and demand. Suppliers will be issued with mtTokens which will grow with the interest paid by borrowers. This promotes holding of deposits as opposed to rotating on a short term basis. A second mechanic supports long term value. Part of the protocol revenue will be utilized in purchasing MUTM in the open market. The open market sale of MUTM is resold to holders, who deposit mtTokens in the safety module. This compliments token demand with real lending activity but not hype cycles. In a scenario of heavier usage, analysts map a second price frame of between $0.40 and $0.50. Based on the current presale price of $0.04, it would translate to a 10x to 12x movement in 2027 in case of greater participation and greater borrowing levels. Long-Term View Stablecoins are likely to be an important part within the protocol. The use of stablecoins to borrow money makes it possible to access liquidity without the price volatility impacting the repayment of the loan. When the market sentiment becomes bullish and the value of assets goes up, the demand of borrowing stablecoin is likely to increase. Integrations at Layer-2 are also under consideration in a bid to lower the gas expenses and enhance the rate of liquidation. It is important in the lending systems since the slow liquidation raises the risk of insolvency in volatile times. With stablecoin borrowing and Layer-2 support both increasing by 2027, analysts project a higher valuation range of $0.70 to $0.80, which would put MUTM within the 850%-950% growth range. These scenarios indicate why MUTM is being shown on potential best cryptocurrency to invest in lists in 2026-2027. Participation Signs Phase 7 has been selling faster than other phases. During this time, whales have been reported to enter the place with huge allocations. A daily leaderboard that grants the highest daily contributor $500 in MUTM will encourage more people to play and card payments have been supported to allow people who do not access traditional exchange channels. When V1 deployment coincides with these distribution signals, analysts will predict an increase in visibility when the token enters the public trade and consumption stage. MUTM is also being considered as a long-term valuation asset instead of a short-term speculation asset to those who are making their minds up about what crypto to purchase at current prices that are below $1.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong explained that the draft has some big problems, especially around stablecoins and the interest people earn on them. He said the proposed changes “would kill rewards on stablecoins, allowing banks to block their competition.” In simple words, these rules could stop people from earning interest on stablecoins and give more control to traditional banks. “After reviewing the Senate Banking draft text over the last 48 hours, Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written,” Armstrong said. “This version would be materially worse than the current status quo,” he added. “We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill.” U.S. Senate cancels its vote on the crypto market structure bill COINBASE SAYS IT CAN’T BACK THE SENATE BANKING CRYPTO DRAFT.

NO BILL > BAD BILL pic.twitter.com/3antyA32k0 — Money Ape (@TheMoneyApe) January 15, 2026 Stablecoins are digital money that stay close to the value of the US dollar, and many people use them to earn interest. If these new rules pass, banks could limit how stablecoins work, which might take away opportunities for crypto users and reduce competition. Coinbase is warning that this could shift control of money back to banks and affect both investors and the broader crypto market. People are now watching closely to see how this will play out. If these stablecoin restrictions pass, XRP could face pressure as crypto investors may move cautiously, reducing demand. This could slow price growth and keep XRP near key support levels. XRP Price Prediction: Descending Triangle Signals Breakdown Below $2.05 Toward $1.90 XRP price prediction is neutral as XRP is currently trading around $2.0568, sitting just above a key support zone near $2.0527. Price action is compressing within a descending triangle, a structure often associated with bearish continuation. The triangle’s lower boundary aligns with horizontal support, while the upper trendline shows consistent lower highs. Recent candles show indecision, with small-bodied formations and no clear momentum shift. The leading technical indicator, such as RSI, is hovering near 45, indicating neutral momentum but leaning slightly bearish. The moving averages (red and blue) remain flat, suggesting a lack of trend strength. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Fibonacci levels highlight $2.1127 and $2.1911 as potential resistance zones if price breaks upward, while $1.9764 and $1.9144 mark downside targets on a breakdown. Until a decisive move occurs, the triangle pattern remains in play. A confirmed close below $2.0527 could open a short setup targeting $1.9144, while a breakout above $2.1127 would invalidate the bearish bias and favor a move toward $2.1911. Trade idea: short below $2.0527. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

This move highlights the investment manager’s aggressive buying in 2026, which has contributed to a short-term rebound in the two leading assets. The bulk of the inflows went into Bitcoin via BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which recorded net purchases totaling roughly $1.04 billion over the five days from January 12 to January 16. While the week included one day of notable outflows, sustained buying across the remaining sessions more than offset the dip. The most aggressive accumulation occurred midweek, when IBIT alone attracted over $600 million in a single session, coinciding with broader strength across spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Source: Coinglass BlackRock Ethereum inflows Ethereum also saw meaningful capital allocation, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) adding approximately $219 million worth of Ether over the same period. After starting the week with modest net outflows, ETHA reversed course, posting consecutive days of solid inflows. A standout session saw ETHA pull in nearly $150 million in one day on January 15, marking one of its strongest daily performances in recent weeks. Total Ethereum spot ETF inflows. Source: Coinglass Taken together, BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum purchases lifted combined crypto ETF exposure to about $1.25 billion for the week. This accumulation occurred alongside broadly positive flows across the wider ETF market. Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded several strong inflow days earlier in the week before a sharp pullback in the final session, while Ethereum spot ETFs maintained a net positive balance overall despite uneven daily activity. Impact on Bitcoin price Indeed, the purchases coincided with Bitcoin’s continued push toward reclaiming the $100,000 mark, having at one point surged to $98,000 before retracing and holding the $95,000 support zone. As of press time, the flagship cryptocurrency was trading at $95,093, having rallied almost 5% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

The shift comes nearly a year after DeepSeek rattled global markets by challenging US dominance with the launch of its open-source DeepSeek-R1, a highly capable AI model. Since then, reports from credible sources show that Chinese tech shares have opened the year strongly, buoyed by fresh breakthroughs across sectors such as commercial rockets, robotics, and flying cars. *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""4d56dde5-c468-481e-b9a0-8e9bb957abbd"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-2"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> As a result, a Nasdaq-style index tracking Chinese technology stocks has climbed nearly 13% in January 2026, while a gauge of Hong Kong-listed Chinese tech firms has risen close to 6%. Both benchmarks have outperformed the Nasdaq 100 over the same period. China’s growth outlook remains resilient Since April last year, analysts have noticed that China’s stock market has been on an upward trend , mainly due to enthusiasm for local technology, despite the Asian nation’s difficulties managing low consumer spending and a housing crisis. With this finding, sources noted that individuals have placed bets on prediction markets anticipating sustained upward momentum in the coming months, driven by the introduction of a new, highly capable AI model from DeepSeek and China’s economic plan set to focus on technological independence over the next five years. On Friday, January 16, Mark Mobius, a managing director of Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund, released a statement noting that “The stock market indicates that what China is doing in the technology sector will be very exciting in the future,” adding that, “We must remember that China’s goal now is to surpass the US in technology, high-level chips, and various types of AI. So investments are flowing in that direction.” Meanwhile, since DeepSeek shook up the market worldwide with its cheap, cutting-edge AI models on January 27, 2025, the tech company has motivated other Chinese-based firms to accelerate their efforts and develop their own model versions. This situation demonstrates a growing trend in the tech industry, with companies, mostly leading Chinese internet firms such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd ., increasingly interested in generative AI. The tech industry faces stiff competition amid the AI boom era Just as with generative AI, Chinese-based firms have also shown heightened interest in creating robots, sparking stiff competition in the sector. These Chinese robots have participated in marathons, engaged in boxing matches, and performed folk dances, proving their power. On the other hand, the manufacturing sector is integrating high-end language models into advanced equipment such as precision machinery and flying taxis. With these advancements in the tech sector, investors have adopted a new perspective towards China, transforming it from an earlier view as just a cost-effective manufacturing base into a serious rival to major US tech firms. This change in perspective comes at a time when global investors are seeking new opportunities to expand. In the meantime, data from Jefferies Financial Group Inc., dated January 13, showed that a team of 33 Chinese AI stocks saw their combined market value surge by around $732 billion in 2025. With these results, Jefferies anticipated that China could still do better, as its market value in the AI industry is just 6.5% of the United States.

Key Takeaways: Ethereum’s validator exit queue has dropped to zero as staking inflows surge to multi-year highs. Rising entry backlogs and institutional staking are tightening ETH supply and reducing sell pressure. Analysts see the shift as a bullish structural signal despite ETH trading below its all-time high. Data from the Ethereum Validator Queue shows the exit queue has fallen from a September 2025 peak of roughly 2.67 million ETH to none, while the entry queue has surged more than fivefold over the past month to about 2.6 million ETH. The imbalance has pushed estimated entry wait times to roughly 45 days, while validators seeking to exit are being processed within minutes. Ethereum Staking Backlog Signals Tighter Supply Market participants say the reversal points to strengthening supply dynamics for Ether, as more tokens are locked into staking contracts rather than becoming available for sale. Leon Waitmann, head of research at Onchain Foundation, said the growing entry backlog could lift Ethereum’s staking rate toward new highs once those validators go live, calling the setup bullish for the months ahead. Institutional demand has been a key driver. Ethereum staking currently offers yields of around 2.8% annualized, an increasingly attractive return for large holders seeking income without liquidating positions. Among the largest contributors is BitMine Immersion Technologies , chaired by Tom Lee, which has staked more than 1.25 million ETH, over a third of its total holdings, according to public disclosures. Broader onchain data reinforces the trend. Analytics firm Santiment reports that more than 46.5% of Ethereum’s total supply, about 77.85 million ETH, is now held in the proof-of-stake deposit contract, valued at roughly $256 billion at current prices. Meanwhile, data from Beaconcha.in shows total staked ETH at around 36.1 million, representing close to 29% of circulating supply. Zero Ethereum is waiting to be unstaked! Exit queue: 0 ETH This has not happened since July 2025. Last time, it preceded a strong ETH price rally. At the same time, staking demand is accelerating. Entry queue: 1,811,273 ETH waiting to be staked What does it… pic.twitter.com/gipHBhpQYH — Leon Waidmann (@LeonWaidmann) January 12, 2026 Despite the surge in staking participation, ETH’s price remains below its August 2025 all-time high of $4,946. Still, analysts say the collapse of the exit queue and swelling entry demand underscore a structural shift that could support prices if momentum holds. Ethereum User Activity and Retention Surge as New Addresses Double As reported, Ethereum is seeing a notable influx of new users , with onchain data showing activity retention among recent entrants has nearly doubled over the past month, according to Glassnode. The firm said a sharp rise in first-time interacting addresses suggests fresh users are driving network growth, rather than short-term spikes from existing participants, with new active addresses climbing from just over 4 million to around 8 million in a single month. Broader metrics point to sustained momentum. Active addresses have more than doubled year over year, while daily transactions recently hit a record 2.8 million, up roughly 125% from last year, data from Etherscan shows. Analysts link the trend to lower fees and growing stablecoin usage, alongside Ethereum’s shift toward layer-2 execution while retaining settlement on the main chain. Last week, Buterin said the Ethereum network has solved the blockchain trilemma, crossing a milestone many in crypto long viewed as unattainable.

Most fade quickly. A few build real utility. Today, a growing group of analysts and early adopters are shifting attention from famous meme coins toward emerging lending platforms. Their focus is no longer just hype or social trends. It is moving toward income, infrastructure, and measurable use. This is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly being mentioned in serious crypto predictions as a stronger candidate for the best crypto to invest than Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin (DOGE): Popularity Without Real Yield Dogecoin (DOGE) began in 2013 as a playful experiment based on a Shiba Inu meme. Created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, it was never designed as a financial system. Its strength has always been community humor, viral moments, and celebrity attention. Over time, Dogecoin (DOGE) became a cultural icon, especially after high-profile tweets and social media trends pushed its price upward. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) has serious structural limits. It has no lending system, no staking tied to real economic activity, and no revenue model that feeds value back to holders. The supply of Dogecoin (DOGE) increases every year without any mechanism that directly rewards long-term users. Price movements depend mostly on sentiment, influencers, and broader market cycles rather than utility. Liquidity for Dogecoin (DOGE) is high on major exchanges, but liquidity alone does not create sustainable value. When market volatility rises, Dogecoin (DOGE) often swings wildly because it lacks on-chain mechanisms that stabilize demand. There is no built-in liquidation system, no collateral structure, and no framework that protects users from bad debt or sudden crashes. For this reason, many analysts now see Dogecoin (DOGE) more as a trading instrument than a serious financial tool. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Presale The project is currently in presale phase 7. The total token supply is fixed at 4 billion. Across all previous phases, around $19.80 million has already been generated. The current price sits at $0.04, which is still a discounted entry point compared to later stages. More than 18,850 holders are already participating across all phases combined, showing steady organic interest instead of artificial marketing spikes. In phase 7 alone, 7% of the 180 million token allocation has already been sold, proving that demand continues to build rather than slow down. This presale is positioned as 100% legitimate. The team has been active since early 2025 and has followed its roadmap consistently. Milestones have been delivered on time. A fully functional lending protocol is scheduled to launch, and the community has been growing naturally without paid hype campaigns. Unlike many speculative projects that disappear after raising funds, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has maintained transparency and steady progress, clearly separating itself from the rug-pull culture that still damages trust in the crypto industry. Community engagement is already live. The 24-hour leaderboard resets every day at 00:00 UTC. The top-ranked user who completes at least one transaction will receive $500 worth of MUTM daily. This keeps participation high and turns regular activity into real incentives. Dual Lending Models Explained Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built around real lending, real borrowing, and real revenue. Its Dual Lending Model combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P), giving users practical reasons to hold and use the token rather than just speculate on price. In the P2C model, lenders will deposit assets such as USDT or SOL into audited smart contracts. These pooled assets will then be available to borrowers who must provide overcollateralized positions. Interest rates will adjust automatically based on demand. When more people borrow, rates rise, which attracts more lenders. When borrowing slows, rates normalize. This creates a self-balancing financial loop. Depositors will receive mtTokens that represent both their deposit and their growing interest. These mtTokens will also serve as collateral for future loans, making capital more flexible. A simple example shows the power of this system. If a user lends $15,000 in USDT, they will receive mtUSDT at a 1:1 ratio. With an average APY of around 17%, that user will earn $2,550 in passive income within a year, without selling their original capital. Borrowers also benefit. If someone holds $1,000 worth of ETH but does not want to sell it, they will be able to use that ETH as collateral and borrow up to 70% of its value, depending on the assigned LTV. This gives access to liquidity while still keeping exposure to future ETH price growth. The P2P model will handle riskier or more volatile tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE. Here, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly. There will be no shared pool, so lenders take more risk but can also demand higher returns. This design protects the core system while still allowing users to generate income from meme assets. Market stability also matters. Mutuum’s risk system accounts for volatility and liquidity. Lower-volatility assets such as stablecoins and ETH will support higher LTV levels around 7% with a matching 7% liquidation threshold. More volatile tokens will operate in a tighter 35–7% LTV range with stricter liquidation rules. Safer assets will carry a reserve factor near 10%, while riskier ones can reach up to 57%, protecting the protocol while still allowing broad participation. Every loan on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will require overcollateralization. A Stability Factor will track how safe each position is. If collateral value falls too low, automated liquidators will step in to repurchase debt at a discount. This keeps the system solvent and prevents losses from spreading across users. As part of the beta rollout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its V1 of the protocol on the Sepolia Testnet soon, starting with ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral use. Security and MUTM Buybacks Mechanics Security has been treated as a priority, not an afterthought. In November 2025, Halborn completed a formal audit of Mutuum’s smart contracts. Six issues were identified, including one high-severity finding. The team resolved all of them before final approval. Halborn confirmed that 100% of reported findings were remediated, strengthening confidence as the project moves toward launch. One of the strongest growth drivers is the buy-and-distribute model. A portion of revenue from lending and borrowing fees will be used to buy MUTM from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This means active users will earn rewards directly tied to real platform activity, not inflationary token printing. As usage grows, buy pressure increases, supporting steady price momentum after listing. Early Investors Have Clear Advantage Now consider a real investment example. Imagine an investor sold part of their SOL holdings in phase 1 and invested $10,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.01. That purchase delivered 1,000,000 tokens. At today’s phase 7 price of $0.04, that position is already worth $40,000, a clear 4x return and a $30,000 profit. When the token lists at $0.06, that same holding will be valued at $60,000, representing a 6x increase from the original investment. After listing, strong platform usage will push the price to at least three times the listing value, reaching around $0.18 and delivering another 200% gain from the exchange debut. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), whose price depends largely on tweets and trends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed around lending activity, staking rewards, and continuous buybacks. The platform and token will launch together, giving users a working product on day one instead of an empty promise. This expected synchronized rollout will attract serious attention from Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges and institutional watchers.

57267777,658184,1768730431,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57267777.jpeg,Bitcoin Cycle Far From Over  — Here’s What’s Happening,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-cycle-far-from-over-heres-whats-happening/,"Bitcoin prices continue to consolidate within the $95,000 zone following the pullback in the latter part of the past week. The premier cryptocurrency is experiencing a bullish January performance marked by a net gain of 11.42% since the new year commenced. However, the effects of the extended price correction from Q4 2025 linger. Using recent on-chain data, a market analyst with the username MorenoDV_ has identified certain holder cohorts who are still experiencing extreme psychological stress that could impact future price trajectory. Bitcoin Market Risk Redistribution Ongoing – Here’s Why In a QuickTake post on January 17, MorenoDV_ postulates that the Bitcoin bull cycle remains on despite the negative events of Q4 2025. Notably, the crypto market leader experienced a heavy 33% price correction after hitting its current all-time high ($126,198) in early October. Although Bitcoin has recorded some modest price recovery in the past month, significant expectations of a bear market remain, driven by a diminished market demand and failure to reclaim key technical levels such as the 365-day MA. Using the data from the Realized Price by UTXO Age Bands, MorenoDV explains that the Bitcoin market is actively redistributing risk. This positive development counters the bearish narrative of a market cycle ending. With the present spot price around $95,583, the CryptoQuant metric shows that psychological stress is unevenly distributed among Bitcoin holders. Notably, short-term holders, i.e., 1w-1m and 1m-3m cohorts, have realized prices, i.e., $89,255 and $93,504, respectively, below the spot price. This data suggests that these classes of investors are in profit and are experiencing low market pressure, which helps keep fear at bay. However, mid-term holders of 3m-6m and long-term holders of 6m-12m have realized prices of $114,808, and $100,748 both of which are significantly above the present spot price. However, both holder cohorts have chosen to bear the discomfort by absorbing losses rather than initiating an aggressive redistribution. Therefore, as the spot price rises towards the realized price levels of these stressed cohorts, losses are expected to significantly reduce, eventually easing these pressures on these classes of holders and balancing the market risk. This market development only occurs if the 3m-6m and 6m-12m continue to interpret the present market drawdown as a mere cyclical discomfort rather than a change in market structure. Therefore, there is a need for a sustained bullish narrative and constructive price behavior to keep these investors from seeking a market exit. Bitcoin Price Overview At press time, Bitcoin trades at $95,265, reflecting a modest 5.3% gain in the last week.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin risk distribution|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Long-Term Holders|Short-Term Holders,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-18 10:00:31
57267800,https://cryptonews.com/?p=475812,1768730441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57267800.jpeg,"Solana’s Future Hinges on Constant Innovation, Says Co-Founder",https://cryptonews.com/news/solanas-future-hinges-on-constant-innovation-says-co-founder/,"Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has declared that the network’s survival depends on perpetual evolution, directly challenging Ethereum’s recent push toward protocol ossification. In a statement posted yesterday, Yakovenko argued that Solana must “ never stop iterating ” to remain materially useful to developers and users, warning that stagnation would prove fatal regardless of which teams drive future upgrades. The remarks came in response to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s January 12 manifesto, which called for the network to achieve a state where it “ can ossify if we want to ,” establishing quantum resistance, a scalable architecture, and account abstraction as prerequisites before freezing core protocol development. I actually think fairly differently on this. Solana needs to never stop iterating. It shouldn’t depend on any single group or individual to do so, but if it ever stops changing to fit the needs of its devs and users, it will die. It needs to be so materially useful to humans… https://t.co/itqr1b5az4 — toly (@toly) January 17, 2026 Protocol Evolution as Existential Requirement Yakovenko rejected the premise that blockchain protocols should aim for completion, instead framing continuous adaptation as the only path to long-term viability. “ It shouldn’t depend on any single group or individual to do so, but if it ever stops changing to fit the needs of its devs and users, it will die, ” he stated. The co-founder outlined a vision where protocol improvements are funded directly by developers whose livelihoods depend on network transactions. “ It needs to be so materially useful to humans and used by so many devs that are gainfully employed from the value of the transactions on solana, that the devs have spare LLM token credits to upstream improvements to this common open source protocol,” Yakovenko explained. He emphasized that maintaining utility requires disciplined governance alongside relentless innovation. “ To not die requires to always be useful. So the primary goal of protocol changes should be to solve a dev or user problem. That doesn’t mean solve every problem, in fact, saying no to most problems is necessary, ” he added. Decentralized Development Beyond Core Teams Yakovenko’s comments suggest that future Solana upgrades will increasingly originate outside established development organizations such as Anza, Solana Labs, and Firedancer. “ You should always count on there being a next version of solana, just not necessarily from anza or labs or fd ,” he wrote. The co-founder suggested emerging governance models could fundamentally reshape how protocol changes are proposed and funded. “ The way things are going we are likely to end up in a world where a simd vote pays for the GPUs that write the code, ” Yakovenko stated, referencing Solana’s improvement proposal process. This decentralized development philosophy comes as Solana demonstrates resilience under extreme stress. The network withstood a sustained distributed denial-of-service attack peaking near 6 terabits per second last month (the fourth-largest DDoS attack in internet history) without visible performance degradation or delayed block production. Solana has weathered one of the most powerful DDoS attacks ever recorded without any visible impact on network performance. #Solana #Sui https://t.co/JC9BdGbU5e — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 16, 2025 Network Metrics Show Steady Growth Amid Market Volatility Solana’s technical positioning contrasts with recent liquidity challenges. Last month, on-chain data from Glassnode shows the network’s 30-day realized profit-to-loss ratio has remained below 1 since mid-November, typically indicating bearish conditions where traders realize losses more frequently than gains. Analysts at Altcoin Vector described the current environment as a “ full liquidity reset ,” a pattern that has historically marked the beginning of new liquidity cycles and preceded market bottoms. If the structure mirrors April’s setup, liquidity could begin to recover in roughly 4 weeks, potentially setting the stage for renewed momentum by now. Source: X/@altcoinvector Despite near-term headwinds, fundamental network activity continues expanding. Average daily active addresses reached 2.4 million, up 5.64% over 30 days, while total value locked in decentralized finance protocols stands at $11.80 billion according to Messari , representing a 6.98% monthly increase. Source: Messari Transaction fees generated $21.65 million over the past 30 days, up 19.61% from the previous period, while the network processed 2.3 billion total transactions. DeFi protocols on Solana recorded $9.086 billion in total value locked according to DefiLlama , with decentralized exchanges handling $2.956 billion in 24-hour trading volume. The Solana Policy Institute has also intensified efforts to reduce regulatory friction for developers, submitting a letter to the SEC on January 10 requesting explicit exemptions for non-custodial DeFi software. The nonprofit argued that applying broker-dealer or exchange rules to open-source smart contracts would force protocols to either shut down or reintroduce centralized control, undermining the investor protections regulators seek to preserve.

His post focused on the idea that these valuations overlook years of structural preparation by Ripple, suggesting that the company’s actions indicate ambitions far beyond modest price outcomes. Austin’s position was presented as a critique of narrow market expectations rather than a direct price forecast, emphasizing long-term alignment over near-term trading narratives. People throwing around “$5–$10 XRP"" miss the bigger picture. @Ripple has spent the last few years: • acquiring infrastructure • partnering with institutions • positioning for global settlement • preparing for regulatory clarity • pursuing a full banking license You don’t… — Austin (@Austin_XRPL) January 16, 2026 Ripple’s Strategic Positioning as Presented by Austin In his commentary, Austin pointed to Ripple’s sustained efforts in acquiring infrastructure, forming institutional partnerships, and positioning itself for use in global settlement flows. He also highlighted preparations for regulatory clarity and the company’s pursuit of a full banking license as central components of its strategy. According to Austin, initiatives of this scale are not undertaken without expectations of substantial, system-level relevance. His post suggested that the scope and cost of these developments imply a vision that extends well beyond incremental market gains. Community Pushback on the Ripple–XRP Relationship The post prompted responses questioning the connection between Ripple’s corporate strategy and XRP itself. One commenter, What the Pho, stated that despite holding a significant long-term XRP position, it is important to distinguish between Ripple as a company and XRP as a digital asset. The commenter argued that Ripple’s priorities may center on corporate and XRPL interests rather than directly maximizing XRP’s value, echoing long-standing discussions within the community about structural separation. Another response, from Fishy CatFish, took a more critical stance. This user contended that Ripple’s announcements primarily serve its own corporate objectives and products such as RLUSD , rather than XRP. The commenter cited reports of Ripple attempting to repurchase its own shares instead of XRP as evidence that holding XRP does not equate to direct exposure to Ripple’s corporate value. This argument reinforced a view held by some market participants that Ripple’s incentives and XRP’s market performance are not inherently aligned. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Austin’s Rebuttal and a Call for Perspective Austin directly rejected these criticisms, asserting that XRP remains central to everything Ripple does. His reply reinforced his original claim that the company’s long-term strategy cannot be separated from XRP’s role within its ecosystem. Another commenter, Cryptomantus, introduced a more neutral perspective, noting that short-term price predictions and profit-taking strategies do not necessarily negate long-term beliefs. The commenter emphasized that investors have different goals and timelines, and that exiting positions should not be framed as a misunderstanding of the broader vision. Taken together, the exchange illustrates an ongoing debate within the XRP community : whether Ripple’s expansive strategy should be interpreted as a direct signal of XRP’s long-term value, or whether corporate developments and asset performance should be assessed independently.

The company will pay out some of its biggest performance bonuses in years, as the global memory chip supercycle continues to bring in historic profits as a result of an increase in AI adoption. Device Solutions, the semiconductor division of Samsung, has announced that eligible staff will receive bonuses up to 47% of their base annual salary this month. The payout is expected to be applied across the division’s three businesses: memory, system, large-scale integration, and foundry. It also marks a sharp rebound from 2023, when the division’s bonus rate was 0% after the downturn experienced in the chip market. Samsung announces record bonuses for semiconductor division staff According to reports, this year’s bonus is slightly lower than Samsung’s internal maximum cap of 50%, reflecting the extraordinary recovery that the division has undergone since 2023. Samsung uses its performance-based incentive system called Overachieved Performance Incentive to reward its staff. The reward is carried out once every year and is calculated from 20% of the previous year’s economic value added. Samsung’s mobile MX division, which is in charge of the company ‘s Galaxy smartphone line, will see its OPI payout set at the full 50%. Meanwhile, divisions like consumer electronics and networks will see much lower rates, with reports noting that it could be around the 12% range, based on their 2025 performance. The bonuses come after Samsung announced a record-breaking fourth quarter operating profit of 20 trillion won ($13.6 billion), according to the company’s preliminary announcement. According to analysts’ estimates, the DS division contributed around 16 to 17 trillion won to the numbers, with the contribution driven by an increase in prices of both advanced and general-purpose memory chips. Aside from Samsung, another company preparing a payout for its staff is SK hynix. After scrapping its previous internal cap that had limited bonuses to the equivalent of 10 months’ base salary, the company is now expected to allocate 10% of its total operating profits to this year’s profit-sharing program. SK Hynix teases new profit-sharing program SK Hynix saw its full-year operating profit hit 45 trillion won, and with a workforce of 33,000, the average bonus that is expected to reach each employee is projected to reach more than 140 million, marking a new record high. The company is expected to pay 80% of the bonus up front and will defer the remaining 20% over two years. The company said it will also reintroduce the Employee Share Participation Program, which it debuted last year. Under the program, employees are allowed to choose to take half of their bonus in company shares and receive a 15% cash premium if they hold the stock for a year. The program is designed to encourage long-term alignment between staff and shareholders. Since 2024, Samsung and SK Hynix have redirected much of their chip capacity toward high-bandwidth memory. This is because producing them consumes about three times the wafer capacity of standard DRAM. In addition, the move has created a drop in supply for general-purpose memory such as DDR5, driving up its prices across the board. For SK Hynix, which holds a large share of the HBM market, these margins have been profitable. On the other hand, Samsung has been able to benefit from rising demand for HBM and higher prices in the general memory market due to its larger manufacturing scale. Samsung still retains its position as the global volume leader in the general memory market. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Bitcoin faces renewed volatility as geopolitical tensions mirror the October 2025 tariff shock that triggered $19 billion in liquidations. Trump declared via Truth Social that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, and Finland will face immediate tariffs “ until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland .” The move sparked emergency EU meetings and unified condemnation from European leaders, with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling tariffs on allies “ completely wrong ” while France’s Emmanuel Macron warned “ no intimidation nor threat will influence us. “ France is committed to the sovereignty and independence of nations, in Europe and elsewhere. This guides our choices. It underpins our commitment to the United Nations and to its Charter. It is on this basis that we support, and will continue to support Ukraine… — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) January 17, 2026 European Leaders Unite Against Unprecedented Threat The tariff announcement triggered an extraordinary diplomatic crisis as EU ambassadors convened emergency meetings on Sunday afternoon. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized that “ tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral, ” while declaring full EU solidarity with Denmark and Greenland. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson stated bluntly, “ We will not let ourselves be blackmailed, ” characterizing Trump’s demands as an EU-wide issue requiring a collective response. Finland’s President Alexander Stubb, previously considered a Trump ally through shared golf interests, urged that “ among allies, issues are best resolved through discussion, not through pressure. “ Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre agreed, stressing “ threats have no place among allies. “ Even Trump supporter Nigel Farage criticized the tariffs, admitting “ we don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us. “ We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us. If Greenland is vulnerable to malign influences, then have another look at Diego Garcia. https://t.co/z0r0IUlD6I — Nigel Farage MP (@Nigel_Farage) January 17, 2026 Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez delivered perhaps the sharpest rebuke, warning that a US invasion of Greenland “ would make Putin the happiest man on earth ” by legitimizing Russia’s Ukraine invasion and spelling “ the death knell for Nato. “ EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas also echoed this sentiment, noting “ China and Russia must be having a field day” as they “benefit from divisions among Allies. “ Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen also expressed surprise at Trump’s announcement following what he described as “ constructive meetings ” with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier in the week. Given Trump’s threats over Greenland, German MEP Manfred Weber suggested halting the recently negotiated EU-US trade deal, stating, “ The 0% tariffs on US products must be put on hold. “ Meanwhile, thousands protested across Greenland and Denmark, carrying banners reading “ Greenland is for Greenlanders ” and “ Hands Off Greenland. “ Tariff Uncertainty Clouds Bitcoin Recovery Bitcoin currently trades around $95,000 after weeks of range-bound movement between $94,000 and $97,000. Market participants remain cautious following Trump’s latest geopolitical escalation, which adds fresh uncertainty to an already fragile recovery. The crypto has avoided revisiting lower support levels in 2026, though gains remain thin amid persistent geopolitical risks.

Liquidity channels are more diverse now, so timing inflows is pointless, ” he stated, noting money has “ rotated to stocks and shiny rocks. “ Despite a lack of buying pressure , large holders, including US banks, continue to accumulate Bitcoin, with no clear signs of capitulation yet. Speaking with Cryptonews, John Glover, Chief Investment Officer at Ledn, suggests Bitcoin remains in Wave IV of its bull cycle, with completion targets between $71,000 and $84,000. “ Confirmation as to which path we’re following will come from either a break and close above $104,000 which would confirm we are now starting Wave V, or a break below $80,000, which means a move to the low $70s before we head higher, ” Glover explained. Source: TradingView October Tariff Precedent Raises Concerns Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy previously devastated crypto markets in October 2025 when 100% tariffs on Chinese imports triggered one of history’s largest single-day liquidation events. Bitcoin plunged below $105,000 as $19 billion in leveraged positions unwound within 24 hours, forcing 1.6 million traders into liquidations, with nearly 87% being long positions. Open interest in Bitcoin futures collapsed by more than 30% during that selloff before recovering above $114,000 days later. The current tariff threat targets America’s closest European allies rather than adversaries, creating unprecedented uncertainty about transatlantic relations. Markets now face potential Supreme Court rulings on the legality of tariffs alongside escalating geopolitical tensions over Greenland, Venezuela, and broader global trade policy.

Standard Chartered’s Bet Gains Steam as Spot ETFs Steal the Spotlight,https://coinpaper.com/13835/xrp-to-12-50-standard-chartered-s-bet-gains-steam-as-spot-et-fs-steal-the-spotlight,"Wall Street Whale Calls XRP to $12.50 as ETFs and Institutional Demand Accelerate Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick has sparked renewed debate on Wall Street and across the crypto market with a bold forecast that XRP could reach $12.50 by 2028. Far from mere speculation, his projection is anchored in accelerating regulatory clarity, growing institutional adoption, and the expanding momentum behind XRP-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the core of this thesis is the accelerating push toward spot XRP ETFs. Kendrick argues that approvals in major markets could finally open the floodgates to institutional capital XRP has long been denied. With as many as six XRP ETF products potentially launching, projections point to $4–$8 billion in inflows within the first year. For an asset historically held back by legal uncertainty, this marks a decisive structural inflection point. Why XRP? Unlike many digital assets still chasing real-world relevance, XRP is already embedded in the global payments ecosystem. Its unmatched speed, ultra-low fees, and scalability make it purpose-built for cross-border settlements and tokenized financial flows, exactly where institutional demand is accelerating. As regulatory clarity improves, the barriers that once kept traditional finance on the sidelines are rapidly dissolving, positioning XRP as a core infrastructure asset rather than a speculative bet. Kendrick underscores XRP’s asymmetric upside at current valuations. While Bitcoin and Ethereum command the spotlight, XRP’s market structure offers greater multiple expansion if institutional demand accelerates with present price being $2.06 per CoinCodex data. In a bullish setup, ETF-driven inflows combined with broader market momentum could rapidly reprice the asset. More notably, Kendrick suggests XRP could challenge, and potentially overtake, Ethereum’s market capitalization in the 2026 bull cycle. This isn’t a critique of Ethereum’s ecosystem, but a reflection of late-cycle capital dynamics. Should XRP emerge as the preferred institutional bridge asset and ETF proxy, its market cap could scale faster than established Layer 1 incumbents. Well, the $12.50 target for 2028 looks less like an outlier and more like a valuation grounded in adoption and expanding capital access. As Wall Street shifts from viewing crypto as a speculative fringe to a legitimate asset class, XRP’s combination of real-world utility, deep liquidity, and advancing regulatory clarity positions it as a credible contender in the next phase of digital finance. Conclusion XRP’s $12.50 projection isn’t just an ambitious price target, it signals a potential shift in how institutional capital engages with crypto. With spot XRP ETFs positioned to unlock billions in inflows, regulatory headwinds easing, and real-world payment utility already proven, XRP sits at the crossroads of finance and functionality. If the 2026 bull market unfolds as expected, XRP could evolve from a long-overlooked asset into a core pillar of institutional crypto portfolios, challenging market leadership beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, XRP’s next phase may be driven less by hype and more by sustained adoption and Wall Street–scale capital.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-18 10:50:46

The biggest chunk of the exports are rare-earth magnets, which have played a key role in past trade fights. China’s Ministry of Commerce had recently said it’s adding controls on shipments that could be used in military applications, with Japan clearly in mind. These two frenemies have been in a beef ever since Japan’s new prime minister Takaichi Sanae made comments about Xi Jinping’s very publicized plans for Taiwan, saying that she will come to the aid of the island nation should Beijing move forward with those plans. China Daily said Beijing is also thinking about tightening up license rules for shipping these critical rare earth materials to Japan. U.S. and allies hold meeting to reduce dependence The export numbers don’t show where the materials went or what types were shipped. That kind of breakdown is supposed to come out Tuesday. But even without details, governments are already reacting. China said back in October that these export restrictions will apply worldwide now, not just to specific countries. This is why the U.S. invited the G7 finance ministers, plus reps from Australia, India, South Korea, and the EU, to meet in Washington on Monday. The meeting was led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and the focus was on how to stop depending so much on China for rare earths. They talked about setting price floors to help other countries start their own rare-earth projects and build new partnerships to get supplies from different places. An official at the meeting said, “Urgency is the theme of the day. It’s a very big undertaking. There’s a lot of different angles, a lot of different countries involved, and we need to move faster.” Tensions grow over military use and economic pressure Right now, foreign companies need to get a license from China if they want to ship out rare earths or related tech. That system is now being used to slow things down or block exports to certain places, especially in defense and advanced tech sectors in countries like Japan, Europe, and the U.S. Jon Lang, who runs economic security policy at APCO in Washington, said the U.S. push to cut down on rare-earth reliance was “an easy sell” because of what he called China’s broad economic coercion. He also said the G7 is more united now than before. Lang added, “The meeting could also be seen as a show of support for Japan, as it had been an early victim of China using rare earths as a tool of trade coercion since 2010.” Not surprisingly, The Global Times, which is a Chinese state-owned tabloid, called the G7 talks a sign of America’s strategic anxiety. They said the West’s goal of beating China on rare-earth supply just won’t happen because of the way global demand and production look right now. Still, it’s obvious China is watching other countries invest more in new mining and processing centers. Nobody wants to rely on one country forever. Since the October announcement, there’s been a serious push around the world to build new supply chains for these critical materials.

On the other hand, MEXC claims record expansion and community participation across Latin America, and a high-profile Polymarket bet on Nicolás Maduro’s departure raises concerns about insider information. These developments highlight the region’s dynamic cryptocurrency scene, which includes legislative trials, exchange growth, and high-stakes prediction markets. Expanding Bitcoin zones strengthen El Salvador’s digital strategy El Salvador’s Bitcoin Zones have regained international interest following the formal announcement of two new developments that will complement the country’s existing programs. This step supports El Salvador’s aim of integrating Bitcoin into the economy through technological innovation, capital attractiveness, and territorial development. Despite persistent external concern, the government remains steadfast in its pro-Bitcoin attitude, framing these additional zones as an extension of the crypto model beyond the well-known programs. Bitcoin Zones are special economic zones that combine Bitcoin and digital technology into business, tourist, and finance operations. Current references such as Bitcoin Beach, Bitcoin City, and the Bitcoin Zone at the National Library all serve different purposes, ranging from ordinary BTC payments to geothermal-powered smart city construction. According to The Bitcoin Office, the newly announced zones will take a similar strategy, potentially using strategic resources while incorporating mining, data centres, and tourism, establishing Bitcoin as an active driver of economic growth rather than just a store of wealth. Polymarket bet on Maduro sparks speculation In early January, the crypto community was alerted to an odd wager on the Polymarket platform. An unnamed trader wagered $32,000 that Nicolás Maduro would depart Venezuela’s presidency by January 31, 2026, and gained nearly $400,000. The wager was placed just hours before circumstances occurred that rendered the market outcome nearly certain. On-chain analysis soon stoked conjecture about an insider tip, and the story took a turn when Donald Trump stated that the putative informant had been apprehended and was in custody. Suspicions were founded not just on profit, but also on the structure of fund movements . The study revealed that cash came from two seemingly disposable wallets with no other activity, funded solely through Coinbase, and moved nearly instantly to the prediction market. A thorough investigation showed a series of nearly similar transactions at short intervals employing wallets related to the domains StCharles, StevenCharles, and STVLU, which had previously processed millions through Coinbase. While the wallets’ ownership was not confirmed, the pattern appeared too consistent to be coincidental. Following this, Trump publicly declared that the leak had been detected, coinciding with an FBI investigation into Aurelio Pérez-Lugones, a Department of Defence contractor accused of illegally holding secret information about Venezuela. MEXC accelerates growth and user engagement in LATAM MEXC, the world’s fastest-growing digital asset exchange and the pioneer of commission-free trading, plans to expand significantly throughout Latin America by 2025. The company prioritized localizing its products, improving customer service, and expanding community engagement. Key activities included integrating PIX deposits and withdrawals in Brazil, improving fiat payment channels in Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Peru, and extending peer-to-peer services in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Bolivia. MEXC has launched the Visa MEXC x Ether.fi card, which allows users to spend cryptocurrency globally via Apple Pay or Google Pay and earn up to 4% cashback, bridging the gap between digital assets and ordinary payments. The company also prioritised improving the customer experience in Latin America by increasing support in Spanish and Portuguese, localising educational content, and synchronising service hours with regional time zones. Customer satisfaction (CSAT) climbed from 92.48% to 96.25%, while problem resolution rates increased from 90.51% to 93.10%. MEXC increased its physical and cultural presence by attending key blockchain events and community meetups in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia. MEXC cemented Latin America as one of its fastest-growing markets, setting the scene for future progress in 2026, after being named the “Best Exchange in Latin America” at the BeInCrypto 100 Awards and praised for its strong regional growth.

Analyst Sets $2.3 Short-Term Target,https://www.newsbtc.com/sui/sui-price-breakout-next-2-3-short-term-target/,"The SUI price struggled to replicate its early-year momentum over the past week despite the general market seeing renewed optimism. The altcoin’s price mostly moved sideways, oscillating between the $1.70 – $1.90 levels. According to a popular analyst on the social media platform X, this slight inactivity might be a bullish signal of what is to come over the next few weeks. Is SUI On The Verge Of A 30% Surge? In a January 18 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an interesting chart setup for the SUI price. According to the market pundit, a break out of the current chart setup could see the altcoin reach the $2.29 level over the coming weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin RSI Just Entered Historical Oversold Levels Again, Will It Repeat 2021? The rationale behind this positive prediction is the formation of a bull flag pattern on the 4-hour timeframe of the Bitcoin price chart. The bull flag is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a period of steep upward movement (the flagpole) typically followed by sideways or slightly downward price action. Typically, the bull flag functions as a prevailing continuation pattern for an existing upward trend, suggesting a potential move to a higher price point. While this chart is often a bullish signal, it is crucial to wait for a successful breach of the upper boundary of the consolidation range; this increases the odds that the price will continue in its upward trajectory. As shown in the chart above, the price level that needs to be broken to confirm the uptrend continuation lies around the $1.84 mark. Meanwhile, the target for this chart pattern is usually calculated by adding the vertical height of the flagpole to the potential breakout point from the flag. According to Martinez, a sustained break above this level could see the SUI price run up to as $2.29, representing an almost 30% surge from the current price point. SUI Price Overview As of this writing, the price of SUI stands at around $1.78, reflecting a mere 0.9% dip in the past 24 hours. This tame daily action highlights the indecisiveness currently affecting this altcoin market, as the SUI bulls and bears battled for dominance over the past week. According to CoinGecko data, the altcoin’s value is down by 1.7% in the last seven days. However, this past week’s struggles have not been enough to wipe out SUI’s recent success, especially on broader timeframes. For instance, the altcoin’s value has increased by more than 28% on the monthly timeframe. With this positive performance, the token has maintained a position within the top 30 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.

In a recent post, Pumpius argued that while attention often shifts toward new blockchains and familiar narratives recycled each cycle, XRP has continued to strengthen without relying on visibility or trend-driven momentum. The commentary positioned longevity and endurance as more meaningful indicators than short-term enthusiasm. Pumpius emphasized that a decade of participation in real-world finance represents a level of exposure that cannot be artificially created. According to the post, ten years of operating through regulatory pressure, market downturns, and changing industry conditions provide evidence that goes beyond promotional claims. The argument focused on survival as a measurable outcome, rather than promises about future potential. A lot of people are not ready to hear this. While the market chases shiny new chains and recycled narratives, XRP has been quietly dominating in the background. Ten years of real world finance cannot be faked. Ten years of regulatory pressure cannot be simulated. Ten years of… — Pumpius (@pumpius) January 17, 2026 Regulatory Exposure and Operational Stress A significant portion of the commentary addressed regulatory pressure. Pumpius stated that XRP has operated while facing regulators directly, rather than attempting to avoid oversight. This experience, the post suggested, subjected the network to scrutiny of governments, banks, and institutions, creating conditions that many newer projects have not yet encountered. The post contrasted this with emerging blockchains that have not cleared large volumes of real value or operated at scale under sustained oversight. Pumpius argued that many networks promote ambitious goals but remain untested when confronted with coordinated regulatory enforcement or institutional demands. In this context, XRP’s continued operation was presented as evidence of structural resilience. Building Through Market Cycles Pumpius also reflected on the repeated rise and fall of projects driven primarily by hype. The post referenced multiple market cycles in which highly promoted blockchains failed once market conditions tightened or regulatory pressure increased. According to Pumpius, these failures often occurred when real stress replaced favorable conditions. In contrast, XRP was described as continuing to develop practical integrations during these periods. The commentary stated that while other networks focused on experimentation or online debate, XRP concentrated on establishing payment corridors and maintaining functionality. This approach was linked to consistency rather than rapid expansion fueled by speculation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Assessing Value Through Longevity The post concluded by encouraging a reassessment of how digital assets are evaluated. Pumpius stated that the issue is not personal preference or loyalty to a particular project, but the ability of a network to remain operational under prolonged pressure. Survival through adverse conditions was presented as a form of proof that cannot be replicated quickly. By highlighting XRP’s history of regulatory engagement , institutional testing, and endurance across bear markets, Pumpius positioned the network as an infrastructure that has resisted repeated attempts to undermine it. The commentary suggested that certain realities in the digital asset sector become clear only after extended observation, rather than during periods dominated by attention-driven trends.

Most larger-cap altcoins have remained sluggish as well, unlike small gains from HYPE and TRX. XMR, on the other hand, continues its freefall after the mid-week all-time high. BTC Stable Despite Political Turmoil As mentioned above, the previous weekend was quite dull, with BTC trading sideways around $90,500. However, it broke out on Monday and confirmed it on Tuesday when it flew past $92,000 with force. Its price gains continued on Wednesday when it tapped a multi-month peak of $98,000. After gaining around $8,000 in less than a week, bitcoin lost some of its momentum and slipped below $94,500 on Thursday. It rebounded on Friday and has remained above $95,000 ever since. What’s particularly interesting about this price stagnation is the fact that the geopolitical tension has skyrocketed since Friday. First, several EU nations sent troops to Greenland after Trump’s most recent remarks. Then POTUS announced a new set of 10% tariffs on all those eight EU nations. The Union lawmakers responded with an emergency meeting today, and threats about pulling out of the ongoing trade deal. BTC has remained unfazed and still stands at around $95,000.

On Sunday, a presidential spokesperson said the government will push for favorable terms and talk directly with the U.S. to protect its chipmakers. The focus is Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, two of the biggest memory chip exporters in the world. Trump’s proclamation might not hit them immediately, but no one in Seoul is taking chances. The official reminded reporters that last year, South Korea and the U.S. published a joint fact sheet. It said South Korea would not face worse tariff treatment than other chipmaking countries. That agreement is now under pressure. The new tariff order only covers some types of advanced chips, for now, but things could escalate fast. Trump order hits AI chips first, but more tariffs could follow South Korea’s Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo said on Saturday that Trump’s new tariff plan mainly targets high-end artificial intelligence chips, not memory chips. “While the government remains cautious at an early stage, the first-phase measures announced so far focus on advanced chips made by Nvidia and AMD,” he said . He pointed out that the memory chips South Korea usually exports are not included in this first phase, so the impact is “expected to be limited.” But Yeo made it clear the government is not relaxed about the situation. “It is not yet time to be reassured,” he said, noting that no one knows how wide the next phase could be. He added that the government will keep working with local companies to secure the best possible deal for South Korea. Trump signed the new tariff proclamation on Wednesday, claiming it’s about national security. It puts a 25% duty on AI chips like Nvidia’s H200 and AMD’s MI325X. The White House said the scope is “narrow,” and the tariffs won’t apply to chips imported for U.S. data centers, public sector uses, consumer electronics, startups, or civil industrial applications that don’t involve data centers. Still, the fact sheet makes it clear that wider tariffs are on the table. The U.S. could expand this to include more types of chips and related products to push more domestic production. Basically, if chipmakers don’t build factories in the U.S., they could get taxed hard. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers who aren’t investing in the U.S. could face tariffs as high as 100%. “If you want to sell in America, you should build in America,” he said at the groundbreaking of Micron’s new plant in New York. The new rules come after a nine-month investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The investigation targeted advanced chips that meet certain performance levels and the gear built around them. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Years of growth have largely been priced in by big caps, and new altcoins at a price below a dollar are gaining popularity due to their potential asymmetric returns. They say that one of those tokens is currently in its visibility phase and it will be directly compared to Cardano by early-stage investors. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is trading at approximately $0.40 and it has got a market cap of approximately $14.5 billion. During the initial growth, ADA gained a following of developers and retail traders flooding the network through the proof-of-stake model. This boom early made ADA one of the best crypto assets in terms of market cap. However, it is that size which brings its own constraints today. Technical analysts indicate resistance areas around $0.50 and $0.60. Several attempts by the levels have been repelling the rallies. The traders worry that ADA can not easily penetrate beyond them unless there is a significant change in the demand of the ecosystem. Since ADA has become large, the large volume of liquidity is needed to cause the movement of the price. It is to say that it has a low percentage upside relative to early-stage tokens. There are estimates that ADA would reach a bullish case of $0.65 in 2026. It would be a modest multiplier in comparison to what traders expect out of the next crypto to blow. What Mutuum Finance Is Developing The project that is compared to ADA in this regard is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Once it becomes active, it is developing a lending protocol on Ethereum that will enable its users to supply and borrow crypto assets using smart contracts. The suppliers get interest, they get yield tracking mtTokens and the borrowers can post collateral to get access to liquidity without selling the long-term holdings. This organized lending model will interest people interested in utility-based tokens and not meme-based speculation. As per the official X version, the V1 protocol of the Mutuum Finance is currently ready to be deployed on the testnet before the mainnet activation. Testnets will be a significant milestone to lenders and traders since they will start seeing usage data appearing. There is also the development of security. Halborn security audited V1 codebase. The MUTM token was rated 90 out of 100 according to the Token Scan of CertiK. There exists a bug bounty of $50,000 to report before mainnet. This validation step is important in a DeFi crypto that involves collateral and liquidation. Comprehensive Token Allocation Mutuum Finance is not publicly traded. The token is already being sold at the price of $0.04 at the Phase 7 of its distribution. The project has collected over $19.8 million and has acquired in excess of 18,800 holders since early 2025. Of the stock 4 billion, 45.5% has been set aside in presale distribution and over 830 million tokens have already been bought. It has been an ongoing involvement and not a hype based participation. They have a 24-hour leaderboard that gives the best daily purchaser $500 in MUTM. Cards are accepted and this enables new crypto investors who are not part of the exchange environment to come in without resistance. The selling out of Phase 7 is also increasing more rapidly than previous phases which analysts term as allocation tightening behavior. Why Investors Consider MUTM To Be The Greater Upside The overlap of the technologies does not form the basis of the comparison between ADA and MUTM. Rather, it is founded on an upside profile. ADA already has a huge market and a developed ecosystem. MUTM is in the initial stages of its curve with milestones to come through. That is the only thing that will alter the formation of multipliers. Certain analysts simulate a scenario in which MUTM might perform 10 times better than ADA in terms of token appreciation in case V1 usage, borrowing stablecoins and revenue mechanics are implemented as intended. A single whale wallet has recently disbursed approximately 115,000 to MUTM in the recent stages. Such an activity is a sign of positioning by the larger buyers prior to the launch. Traders will receive an approximate 1.5x increase in the event that ADA rises between $0.42 and $0.65. Assuming that MUTM grows within the next few years of development and use by as little as 10 cents (or more) to even $0.40, that represents a 10 times shift. These can be seen why investors seeking the best cryptocurrency under $1 are following MUTM closely into 2026.

Within this dynamic landscape, certain coins appear poised for potential growth. Dive into this analysis to uncover which digital assets could be on the verge of a significant upswing. Ethereum Eyes Resistance with Strong Uptrend Potential Source: tradingview Ethereum , currently trading between $3013 and $3263, is showing signs of positive momentum. With the nearest resistance at $3408, ETH has gained over 11% this month, suggesting a potential break above this level. If Ethereum continues its upward trend, it could aim for the second resistance at $3657, marking a significant rise from its current range. The 10-day moving average at slightly above $3300 signals ongoing bullish activity, despite a 6-month dip. If ETH overcomes the nearest resistance, it could see a percentage increase of around 11%-13%, reinforcing its potential for future growth. As the crypto market reacts to these movements, Ethereum's path promises excitement for enthusiasts and investors alike. Conclusion ETH continues to show resilience thanks to strong network activity. As transactions and smart contract deployments remain high, ETH's price could see steady growth. High activity levels often indicate robust demand and utility, which can positively impact the market outlook. While short-term fluctuations are possible, the overall trend may lean towards gradual appreciation. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The leader of the massive chip manufacturer, Jensen Huang, made the comments when talking about artificial intelligence’s future. He defined this hypothetical “God AI” as something that could achieve ultimate mastery over human language, genes, chemical structures, proteins, amino acids, and physics. Huang, however, was eager to refute any idea that such technology is either available or will be available very soon. No company close to creating such technology “God AI is not showing up next week, I’m fairly certain of that,” Huang said. “And God AI isn’t going to show up next year, but the whole world needs to move forward next week, next year, next decade.” The Nvidia CEO emphasized that no company currently believes it’s anywhere close to creating such powerful AI, and researchers lack any reasonable ability to build it. Despite the dramatic terminology, Huang stressed that society doesn’t need to wait for this hypothetical technology to make progress. The statements come as generative AI continues to garner hundreds of billions of dollars in funding , with supporters predicting it will revolutionize society more than any other human innovation. Huang positioned AI as the next important step for the computing industry, stating that businesses will need to integrate these systems into their operations, just as many already rely on AI for daily chores. Meanwhile, other industry executives have made various forecasts about AI’s future. Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind has warned that artificial general intelligence, or AI with human capabilities, may arrive before society is prepared for the consequences. In contrast, OpenAI’s Sam Altman has stated that achieving this condition may have a lower societal impact than many expect. Last year, podcast presenter Joe Rogan sparked debate by claiming that if Jesus did return, he would “absolutely” do so as artificial intelligence. Growing concerns about advanced AI risks The discussion around advanced AI comes against a backdrop of growing concern about the technology’s risks . Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates recently called for intervention through guardrails and regulation to govern AI development and deployment. Gates warned that the technology could enable the creation of bioterrorism weapons posin g gr eater danger to humanity than the COVID-19 pandemic. Huang’s remarks have sparked debate about whether such predictions represent genuine warnings about technology’s future direction or simply serve as marketing to maintain Nvidia’s position in the competitive AI market. The company manufactures chips that power much of the AI industry’s infrastructure. The discussion underscores broader concerns about where AI development is headed and if current controls are sufficient. While some regard discussions of “God AI” as innocent speculation or corporate propaganda, others see them as reminders that rapid AI growth may lead to events that mankind is unprepared to handle. According to Huang, the concept is currently only a theory rather than a reality. According to the executive’s timeframe, any such advancement will occur far beyond the present generation’s lifetime, if at all. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

As institutions continue to engage actively, many are left wondering about the future price movements of these digital assets. With so much at stake, which coins are poised for growth in this evolving landscape? Dive in to explore potential winners. Ondo (ONDO) Shows Signs of Potential Rebound After Recent Drop Source: tradingview Ondo's current price hovers between 37 and 45 cents, showing slight movement within this narrow range. Although recent months have seen a nearly 9% dip in the last month and over 63% drop in half a year, there's potential for upward movement. Its immediate challenge lies in the 50-cent resistance. If ONDO breaks past this, it eyes a climb toward 58 cents. This represents a potential rise of about 29% from the top of the current range. With an RSI below 40, ONDO appears undervalued, which may attract buyers. Yet, traders should watch for price settling above short-term moving averages to boost confidence in upward potential. Algorand Price Hovers with Potential for a Modest Rebound Source: tradingview Algorand (ALGO) is currently trading between 13 and 14 cents, showing a slight dip over the past week but a notable gain in the past month. The nearest resistance level is set at 15 cents, while support is nearby at 12 cents. This suggests a potentially cautious upward trend if the resistance is broken. Algorand has gained over 10% this month, indicating a glimmer of recovery. However, over the past six months, it remains down by more than half of its value. If the coin successfully breaks through the second resistance at 17 cents, it could see a growth of around 30% from its current levels. Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes Potential Surge Amid Recent Price Movements Source: tradingview Avalanche's price is currently drifting between $13.18 and $14.50. It hints at a cautious optimism as it nears the resistance level of $15.31. Traders may find comfort that the coin recently gained over ten percent this past month. Yet, the journey isn't without bumps, seeing a big drop of nearly forty-four percent over half a year. If AVAX can overcome its nearest hurdles and touch $16.63, it could mean a rise of over twenty percent from its current low. The crypto still has room to grow, but it walks a tightrope between resistance and support levels. Stellar Price Eyes Modest Rally Amidst Lingering Uncertainty Source: tradingview Stellar's current price dances between 21 and 25 cents, resting near its 10-day moving average. It's coming off a slight drop over the past week, down a bit more than 1%. This coin is testing waters close to its support line at 20 cents, suggesting some stability. Challenges remain with resistance near 27 and 30 cents. If momentum picks up, Stellar might aim for these levels, eyeing potential growth over its month-long uptrend of around 3.5%. Still, long-term watchers note a steep 50% fall over six months. With more balance in relative strength and a subdued MACD, Stellar seems tentatively optimistic about its near future. Conclusion Institutions remain active in the crypto market. ONDO and ALGO show strong potential for steady growth. AVAX's unique features continue to attract attention. XLM maintains its appeal due to its focus on financial inclusion. These coins are likely to play significant roles in the evolving market. Each offers unique value propositions, making them interesting to watch for future developments. Consistent interest from institutions could indicate sustained growth for these tokens.

The figures point to a clear shift toward targeted social engineering and attacks on centralized players, with scams alone rising far faster than technical exploits. Scams and Centralized Attacks Drove 2025 Losses PeckShield said total crypto losses in 2025 rose about 34% from 2024, with $2.67 billion tied to hacks and $1.37 billion linked to scams. Scam losses jumped roughly 64% year-on-year, outpacing the growth in direct protocol exploits. However, the larger issue was higher per-case losses, often tied to tailored phishing and impersonation campaigns targeting high-value individuals. More than 200 hack incidents were recorded during the year, excluding scams. February accounted for the largest single-month loss on record after a $1.51 billion breach at Bybit, which PeckShield now ranks as the largest hack in crypto history. The FBI later linked that attack to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, detailing their use of malware and social engineering to gain access to Bybit’s cold wallets. According to PeckShield’s data, attackers also started changing their approach last year. Instead of just targeting decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, they started focusing more on centralized exchanges and large organizations, which made up 75% of the money stolen last year, up from 46% in 2024. BNB Chain saw the highest number of incidents, while Ethereum accounted for the most dollar value lost due to large targets. A Look at Patterns and Recovery The report also provided context on how the stolen funds were moved. Tracked laundering linked to major exploits reached $1.49 billion in 2025, a 15% increase from the previous year, with PeckShield connecting the rise to the larger sums taken in individual heists. On a positive note, approximately $334.9 million of stolen crypto was recovered or frozen by authorities and security firms last year. However, that recovery rate was lower than the $488.5 million recovered in 2024, suggesting the scale and complexity of thefts are outpacing mitigation efforts. Recent data offers a mixed outlook. A separate report from PeckShield on January 3, 2026, noted that losses from exploits fell to $76 million in December 2025, a 60% drop from November. However, the new year began with a major breach, as the Truebit protocol lost $26.5 million in an exploit on January 9. This ongoing cycle of attacks is a reminder that while monthly totals may fluctuate, the underlying threats of infrastructure vulnerabilities and personalized scams remain persistent challenges for the crypto ecosystem. Together, the cases support PeckShield’s view that 2025’s losses were less about random exploits and more about precision targeting, where social engineering and access to centralized systems played a growing role.

Today, experienced players are looking for speed, control, and flexibility — and that’s exactly why betting with BTC and USDT has become the preferred option for many esports bettors. Titles like Valorant and StarCraft 2 demand fast settlements, reliable live markets, and platforms that work globally without friction. In this guide, we break down where to bet on Valorant and StarCraft with crypto, what to look for in a Bitcoin esports betting platform, and which sites stand out for serious crypto-native players. Why Crypto Betting Makes Sense for Esports Esports audiences are global by nature, and traditional fiat sportsbooks often struggle to keep up. Crypto betting platforms solve many of these issues by design. When you bet with BTC, you get: Faster deposits and withdrawals Borderless access without banking restrictions Greater privacy compared to fiat sportsbooks Better suitability for live and in-play esports betting This is especially relevant for esports betting with Bitcoin, where odds change quickly and timing matters. Using USDT adds stability for players who want predictable bankroll management while still benefiting from crypto-native infrastructure. What to Look for in a Crypto Esports Betting Platform Before choosing where to place your bets, experienced players usually evaluate platforms based on a few critical factors: Esports coverage: Valorant and StarCraft 2 should be supported consistently Bitcoin & USDT support: Core currencies for esports betting Live betting & cash out: Essential for fast-paced matches Anonymity & KYC policy: Flexibility matters for global players Settlement speed & transparency: Especially important when betting with BTC Not every crypto betting platform delivers equally across these areas, which is why platform selection matters. Best Platforms to Bet on Valorant and StarCraft with Crypto Dexsport — Best Non-Custodial Crypto Betting Platform for Esports Dexsport stands out as a non-custodial crypto betting platform designed for players who want full control over their funds. Unlike traditional custodial sportsbooks, Dexsport operates with on-chain transparency, allowing users to verify wagers directly on the blockchain. For esports bettors, Dexsport offers: Support for Bitcoin, USDT, Ethereum, BNB, and TRON Fast deposits and withdrawals across multiple networks Live betting with Cash Out, ideal for in-play Valorant matches Full anonymity with no mandatory KYC Transparent betting activity visible via a public betting desk Dexsport’s structure appeals to players who prefer betting with BTC without surrendering custody of their funds. Valorant markets are well-integrated into the esports offering, while StarCraft 2 fits naturally into the platform’s broader competitive betting ecosystem. Rather than positioning itself as a casual entertainment casino, Dexsport caters to experienced bettors who value flexibility, privacy, and real-time control. Cloudbet — Established Bitcoin Esports Sportsbook Cloudbet is one of the longest-running crypto sportsbooks and remains a solid option for esports betting with Bitcoin. Founded in 2013, the platform offers deep liquidity and a wide selection of esports markets. Key strengths include: Support for BTC, USDT, and 30+ cryptocurrencies Strong coverage of Valorant, CS2, Dota 2, and other major esports High betting limits suitable for volume players Reliable live betting functionality However, Cloudbet may request KYC verification in certain cases, especially for large withdrawals, which may not suit players seeking full anonymity. Thunderpick — Esports-Focused Crypto Betting Platform Thunderpick is built primarily around esports and performs especially well for Valorant crypto betting. The platform emphasizes live markets and offers a streamlined betting experience tailored to competitive gaming. Highlights: Crypto-only deposits and withdrawals Strong focus on Valorant and other top esports titles Regular promotions and esports-specific markets Accessible interface for esports-first bettors Thunderpick is a good choice for players focused almost exclusively on esports, though withdrawal processing times can be slower compared to non-custodial platforms. Valorant Crypto Betting: Markets and Live Strategy Valorant has quickly become one of the most popular esports for crypto betting. Common markets include: Match winner Map winner Total maps Handicap betting Live round-based markets Because matches evolve rapidly, esports betting with Bitcoin works best on platforms that support fast in-play updates and early cash out options. This is where crypto-native sportsbooks outperform traditional betting sites, especially for players actively managing positions during live matches. StarCraft 2 Esports Crypto Betting: A Niche for Experienced Players StarCraft 2 remains a more analytical and strategy-driven esport. While liquidity is lower than in Valorant, SC2 markets often offer higher value for informed bettors. The best StarCraft 2 esports crypto betting platforms are those that: Offer consistent match coverage Settle bets quickly Support BTC-based wagering without unnecessary friction For players comfortable betting with BTC on niche esports, StarCraft 2 can still be a profitable environment — particularly when using platforms built for flexible crypto wagering. BTC vs USDT for Esports Betting Choosing between Bitcoin and USDT depends on your betting style: BTC: Preferred by long-term crypto holders and players comfortable with volatility USDT: Ideal for stable bankroll management and predictable stake sizing Many experienced bettors use both — BTC for selective high-conviction bets and USDT for frequent live wagering. Final Thoughts Crypto has reshaped how esports betting works. Platforms that support betting with BTC, fast settlements, and live market flexibility now define the standard for Valorant and StarCraft wagering. For players who value transparency, anonymity, and non-custodial control, Dexsport represents a modern approach to esports betting with crypto. Others may prefer established custodial platforms or esports-first sportsbooks depending on their priorities. Ultimately, the best choice comes down to how you want to manage risk, control funds, and engage with esports markets — and crypto betting platforms now give players more options than ever before.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2026-01-18 11:44:31

Fast pace, frequent scoring, constant momentum shifts — the NHL offers far more in-play opportunities than many other leagues. Over the past few seasons, a growing number of hockey fans have started to bet on the NHL using crypto , and this shift is no coincidence. Crypto sportsbooks like Dexsport are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for NHL bettors who value speed, flexibility, and full control over their wagering experience. NHL Betting Is Growing — And So Is the Crypto Audience The NHL has a massive and expanding global audience. Beyond North America, hockey attracts strong viewership across Europe, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe — regions where crypto adoption is already high. This overlap explains why NHL crypto betting is growing so quickly. Crypto allows fans to place bets instantly, without relying on banks or regional payment systems. As a result, more bettors are turning to platforms built specifically for digital assets rather than adapting to traditional sportsbooks. Why Hockey Is Perfect for Crypto Betting Hockey is uniquely suited for crypto sportsbooks due to the nature of the game itself. NHL matches feature: High scoring frequency compared to many other sports Rapid shifts in momentum Short intervals between goals Constant action across all three periods This creates an environment where live betting thrives. Bettors aren’t limited to a single pre-match wager — instead, they can adjust strategies throughout the game. On platforms like Dexsport, this translates into a wide range of in-play options, making crypto bets on NHL games far more engaging than traditional fixed markets. In-Play NHL Markets Drive Crypto Betting Demand One of the main reasons NHL crypto betting sites are gaining popularity is the sheer number of live markets available during a game. Popular NHL live betting options include: Who scores the next goal Total goals by period Team to score first or last Puck line and totals adjusted in real time Outcome after specific time intervals Because goals can come in quick succession, bettors need platforms that update odds instantly and allow fast bet placement. Crypto sportsbooks are naturally better suited for this environment, especially when combined with non-custodial infrastructure. Frequent Games and Non-Stop Betting Opportunities Unlike many leagues with limited weekly schedules, the NHL runs multiple games almost every day throughout the regular season. This frequency is another key driver behind the rise of crypto betting in hockey. For bettors, this means: Continuous betting opportunities Easier bankroll rotation Ability to spread risk across many matches Dexsport supports this style of betting by offering fast settlements and uninterrupted access, allowing users to move smoothly from one NHL game to the next without delays. Big Odds and Unpredictable Outcomes Hockey is notoriously unpredictable. Underdogs often outperform expectations, and even top teams can collapse within minutes. This volatility is exactly what attracts experienced bettors looking for value. Crypto sportsbooks amplify this advantage by: Allowing quick reactions to changing odds Supporting flexible bet sizing Enabling early profit locking through Cash Out For players seeking the best crypto sportsbook for NHL betting, unpredictability isn’t a risk — it’s an opportunity. Dexsport : A Crypto-Native Platform Built for NHL Betting Dexsport approaches NHL betting from a crypto-first perspective. Rather than adapting traditional sportsbook models, the platform is designed around blockchain transparency and user control. Key features for NHL bettors include: Full support for Bitcoin, USDT, and multiple major cryptocurrencies Non-custodial betting with on-chain transparency Live NHL markets with Cash Out functionality No mandatory KYC, allowing private and unrestricted access Fast deposits and withdrawals across multiple networks Dexsport’s structure suits bettors who actively engage with NHL games, especially those who focus on live markets and dynamic in-play strategies. Why NHL Bettors Are Moving to Crypto Sportsbooks The growing shift toward NHL crypto betting is driven by practical advantages rather than trends or marketing narratives. Hockey is fast, unpredictable, and packed with live betting opportunities — and crypto sportsbooks are simply better equipped to handle that pace. With frequent games, volatile odds, and constant in-play action, NHL bettors increasingly favor platforms that offer speed, flexibility, and full control over funds. Dexsport fits naturally into this environment by combining non-custodial betting, real-time markets, and unrestricted access — making it a logical choice for modern hockey bettors who value efficiency over friction.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2026-01-18 11:47:27

Platforms keep slashing costs to beat each other, and now regulators are getting involved. Beijing doesn’t want another year of businesses throwing subsidies at users just to win market share. The government is under pressure to stop this, especially with deflation hanging over the economy and prices falling for more than three years straight. The main watchdog, SAMR, is picking off companies one by one. First, it went after food delivery services. Then this week, it announced an investigation into China’s biggest travel booking site, Ctrip. Ctrip joins food delivery groups under investigation Ctrip is now under official investigation, which SAMR made public on Wednesday, saying that it came right after earlier probes into Meituan and Alibaba’s delivery businesses. Regulators are trying to stop what’s being called “involution;” basically, when companies go all-in on cutting prices and launching discounts just to stay relevant, without any real long-term plan. It’s a problem across China, from tech to electric cars to solar panels. Trip.com, Ctrip’s parent company listed in Hong Kong, dropped over 20% in the past week. Ctrip put out a statement saying it’ll cooperate with the probe and that its operations are still running like normal. SAMR’s new energy isn’t coming out of nowhere. For years after the 2021 tech crackdown, enforcement slowed down. Companies had room to breathe. But now, things are ramping up again . Experts say SAMR feels more confident now, but it’s still understaffed. So instead of launching complex cases, it’s calling in execs for warnings and asking the State Council (China’s top government body) to support its efforts publicly. Price war in food delivery pushes regulators to act The food delivery space is where this really exploded. Last year, Alibaba and JD.com started crowding into Meituan’s territory. Everyone started throwing money at discounts; cheap burgers, free drinks, whatever it took. Platforms bled money. Restaurants had to slash prices too. Regulators called in the platforms for a meeting in July and told them to chill. But the battle didn’t stop. Subsidies kept flowing all summer. One executive said it’s tough to end the fight unless the government starts handing out real fines. But officials are nervous. These companies hire millions of workers and feed thousands of restaurants, so they’re treading lightly during a weak job market. Chelsey Tam at Morningstar said the big discounts seem to be slowing down now, but it took too long. And that lag showed how bad the relationship between tech and the regulators has gotten. Tensions are high. Last month, things got physical. SAMR staff showed up at PDD Group’s Shanghai office. They were there to gather info on pricing and how suppliers were being treated. According to local media, a fight broke out between employees and regulators during the inspection. One source allegedly said SAMR saw PDD’s behavior as arrogant. That kind of reaction could lead to even harsher action later. So far, no fine’s been announced. But if PDD keeps acting like this, it’s probably next in line.

As leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) continue to dominate global viewership, bettors are increasingly choosing crypto sportsbooks to place wagers quickly and without geographic or banking restrictions. The rise of crypto cricket bet online platforms reflects a broader trend: players want faster access, flexible payments, and uninterrupted betting during high-intensity tournaments. With dozens of matches packed into short timeframes, IPL betting demands platforms built for speed and scale — something crypto sportsbooks are uniquely positioned to deliver. Why Cricket Bettors Are Moving to Crypto Sportsbooks Cricket has one of the most geographically diverse betting audiences in sports. Fans across India, the UK, Australia, South Asia, and parts of Africa all follow major tournaments closely — yet traditional sportsbooks often struggle to support this global demand efficiently. This is where online crypto cricket bet sites gain an advantage. Crypto payments remove cross-border friction, allowing bettors to place wagers without relying on local banks or region-specific payment systems. Deposits are faster, withdrawals are more predictable, and access remains consistent throughout long tournaments like the IPL. As a result, crypto cricket betting has evolved from a niche option into a mainstream alternative for serious cricket bettors. Why IPL Is One of the Most Bet-On Cricket Leagues The Indian Premier League is not just the most watched cricket competition — it is also one of the most bet-driven leagues worldwide. Its format is designed for constant action and rapid momentum shifts, which naturally fuels betting activity. Key reasons IPL attracts heavy crypto betting volumes include: Short T20 matches with quick outcomes Frequent matches across a compressed schedule High-profile teams and international star players Constant rotation of form and conditions Because matches are played almost daily, bettors actively seek platforms that allow them to bet on IPL with crypto without interruptions. This demand has pushed crypto cricket betting sites to expand IPL market depth and live coverage significantly. Live Betting Opportunities in Cricket and IPL Live betting is where cricket truly shines — especially during IPL matches. Every over can change the outcome, creating a constant stream of betting opportunities throughout the game. Common live cricket betting markets include: Runs scored in the next over Next wicket to fall Top batsman or bowler Team performance by innings Match winner after specific overs For players using online crypto cricket bet sites, live markets are particularly attractive because they allow rapid reactions to changing conditions. Crypto sportsbooks are well-suited for this environment, offering fast bet placement and uninterrupted access during extended match sessions. What to Look for in a Crypto Cricket Betting Platform Not all sportsbooks are equally suited for cricket betting, especially when it comes to fast-paced tournaments like the IPL. Experienced bettors tend to focus on a few key factors before choosing where to place their wagers. Important features to look for include: Depth of cricket and IPL markets, both pre-match and live Live betting and cash out options to manage positions during long matches Support for major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and stablecoins Stable platform performance during peak betting hours Accessibility across regions, especially during global tournaments Platforms that combine these elements tend to perform best for crypto cricket betting, particularly during high-volume IPL fixtures. Best Crypto Sportsbooks for Cricket Betting Dexsport — Best Crypto Sportsbook for Cricket and IPL Betting Dexsport positions itself as a crypto-native sportsbook built for players who value speed, transparency, and control.

The token fell roughly 3%, contrasting sharply with its 30% gain over the past week and signaling that near-term momentum has cooled. This analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto PR firm built on data, which helps Web3 projects make the most of every moment. A Strong Weekly Rally Driven by Inflation Reduction Proposal ICP’s impressive weekly surge was fueled largely by DFINITY’s “Mission 70” whitepaper, which proposes reducing token inflation by 70% by the end of 2026. The prospect of significantly lower issuance sparked bullish sentiment and renewed interest in ICP’s long-term tokenomics. This policy-driven catalyst attracted momentum traders, contributing to the rapid upside move and lifting ICP to a 39% monthly gain. Profit-Taking Follows Parabolic Moves However, such strong rallies often trigger equally sharp reversals as traders secure profits. The speed of ICP’s rise created ideal conditions for short-term participants to exit positions, especially as market-wide liquidity began to soften. The token faced natural resistance near the $4.80 Fibonacci swing high—an area that historically acts as a profit-taking zone during extended moves. Once ICP approached this level, selling pressure intensified, accelerating the pullback.

It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect.

Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics.

Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. ICP Price Outlook ICP’s 3% drop represents a natural cooling phase following an outsized rally. With sentiment elevated, liquidity thinning, and RSI signaling exhaustion, the pullback appears to be a standard corrective move rather than a shift in long-term narrative. The key question now is whether buyers return on dips or whether momentum fades further as traders reassess the sustainability of recent gains. For now, ICP’s fundamental catalyst remains intact, but near-term volatility is likely as the market digests its rapid ascent. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to reports, the purchase equals about 105 BTC at current prices, and the company says all customer Bitcoin receipts feed into a so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Tied To Sales Based on reports, Steak ’n Shake calls its new approach a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and says it links reserve growth directly to rising same-store sales. The company has framed the move as part of daily operations rather than a standalone financial bet. Customers who pay with Bitcoin are effectively contributing to the reserve, the chain said. This is a different route from companies that raise capital or borrow specifically to buy crypto. Eight months ago today, Steak n Shake launched its burger-to-Bitcoin transformation when we started accepting bitcoin payments. Our same-store sales have risen dramatically ever since. All Bitcoin sales go into our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Today we increased our Bitcoin… — Steak ‘n Shake (@SteaknShake) January 17, 2026 Payments On The Lightning Network Steak ’n Shake started accepting Bitcoin at US locations in mid-May 2025, using the Lightning Network to handle payments, according to earlier coverage. The company reports payment processing fees have fallen by roughly 50% compared with traditional card payments, and sales have risen since the rollout. Reports note same-store sales gains in the low-to-mid double digits — figures such as 15% have been cited by several outlets. The $10 million allocation follows eight months of active Bitcoin payments at the tills. Management says the reserve will fund store upgrades and ingredient improvements without raising menu prices. The firm also ran a branded promotion last year that linked small Bitcoin rewards to specific menu purchases, part of its wider effort to make crypto part of the customer experience. How The Company Plans To Use Funds Reports indicate Steak ’n Shake wants the reserve to be a steady, internally funded asset rather than a speculative holding driven by market timing. Some of the Bitcoin will support operational improvements, while other parts may be kept as a corporate asset. That mix could change if management alters its view of how Bitcoin fits with broader company goals. Industry watchers point out that $10 million is modest against the biggest corporate crypto treasuries, but it is one of the more public moves by a legacy consumer brand. The trend of businesses accepting Bitcoin and then holding some of it has drawn attention because it ties everyday commerce to cryptocurrency accumulation.

The industry also wants clear rules for digital assets in addition to a rationalization of the 1% TDS on crypto transactions to boost investor confidence and encourage foreign participation in the Indian crypto industry. In the previous Union Budget 2025, the finance minister kept the existing tax frameworks for VDAs, despite repeated appeals from the industry. The Indian crypto industry has always argued that the current rules have discouraged investors and traders from patronizing crypto exchanges in the country, highlighting fears that heavy capital may be moving abroad. India calls for favorable crypto tax in 2026 India agreed to recognize cryptocurrencies as Virtual Digital Assets in its Budget 2022. The country introduced a defined tax regime that year. Under the Income Tax Act, VDAs such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other digital tokens were taxed. Gains from VDAs were taxed at a flat 30%, alongside a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on transactions. Meanwhile, non-trading income is taxed according to an individual’s income slab. Raj Karkara, the Chief Operating Officer at ZebPay, mentioned that Budget 2026 is coming at an important time for India’s crypto industry . He noted that the industry is looking forward to the clarification that can bring confidence to investors and the market. Karkara also added that it is an opportunity to present a clear and consistent plan for the crypto industry. Nichal Shetty, founder of WazirX, said that the budget offers the country and the regulators the opportunity to revisit the previous rules. He added that the government needs to look into the TDS and allow loss set-offs, which he claims would be good for liquidity and improve compliance. Shetty also added that clear rules on reporting would boost investor confidence. Pankaj Balani, CEO and co-founder of Delta Exchange, said the current crypto adoption in the country should follow a clear approach. Balani stressed that regulators need to support compliant domestic platforms that follow rules, while acting against illegal platforms. He said the policy needs to clearly differentiate between complaint platforms in India and non-compliant platforms abroad. Summit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX , said that the sector has been crying out for measured relief, especially during the four years that the current tax framework has been in use. He mentioned that any decision taken by the regulators now should be able to help improve innovation in India and help the country emerge as a global leader in Web3 and VDA. Gupta called for clear rules and the need for the implementation of TDS across all crypto exchanges. SB Seeker, Head of APAC at Binance, said the adoption of crypto in India shows the power of the digital economy and growing retail participation. He added that Budget 2026 will present regulators with the opportunity to protect users and maintain financial stability through the right regulations. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-forming-a-compression-above-support-heres-what-to-expect/,"XRP is entering a phase where structure matters more than momentum. Weekly candles continue to close above a clearly defined support zone, and the price shows very little volatility. This type of behavior often develops quietly while the market waits for confirmation. It is not driven by hype or reaction. It is driven by compression. That is the setup crypto commentator Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) highlighted when he pointed to XRP holding firm above support while the price tightens. Xaif noted that XRP is forming compression above support and stated that moves like this usually do not resolve sideways. His observation centers on market structure, and the chart he shared emphasizes where the price is holding. XRP is forming a compression above support. Moves like this usually don’t resolve sideways. pic.twitter.com/yXqNjM7pBD — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) January 15, 2026 Compression Becomes Clear on the Weekly Chart The weekly chart shows XRP holding above a horizontal support zone near $2.05. The digital assets price has tested this level multiple times and held each attempt. Sellers have failed to force the price below it. At the same time, upside progress has slowed, producing lower highs. This creates a tightening range directly above support. Candle structure reinforces this view. Weekly bodies clustered within a narrow band toward the end of 2025. While some wicks extended downward significantly , the decline failed to follow through. Compression occurs when buyers absorb supply without driving the price higher. This pattern indicates balance. The result is reduced volatility with structural stability. The Ichimoku clouds support the current consolidation. XRP trades near the shaded support zone on the chart, where the price often stabilizes. That zone ahead is flat, which supports the idea of a balanced market. XRP holding above it shows stability. Why Sideways Resolution Remains Unlikely Xaif’s comment that this type of move usually does not resolve sideways reflects how compression functions. Volatility has already contracted, and spending an extended period above support increases pressure within the range. That pressure must resolve through expansion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The chart does not show breakdown signals, and support continues to hold. XRP’s volume remains controlled rather than aggressive on pullbacks. That suggests selling pressure lacks dominance. What to Watch Next for XRP As long as XRP holds above $2.05 on a weekly closing basis, the compression structure remains intact. A decisive close above the upper range near $2.45 would signal resolution. That level aligns with prior consolidation highs and visible resistance. A breakdown would require acceptance below the support level. The current structure does not point to that outcome. XRP’s current pattern signals a major breakout on the horizon .

BTC owners increasingly look for practical ways to earn passive income without selling or undertaking complex on-chain strategies. In 2026, this is easier than ever thanks to flexible savings accounts, decentralized lending, and Bitcoin Layer 2 networks. This guide outlines how BTC holders can earn interest efficiently, what risks to evaluate, and how flexible savings platforms like Clapp now offer a streamlined path to passive income with daily payouts and instant liquidity. Why Earn Interest on BTC? Earning yield on Bitcoin provides straightforward benefits: passive BTC accumulation without trading, liquidity preservation even while earning, steady compounding through daily interest, diversification across earning strategies. The challenge has always been finding methods that do not require technical expertise, lock-ups, or exposure to opaque lending practices. Market infrastructure in 2026 offers more transparent, flexible alternatives. 1. Centralized Exchange Earn Programs Major exchanges continue to offer BTC savings products with flexible or fixed terms. How this works You deposit BTC, the exchange lends it to margin traders or institutional borrowers, and you receive a share of the interest. Benefits Simple onboarding. Flexible withdrawal options. No need to wrap BTC or interact with DeFi. Limitations APY is modest. Full custodial dependency. Borrowing demand fluctuates. Typical APY: 0.5–3%. 2. Bitcoin in DeFi via wBTC DeFi lending protocols allow BTC holders to earn yield by lending wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) on networks like Ethereum, Arbitrum, or BNB Chain. Benefits Non-custodial control. Transparent interest mechanics. Competitive yields. Limitations Requires wrapping BTC. Smart contract exposure. Bridge and custodian dependencies. Typical APY: 0.5–4%. 3. Bitcoin Layer 2 Yield Opportunities Bitcoin’s Layer 2 landscape has grown into a functional ecosystem with lending markets, liquidity pools, and collateral-based reward systems. Benefits BTC utility without full migration to alt-chain environments. Expanding infrastructure for native BTC yield. Opportunities tied to network growth. Limitations Early-stage risk. Synthetic BTC models vary by L2. Smart contract surface area is larger. Typical APY: 1–6%. 4. Clapp Flexible Savings: Daily BTC Interest with Instant Access Clapp.finance offers interest-earning accounts for Bitcoin alongside EUR and stablecoins. Its Flexible Savings product is designed for users who want yield without navigating on-chain protocols, lock-ups, or complex lending structures. Simple structure, no lock-ups Clapp credits interest on BTC every day. You can withdraw at any time without losing accrued yield, and there are no fixed terms or penalty fees. Full liquidity Your BTC remains liquid 24/7. You can transfer or convert it instantly whenever needed. Flexible access is preserved at all times. Transparent yields with no hidden tiers Clapp displays its BTC APY directly in the app with no “loyalty levels,” conditional bonuses, or earnings caps. What you see is what you earn. Low minimums You can start earning daily BTC interest with small amounts, removing the barrier to entry often found in traditional or DeFi strategies. Secure and licensed Clapp Finance is a registered VASP in the Czech Republic and operates within EU AML and compliance standards. Digital assets, including BTC, are secured through Fireblocks’ institutional-grade custody. Clapp’s model removes unnecessary friction, offering a clean alternative to both centralized exchange lending and technical DeFi workflows. Users get predictable BTC yield, instant access to funds, and a clear understanding of how earnings are generated. Key Risks to Understand Regardless of the platform or method, earning yield on BTC includes several risks: Custodial risk on centralized platforms and fintech apps. Smart contract risk for DeFi and Layer 2 environments. Wrapping and bridge risk when using wBTC or synthetic BTC. Impermanent loss in liquidity provision strategies. Regulatory risk for interest-bearing crypto products. BTC volatility also influences strategies tied to paired liquidity or collateralization. Conclusion Earning APY on Bitcoin in 2026 is straightforward. The market now offers accessible, flexible methods that work for both technical and non-technical users. While DeFi and Bitcoin Layer 2 networks provide innovative earning opportunities, flexible savings accounts remain the most user-friendly option. Clapp’s BTC Flexible Savings product delivers daily interest, instant access, transparent rates, and institutional-grade security. For BTC holders who want passive income without sacrificing liquidity or taking on unnecessary complexity, it is one of the most practical solutions available today.

57270685,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/01/privacy-coins-face-selling-pressure-following-sharp-rallies,1768737971,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/57270685.jpeg,Privacy Coins Face Selling Pressure Following Sharp Rallies,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/01/privacy-coins-face-selling-pressure-following-sharp-rallies,"The privacy-token sector came under pressure as traders locked in profits following steep rallies earlier this month, triggering technical breakdowns across major names such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC). Both assets slipped lower in Thursday trading, with ZEC seeing the sharpest declines. Outset PR , a crypto-native firm that blends data analysis with communication strategy, powers this piece. With a sharp eye on trends and timing, Outset PR helps blockchain projects convert critical moments into enduring visibility. Zcash Breaks Key Supports as Momentum Turns Lower Zcash (ZEC) fell almost 9% in a single session after breaking below several closely watched technical levels, including $421.90 and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $488.60. The move confirmed a shift in short-term momentum and opened the door to deeper retracement. A bear flag pattern is developing meaning a continuation formation that could send the token toward the $275–$300 zone if support at $390 fails. With ZEC’s RSI-7 sitting at 42.78, the market shows no signs of oversold relief, suggesting sellers may continue to dominate. Technical failures of this kind often activate algorithmic strategies and trigger stop-loss cascades, contributing to sharper downside moves in lower-liquidity segments such as privacy coins. Monero Retreats After Reaching All-Time High Monero (XMR) also slipped, losing roughly 2% after a record run that saw the token surge to $797.54 on January 14, marking a 65% gain over the past month. The rapid ascent drew in momentum traders, many of whom moved to lock in profits as the token entered overbought territory. XMR’s RSI-7 climbed to 80.11, a level that typically signals exhaustion. The subsequent pullback followed a familiar pattern: steep extensions often give way to corrective phases as shorter-term participants unwind positions. The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $706.57 now represents immediate resistance, with the 38.2% level at $649.44 serving as a deeper downside target. Analysts note that sustained closes below $700 could invite further selling pressure. Market Context: A Sector Reset After Crowded Rallies Privacy coins have historically exhibited wider trading ranges than the broader market, with thinner liquidity amplifying both rallies and declines. The current pullback reflects that structure: strong appreciation created crowded positioning, and relatively minor technical breaks evolved into broader selling. With key support levels compromised in ZEC and momentum cooling in XMR, traders may look for stabilization around lower Fibonacci and multi-week support zones before reassessing trend direction. How Outset PR Uses Market Momentum to Shape Visibility As sector volatility accelerates, some communications firms are adjusting how they position crypto projects during fast-moving market cycles. Outset PR has adopted a data-driven approach that connects market events with narrative opportunities — an increasingly relevant tactic as traders shift positions based on technical signals and sentiment breaks. Unlike traditional crypto PR models that rely on broad distribution or templated outreach, Outset PR uses its Outset Data Pulse intelligence system to track media trendlines, audience traffic flows, and the timing of peak receptivity. The analysis informs which publications to target, which angles are most likely to resonate, and when a message should be released to achieve measurable lift. Another component of its framework — the agency’s internal Syndication Map — tracks downstream distribution across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. This allows campaigns to be structured around outlets that historically generate the strongest second-layer visibility, often resulting in campaign reach several times larger than initial placements. The approach reflects a broader shift within crypto communications: campaigns must be market-fit to succeed. As volatility drives sudden changes in sentiment, timing and narrative alignment increasingly dictate whether a project gains traction or disappears in the noise. Outlook For now, privacy coins appear to be entering a cooling period after outsized gains. Stabilization may depend on whether buyers step in at intermediate support levels and whether broader market sentiment firms. As momentum continues to shape both trading and narrative cycles, projects operating in volatile sectors may find that data-driven communication strategies — such as those used by firms like Outset PR — help align messaging with the realities of fast-moving markets.

Trump made the announcement Saturday on his social media platform, repeating long-held claims that financial institutions severed ties with him for political reasons. Trump also denied a report that he offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman, calling it false and unrelated to his pending legal action. JPMorgan says it does not close accounts based on political or religious beliefs, and it has denied any improper conduct. Legal experts say the dispute could highlight broader tensions between public officials and private financial firms, especially around questions of political influence and institutional independence. Trump’s Accusations and JPMorgan’s Response Trump said the bank “incorrectly and inappropriately debanked” him after January 6, forcing him to allegedly move significant funds on short notice. He tied the bank’s decision to what he describes as political pressure following the riot and said the lawsuit would be filed within the next two weeks. In his message, Trump also reasserted his claim that the 2020 election was “rigged,” and said the protest on January 6 “turned out to be correct,” a statement that continues to echo his long-disputed election narratives. JPMorgan has pushed back on Trump’s claims. The bank’s leadership has repeatedly said it does not make decisions based on political views, and that corporate compliance and legal standards guide its account policies. JPMorgan also declined to comment directly on the planned lawsuit when asked by business news outlets. The denial of any job offer to Dimon surfaced amid the dispute. Trump responded to reports suggesting he had considered Dimon for a top Federal Reserve post, saying no such offer was ever extended. Dimon has also publicly stated he has no interest in the Fed chair role. Broader Context and Historical Banking Tensions The accusation touches on a concept known as ” debanking ,” where banks sever relationships with customers perceived as high risk or controversial. The practice has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and civil rights advocates when it appears tied to political or social activities. In recent years, several high-profile figures have criticized major financial institutions for restricting access to services, arguing that the decisions reflect bias rather than standard risk management. Such disputes have led to regulatory reviews and congressional hearings. Trump’s planned suit comes amid broader legal and political battles involving his administration. It adds another chapter to ongoing debates about the role of financial institutions in public life and how they balance legal obligations with customer relationships",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-18 12:07:12

The Indianapolis-based company said all Bitcoin received from customers goes directly into its “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” According to a social media post from the official Steak ’n Shake account, the initiative ties its payment strategy to broader business growth, and the reserve will help fuel improvements without raising menu prices. Steak ’n Shake did not disclose how much Bitcoin it holds in total or the exact timing of the latest purchase but said the increase reflects the cumulative effect of accepting crypto payments for eight months. Bitcoin Payments Linked to Sales Growth Steak ’n Shake began accepting Bitcoin at all U.S. locations in May 2025 via the Lightning Network , a protocol designed to speed up transactions and lower costs compared with traditional card payments. The company said same-store sales have risen “dramatically” since the crypto option was introduced. Independent media reports and company statements from late 2025 showed same-store sales increases of more than 10% in the second quarter and roughly 15% in the third quarter after the Bitcoin rollout began. Steak ’n Shake Chief Operating Officer Dan Edwards previously told reporters that the restaurant saved about 50% on processing fees when customers paid in Bitcoin, compared with credit card fees. The restaurant’s strategy includes a consumer engagement angle. Last year, it introduced a Bitcoin-branded burger and tied part of the proceeds from a “Bitcoin Meal” to donations supporting Bitcoin development projects. Industry analysts say Steak ’n Shake’s approach is unusual for a major restaurant brand because it integrates cryptocurrency directly into daily operations rather than holding it purely as an investment asset. Broader adoption of Bitcoin in retail remains limited, but companies exploring digital currency acceptance say it can reduce costs and attract tech-savvy customers. Steak ’n Shake’s announcement this week marks one of the more notable examples of a consumer-facing business tying its payment systems to Bitcoin accumulation and corporate strategy. Weekly Bitcoin Chart Points to $136,000 Target Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s weekly chart is starting to turn higher after holding a rising trendline, according to technical analyst Donald Dean, who said the next channel target sits near $136,000. Bitcoin Weekly Chart. Source: TradingView / X Dean wrote on X that Bitcoin is “time to move higher,” arguing the latest rebound began from long term trendline support on the weekly timeframe. The chart shows Bitcoin staying inside an upward sloping channel, with the recent pullback stopping above the lower boundary before price started to recover. That structure keeps the broader uptrend intact because the weekly pattern still shows higher highs and higher lows, even after the correction from the prior peak. The upper trendline, drawn across earlier weekly tops, now acts as the reference level for Dean’s projected target around $136,000. The post also referenced IBIT, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure that many traders track alongside spot price action. While the chart does not set a timeline, the weekly framing implies any move toward the upper boundary would likely take weeks, not days, and would depend on Bitcoin continuing to hold above the rising support line.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-18 12:12:14

Traders use them for liquidity, long-term holders use them to preserve value, and newcomers rely on them as an accessible entry point into crypto. But one of the most practical use cases today is simple: earning passive income on idle USDT. By 2026, most users expect three things from a savings product: daily interest, instant access, and transparent yield generation. Yet many platforms still rely on outdated structures. This guide explains how flexible crypto savings accounts work, what risks to consider, and how solutions like Clapp provide a more functional alternative to traditional and crypto-native products. Why Flexible Savings Have Become the Standard Users have moved away from complicated staking mechanisms and long-term lock-ups. Liquidity is a requirement, not an add-on. The modern crypto saver wants: predictable yield, uninterrupted access to funds, clarity on custody and risk, fiat on- and off-ramps without friction. Flexible savings accounts respond to this shift. They operate as simple interest-bearing balances. You deposit USDT to your Tether savings account , earn interest automatically, and withdraw when needed. There is no commitment period, penalty, or strategic action required. How Flexible Savings Accounts Work A flexible savings account credits interest on your USDT balance every day. You maintain full liquidity: sell your assets, withdraw, or deposit more at any time. There is no reward schedule to track and no requirement to “unstake.” Key characteristics: Daily accrual improves compounding. Instant access gives you liquidity when markets move. Transparent APY lets you calculate expected returns with precision. Low minimums make it accessible whether you hold 10 USDT or 10,000. This simplicity is drawing users away from both traditional yield products and complex on-chain strategies. Clapp Flexible Savings: A Streamlined Way to Earn on USDT Clapp Flexible Savings offers a model built around straightforward, user-driven design. It addresses the structural issues that undermine many traditional and crypto savings products. Daily interest with instant access Interest is calculated and credited every day. You start earning immediately after deposit and maintain full liquidity. Withdrawals do not reduce your rate, and there are no lock-ups. 24/7 liquidity You can move or sell your USDT whenever needed. The account structure is built for constant access, which is critical for market-sensitive strategies. High, transparent yields Clapp provides a clear 5.2% APY on stablecoins and EUR. The rate is displayed directly in the app without tiers, loyalty systems, or conditional multipliers. Low minimum entry You can start earning with as little as 10 EUR, USDC, or USDT. This makes passive income accessible without requiring a large starting balance. Native EUR savings You can deposit EUR via SEPA Instant and begin earning immediately. This reduces friction for users who move between fiat and digital assets. Licensed and secure Clapp Finance is a registered VASP in the Czech Republic and operates under EU AML and compliance standards. Digital assets are stored through Fireblocks’ institutional-grade custody infrastructure. Clapp’s approach eliminates unnecessary complexity. You earn daily, access funds instantly, and understand how your yield is generated. The product is built around user control and clarity rather than optimization hoops or opaque strategies. How Flexible Savings Compare to Other Earning Methods Below is a concise comparison of common USDT earning options in 2026. Method Liquidity Complexity Typical APY Risks CEX Earn Programs Medium–High Low 2–8% Exchange solvency, rehypothecation DeFi Lending (Aave, Compound) High Medium 2–10% Smart contract risk Liquidity Pools High Medium–High 3–15% Impermanent loss, contract risk Structured Products Variable High 5–20% Strategy and counterparty risk Flexible Savings Accounts High Very Low ~5% Platform and custody risk Flexible savings occupy the space for users who want passive yield without complexity. They provide stable returns without exposing users to the volatility of LP positions or the technical overhead of DeFi lending. Risks to Consider Before Choosing a Platform Even with flexible savings, due diligence matters. Evaluate: How custody is handled (self-custody, third-party, shared pools). Regulation and licensing of the provider. Whether yields are sustainable, not inflated by incentives. Speed and cost of withdrawals across fiat and crypto. Risk disclosures and transparency about how returns are generated. A platform that is clear about these factors reduces uncertainty and helps you assess risk effectively. The Bottom Line Earning interest on USDT in 2026 is straightforward when you use flexible savings products that prioritize daily payouts, liquidity, and transparent yields. The market has matured beyond lock-ups, confusing tiers, and complex DeFi workflows. Users want clarity and immediate access, and flexible savings accounts now set the standard. Clapp exemplifies this shift. It offers daily interest, instant access, clear rates, and institutional-grade custody with EU-regulated oversight. For individuals who want dependable passive income on USDT without sacrificing liquidity, flexible savings provide a practical and user-friendly solution.

The device will be used for digital mapping and to provide communications to distant areas, according to the head of the country’s space agency. Roscosmos to manufacture and launch 300 ‘Zorkiy’ satellites Russia is preparing to establish its own satellite system meant to become the domestic analogue to Starlink, developed and operated by U.S. tech entrepreneur Elon Musk’s SpaceX company. The nation is gearing up to start producing satellites for the network, announced Dmitry Bakanov, general director of the Russian State Corporation for Space Activities “Roscosmos,” who was interviewed by the state-controlled Channel One ahead of the weekend. According to the Russian press, the satellite named “Zorkiy” is the backbone of the “Rassvet” project, conceived as a response to America’s Starlink. Also quoted by the official TASS news agency on Saturday, Bakanov detailed that its production will begin in 2026 and more than 300 units will form an orbital group around the Earth by 2027. Demonstrating the device, the Roscosmos official announced: “Here is the ‘Zorkiy’ satellite. It is an apparatus that captures images from space, and based on these images, digital maps are created, which are then used for navigation by unmanned vehicles … This year, serial production of this equipment will begin.” Bakanov added that the satellite system will also facilitate communications in remote regions, where traditional land-based connections are either absent or unstable, elaborating: “It is also crucial to provide communications to all areas not covered by terrestrial networks. We have a Russian development on display here today for precisely this purpose. This is a terminal for broadband internet access anywhere on Earth.” Will Russia’s satellite system be a true alternative to Starlink? Just like Starlink, the Rassvet network will consist of low Earth orbit satellites, which significantly reduces the cost of data transmission in comparison with geostationary satellites. The low orbit allows for high-resolution imagery and satellite internet connection. While speaking on national TV, the Roscosmos CEO did present a module providing broadband access to the online space. However, the agency later posted on Telegram an excerpt from the video report with Bakanov’s comments, which had been quoted by a number of Russian publications, and clarified: “Earlier, media outlets reported that the head of Roscosmos called Zorky an analogue of Starlink on Channel One. This interpretation is inaccurate. Starlink is a satellite communications system. Zorky-2M is an Earth remote sensing satellite.” What about Rassvet’s main purpose? The Rassvet network, touted as Russia’s equivalent of Starlink, will transform troop command and control, while the Zorkiy satellites will improve the efficiency of high-precision strikes, Russian military expert Yuri Knutov spilled the beans in an interview with the Vzglyad newspaper. Also quoted by the Izvestia daily on Sunday, Knutov made it clear the satellite system will primarily address military objectives and mostly facilitate communications for Russian forces on the ground, emphasizing: “This is the creation of a global automated troop command and control system, where every service member will be able to receive information and transmit coordinates directly to the satellite.” As for its civilian application, Rassvet will provide internet access in certain regions of the Russian Federation and expand communications with civilian vessels, he nevertheless confirmed. If its satellites are positioned in optimal orbits, the system should significantly improve the reliability of communications and navigation, especially in the Arctic, the specialist added. While admitting Rassvet’s limited capabilities, compared to Starlink, Knutov described it as a significant step for Russia, aimed at outperforming the U.K.-based OneWeb satellite network, which serves corporate entities and military units. Access to Starlink has given the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which have been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion since 2022, a significant advantage on the battlefield, where satellite communications and unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have proved indispensable. Earlier in January, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved SpaceX’s deployment of 7,500 additional second-generation Starlink satellites, bringing the total of its authorized satellites to 15,000, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Last month, China applied to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), requesting orbital locations and frequencies for over 200,000 satellites. The move is seen as an apparent attempt to challenge the dominance of SpaceX and the United States in this space and market. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Paul said he was leaving for Davos to attend the World Economic Forum, where about 3,000 political and business leaders from more than 100 countries will meet to talk about global risks. He said he would hold meetings, deliver speeches, and promote Hong Kong’s position under China’s upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan. Gold clearing plans target faster trades and lower costs Paul said Hong Kong needs to move faster in a global environment that is changing by the month. Under the One Country, Two Systems framework, the city plays the role of a connector and value builder, especially as global trade rules change. One area the government wants to push harder is gold trading, with the goal of building an international gold hub . He said demand for gold has grown as investors look beyond US dollar assets. Gold prices jumped more than 60% in 2025, the biggest annual gain since 1979. By the third quarter of last year, global gold demand by value rose 44% year on year to $146 billion. Paul added that Asia now needs more reliable platforms for storing, trading, clearing, and pricing gold. Gold trading activity inside Hong Kong has already picked up. By November, average daily turnover of 99 tael gold on the local exchange climbed more than two times from a year earlier to HK$2.9 billion. Paul said the growth exposed a weakness. All over-the-counter spot trades still rely on direct settlement between buyers and sellers. There is no central clearing, which slows trades and raises risks. The government is now pushing to build a central gold clearing system as core financial infrastructure. Paul said the system aims to raise efficiency, improve physical delivery, cut transaction costs, and add liquidity. A trial run is planned within the year, and the Shanghai Gold Exchange has been invited to take part. The memorandum to be signed at the Asian Financial Forum will also include new details on strengthening this clearing system and preparing for future market links with the mainland. Trade digitization supports wider finance and logistics overhaul Paul said geopolitical tensions are not only changing asset allocation. They are also reshaping global trade, supply chains, and business models. Hong Kong plans to upgrade its entire trade ecosystem to protect its role as an international trade center. The government is supporting mainland firms expanding overseas while also speeding up digital upgrades across logistics and trade finance at home. One project is the Port Community System, which launched last week. The platform now connects more than 2,300 companies. It uses artificial intelligence and blockchain to offer real-time cargo tracking around the clock. The system is designed to improve transparency across the logistics chain and make trade data easier to use for financing. Another effort is the CargoX project, led by the government and the Monetary Authority with other agencies. The project uses cargo, logistics, and trade data to simplify trade finance processes and help small and medium-sized firms access funding. A new roadmap will be released this week. It will focus on data, infrastructure, and connectivity, with 20 proposals aimed at building a more digital and competitive trade finance ecosystem. Paul said Hong Kong will keep its open-market policies regardless of whatever, adding that public consultation on the next budget is under way, covering industry growth, job creation, public services, and living standards. He said policymakers must balance these goals against global political risks, local economic transition pressures, and the need to control public spending growth. Hong Kong is also positioning itself as a regional precious metals hub and as a bridge to mainland markets. International clearing is seen as key because it lets investors trade gold without physically moving it. Bloomberg News reported in October that the Shanghai Gold Exchange was already in advanced talks with Hong Kong officials on joining an international clearing system. Gary Ng Cheuk-yan, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Bank, said cooperation with Shanghai could strengthen Hong Kong’s role by expanding yuan-based products and attracting overseas investors. “With improved storage and clearing systems, Hong Kong can provide a regulated, safe environment to develop the gold trading ecosystem,” Gary said. “Hong Kong can leverage its multicurrency offerings – including the Hong Kong dollar, US dollar and yuan – to build the necessary storage and clearing infrastructure, eventually attracting investors to trade within the Asian time zone.” Don’t just read crypto news.

At the same time, a widely shared weekly chart flagged an inverse head and shoulders setup as ETH trades near a major volume shelf. Ethereum validator exit queue drops to zero as withdrawals clear Ethereum’s validator exit queue fell to zero, signaling that no validators were waiting to leave the network at the time of the latest update. Data shown on the Ethereum Validator Queue dashboard, provided by Beaconcha.in, listed exit queue ETH at 0 and the wait time at 0 minutes, reflecting a fully cleared line for exits. Meanwhile, the dashboard showed the network still facing heavy demand on the way in. The validator entry queue stood at about 2,597,854 ETH, with an estimated wait of 45 days and 2 hours, based on a churn setting of 256 per epoch. That gap between a cleared exit queue and a long entry queue pointed to net inflows into staking, since validators continued to line up to join while departures stayed absent. The same dashboard also reported an 8.5 day “sweep delay,” which tracks the time it takes for balances to be processed and swept through the system. Even with the exit queue cleared, that delay can still affect when funds move through withdrawal mechanics, depending on validator status and scheduling. Network totals stayed elevated in the snapshot. The dashboard listed about 977,886 active validators and roughly 36.0 million ETH staked, equal to 29.65% of supply, while the displayed annual percentage rate sat near 2.81%. The page showed the figures were last updated about 125 minutes before the capture. Ethereum weekly chart highlights inverse head and shoulders setup near key volume shelf Meanwhile, a weekly Ethereum chart shared by trader Donald Dean on X outlined an inverse head and shoulders structure as ETH traded around $3,313 on Coinbase. The chart marked the left shoulder in late 2024, the head in early 2025, and the right shoulder in late 2025, a formation many traders use to map a potential trend reversal if price clears the neckline zone. Ethereum U.S. Dollar Weekly Chart. Source: TradingView Coinbase / X Dean pointed to ETH sitting near the 0.618 Fibonacci level, shown around $3,344 on the chart, while volume profile bars on the right highlighted a dense “volume shelf” in the low to mid $3,000s. That matters because heavy traded zones often act as decision areas, since price can stall there while buyers and sellers settle positioning. If ETH holds above that shelf, traders often treat it as support; however, if it loses the area, attention typically shifts to the next volume shelf lower on the profile. The chart also showed higher horizontal reference levels, including a marked line near $4,123 and a prior peak zone above $4,800. Dean framed $4,867 as an upper target tied to a challenge of previous highs, but that path depends on ETH reclaiming and maintaining levels above the mid $3,000 region first. As a result, the setup remains conditional: the pattern strengthens only if price pushes through the resistance band and sustains acceptance above it on the weekly timeframe.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-18 12:34:27

The Silicon Valley firm is joining a massive fundraising round that could hit $25 billion. This round would more than double the company’s value, taking it from $170 billion four months ago to $350 billion now. The money isn’t coming from just one place. This is a pile-on. GIC, the wealth fund from Singapore, and Coatue, the U.S. investment firm, are each throwing in $1.5 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia are together pitching up to $15 billion. Everyone else (the venture funds, institutional players) is adding $10 billion or more on top. The final number hasn’t been locked in yet. Anthropic is still deciding who gets in. But the deal is expected to close soon, according to the Financial Times. Sequoia overhauls its leadership and bets on multiple rivals Moving on, this isn’t how Sequoia used to do things. Roelof Botha, the guy running it before, didn’t want anything to do with Anthropic. He thought venture money was being thrown at the same overhyped companies. “Throwing more money into Silicon Valley doesn’t yield more great companies,” Roelof said last year. But Roelof is out. He got replaced in November. Now Pat Grady and Alfred Lin are running the show. And their approach is different. Sequoia has already backed OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI. Now it’s backing Anthropic too. That’s rare. Venture firms usually pick one winner in a sector and stick with it. But the money flying around AI has broken that rule. Someone involved in the deal said this round is so huge, it doesn’t even feel like venture investing anymore. Sequoia doesn’t seem worried about overlap. The same person said the firm owns a lot of both OpenAI and xAI, and thinks they’ll all go in different directions. That’s what’s driving this shift. It’s not about picking one winner. It’s about not missing out. Sequoia’s track record is packed with Google, Apple, Airbnb, and Stripe, but this is the first time it’s entered a late-stage deal like this for Anthropic. And Anthropic is making serious money now, with its revenue literally surging 10x to $10 billion in December after being worth only $1 billion exactly a year before that. That kind of growth is rare, even in tech. The company is best known for its chatbot Claude, which is used across a lot of engineering workflows. And there’s more coming. Anthropic has already hired the law firm Wilson Sonsini to start work on an IPO. It’s also talking to banks to set up the offering. The public listing could happen later this year if all goes to plan. This would put it on the same track as OpenAI and SpaceX, who are also getting ready to go public.

After years of being blocked, China’s top EV brands like BYD and Geely are starting to see real changes in how Western markets treat them. Tariffs are easing. Quotas are being set. The door is cracked, and they’re stepping in. This is the year things might start shifting. Nobody expects a massive export boom overnight, but China’s EV giants are now positioned to test the waters in countries they’ve barely touched before. They’ve already crushed the competition in places like Southeast Asia and Russia. Now they’re setting their sights on the U.S. and Canada. Canada drops 100% penalty and opens small quota Prime Minister Mark Carney just confirmed that Canada will drop the extra 100% tariff it placed on China-made EVs last year. That tariff had completely stopped imports. Now, the country is allowing up to 49,000 units per year, starting immediately. Carney made the announcement after his visit to Beijing. He’s not removing all taxes. A 6.1% tariff is staying in place, mostly for longer-range models loaded with software and flashy entertainment systems. But this change is a clear shift from Canada’s previous hardline stance. This happened right after Beijing and the European Union agreed to get rid of steep tariffs, anywhere between 7.8% and 35.3%, and replace them with pricing deals that let Chinese carmakers earn more per sale. Geely said the news out of Canada gives them and others like them a new opening. “At first glance it is a positive step in the right direction. We are following it closely but it is too early to comment on specifics,” the company said. Sales surge in Europe while Canada restarts from zero Right now, China is the biggest electric vehicle producer in the world. They shipped 2.6 million cars last year, including hybrids. That was a 104% increase, based on numbers from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Even with those numbers, China’s EVs haven’t had much luck breaking into places like the U.S. or the EU, not because of the cars themselves, but because of policy. Canada’s 2024 decision to slap a 100% tariff wiped out their EV imports entirely. Phate Zhang, who runs CnEVPost in Shanghai, said this new import cap might help turn things around. “A sales cap below 50,000 units is not enough to shore up a Chinese EV maker’s total export volume, but it will definitely be a good start if [they] can convince local drivers of their reliability,” he said. “Canada, as part of the big North American market, is of great significance to Chinese companies.” BYD , China’s largest EV builder, is doing a lot better in Europe. They delivered 159,869 cars there in the first 11 months of 2025, which is 276% more than they shipped in the same period the year before. That’s based on numbers from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Still, they aren’t getting a free pass. BYD cars sold in Europe face a 17% anti-subsidy charge on top of a 10% regular tariff. That cuts into profits. In Canada , now that the 100% penalty is gone, they’re likely to earn a lot more per sale. Right now, international shipments make up 20% of BYD’s total sales. Back home, China’s EV scene is massive. Local drivers bought 70% of the electric cars sold globally last year. That’s around 13 million units, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Xu Bin from UBS Securities pointed out how prices are rising fast. “Most of China’s exported cars are priced at about 100,000 yuan (US$14,355) and we now see cars priced at 300,000 yuan sold abroad,” he said.

The inflows totaled about $1.42 billion, the biggest weekly pickup since early October. That rush pushed prices higher for a time and pulled a lot of attention back to these regulated funds. Related Reading: Saylor Defends Bitcoin Treasury Firms Amid Rising Criticism Institutional Demand Comes Back Reports say big, familiar investors are rejoining these funds. Managers with large pools of capital are using ETFs to get Bitcoin exposure in a way that fits standard rules and reporting. Some of the buying came through a tight set of funds that have wide reach with big clients. The move is being read as a return of steady, long-term money rather than quick speculative bets. Reports from the Bitcoin macro newsletter Ecoinometrics note that recent jumps in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows usually lead to brief price gains, which often disappear when the inflows ease. Based on data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their biggest inflows midweek, with Wednesday bringing in more than $840 million in a single day and Tuesday following with roughly $754 million. Bitcoin doesn’t need a few good days. It needs a few good weeks. We’ve seen this pattern repeatedly: a short burst of ETF inflows, a quick price bounce, and then momentum fades. That tells us demand still exists, but it’s not persistent enough to change the trend. The chart… pic.twitter.com/6mkv7ye9fW — ecoinometrics (@ecoinometrics) January 16, 2026 BlackRock’s IBIT Tops Flows BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust drew the largest share of the gains. On several days it led all spot ETF flows, with one report showing IBIT accounted for roughly $1.03 billion of the weekly total. A single day during the run saw IBIT pull in amounts measured in the hundreds of millions, underlining how dominant the fund has become in the US market. When big, regulated vehicles buy a lot of Bitcoin, the effect is not just on paper. These ETFs must either create new shares by buying coins or choose to source supply elsewhere. That process removes coins from the pool available to regular traders. At the same time, some data show that large holders eased off selling in recent days, which tightened the coins ready to trade even more. The mix of fresh demand and less selling can lift price quickly. Short Gains, Or The Start Of Something Longer? Some market watchers point out that a single week of big inflows is only part of the picture. Patterns matter. If monthly flows stay strong, then the story is clearer. If the money fades, prices can fall back just as fast. Still, the sudden inflow shows that at least a group of big investors prefers regulated ETF exposure right now. That matters for how traditional funds think about Bitcoin in balanced portfolios.

Data from X’s Head of Product from Dec 2025 to Jan 14, 2026 reveals Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum as the platform’s top-discussed crypto topics, XRP notably outpacing Ethereum. The trend has traders and analysts buzzing, hinting at a faster-than-expected surge in market sentiment around XRP. Xaif Crypto highlights that XRP’s surge in mentions goes beyond retail chatter, signaling growing market interest. Social media trends often precede price moves and institutional engagement, and XRP’s online prominence shows both investors and influencers are closely watching Ripple’s developments. Well, XRP’s rising visibility is being fueled by real-world payment adoption, positive regulatory updates, and speculation around upcoming XRP-focused ETFs, which are capturing investor attention and driving social media engagement. Meanwhile, Ethereum discussions remain largely centered on long-term network upgrades rather than immediate market activity. According to Xaif Crypto, hashtags offer a clear measure of crypto popularity. Over the reporting period, Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum dominated trends, with XRP-related tags consistently outperforming Ethereum’s, signaling not just mentions, but active engagement through debates, news sharing, and investment discourse. Why does this matter? Well, social media momentum could be a key driver of XRP’s performance in the 2026 bull cycle. Rising mentions signal growing investor attention, potentially drawing both retail and institutional capital. While Bitcoin leads overall attention, XRP’s surge in social chatter highlights its expanding relevance. Outpacing Ethereum in social engagement may foreshadow heightened interest and volatility, cementing XRP as a crypto to watch in early 2026. Conclusion XRP’s rising social media buzz over Ethereum signals more than chatter, it reflects real investor interest and shifting market narratives. With growing adoption, heightened visibility, and potential institutional inflows, XRP is emerging as a key market mover in 2026. Therefore, the signal is clear that XRP is no longer background noise, it’s driving the conversation.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-18 13:02:08

He stated that anyone holding 10,000 XRP is already pre-rich. The remark draws attention to the remarkable rise in the token’s value over the past year and the projections experts have made for its future. Rapid Growth Since 2024 In late 2024, XRP traded at $0.50. At that time, 10,000 XRP cost $5,500. Investors who purchased at that time have already seen substantial gains. Today, XRP trades at $2.07, meaning the same 10,000 tokens are worth over $20,000. This represents a 3x increase in just over a year. Notably, experts have indicated that this growth phase placed XRP within an accumulation zone that has lasted 13 months . Once the asset breaks out, it could see further gains, potentially smashing through its all-time high of $3.65 . If you hold 10,000 $XRP you are pre rich — Austin (@Austin_XRPL) January 17, 2026 Potential for Major Gains Analysts have projected that XRP could reach as high as $589, with some suggesting it could rise to four or even five-digit prices. If the asset hits the $589 target , someone investing a little over $20,000 now could see their holdings grow to $589,000. Larger investments or continued growth could increase these returns, potentially making some holders millionaires. This forecast is the context behind Austin’s description of token holders as pre-rich. Market Dynamics Supporting XRP Several factors contribute to XRP’s growth potential. Its adoption in financial systems and partnerships with institutions enhances demand for the token. XRP benefits from global attention and usage within the multinational payment infrastructure, positioning it for future price appreciation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory clarity has also given rise to spot XRP ETFs, which have seen massive demand from institutional investors . Investors tracking the market can observe that the token’s value has already risen significantly within a short period, suggesting continued interest and activity around it. Investing Early Is the Best Strategy XRP’s current market price allows both early adopters and new investors to benefit. Those who purchased XRP when it was under $1 have already experienced meaningful gains. New investors entering the market at the current $2.07 level are participating in a stage that analysts describe as having strong upside potential. The growth seen in recent years underlines how early investment in XRP can translate into large financial gains . With projected targets significantly higher than the current price, token holders may realize substantial returns if these forecasts materialize.

Bitcoin Demand Shows Improvement but Remains Weak (CryptoQuant​),https://cryptopotato.com/bear-market-rally-bitcoin-demand-shows-improvement-but-remains-weak-cryptoquant/,"Over the past week, bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded, with the price approaching certain crucial thresholds. Despite this rally in the asset’s value, analysts at the crypto research firm CryptoQuant believe the market, led by BTC, has not escaped the bears’ claws. In a weekly report from CryptoQuant, market experts noted that BTC demand conditions have improved recently. However, they are still weak and have not changed significantly. This substantiates the claim that the market is still in a bearish phase despite bitcoin’s latest rally. Bitcoin Sees Bear Market Rally Since November 21, 2025, BTC has risen by approximately 20% to its current levels. The rally follows a 19% decline that confirmed the start of a bear market as BTC fell below its 365-day moving average (MA). The surge brought the leading cryptocurrency near its 365-day MA, currently sitting at $101,000. Historically, the 365-day MA has acted as a regime boundary with previous bear cycles showing repeated rejections near that level before renewed downward movement. BTC recorded a similar pattern in the 2022 bear cycle, and this time is no different. The rally in bitcoin’s price comes amid slightly improved but weak demand conditions. In fact, spot demand is still contracting. U.S. spot indicators, such as the Coinbase Price Premium and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), briefly turned positive. The Coinbase premium briefly increased from deep negative territory for the second time since mid-December 2025. Bitcoin Demand Remains Weak On the ETF front, there is still no extraordinary activity. These products merely stopped net selling during the rally, after offloading as much as 54,000 BTC over a 30-day period in November 2025. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have not indicated a strong return of U.S. demand or shown sustained accumulation. Furthermore, apparent demand metrics reveal that Bitcoin spot demand has contracted by 67,000 BTC over the last 30 days and has been in negative territory since November 28, 2025. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have purchased only 3,800 BTC so far this year, compared to 3,600 at the same time last year – levels below thresholds associated with bull-market recoveries. Meanwhile, analysts say BTC may face increased selling pressure in the coming weeks, as exchange flows have begun to rise after the recent rally. Bitcoin transfers to exchanges have spiked to a seven-day average of 39,000 BTC. Increased flows into exchanges are historically associated with escalating selling activity, so there may be more trouble for BTC ahead. The post Bear Market Rally?

57272180,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=897464,1768741906,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57272180.jpeg,China tech stocks defy weak economy to outperform international competition,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-tech-stocks-outperform-global-peers/,"China’s tech stocks are ripping higher while the rest of the world tries to figure out what’s happening. Been a year since DeepSeek dropped its shock AI model, China is flying into 2026 with a fresh round of tech milestones and a market that doesn’t care how weak the economy looks. A Nasdaq-style index of local Chinese tech stocks has jumped nearly 13% just this month. A second gauge tracking Hong Kong-listed Chinese tech firms is up 6%. Both are leaving the Nasdaq 100 behind. And this is happening while the economy is stuck. Housing is still a disaster, and consumers aren’t spending. AI stocks jump as investors bet on Chinese-made breakthroughs The real fireworks started last January when DeepSeek released its low-cost AI model. It worked just as well as its Western peers and cost way less. That one launch rattled global markets and lit a fire under China’s entire tech ecosystem. Since then, local firms haven’t looked back. Giants like Tencent and Alibaba quickly embraced generative AI. Others raced to develop their own versions. Now it’s everywhere. Chinese AI firms aren’t just building chatbots. They’re embedding large language models into machines, tools, even flying cars. Some robots have run marathons, boxed in demo fights, and danced in folk shows. In factories, AI is showing up inside precision machine tools and next-gen equipment. Investors are no longer seeing China as just a cheap labor hub. It’s now looking like a serious rival to US tech. That shift is visible in the numbers. Jefferies tracks 33 Chinese AI stocks. Their market value has exploded by $732 billion in the past year. And Jefferies thinks that number could grow much more because Chinese AI companies still make up just 6.5% of the market cap of their U.S. counterparts. Public listings are heating up too. A bunch of new AI-related IPOs have seen huge gains. That’s encouraging more firms to go public. Companies in the queue include Xpeng’s flying-car division , rocket maker LandSpace Technology, and BrainCo, a firm being called a possible rival to Neuralink. Tech valuations stretch as Beijing tries to slow speculation Of course, not everyone’s thrilled. Some stocks look way too expensive. Cambricon Technologies , an AI chip company competing with Nvidia, is trading at around 120 times forward earnings. A separate index tracking Chinese robotics is trading at 40 times forward earnings, higher than the Nasdaq 100, which sits around 25. Regulators are watching. Beijing just tightened margin financing rules, a clear signal that they’re worried about speculation getting out of hand. Most of the heat is in the tech sector. The message is simple: they don’t want a bubble. Still, some investors are holding their ground. They point to low labor costs, strong central planning, and government backing as reasons to stay long on China’s tech. Outside of tech, things are bleak. New economic data expected Monday will likely confirm that investment is shrinking, and consumer spending is weak, even as exports remain strong. Economists in a Bloomberg poll predict fourth-quarter GDP growth of 4.5%, the worst since China reopened after the Covid lockdowns. For the full year, growth is expected to come in at 5%, hitting Beijing’s official target. But that number hides the truth. Once you strip out price changes, nominal growth could be just 4%, dragged down by deflation. That would be the slowest pace in half a century, except for 2020. Economist Raymond Yeung at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group said last week that the negative GDP deflator means supply is far outpacing demand. “A negative GDP deflator suggests excess aggregate supply in the economy,” he said in a research note.

These tools can help customers achieve higher conversion rates across web, app, email, and stores. Its Brainpowa LLM is trained and commerce-tuned, using a verification layer to reduce hallucinations and tailor responses, which is promising on paper. However, 2025 as a whole changed RZLV’s prospects entirely. Their equity raises and acquisitions throughout the year materially grew the revenue base. Ultimately, based on their recent guidance, I believe RZLV’s EV now seems quite compelling for investors willing to speculate on their execution going forward. Rezolve AI plc ( RZLV ) is a software company that offers AI agents for e-commerce platforms. The idea is that these tools can improve engagement and obtain higher conversion rates for its customers. RZLV’s main product is Brain Suite, including Brain Commerce for conversational shopping, and Brain Checkout for streamlined cart-to-payment flows across several channels like web, app, email, and in-store. Recently, RZLV has added fresh institutional capital, acquired visual search, and blockchain data infrastructure. They also have partnerships using distribution pathways via Google Cloud (GOOGL) ( GOOG ) and Microsoft Azure ( MSFT ). But more importantly, post-acquisition and capital raises, RZLV now looks (at least on paper) like a viable speculative “Buy” at these levels. Revamped AI SaaS Rezolve AI plc is, at its core, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that develops artificial intelligence ((AI)) agents for e-commerce. The company was incorporated in 2023 with an office in London, UK. I previously covered RZLV last March, but since then, the stock has appreciated significantly, made a major acquisition, and bolstered its balance sheet. So, I thought it was worthwhile updating my thesis on this name. Source: Investor Presentation. July 2025. You see, RZLV’s core product family is the Brain Suite , which includes software for recommendations (Brain Commerce) and to facilitate transactions (Brain Checkout). The suite offers rapid deployment with minimal development using an application programming interface ((API)), where the business is required to feed its catalog, pricing, inventory, promos, and related information. Interestingly, RZLV’s Brain Checkout module supports payments in crypto, with the merchant receiving fiat (crypto-to-fiat). This feature often means that the system integrates with a processor that accepts crypto stablecoins on the consumer side, and settles to the merchant in USD/EUR or others. Brain Suite is powered by a proprietary large language model [LLM] called Brainpowa . This LLM was trained using 300 billion pieces of text (tokens) and fine-tuned on commerce-specific data to achieve better performance in the retail context. The software detects sentiment, like urgency or frustration, to adjust tone and escalation. Brainpowa is designed to reduce hallucinations thanks to a verification layer where answers are checked against a trusted source before being shown to users. Similarly, Brain Commerce specializes in retail behavior, managing product attributes, and shopping intent, capable of showing the right product for the customer, aiming for sales conversion. It is a system that works end-to-end for conversational discovery to AI search and recommendations. Source: Investor Presentation. July 2025. However, the interesting portion of their business comes with Brain Checkout , which is their AI last-mile module. This offering basically takes a shopper from cart to payment and fulfillment with fewer clicks and is integrated with the merchant’s e-commerce and payment stack. The user can initiate and finalize the purchase inside the conversation itself, which can lead to higher conversion rates. This software can be used across several channels, such as web, mobile app, email links, and in-store experiences. And the payment transactions plug into third-party payment processors with payment card industry data security standards (PCI-DSS) compliance. Major Developments Having said that, by July 2025, RZLV announced that it had secured fresh capital with a $50 million investment by two new institutional investors, one of them being Citadel Global Equities, to use in product innovation. Later, RZLV acquired ViSenze , a company specializing in visual search applied in retail for product discovery. Another acquisition was made in December, when the company bought Crownpeak , a digital experience platform to improve content management and product discovery. In my view, this latter acquisition completely changed its prospects (more on this later). Moreover, by October 2025, RZLV acquired SQD (Subsquid), and since then, it has used SQD Network as the subsidiary name. There is a crypto utility token, also called SQD, that is tied to this network. RZLV intends to build a token treasury position by acquiring SQD tokens equivalent to at least 1% of the company’s annual revenues each year. Though time will tell how this crypto strategy plays out in the long run, I think the main story here lies with Crownpeak. Still, last December, they did announce they’d fund SQD Network’s data infrastructure through revenue pools . Enterprises pay subscription and service fees for SQD’s data services, and those payments are routed into a pool that helps finance the service. Source: Investor Presentation. July 2025. Aside from that, RZLV continued its partnerships with Microsoft and Google to make it easier for businesses already on Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure to adopt RZLV’s Brain Suite. Google Cloud’s sales channels are expected to distribute RZLV’s suite globally, hoping to contribute more than 50% of forecasted revenues over the coming years. In fact, RZLV’s suite is available through Microsoft Azure Marketplace, which also simplifies enterprise procurement and deployment. Microsoft also mentions co-sell, meaning that Microsoft’s sales motion can bring RZLV into its deals, while it also validates RZLV’s growth ambitions to some extent. Plus, RZLV expects that Microsoft's go-to-market support amounts to around $130 million over time, thanks to credibility and easing in distribution via the Azure ecosystem. Source: Investor Presentation. July 2025. Furthermore, just a few days ago, RZLV guided to $40 million for full-year 2025. However, in this new guidance, the true headline was their $350 million revenue target for the full year 2026, which is nearly double the previous market expectations of about $170 million. The company also said it exited 2025 with a $209 million annualized run-rate ((ARR)), and that December 2025 revenue exceeded $17 million, calling it its first profitable month. The company claims that December performance implies a much higher starting run-rate going into 2026. Valuation And Risk Analysis Now, from a valuation perspective, the stock itself is up around 306% from its 2025 lows, which shows they’ve already had an impressive run-up despite the recent 37% decline from their 2025 highs. However, the latest detailed financial information we have comes from their 6-K filing for 1H2025. At the time, their balance sheet held $9.9 million in cash against $33.5 million in financial debt (loans and notes), aside from other operating liabilities. Source: RZLV’s 1H2025 6-K. However, it’s worth highlighting that the Q2 2025 earnings call mentioned that, by Q3, RZLV successfully raised two financing rounds for a total of $250 million. They also disclosed they ended September 2025 with approximately $230 million in cash. Though note that those raises also diluted shareholders, including their recent acquisition of Crownpeak. So, basically, RZLV now has around 322 million shares outstanding post-raises and post-acquisition. That number aligns with what we do know, since the raises added ( PIPE + private placement ), and the Crownpeak acquisition involved issuing shares. RZLV also repaid some of Crownpeak’s debts (a $50 million term loan and $7.5 million revolver). That’s why I would adjust their September $230 million cash figure to roughly $172.5 million post-acquisition. But note I excluded other potential integration costs, working capital adjustments, etc., to work with a simple estimate. I also calculate that RZLV burned through approximately $10.0 million during Q2 2025. I got this figure by adding its quarterly cash flows from operations and CAPEX. Using the same approach, I calculate Crownpeak’s 2025 cash burn at $14.9 million (or about $3.7 million per quarter). That would add to a combined estimated cash burn of $13.8 million per quarter, assuming the same burn rate persisted through Q4. Thus, that would imply RZLV’s cash position by the start of 2026 is closer to $158.7 million. And more importantly, it would show they probably have an ample cash runway of around 11.5 quarters. Source: Investor Presentation. July 2025. Moreover, at the current $4.60 PPS, those figures imply a market cap of around $1.48 billion. They also added Crownpeak’s term loan of $103.7 million and a $50 million loan used as consideration for the acquisition. Thus, my EV estimate is around $1.5 billion today. And if we assume their $500 million 2026 exit ARR target materializes, it would price RZLV at a forward EV/S of 3.0. For comparison, their sector’s median forward EV/S is actually slightly higher at 3.6. Plus, they target a sizeable TAM, which they estimate at roughly $480-$540 billion . So, if anything, RZLV may actually be somewhat cheap at these levels based on those multiples. On top of that, RZLV would be effectively growing at a much faster clip than its peers’ forward topline growth rate of only 8.3% , which should deserve a premium multiple. But note that RZLV, as it stands today, appears to be growing its ARR quite rapidly. So, depending on how their post-acquisition margins evolve, it’s possible this cash burn figure will change drastically in the coming quarters. And remember, RZLV’s standalone Q2 2025 EBIT margins were -513.3%, so this is their key risk now in my view. Source: Seeking Alpha. If their margins worsen or remain negative, I would imagine their runway will actually decrease quickly as their ARR increases. Conversely, if margins improve or turn positive, they could quickly become self-sustainable. We have to wait until their next update to have a clearer picture on this, but my guess is that their margins aren’t likely to improve significantly at first because acquisition and integration costs tend to be front-loaded. So, this variable alone could make or break RZLV’s investment thesis in the long run, which is why RZLV ultimately remains highly speculative for now. Conclusion: Speculative “Buy” Overall, RZLV post-acquisition and capital raises now look like a much more compelling bet than when I first covered it. Naturally, there are several assumptions in my speculative bull case and valuation approach. Also, RZLV’s ARR growth targets seem quite aggressive, and they may not materialize entirely as management expects. And, even if growth materializes like that, their margins may deteriorate in the process and lead to an unsustainable runway. All of these factors create considerable uncertainty for investors at this stage as well. I believe the ingredients for success appear to be there, but until we see their next detailed update, I can only rate RZLV as a viable speculative “buy” given their acquisition and strengthened balance sheet. But, please size your position carefully, as there’s limited information about their actual operations (and by extension, prospects) until we have their 6-K post-acquisition later this year.",RZLV,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-18 13:15:00

Specialized training data could greatly improve digital assistance for at-risk groups, according to Lu Shiyu, a senior researcher at Tencent Research Institute. “The next crucial step is working with major developers that serve many users,” Lu stated. “This would create the biggest positive impact.” Specialized data sets under development In order to train language models to better assist vulnerable users, Lu’s team at the Tencent Research Institute, the public research division of the Shenzhen-based internet giant, has been creating specialized data collections since 2024. Before systems are fine-tuned and deployed, these collections provide fundamental knowledge during the pre-training stage. Lu’s team and academics from the University of Science and Technology Beijing tested some of the top models last year, and the results showed serious flaws. The study looked at the best Chinese and American systems, including Tencent ‘s own Hunyuan, and discovered that all of them did poorly on subjects like sex education and other themes pertinent to China’s 69 million left-behind children, children from rural areas whose parents have moved to cities in search of employment. Technology integration raises concerns The program coincides with the swift assimilation of intelligent systems into the lives of Chinese youngsters. A November 2025 story in the Rest of the World claims that robot tutors, digital chatbots, and automated assignment grading systems are transforming childhood in China by providing both friendship and educational content. In August, the Chinese government mandated technology integration throughout children’s education to enable personalized teaching. However, educators have expressed skepticism, warning that overreliance on automated systems could impair children’s independent thinking and communication skills. Targeting elderly users Tencent’s research team has also partnered with Chinese nonprofits serving vulnerable populations to develop an “elderly data set” compiled from thousands of question-and-answer samples contributed by older respondents. Global developments are reflected in the work. Age-friendly design, cognitive accessibility, and privacy protections for vulnerable users were identified as major research themes in a January 2026 study published in JMIR that emphasized the growing significance of specialized data for aged populations. According to the report, older persons frequently encounter major obstacles because of their low level of digital literacy and the complexity of contemporary gadgets. Tencent hopes to ensure that technology benefits society’s most disadvantaged citizens, not only tech-savvy consumers, by creating these specialized collections and encouraging industry-wide cooperation.

Garlinghouse praised the proposed Crypto Market Structure Bill as a critical step forward despite its imperfections saying: “Clarity is always better than chaos.” Ripple CEO urged ongoing collaboration with Washington, stressing that the industry must keep pushing to secure meaningful legislation. “We’re so close we can’t give up now,” he added. Garlinghouse’s remarks follow the Senate Banking Committee’s delay on the Crypto Market Structure Bill, prompted by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s warning that the draft could worsen an already ‘murky’ regulatory landscape after a rapid 48-hour review. Well, the clash underscores the regulatory tightrope: lawmakers aim to provide clarity for crypto innovation and institutional adoption, yet rushed rules, especially on stablecoins and trading, risk stifling growth. Armstrong’s rejection highlights the ongoing tension between certainty and sustainable market development. Conversely, The White House has warned that it may withdraw support for the Crypto Market Structure Bill and CLARITY Act if major industry consensus isn’t reached, highlighting friction over stablecoin yields and market rules and the difficulty of aligning lawmakers with market participants. As a result, Garlinghouse has urged stakeholders to prioritize constructive dialogue over gridlock, emphasizing that incremental progress and collaboration with lawmakers outweigh stalling efforts. He noted that even a “flawed” bill can provide crucial legal clarity, laying the groundwork for refinement over time. As the U.S. crypto sector awaits decisive action, the debate around the CLARITY Act shows that effective regulation requires compromise, persistence, and forward momentum. For Garlinghouse and Ripple, the takeaway is clear that the industry cannot let perfect be the enemy of progress. Conclusion In an industry driven by rapid innovation, the CLARITY Act could be a turning point for U.S. crypto markets. Despite ongoing disagreements, Garlinghouse emphasizes collaboration over conflict, highlighting a key truth that progress demands compromise. Regulatory clarity now could unlock growth, institutional adoption, and investor confidence, paving the way for a more stable, vibrant crypto ecosystem.

The threat has hit a nerve in Europe. Leaders from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, and Finland called it blackmail and warned that this could tear apart long-standing alliances. Trump’s team didn’t say if the European Union would be hit as a whole, but the eight countries were listed one by one. The tariffs , Trump said, were punishment for sending troops to Greenland, even though those deployments were small. European officials said they only did it because Trump had asked them to step up Arctic security months ago. Now he’s using it against them. Denmark and Norway defend actions in Greenland, reject Trump’s pressure Lars, Denmark’s foreign minister, said the Arctic is not peaceful anymore, and they’ve been honest with the US about why troops were sent to Greenland. He said, “That’s exactly why we and NATO partners are stepping up in full transparency with our American allies.” Jonas, Norway’s prime minister, said the whole thing is wrong. “Threats have no place among allies,” he said. Jonas also reminded reporters that Greenland belongs to Denmark and that Norway backs Denmark’s rights there completely. He said NATO already agreed it was time to focus more on Arctic defense. Ulf, the prime minister of Sweden, went further. “We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” he wrote online. He said this wasn’t just about a few countries—he called it an EU problem that affects the whole bloc. Emmanuel, the president of France, kept it short. “No intimidation or threats will influence us,” he wrote. He named Greenland directly and called the tariff warning “unacceptable.” Stefan, a government spokesperson from Germany, said Berlin saw the statement from Trump and was talking with other European governments about how to respond. “We will decide on the right steps together,” he said. UK, Netherlands, Finland, and opposition leaders warn of consequences Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said clearly that Greenland is part of Denmark and its future isn’t up to the US. “We’ve made it clear that Arctic security matters for all of NATO,” he said. He added that tariffs shouldn’t be used against allies who are trying to keep the region stable. David, the foreign minister of the Netherlands, said the whole thing was inappropriate. Speaking on a Dutch TV show, he said, “We’re not in favor of using trade tariffs in situations that have nothing to do with trade.” He also said allies should talk to each other instead of trying to push each other around. Alexander, the president of Finland, said the same thing. “Among allies, issues are best resolved through discussion, not through pressure,” he wrote. He added that this could hurt the US-Europe relationship. Then came a joint statement from all eight countries. It said Arctic safety is a shared NATO issue, and that a recent Danish exercise called Arctic Endurance was planned with allies. “It poses no threat to anyone,” they wrote. They said they stand fully with Denmark and the people of Greenland , and warned that tariff threats are dangerous and risk serious fallout between allies. The reaction wasn’t just from sitting leaders. Nigel, head of Reform UK, said these tariffs will “hurt” Britain. He said, “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t.” Richard, also from Reform UK, said Trump was wrong. Kemi, leader of the Conservatives, said Britain had to rebuild its strength. “Otherwise, we’ll end up being poodles as the US annexes Greenland and we’re slapped with tariffs because we have not shown any strength,” she said.

Some believe XRP could break through key resistance in the next leg of the market, with a short-term target around $5 and room for further upside. More aggressive forecasts suggest that if momentum accelerates, XRP could see a multi-fold rally—potentially pushing toward the $50 range—arguing that the current move may only be the start of a broader uptrend. At the same time, XRP’s price swings have grown sharper since December, leading more holders to rethink strategies that depend solely on price appreciation. While maintaining long-term exposure to XRP, some investors are adding cloud mining to their portfolios to generate daily cash flow and smooth out returns. Through platforms such as NAP Hash , some participants report earning $25,700 per day in passive income without stepping away from the market, helping offset uncertainty across market cycles. Why NAP Hash Stands Out in Cloud Mining As competition in the cloud mining market continues to intensify, NAP Hash has built a clear advantage through consistent investment in compliance, transparency, and high operational standards. Registered in the United Kingdom, the company operates within a defined regulatory framework and follows structured processes designed to strengthen long-term user trust. From an operations standpoint, NAP Hash runs on a fully cloud-based model, meaning users don’t need to buy, install, or maintain any mining hardware—significantly lowering the barrier to entry. The platform integrates data center resources across multiple continents and supports its computing power with clean energy sources such as geothermal, hydropower, wind, and solar, helping deliver stable performance with lower energy use. Combined with intelligent computing power allocation and a MiCA-aligned compliance structure, this setup is designed to improve both reliability and overall efficiency. On the product side, NAP Hash offers short-term mining plans ranging from one to three days, giving users more flexibility and liquidity when managing their funds. New users can also access trial mining power worth between $15 and $100, allowing them to see real settlement results without an upfront commitment. By improving energy efficiency while keeping power costs under control, NAP Hash creates a more competitive net return profile for users and further reinforces its position as a leading platform in cloud mining. How to Get Started with NAP Hash in Three Simple Steps Step 1: Create Your Account Setting up a NAP Hash account takes less than 30 seconds, and new users instantly receive a starter reward. Step 2: Choose a Cloud Mining Contract The platform offers a range of budget-friendly plans suitable for beginners and experienced investors alike. Each contract provides fixed returns with daily payouts, giving users a clear and predictable earning experience. Popular Contract Earnings Examples Mining Machine Model Contract Price Duration (Days) Daily Earnings Principal + Total Returns BTC Miner A1366L $100 2 Days $3 $100 + $6 BTC Miner A1346 $500 6 Days $6 $500 + 36$ GODE Miner DogeII $2500 20 Days $36 $2500 + 725$ BTC Miner M60S++ $8000 30 Days $130 $8000 + 3888$ LTC Miner ANTRACK V1 $10000 35 Days $172 $10000 + 6020$ Please visit the official NAP Hash website to view more contract options. Step 3: Collect Your Daily Earnings Mining rewards are credited to your account automatically every day. You can withdraw your earnings at any time or reinvest them to build stronger long-term returns. Real User Cases JL, a rideshare driver in Chicago, USA, wanted a steadier income stream to balance weeks when earnings were slower. He chose a $1,500 cloud mining contract, which brings in roughly $18–$22 per day through automatic daily payouts. He said the daily settlement makes budgeting easier, and he likes that it doesn’t depend on catching the “right” market move. KC, a retail worker in Sydney, Australia, was looking for a simple way to earn extra income without spending hours tracking charts. She started with a $1,000 cloud mining contract, earning around $12–$15 per day in daily payouts. She shared that the consistent cash flow helps cover regular expenses like transportation and phone bills, and she prefers cloud mining because it runs in the background. PT, an IT analyst in Toronto, Canada, moved part of his long-term crypto holdings into a $5,000 cloud mining contract to reduce portfolio ups and downs. His contract generates about $40–$50 per day with daily settlement. He described it as a straightforward way to add predictable cash flow while still staying connected to the broader crypto market. Together, these examples show how cloud mining is being used by different types of users—from everyday workers to professionals—as a low-effort way to build daily cash flow. In a market known for sharp swings, it can offer a steadier income option for those who want crypto exposure without relying only on price moves. Conclusion As interest in major crypto assets like XRP continues to rise, market volatility is also picking up. Whether it’s optimism around a potential breakout or the stress that comes with repeated price swings, more investors are asking the same question: how can they stay positioned for long-term upside without relying entirely on price moves—and still maintain steady, reliable returns? Against this backdrop, NAP Hash offers an alternative to short-term trading through a low barrier to entry, a renewable-energy-powered mining infrastructure, and automated daily settlement. As more capital flows into cloud mining, platforms built on compliance, transparent operations, and strong energy efficiency may play a growing role as a steady source of supplemental income—helping investors bring more predictability to their finances in a high-volatility market.

This development follows a series of contentious moments surrounding the highly anticipated crypto market structure bill, beginning with Armstrong raising concerns over its provisions, which the crypto exchange would rather protest than support. Crypto Market Bill Still On, Bank Negotiations Ongoing — Coinbase CEO In a surprising move on January 15, Armstrong announced a public support withdrawal for the Clarity Act. The key crypto figure argued that the current content of proposed legislation was introducing a regulatory structure that would produce a net negative effect on the crypto industry. In particular, Armstrong raised alarm on opposition to stablecoin yield sharing, among other issues, before emphasizing the preference of “no bill than a bad bill.” Following this event, journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the White House became furious over Armstrong and Coinbase’s public criticism, which they described as a “rug pull”. In particular, she claimed the Donald Trump-led administration has threatened to withdraw support for the Clarity Act if the crypto exchange fails to return to the negotiation table with satisfactory solutions to the stablecoin yield dilemma. However, Armstrong has come out to counter this narrative of a potential fallout between Coinbase and the US government. Rather, Armstrong stated the crypto exchange has only directed to negotiate a deal with banks on how stablecoin yield sharing can fit with the present financial system. Notably, the US banking industry has pushed against allowing stablecoin operators to share yield with users, which they project could potentially cause a deposit flight even at interest rates as low as 5%. Armstrong states Coinbase is now exploring a potential deal that could benefit all entities involved following what he described as a “super constructive” meeting with the White House, thereby countering the report of escalating tensions. Terrett Fires Back At Coinbase Boss In another X post, Terrett hit back at the Coinbase CEO, claiming her initial report remains accurate. The renowned journalist explains that Armstrong’s rebuttal on supports her earlier claim that the White House has now hinged their support of the Clarity Act to Coinbase’s ability to secure a deal with the banks on the implementation of stablecoin yield sharing. For context, the Clarity Act is designed to clearly define how digital assets are regulated in the United States and which agencies oversee different parts of the crypto market. It is a crucial piece of legislation, the approval of which is expected to improve investor protection and encourage adoption.",Coinbase|Brian Armstrong|CLARITY Act|coinbase|Digital Asset Market Clarity Act|Donald Trump|Eleanor Terrett,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-18 14:00:19

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-xrp-price-could-quadruple-overnight-heres-why/,"FeFe (@fefe01101100), a crypto pundit, recently made a strong case for investors to consider XRP alongside silver. He wrote, “If silver can quadruple overnight, why can’t XRP?” This follows an earlier recommendation where FeFe emphasized that acquiring XRP now remains a prudent move. His latest post signals a growing focus on the parallel potential of XRP and silver. XRP currently trades at $2.07, reflecting substantial growth from previous lows. Analysts have repeatedly highlighted XRP’s underappreciated potential, calling on investors to acquire the token while prices are favorable . FeFe’s original post aligns with these views, reinforcing the idea that XRP remains an attractive opportunity for those seeking significant gains. If silver can quadruple overnight why can’t XRP https://t.co/1BUZy5iABd — FeFe (@fefe01101100) January 17, 2026 Silver and XRP Moving Together FeFe’s comparison between silver and XRP suggests that the two assets may experience similar growth dynamics . Silver has demonstrated the ability to move rapidly. FeFe is pointing to this precedent to illustrate the kind of upside that XRP could achieve. If XRP were to increase 4x from its current price of $2.07, the token could reach approximately $8.28. This move would offer substantial returns for investors holding significant positions. Other analysts have noted patterns in XRP’s price movements that resemble those historically seen in silver . These patterns indicate that it may be positioned for a major breakout, with price movements aligning with previous bullish cycles. The comparison strengthens the argument that strategic acquisition of both XRP and silver could provide compounded benefits for investors. Considerations for Investors FeFe’s post emphasizes a proactive approach. By recommending the inclusion of silver alongside XRP, he is suggesting a dual-asset strategy that could capitalize on market trends. For years, experts have encouraged investors to acquire XRP at lower prices . FeFe extends this guidance by highlighting silver as a complementary asset with parallel growth potential. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Investors monitoring the digital asset’s performance have seen strong adoption trends in recent years. The token’s utility within financial systems and cross-border payment networks has attracted attention from institutions and retail participants. This ongoing adoption, combined with the potential for rapid price appreciation, makes the case for strategic accumulation even more compelling. What’s Next for XRP? The fourfold increase referenced by FeFe would place XRP at $8.28. Market activity and historical comparisons suggest that such growth is possible if favorable conditions persist. Analysts remain attentive to patterns that signal readiness for a breakout, with many citing XRP’s current positioning as supportive of a significant upward move .

The metal remains close to record territory following weeks of strong performance that placed it among the top-performing precious metals. Prices have stayed elevated despite sharp intraday swings. That resilience keeps silver firmly in focus. Is the market preparing for another leg higher? Schiff Flags Strength Despite Pullbacks Precious metals investor Peter Schiff highlighted renewed strength across mining stocks after an early sell-off tied to a pullback in gold and silver. He noted that many miners closed the session with solid gains even as gold ended down more than $30 and silver fell over $3 intraday. Schiff stated that he expects a strong rally in the coming week. His comments reinforced attention on silver’s broader trend rather than short-term price noise. Schiff also reiterated his long-standing skepticism toward Bitcoin’s performance, urging investors to focus on precious metals instead. According to prior comments reported by Coinpaper, Schiff described the current phase as the early stage of what he called a historic bull market in precious metals. Drivers Behind Silver’s Recent Surge Silver has posted sharp gains after stabilizing above the $80 psychological level. Earlier trading sessions saw the metal near $83.59, close to its previous all-time high of $85.94, before momentum carried prices higher. Over the past year, silver prices have risen roughly 160%, supported by a mix of macroeconomic and sector-specific forces. Source: X Geopolitical uncertainty continues to support safe-haven demand. At the same time, expectations for U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts remain a key factor. Markets continue to price in potential easing during 2026, with upcoming labor and inflation data set to guide expectations. A weaker dollar has also supported precious metals pricing. Industrial demand plays a growing role. Silver remains critical for electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and electronics manufacturing. That structural demand contrasts with purely speculative flows and adds depth to the current rally. Market Reaction to Global Events Recent geopolitical developments added another layer to market behavior. U.S. military intervention in Venezuela and the capture of President Nicolás Maduro did not trigger a traditional flight to safety. Instead, stocks, Bitcoin, and precious metals all advanced. This unusual alignment suggested a short-term “rally across the board,” reflecting broad risk appetite rather than fear-driven flows alone. Meanwhile, the CME has prepared for potential market stress by implementing updated margin rules as volatility across precious metals increased. Those measures signal heightened awareness of rapid price movements as silver trades near historic levels. Can Silver Reach $100 per Ounce? The $100 level remains a key psychological target. In the near term, geopolitical risks linked to Venezuela continue to support safe-haven demand. President Donald Trump has indicated that further military actions remain possible if U.S. demands go unmet, keeping uncertainty elevated. From a longer-term perspective, lower interest rates would favor non-yielding assets such as silver by reducing opportunity costs. Continued industrial demand, combined with constrained mining supply, could support higher prices. For silver to reach or exceed $100, sustained physical demand, steady investment flows, and limited supply response would need to align. More extreme scenarios, such as runaway inflation, financial instability, or a genuine physical shortage, could push prices well beyond that level. Analysts continue to monitor the balance between paper markets and physical availability. Technical Structure Supports Near-Term Upside Short-term technical analysis shows silver holding above key demand levels . On lower timeframes, market structure has shifted bullish, with prices remaining above the $88.60 zone. Analysts tracking these levels point to potential upside targets near $91.80 and $93.00 if support holds. Pullbacks continue to appear corrective rather than trend-breaking.
