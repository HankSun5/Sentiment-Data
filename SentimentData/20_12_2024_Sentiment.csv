Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 22:38:00

Table of Contents The all-sports meme token with potential Dogecoin Shiba Inu Conclusion As cryptocurrencies reach new peaks and the bull run accelerates, traders are looking beyond Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for fresh opportunities. A rising star is capturing attention, promising potential that established meme coins might no longer offer. Introducing XYZVerse, an all-sport meme coin looking to unite fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports within a dynamic ecosystem with the potential to outperform previous successes. The all-sports meme token with potential Think of XYZ as an exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. It’s the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where savvy investors can cash in on the growing synergy between meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. Imagine the energy of Polymarket’s $1 billion trading volume during the U.S. presidential election with the viral appeal of meme coins and the excitement of sports fandom. With millions of fans gearing up to participate, the XYZVerse ecosystem is primed for explosive growth. Meme coins are dominating the crypto space in 2024 and XYZ could lead the pack.

You might also like: XYZ and DOGE prices to soar if BTC touches $150k: 2025 could be massive Dogecoin Dogecoin has seen significant changes, with its price increasing by 207.62% in the past six months. However, in the past week, its price dipped by 16.81%, indicating short-term volatility. The current price ranges between $0.35 and $0.42, hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.38 and $0.40. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.39, suggesting the coin is not overbought and may have the potential to rise. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.004012, but close to zero, which could point to a possible upward shift soon. If Dogecoin moves past the nearest resistance level at $0.51, it might reach the second resistance at $0.62, which would be an increase of around 34%. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $0.31, it could drop to the next support at $0.21, a decrease of about 41%. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge where the price might head next. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by about 20%. Looking at the last six months, SHIB’s price surged by nearly 42%, highlighting its strong growth over a longer period. The recent weekly dip might suggest a short-term correction. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 34.51, which is approaching oversold territory. This could signal a potential rebound in price soon. The Stochastic value is 23.71, also indicating possible undervaluation. SHIB is currently trading between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00003614. If the price breaks this level, it could see gains of around 13%. The nearest support level is at $0.00002006. Falling below this could lead to a decline of approximately 16%.

This surprise move lit a fire under selling across all altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) being hit hardest and crashing -26%, breaking its 40-day trendline too. Conversely, Altura ($ALU) displayed outstanding strength, remaining locked into a bullish falling wedge pattern, a technical pattern that often leads to a reversal upward. Render ($RENDER) Faces Dramatic Decline After Bitcoin’s Tumble Render’s large crash is due to Bitcoin overnight tanking. That penetration below the psychological level of $100,000 triggered panic and heavy selling pressure. For Render, it meant losing an important support level that had supported its recent uptrend. Render's price action is an indicator of investor indecision and reflects an oversold condition. However, any chance of a recovery ultimately prevents the token from regaining ground and retaking its trendline support. Altura ($ALU) Remains In Bullish Formation Even with the market volatility, Altura has stayed in an attractive technical setup. The falling wedge pattern in the token's position indicates a bullish breakout. This pattern develops when the price of an asset declines within an increasingly tighter range, often resulting in an eventual upward breakout. Source: Tradingview Altura ($ALU): What You Need to Know - Altura has been resilient against potential downturns, holding near its key support zones.- A falling wedge pattern provides a positive outlook with Altura well on track for a bounce.- If Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura could significantly benefit from bullish sentiment. How Altura ($ALU) Keeps Giving Reasons to Pay Attention Altura has weathered volatility with unflappability that speaks to its unique appeal and strong fundamentals. Here are some of the underlying factors that led to its bullish sentiment: Bullish Technical Pattern: The falling wedge setup strengthens confidence in a potential breakout. Unique Use Case: The common ranging of blockchain-based gaming solutions with tokenized in-game assets makes Altura a good potential long-term investment. Supportive User Base: A robust community strengthens the token’s ecosystem and ensures ongoing interest. Future Price Prediction for Render ($RENDER) and Altura ($ALU) Render ($RENDER): Keep an eye out for price stabilization. If the token manages to regain its 40-day trendline while neutralizing its oversold status, we could expect a rebound. Altura ($ALU): The line at the top of the falling wedge is the one traders should pay attention to. A breakout from this pattern would trigger a big upward momentum, confirming Altura's bullish trend. Conclusion: The recent market crash has taken a toll on altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) suffering significant losses. However, Altura ($ALU) stands out with its bullish pattern and strong fundamentals, making it a compelling asset to watch. As Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura's breakout potential positions it as a frontrunner in the event of a market rally. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Following the 2021 cycle pattern, where Bitcoin rose 40% above its moving averages, the peak price would reach around $339,000, according to the report.

Australian computer scientist Craig Wright has been handed a one-year sentence, suspended for two years, for filing a $1.2 trillion lawsuit against the payments firm Block. The judge says Wright violated a previous court order designed to keep him from filing further legal actions. The suspended sentence essentially means Wright would avoid jail if he meets certain conditions and does not commit another offense, although the judge noted Wright is living abroad in Asia and is likely not within jurisdiction of the court. Earlier this year, a UK judge ruled that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Wright is neither Satoshi nor the author of the Bitcoin white paper after he was sued by the nonprofit crypto advocacy group Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) for filing frivolous lawsuits against Bitcoin developers. In November, COPA went on to claim that Wright violated an injunction by filing a lawsuit against Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s payments firm. According to the report, the injunction was set in place to prevent Wright from filing BTC-related lawsuits on the grounds that he is Satoshi and Judge James Mellor found Wright to be in contempt of court following a hearing Wednesday.

Two days ago on the social media platform X, the top US-based crypto exchange platform said it had added Parcl ( PARCL ), a decentralized exchange (DEX) that lets users trade and invest in real estate using synthetic assets without the need to physically own any property. Synthetic assets are tokenized, blockchain-based representations of real-world assets, such as securities and real property that can easily be swapped. News of the addition caused the token to dip in price as it went from a peak of $0.586 on December 17th to a low of $0.408 just two days later. PARCL is trading for $0.418 a time of writing, a 9% decrease during the last 24 hours. On December 15th, Coinbase added PARCL to its listing roadmap, signaling at the time that it was going to add support soon. At that time, the crypto exchange’s announcement triggered a 50% rally of the altcoin as it was moving for just $0.33 on December 10th. PARCL aims to provide traders with global city indexes – including major cities such as New York, Miami Beach, San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dubai – and allow them to acquire tokens that represent a stake in a specific index.

The latest $1.53 billion investment brings MARA’s total holdings to 44,394 BTC. At the current spot price of $100,151 per Bitcoin, the company’s holdings are valued at approximately $4.45 billion. The firm currently ranks second on the list of publicly traded companies with the largest BTC holdings globally. MARA has said the purchase was enabled by the $1.925 billion in proceeds from two offerings of 0% convertible senior notes, announced in late November and early December. This calculated move is similar to a strategy employed and popularized by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor involving large-scale BTC accumulation. According to Saylor, it’s a matter of time before MARA Holdings enters the Nasdaq 100 index. MARA seizes opportunity to buy Bitcoin after Federal Reserve Chair’s remarks MARA’s timing is interesting. They announced this purchase just a day after Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, stated that the central bank couldn’t own Bitcoin. Furthermore, the purchase coincided with a fall in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin plunged by 5.6% during Wednesday’s session, testing levels below the $100,000 mark. This marked the largest single-day drop since August 5. The fall was preceded by a wider sell-off sparked by the Fed’s hawkish comments about the interest rate trajectory and how it may possibly drop in 2025. For a brief period, Bitcoin seemed poised to surpass the $100k milestone. However, two factors contributed to its pullback: Powell’s remarks served as a major catalyst, and lingering skepticism about Bitcoin’s viability as a reserve asset added to the downward pressure. Bitcoin Miners boost reserves by purchasing on the open market Bitcoin miners are beginning to purchase Bitcoin on the open market. Hut 8 (HUT) is one of the latest Bitcoin miners to do so. Other dominant miners include MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings. The Miami-based Hut 8 announced on Thursday that it had purchased 990 BTC at an average price of $101,710 each. The acquisition increased its Bitcoin reserves to 10,096 BTC, with a total value of around $1 billion. The firm, after the latest acquisition, appears among the top ten largest corporate Bitcoin holders. The current rush for Bitcoin by miner firms is an indication of progress. Soon, these firms will control large percentages of cryptocurrency, thus, raising their market influence and overall valuation.

According to a Reuters report, geothermal energy startups are on the increase as big tech firms are looking at feeding their power-intensive data centers. Despite this surge, long-term investments in the sector remain uncertain as oil majors double down on gas. Simply put, geothermal energy is heat energy from the earth. Geothermal energy startups increased in the last two years According to Bryant Jones, the executive director for the industry association Geothermal Rising, the environment has been improving lately, in terms of ease of doing business which has seen more than 60 startups spring to life in the last two years. “Texas is becoming the ‘place to be’ for geothermal exploration and development across the board,” said Matt Welch at the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance (TxGEA). “Much of this is due to an abundance of identified geothermal resources, 1-stop shopping permitting process, and our regulatory certainty.” Welch. According to an industry report published last year, at least 10 of the geothermal startups launched between 2016 and 2022 in the US were headquartered in Texas. Now, the obtaining lower commodity prices might encourage more shale companies to diversify their revenue streams and tap into geothermal power. The Enhanced Geothermal Shot analysis in 2022 confirmed the potential for more geothermal electricity generating capacity – 90 gigawatts by 2050. These developments also come as AI data centers have emerged as high-energy consumers, forcing big techs to look elsewhere for alternative energy sources to keep their data centers running with sufficient and sustainable power. “We believe geothermal, along with abundant natural gas, can be part of the all-of-the-above energy mix we need to meet the demand,” said Trey Lowe, chief technology officer at U.S. shale gas producer Devon Energy (DVN.N), an investor in geothermal startup Fervo Energy. Big techs back the geothermal energy startups According to a Reuters report, social media giant, Meta and search engine giant Google rank among the tech firms that are partnering with these startup companies offering to produce geothermal electricity, to power their data centers. The report further highlights that geothermal energy has been promoted as a faster way to generate carbon-free power compared to nuclear and without the intermittency of wind and solar. However, the new startups do not have it easy as they face high upfront costs, especially for drilling coupled with long project approval times. These high costs have dampened the initial zeal, with limited investment so far, analysts estimate just over $700 million in financing as been contributed to overall geothermal power projects since 2020. But the sector is also receiving bipartisan interest with the CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passing the House and now awaiting Senate approval. If these become law, this will, according to Reuters, make it easier to set up geothermal projects across the US. The sector is receiving increased bipartisan interest as well. The CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passed the House and are awaiting Senate approval. If they become law, it would make it easier to set up geothermal projects in the country. Now, top shale oil producers Chevron, Diamondback Energy, and Exxon Mobil have started advocating for gas as the mainstay fuel for electric power, offering to work with utilities to add to their power plants with carbon sequestration that generates greenhouse emissions. “In general, (there is) a lot more interest from smaller oil and gas producers as well as service companies … we’ve talked to Chevron and Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab but the supermajors seem to be taking more of a wait-and-watch view,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, which is developing energy storage and geothermal baseload technologies deep in the earth. According to Reuters, Sage recently completed a $30 million fundraising which was led by Expand Energy – a US shale gas producer. The company plans to launch the Series B round in January. Colorado-based Gradient Geothermal -which generates geothermal energy using existing oil and gas infrastructure – announced it was providing Chord Energy services to help generate power at one of its oil and gas in North Dakota. Johanna Ostrum, Gradient CEO said most mid-size and smaller independent energy firms were interested in geothermal energy for their own needs, not to create electricity for resale.

We must take a comprehensive, clear stance on taxes, regulations, and cybersecurity before the Trump administration takes office.” Japanese Minister of Digital Affairs Takuya Hirai Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to reporters on the death of Tsuneo Watanabe, editor-in-chief of The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, describing him as a “great Journalist.” https://t.co/4FTHqGOZMo — The Japan News (@The_Japan_News) December 19, 2024 Experts think Tokyo wants to cement any new changes in Japan’s cryptocurrency policy by the time Trump takes office. These changes could include tax reform, in addition to new regulations and cybersecurity laws. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society forms policy recommendations for the government’s consideration. However, Ishiba’s office is under no obligation to accept or incorporate these recommendations. Indeed, in recent weeks, the Prime Minister refused to commit to tax reform or the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs in Japan. Ishiba has appointed lawmakers known to be in favor of crypto reform to ministerial positions . He also mentioned blockchain technology in his election manifesto. However, voices outside the LDP have also called for “urgent” reform. Opposition leaders have also warned repeatedly that capital is flowing out of the country as a result of an “unfair” taxation system for crypto investors. Japan's central bank kept its monetary policy settings steady, signaling it sees little urgency to raise interest rates for now https://t.co/xYQANqP0nF — Bloomberg (@business) December 19, 2024 While many other nations charge traders flat capital gains taxes at rates of about 20%, Japan’s tax rules instead oblige crypto traders to declare their crypto profits on their annual income tax declarations. They must file crypto trading profits under “other income.” And that means that the nation’s highest earners can end up paying up to 55% on their crypto trading revenues. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society said its proposal was of “urgent” importance. On X, Hirai wrote that the LDP had been working on crypto legislation “faster” than any party “in the world.” The post Japan’s Ruling Party Still Pushing for Crypto Tax Reform Despite PM’s Caution appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-19 23:30:00

Here’s the nearest on-chain level that the asset would end up retesting if the drawdown elongates. 1 Week To 1 Month Bitcoin Holders Have Their Realized Price At $97,900 As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old BTC investors is the closest support for the asset right now. Related Reading: Secret Bitcoin Driver: Exchanges Receiving $40 Million USDT Fuel Per Day The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition price of the average holder on the Bitcoin network. When the metric’s value is lower than the spot price of the cryptocurrency, it means the investors as a whole can be considered to be holding a net amount of profit. On the other hand, it being under the BTC value suggests the dominance of loss in the market. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a particular segment of the sector is of interest: the 1-week to 1-month-old holders. This cohort includes the addresses that have been holding their coins for at least one week and, at most, one month. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the Realized Price of this Bitcoin group has changed over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old Bitcoin investors has been climbing up alongside the price rally. This is naturally due to the fact that the cohort’s cost basis has been getting repriced to higher levels as new investors have been purchasing at the rally highs. Currently, the indicator’s value sits at $97,900, so these investors would be in profit at the current price. Earlier in the past day, however, the asset came dangerously close to retesting the level as its price saw a brief dip below $99,000. The 1 week to 1 month old investors make up a section of a larger cohort known as the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs are broadly defined as the holders who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell. So, the STHs, and especially the 1-week to 1-month-old segment, would contain the holders with the least amount of resolve in the sector, owing to their low holding time. Because of how fickle they are, the STHs generally show some kind of reaction whenever their average cost basis gets retested by the Bitcoin price. This reaction may come in the form of buying when the retest occurs from above, as these holders could believe the decline to be just a ‘dip.’ As such, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old STHs, which is below the current price, could be looked at as a support level for the cryptocurrency. The level has also already helped the asset out once this month.

With the market constantly evolving, some coins are capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike with groundbreaking innovations and extraordinary potential. VeChain and Fantom are making waves with their recent developments. However, a unique contender, Qubetics ($TICS), is leading the charge with its remarkable presale performance and advanced Web3 solutions. While VeChain has just secured an innovative patent, and Fantom is gearing up for a transformative upgrade, Qubetics is stealing the spotlight. Packed with massive potential for returns, its presale generates significant buzz in the crypto community. This article will cover all three coins’ latest updates and developments—Qubetics, VeChain, and Fantom. Qubetics: Transforming Privacy with Its Decentralised VPN Service What if the internet could be accessed without the risks of surveillance or censorship? As part of its comprehensive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that’s set to redefine online privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPN providers that can log and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN leverages a peer-to-peer network powered by blockchain technology. This ensures user traffic remains entirely decentralised and free from centralised control. The dVPN offers more than just anonymity—it brings transparency and resistance to censorship. Its multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption protect user identities while providing secure, unrestricted internet access. Moreover, the innovative tokenised incentive structure rewards users who contribute bandwidth with $TICS tokens, making the network self-sustaining and encouraging active participation. Adding to the excitement, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to engage with its growing community, answering critical questions and showcasing the platform’s potential. With its cutting-edge features and interactive approach, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to join today . VeChain’s Breakthrough: Secure Data Handling with a New Patent VeChain continues to solidify its position as a leader in enterprise-focused blockchain solutions. The company recently secured a U.S. patent, approved on 17 December 2024, for a groundbreaking system to enhance data security. This patent leverages a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and securely split transaction keys, significantly improving secure data handling capabilities. The innovative key management system (KMS) outlined in the patent enables businesses to safeguard sensitive information effectively. With these advancements, VeChain is reinforcing its role as a pioneer in enterprise blockchain technology, setting new standards in security and reliability. Fantom’s Sonic Mainnet: A Game-Changer in Performance and Scalability Fantom (FTM) is on the rise, surging 16% on 15 December in anticipation of its rebranding and the rollout of the Sonic mainnet. This major upgrade boosts network efficiency, making Fantom faster and more cost-effective. As part of the update, FTM tokens will transition to Sonic (S) through a 1:1 swap, which has sparked considerable excitement among investors. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicate increased demand and positive inflows, supporting Fantom’s bullish trajectory. With support levels firmly established at $1.2, analysts are eyeing resistance points at $1.6 and potentially $2.38, making Fantom a compelling choice for growth-focused investors. Presale Spotlight: Why Qubetics Is the Talk of the Crypto World Investors seeking high returns focus on the Qubetics presale, currently in Phase 13. Each phase witnesses a 10% price increase, with the final stage set to jump by 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.034, and the project has already raised over $7.2 million. Analysts predict that once the mainnet launches, $TICS could soar to between $10 and $15 per token. Imagine investing today and reaping an ROI of over 29,000% if the price hits $10, or an astonishing 43,000% if it climbs to $15. These numbers are no mere speculation—Qubetics has already demonstrated immense traction, proving why it’s one of the best cryptos to join today. The structured price hikes add urgency for investors to act swiftly, securing their position in this promising project before the next phase increases token costs. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads the Pack in Crypto Innovation The crypto market is brimming with potential, and coins like VeChain and Fantom are making commendable strides with their latest updates. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a game-changer, combining innovative Web3 solutions with an electrifying presale that promises exceptional returns. Analysts’ predictions of staggering ROIs and the platform’s robust community engagement make it one of the best cryptos to join today. Don’t miss the chance to be part of Qubetics’ transformative journey. With the presale progressing rapidly, now is the time to act and secure your stake in what could be the next big thing in crypto.

After briefly retesting $99,000, Bitcoin’s price momentum has slowed, raising questions about whether this signals the start of a larger sell-off or a temporary pause in its uptrend. Analysts Highlight BTC Price Key Levels Crypto trader Ali Charts has put a lot of emphasis on the $96,000 level. He explained that if Bitcoin price moves below this level, the following significant points will be $90,000 and $85,000. This view is consistent with the historical Fibonacci levels of retrace commonly employed by traders to understand market reversals. “Keeping it simple, based on the Fib, if Bitcoin loses $96,000, the next focus becomes $90,000 and $85,000,” Ali tweeted. To this, Robert Kiyosaki , a supporter of Bitcoin, said that it is never too late to join the market. He pointed to Bitcoin’s stability and capability to generate riches, saying, “Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich, including those who come in late. Just don’t get greedy.” Long-Term Holders Take Profits as Short-Term Investors Step In Using data from Glassnode, some changes have been observed in the activity of long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs). In the two months period, the total supply held by LTHs has been decreasing from $14.23 billion to $13.31 billion. This comes as BTC price soared from $58,000 to over $100,000 suggesting that institutional investors are booking profits at local highs. However, these sales by the long-term holders have been taken by the short-term holders (STHs) to ensure that the prices are maintained. Glassnode analysts pointed out that “the share of wealth owned by new investors has not yet reached the levels that were seen during the previous cycle peaks” which may mean that there is still some room for growth. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Remains Intact However, based on the correction, some analysts continue to hold the view that the price of Bitcoin is still bullish. The AVIV Ratio, which looks at unrealized profits, is at 1.81, far from the levels that are considered extremely high and which usually signify a reversal in market trends. This means that although some traders may have taken their profits, the market has not become overly aggressive. Meanwhile, the Titan of Crypto still has the positive outlook about Bitcoin’s future. He stressed that Bitcoin has been making higher highs and higher lows which is a positive indication that the trend remains bullish. ”BTC bullish momentum remains strong, with the next target at the 100% Fibonacci extension of $113,000,” he stated. Institutional Demand Could Propel Bitcoin Further The adoption of Bitcoin has remained strong, with Bitcoin ETFs hitting a top of $37 billion in assets by December 19th. This represents a sharp rise from the $24.23 billion at the beginning of November as highlighted by Farside Investors. At the same time, statistics show that at the peak of Bitcoin at $108,000, 62.17% of traders had short positions, expecting the price to fall. However, as Bitcoin dropped to $96,000, the sentiment changed as 55.44% of the traders are now bullish because they anticipate a rally in the price of the cryptocurrency. Supporting this price trend, analysts at Bitfinex believe that the price correction of Bitcoin will be relatively mild owing to the rising demand from institutional investors. They expect it to be at $145,000 by mid-2025, with a possibility of rising to $200,000 in a better environment. Furthermore, in light of the growing talk about the potential of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset at the national level, experts estimate that such a decision could take Bitcoin’s price to $1 million.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 23:57:00

Crypto All-Stars has wrapped up a stellar presale with a $22.64 million haul, solidifying its position as a meme coin powerhouse. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the show with its presale, which has already surpassed $4.2 million in Stage 12. On the flip side, Mog Coin (MOG), once hailed as a meme coin with promise, is struggling to hold its ground amid bearish market conditions. Meme coins have grown beyond being internet jokes. They now represent a unique blend of community power, creative use cases, and, of course, the potential for exponential profits. BTFD Coin is leading this new wave of meme coin evolution with its P2E game, lucrative referral program, staking rewards, and a vibrant community. Let’s dive into why BTFD, Crypto All-Stars, and Mog Coin are the most talked-about meme coins right now and which of them stands out as the best for exponential returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Rising Star in Meme Coins BTFD Coin has taken the meme coin world by storm, and it’s easy to see why. Starting at an initial price of $0.000004, the coin has climbed to $0.00013 in Stage 12 of its presale. With over 57 billion coins sold and $4.2 million raised so far, the numbers speak for themselves. With just four stages left, the presale momentum is building rapidly, and the coin’s listing price of $0.0006 promises substantial short-term returns. BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its presale. Its P2E game offers an engaging way for users to earn rewards, while the referral program incentivises community growth by rewarding users for bringing in new investors. Add in the 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got a project that caters to both gamers and crypto enthusiasts looking for passive income. Here’s an investment scenario to paint the picture. If you invest $30,000 in Stage 12 at $0.00013 per coin, you’d acquire approximately 230.7 million BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would grow to $138,420. That’s the kind of growth that has investors flocking to the project. Why is BTFD one of the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its explosive crypto presale , innovative features, and strong community backing make it a top choice for investors looking to capitalise on the meme coin trend. With the price increasing at every stage, now’s the time to jump in. Crypto All-Stars (STARS): The MemeVault Revolution Crypto All-Stars has already proven itself as a meme coin heavyweight. Its presale, which concluded with $22.64 million raised, set the stage for the launch of its groundbreaking MemeVault—a platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins, including PEPE, Dogecoin, and Floki, under one roof. This innovation has brought a sense of unity to the meme coin community, making $STARS a must-have token for enthusiasts. The $STARS token, priced at $0.0016782 during the presale, comes with lucrative staking rewards of up to 1429% APY. This high return has attracted both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. By reducing the circulating supply through staking incentives, Crypto All-Stars creates scarcity, which often leads to price surges once the token is listed. With the $STARS token set to launch on Uniswap next week, anticipation is building. Early adopters are expected to see substantial gains as more meme coin holders flock to the platform. The MemeVault itself is a game-changer, offering a streamlined way to manage and stake meme coins while earning rewards. Why does $STARS rank among the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its successful presale, innovative staking platform, and upcoming launch make it a strong contender for both short-term and long-term gains. For those who missed the presale, the token launch presents a second chance to get in on the action. Mog Coin (MOG): A Meme Coin Facing Challenges Mog Coin (MOG) entered the scene with a lot of promise, leveraging its quirky branding and strong community backing. However, recent market conditions have posed significant challenges. Once a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts, MOG is now battling bearish pressure that has left its performance lagging behind competitors like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars. MOG’s initial appeal lay in its community-driven initiatives and its potential to carve out a niche in the meme coin space. However, the lack of new developments and a clear roadmap has made it difficult for the project to sustain its early momentum. While the coin still has a loyal following, its price movements have been lacklustre, leaving investors cautious. For MOG to regain its footing, it needs a fresh narrative or a major update to its ecosystem. Without these, it risks falling further behind in a market that thrives on innovation and community engagement. While some investors are holding on in the hope of a turnaround, others are shifting their focus to projects like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars, which offer clearer paths to exponential profits. Why does MOG make this list? Its initial success and strong community give it a place among notable meme coins, but its current struggles highlight the importance of staying ahead in a competitive market. For now, MOG is a speculative play rather than a reliable choice for significant returns. The Concluding Remarks: What Are the Best Meme Coins for Exponential Growth Next Year? Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market offers a wealth of opportunities for investors seeking exponential profits. BTFD Coin is the best meme coin for exponential profits, thanks to its stellar presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support. A $30,000 investment in Stage 12 could grow to $138,420 by the end of the presale, showcasing its immense potential. Crypto All-Stars is another standout, with its MemeVault innovation and successful presale setting the stage for substantial gains. While Mog Coin has its merits, its current challenges make it a riskier option compared to its competitors. If you’re ready to capitalise on these opportunities, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin meme coin presale today and position yourself for exponential profits in the ever-evolving meme coin market. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing in crypto.

The video included a disclaimer suggesting there’s no guarantee the cap won’t be altered. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is a cornerstone of its value as a store of wealth, and any change could fundamentally impact its perception among investors. In the video, BlackRock highlighted Bitcoin’s 21 million cap, noting it as a “hard-coded rule” that controls supply, purchasing power, and prevents excessive currency creation. However, the disclaimer stated: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor reposted the video, sparking criticism. Joel Valenzuela, Dashpay’s marketing director, commented, “When the supply cap increase happens, it will have ‘always been part of the plan.’ And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say Bitcoin wasn’t hijacked.” Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis added, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Is Bitcoin’s Supply Cap Changeable? Bitcoin developer Super Testnet, known for BitVM, explained that altering Bitcoin’s supply cap would depend on how one defines “Bitcoin.” In theory, the cap could change if a majority of the community—node operators, developers, miners, and investors—reached consensus on a hard fork. Such a change would involve a proposal to gauge consensus, followed by implementing changes in Bitcoin Core. If most node operators and miners adopted the new fork, it would create a “new” Bitcoin network with an uncapped supply. However, Super Testnet argued that this new chain wouldn’t truly be Bitcoin. “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” they said. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” In essence, an uncapped version wouldn’t be Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FORKS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 00:36:00

The SEC is reviewing these products to ensure whether they follow regulations and protect investors. This move helps bring digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem by preventing from frauds. Nasdaq and Cboe BZX Exchange crypto index ETF Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange changed their rules for listing and trading with exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to spot bitcoin and ether ETF. Nasdaq intends to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, while the Cboe BZX Exchange aims to introduce the Franklin Crypto Index ETF. These ETPs will directly hold spot bitcoin and ether and cash equivalents. The goal of listing these assets on the exchanges is to increase their accessibility. SEC’s Role in Regulating The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is reviewing these listings according to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which sets rules for trading securities on exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe BZX, for ensuring fairness and transparency. The Securities Act of 1933 regulates how securities are issued and required proper disclosures to protect investors on Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange. The Investment Company Act of 1940 governs investment products like ETFs to ensure they follow rules that protect investors. In addition to this, The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) regulates financial products linked to bitcoin and ether as commodities. The proposed Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act could shape future cryptocurrency regulations to ensure safe investment practices. The SEC believes that the proposed rule changes meet these requirements, especially those to prevent fraud and market manipulation. Additionally, the Commission emphasizes the necessity of surveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges to detect fraudulent activities and maintain market integrity. To minimize the risk of market manipulation, the SEC investigates how the spot markets for assets like bitcoin and ether that are correlated with their futures markets. In previous approvals for Bitcoin and Ether-based ETPs, the SEC confirmed that price movements in spot markets which closely reflected in futures markets. This correlation indicates that if manipulation or fraud occurs in the spot market, it is more like an evident in the futures market, which is easier to monitor. The CME’s bitcoin and ether futures markets have exhibited strong correlations with their spot markets, giving the SEC confidence that these new ETFs can be effectively supervised. The SEC has decided that the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and the Franklin Crypto Index ETF follow all necessary rules. These products are in line with past approvals of similar bitcoin and ether-based investment products. By introducing these new ETPs, investors will have access to spot bitcoin and ether in a regulated environment, which enhances security and transparency in their cryptocurrency investments. This approval is an important step in bringing digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem, with the help of SEC.
