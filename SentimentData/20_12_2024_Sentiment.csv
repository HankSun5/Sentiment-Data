Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 22:38:00

Table of Contents The all-sports meme token with potential Dogecoin Shiba Inu Conclusion As cryptocurrencies reach new peaks and the bull run accelerates, traders are looking beyond Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for fresh opportunities. A rising star is capturing attention, promising potential that established meme coins might no longer offer. Introducing XYZVerse, an all-sport meme coin looking to unite fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports within a dynamic ecosystem with the potential to outperform previous successes. The all-sports meme token with potential Think of XYZ as an exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. It’s the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where savvy investors can cash in on the growing synergy between meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. Imagine the energy of Polymarket’s $1 billion trading volume during the U.S. presidential election with the viral appeal of meme coins and the excitement of sports fandom. With millions of fans gearing up to participate, the XYZVerse ecosystem is primed for explosive growth. Meme coins are dominating the crypto space in 2024 and XYZ could lead the pack.

You might also like: XYZ and DOGE prices to soar if BTC touches $150k: 2025 could be massive Dogecoin Dogecoin has seen significant changes, with its price increasing by 207.62% in the past six months. However, in the past week, its price dipped by 16.81%, indicating short-term volatility. The current price ranges between $0.35 and $0.42, hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.38 and $0.40. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.39, suggesting the coin is not overbought and may have the potential to rise. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.004012, but close to zero, which could point to a possible upward shift soon. If Dogecoin moves past the nearest resistance level at $0.51, it might reach the second resistance at $0.62, which would be an increase of around 34%. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $0.31, it could drop to the next support at $0.21, a decrease of about 41%. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge where the price might head next. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by about 20%. Looking at the last six months, SHIB’s price surged by nearly 42%, highlighting its strong growth over a longer period. The recent weekly dip might suggest a short-term correction. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 34.51, which is approaching oversold territory. This could signal a potential rebound in price soon. The Stochastic value is 23.71, also indicating possible undervaluation. SHIB is currently trading between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00003614. If the price breaks this level, it could see gains of around 13%. The nearest support level is at $0.00002006. Falling below this could lead to a decline of approximately 16%.

This surprise move lit a fire under selling across all altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) being hit hardest and crashing -26%, breaking its 40-day trendline too. Conversely, Altura ($ALU) displayed outstanding strength, remaining locked into a bullish falling wedge pattern, a technical pattern that often leads to a reversal upward. Render ($RENDER) Faces Dramatic Decline After Bitcoin’s Tumble Render’s large crash is due to Bitcoin overnight tanking. That penetration below the psychological level of $100,000 triggered panic and heavy selling pressure. For Render, it meant losing an important support level that had supported its recent uptrend. Render's price action is an indicator of investor indecision and reflects an oversold condition. However, any chance of a recovery ultimately prevents the token from regaining ground and retaking its trendline support. Altura ($ALU) Remains In Bullish Formation Even with the market volatility, Altura has stayed in an attractive technical setup. The falling wedge pattern in the token's position indicates a bullish breakout. This pattern develops when the price of an asset declines within an increasingly tighter range, often resulting in an eventual upward breakout. Source: Tradingview Altura ($ALU): What You Need to Know - Altura has been resilient against potential downturns, holding near its key support zones.- A falling wedge pattern provides a positive outlook with Altura well on track for a bounce.- If Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura could significantly benefit from bullish sentiment. How Altura ($ALU) Keeps Giving Reasons to Pay Attention Altura has weathered volatility with unflappability that speaks to its unique appeal and strong fundamentals. Here are some of the underlying factors that led to its bullish sentiment: Bullish Technical Pattern: The falling wedge setup strengthens confidence in a potential breakout. Unique Use Case: The common ranging of blockchain-based gaming solutions with tokenized in-game assets makes Altura a good potential long-term investment. Supportive User Base: A robust community strengthens the token’s ecosystem and ensures ongoing interest. Future Price Prediction for Render ($RENDER) and Altura ($ALU) Render ($RENDER): Keep an eye out for price stabilization. If the token manages to regain its 40-day trendline while neutralizing its oversold status, we could expect a rebound. Altura ($ALU): The line at the top of the falling wedge is the one traders should pay attention to. A breakout from this pattern would trigger a big upward momentum, confirming Altura's bullish trend. Conclusion: The recent market crash has taken a toll on altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) suffering significant losses. However, Altura ($ALU) stands out with its bullish pattern and strong fundamentals, making it a compelling asset to watch. As Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura's breakout potential positions it as a frontrunner in the event of a market rally. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Following the 2021 cycle pattern, where Bitcoin rose 40% above its moving averages, the peak price would reach around $339,000, according to the report.

Australian computer scientist Craig Wright has been handed a one-year sentence, suspended for two years, for filing a $1.2 trillion lawsuit against the payments firm Block. The judge says Wright violated a previous court order designed to keep him from filing further legal actions. The suspended sentence essentially means Wright would avoid jail if he meets certain conditions and does not commit another offense, although the judge noted Wright is living abroad in Asia and is likely not within jurisdiction of the court. Earlier this year, a UK judge ruled that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Wright is neither Satoshi nor the author of the Bitcoin white paper after he was sued by the nonprofit crypto advocacy group Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) for filing frivolous lawsuits against Bitcoin developers. In November, COPA went on to claim that Wright violated an injunction by filing a lawsuit against Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s payments firm. According to the report, the injunction was set in place to prevent Wright from filing BTC-related lawsuits on the grounds that he is Satoshi and Judge James Mellor found Wright to be in contempt of court following a hearing Wednesday.

Two days ago on the social media platform X, the top US-based crypto exchange platform said it had added Parcl ( PARCL ), a decentralized exchange (DEX) that lets users trade and invest in real estate using synthetic assets without the need to physically own any property. Synthetic assets are tokenized, blockchain-based representations of real-world assets, such as securities and real property that can easily be swapped. News of the addition caused the token to dip in price as it went from a peak of $0.586 on December 17th to a low of $0.408 just two days later. PARCL is trading for $0.418 a time of writing, a 9% decrease during the last 24 hours. On December 15th, Coinbase added PARCL to its listing roadmap, signaling at the time that it was going to add support soon. At that time, the crypto exchange’s announcement triggered a 50% rally of the altcoin as it was moving for just $0.33 on December 10th. PARCL aims to provide traders with global city indexes – including major cities such as New York, Miami Beach, San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dubai – and allow them to acquire tokens that represent a stake in a specific index.

The latest $1.53 billion investment brings MARA’s total holdings to 44,394 BTC. At the current spot price of $100,151 per Bitcoin, the company’s holdings are valued at approximately $4.45 billion. The firm currently ranks second on the list of publicly traded companies with the largest BTC holdings globally. MARA has said the purchase was enabled by the $1.925 billion in proceeds from two offerings of 0% convertible senior notes, announced in late November and early December. This calculated move is similar to a strategy employed and popularized by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor involving large-scale BTC accumulation. According to Saylor, it’s a matter of time before MARA Holdings enters the Nasdaq 100 index. MARA seizes opportunity to buy Bitcoin after Federal Reserve Chair’s remarks MARA’s timing is interesting. They announced this purchase just a day after Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, stated that the central bank couldn’t own Bitcoin. Furthermore, the purchase coincided with a fall in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin plunged by 5.6% during Wednesday’s session, testing levels below the $100,000 mark. This marked the largest single-day drop since August 5. The fall was preceded by a wider sell-off sparked by the Fed’s hawkish comments about the interest rate trajectory and how it may possibly drop in 2025. For a brief period, Bitcoin seemed poised to surpass the $100k milestone. However, two factors contributed to its pullback: Powell’s remarks served as a major catalyst, and lingering skepticism about Bitcoin’s viability as a reserve asset added to the downward pressure. Bitcoin Miners boost reserves by purchasing on the open market Bitcoin miners are beginning to purchase Bitcoin on the open market. Hut 8 (HUT) is one of the latest Bitcoin miners to do so. Other dominant miners include MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings. The Miami-based Hut 8 announced on Thursday that it had purchased 990 BTC at an average price of $101,710 each. The acquisition increased its Bitcoin reserves to 10,096 BTC, with a total value of around $1 billion. The firm, after the latest acquisition, appears among the top ten largest corporate Bitcoin holders. The current rush for Bitcoin by miner firms is an indication of progress. Soon, these firms will control large percentages of cryptocurrency, thus, raising their market influence and overall valuation.

According to a Reuters report, geothermal energy startups are on the increase as big tech firms are looking at feeding their power-intensive data centers. Despite this surge, long-term investments in the sector remain uncertain as oil majors double down on gas. Simply put, geothermal energy is heat energy from the earth. Geothermal energy startups increased in the last two years According to Bryant Jones, the executive director for the industry association Geothermal Rising, the environment has been improving lately, in terms of ease of doing business which has seen more than 60 startups spring to life in the last two years. “Texas is becoming the ‘place to be’ for geothermal exploration and development across the board,” said Matt Welch at the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance (TxGEA). “Much of this is due to an abundance of identified geothermal resources, 1-stop shopping permitting process, and our regulatory certainty.” Welch. According to an industry report published last year, at least 10 of the geothermal startups launched between 2016 and 2022 in the US were headquartered in Texas. Now, the obtaining lower commodity prices might encourage more shale companies to diversify their revenue streams and tap into geothermal power. The Enhanced Geothermal Shot analysis in 2022 confirmed the potential for more geothermal electricity generating capacity – 90 gigawatts by 2050. These developments also come as AI data centers have emerged as high-energy consumers, forcing big techs to look elsewhere for alternative energy sources to keep their data centers running with sufficient and sustainable power. “We believe geothermal, along with abundant natural gas, can be part of the all-of-the-above energy mix we need to meet the demand,” said Trey Lowe, chief technology officer at U.S. shale gas producer Devon Energy (DVN.N), an investor in geothermal startup Fervo Energy. Big techs back the geothermal energy startups According to a Reuters report, social media giant, Meta and search engine giant Google rank among the tech firms that are partnering with these startup companies offering to produce geothermal electricity, to power their data centers. The report further highlights that geothermal energy has been promoted as a faster way to generate carbon-free power compared to nuclear and without the intermittency of wind and solar. However, the new startups do not have it easy as they face high upfront costs, especially for drilling coupled with long project approval times. These high costs have dampened the initial zeal, with limited investment so far, analysts estimate just over $700 million in financing as been contributed to overall geothermal power projects since 2020. But the sector is also receiving bipartisan interest with the CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passing the House and now awaiting Senate approval. If these become law, this will, according to Reuters, make it easier to set up geothermal projects across the US. The sector is receiving increased bipartisan interest as well. The CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passed the House and are awaiting Senate approval. If they become law, it would make it easier to set up geothermal projects in the country. Now, top shale oil producers Chevron, Diamondback Energy, and Exxon Mobil have started advocating for gas as the mainstay fuel for electric power, offering to work with utilities to add to their power plants with carbon sequestration that generates greenhouse emissions. “In general, (there is) a lot more interest from smaller oil and gas producers as well as service companies … we’ve talked to Chevron and Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab but the supermajors seem to be taking more of a wait-and-watch view,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, which is developing energy storage and geothermal baseload technologies deep in the earth. According to Reuters, Sage recently completed a $30 million fundraising which was led by Expand Energy – a US shale gas producer. The company plans to launch the Series B round in January. Colorado-based Gradient Geothermal -which generates geothermal energy using existing oil and gas infrastructure – announced it was providing Chord Energy services to help generate power at one of its oil and gas in North Dakota. Johanna Ostrum, Gradient CEO said most mid-size and smaller independent energy firms were interested in geothermal energy for their own needs, not to create electricity for resale.

We must take a comprehensive, clear stance on taxes, regulations, and cybersecurity before the Trump administration takes office.” Japanese Minister of Digital Affairs Takuya Hirai Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to reporters on the death of Tsuneo Watanabe, editor-in-chief of The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, describing him as a “great Journalist.” https://t.co/4FTHqGOZMo — The Japan News (@The_Japan_News) December 19, 2024 Experts think Tokyo wants to cement any new changes in Japan’s cryptocurrency policy by the time Trump takes office. These changes could include tax reform, in addition to new regulations and cybersecurity laws. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society forms policy recommendations for the government’s consideration. However, Ishiba’s office is under no obligation to accept or incorporate these recommendations. Indeed, in recent weeks, the Prime Minister refused to commit to tax reform or the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs in Japan. Ishiba has appointed lawmakers known to be in favor of crypto reform to ministerial positions . He also mentioned blockchain technology in his election manifesto. However, voices outside the LDP have also called for “urgent” reform. Opposition leaders have also warned repeatedly that capital is flowing out of the country as a result of an “unfair” taxation system for crypto investors. Japan's central bank kept its monetary policy settings steady, signaling it sees little urgency to raise interest rates for now https://t.co/xYQANqP0nF — Bloomberg (@business) December 19, 2024 While many other nations charge traders flat capital gains taxes at rates of about 20%, Japan’s tax rules instead oblige crypto traders to declare their crypto profits on their annual income tax declarations. They must file crypto trading profits under “other income.” And that means that the nation’s highest earners can end up paying up to 55% on their crypto trading revenues. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society said its proposal was of “urgent” importance. On X, Hirai wrote that the LDP had been working on crypto legislation “faster” than any party “in the world.” The post Japan’s Ruling Party Still Pushing for Crypto Tax Reform Despite PM’s Caution appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-19 23:30:00

Here’s the nearest on-chain level that the asset would end up retesting if the drawdown elongates. 1 Week To 1 Month Bitcoin Holders Have Their Realized Price At $97,900 As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old BTC investors is the closest support for the asset right now. Related Reading: Secret Bitcoin Driver: Exchanges Receiving $40 Million USDT Fuel Per Day The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition price of the average holder on the Bitcoin network. When the metric’s value is lower than the spot price of the cryptocurrency, it means the investors as a whole can be considered to be holding a net amount of profit. On the other hand, it being under the BTC value suggests the dominance of loss in the market. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a particular segment of the sector is of interest: the 1-week to 1-month-old holders. This cohort includes the addresses that have been holding their coins for at least one week and, at most, one month. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the Realized Price of this Bitcoin group has changed over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old Bitcoin investors has been climbing up alongside the price rally. This is naturally due to the fact that the cohort’s cost basis has been getting repriced to higher levels as new investors have been purchasing at the rally highs. Currently, the indicator’s value sits at $97,900, so these investors would be in profit at the current price. Earlier in the past day, however, the asset came dangerously close to retesting the level as its price saw a brief dip below $99,000. The 1 week to 1 month old investors make up a section of a larger cohort known as the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs are broadly defined as the holders who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell. So, the STHs, and especially the 1-week to 1-month-old segment, would contain the holders with the least amount of resolve in the sector, owing to their low holding time. Because of how fickle they are, the STHs generally show some kind of reaction whenever their average cost basis gets retested by the Bitcoin price. This reaction may come in the form of buying when the retest occurs from above, as these holders could believe the decline to be just a ‘dip.’ As such, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old STHs, which is below the current price, could be looked at as a support level for the cryptocurrency. The level has also already helped the asset out once this month.

With the market constantly evolving, some coins are capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike with groundbreaking innovations and extraordinary potential. VeChain and Fantom are making waves with their recent developments. However, a unique contender, Qubetics ($TICS), is leading the charge with its remarkable presale performance and advanced Web3 solutions. While VeChain has just secured an innovative patent, and Fantom is gearing up for a transformative upgrade, Qubetics is stealing the spotlight. Packed with massive potential for returns, its presale generates significant buzz in the crypto community. This article will cover all three coins’ latest updates and developments—Qubetics, VeChain, and Fantom. Qubetics: Transforming Privacy with Its Decentralised VPN Service What if the internet could be accessed without the risks of surveillance or censorship? As part of its comprehensive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that’s set to redefine online privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPN providers that can log and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN leverages a peer-to-peer network powered by blockchain technology. This ensures user traffic remains entirely decentralised and free from centralised control. The dVPN offers more than just anonymity—it brings transparency and resistance to censorship. Its multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption protect user identities while providing secure, unrestricted internet access. Moreover, the innovative tokenised incentive structure rewards users who contribute bandwidth with $TICS tokens, making the network self-sustaining and encouraging active participation. Adding to the excitement, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to engage with its growing community, answering critical questions and showcasing the platform’s potential. With its cutting-edge features and interactive approach, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to join today . VeChain’s Breakthrough: Secure Data Handling with a New Patent VeChain continues to solidify its position as a leader in enterprise-focused blockchain solutions. The company recently secured a U.S. patent, approved on 17 December 2024, for a groundbreaking system to enhance data security. This patent leverages a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and securely split transaction keys, significantly improving secure data handling capabilities. The innovative key management system (KMS) outlined in the patent enables businesses to safeguard sensitive information effectively. With these advancements, VeChain is reinforcing its role as a pioneer in enterprise blockchain technology, setting new standards in security and reliability. Fantom’s Sonic Mainnet: A Game-Changer in Performance and Scalability Fantom (FTM) is on the rise, surging 16% on 15 December in anticipation of its rebranding and the rollout of the Sonic mainnet. This major upgrade boosts network efficiency, making Fantom faster and more cost-effective. As part of the update, FTM tokens will transition to Sonic (S) through a 1:1 swap, which has sparked considerable excitement among investors. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicate increased demand and positive inflows, supporting Fantom’s bullish trajectory. With support levels firmly established at $1.2, analysts are eyeing resistance points at $1.6 and potentially $2.38, making Fantom a compelling choice for growth-focused investors. Presale Spotlight: Why Qubetics Is the Talk of the Crypto World Investors seeking high returns focus on the Qubetics presale, currently in Phase 13. Each phase witnesses a 10% price increase, with the final stage set to jump by 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.034, and the project has already raised over $7.2 million. Analysts predict that once the mainnet launches, $TICS could soar to between $10 and $15 per token. Imagine investing today and reaping an ROI of over 29,000% if the price hits $10, or an astonishing 43,000% if it climbs to $15. These numbers are no mere speculation—Qubetics has already demonstrated immense traction, proving why it’s one of the best cryptos to join today. The structured price hikes add urgency for investors to act swiftly, securing their position in this promising project before the next phase increases token costs. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads the Pack in Crypto Innovation The crypto market is brimming with potential, and coins like VeChain and Fantom are making commendable strides with their latest updates. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a game-changer, combining innovative Web3 solutions with an electrifying presale that promises exceptional returns. Analysts’ predictions of staggering ROIs and the platform’s robust community engagement make it one of the best cryptos to join today. Don’t miss the chance to be part of Qubetics’ transformative journey. With the presale progressing rapidly, now is the time to act and secure your stake in what could be the next big thing in crypto.

After briefly retesting $99,000, Bitcoin’s price momentum has slowed, raising questions about whether this signals the start of a larger sell-off or a temporary pause in its uptrend. Analysts Highlight BTC Price Key Levels Crypto trader Ali Charts has put a lot of emphasis on the $96,000 level. He explained that if Bitcoin price moves below this level, the following significant points will be $90,000 and $85,000. This view is consistent with the historical Fibonacci levels of retrace commonly employed by traders to understand market reversals. “Keeping it simple, based on the Fib, if Bitcoin loses $96,000, the next focus becomes $90,000 and $85,000,” Ali tweeted. To this, Robert Kiyosaki , a supporter of Bitcoin, said that it is never too late to join the market. He pointed to Bitcoin’s stability and capability to generate riches, saying, “Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich, including those who come in late. Just don’t get greedy.” Long-Term Holders Take Profits as Short-Term Investors Step In Using data from Glassnode, some changes have been observed in the activity of long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs). In the two months period, the total supply held by LTHs has been decreasing from $14.23 billion to $13.31 billion. This comes as BTC price soared from $58,000 to over $100,000 suggesting that institutional investors are booking profits at local highs. However, these sales by the long-term holders have been taken by the short-term holders (STHs) to ensure that the prices are maintained. Glassnode analysts pointed out that “the share of wealth owned by new investors has not yet reached the levels that were seen during the previous cycle peaks” which may mean that there is still some room for growth. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Remains Intact However, based on the correction, some analysts continue to hold the view that the price of Bitcoin is still bullish. The AVIV Ratio, which looks at unrealized profits, is at 1.81, far from the levels that are considered extremely high and which usually signify a reversal in market trends. This means that although some traders may have taken their profits, the market has not become overly aggressive. Meanwhile, the Titan of Crypto still has the positive outlook about Bitcoin’s future. He stressed that Bitcoin has been making higher highs and higher lows which is a positive indication that the trend remains bullish. ”BTC bullish momentum remains strong, with the next target at the 100% Fibonacci extension of $113,000,” he stated. Institutional Demand Could Propel Bitcoin Further The adoption of Bitcoin has remained strong, with Bitcoin ETFs hitting a top of $37 billion in assets by December 19th. This represents a sharp rise from the $24.23 billion at the beginning of November as highlighted by Farside Investors. At the same time, statistics show that at the peak of Bitcoin at $108,000, 62.17% of traders had short positions, expecting the price to fall. However, as Bitcoin dropped to $96,000, the sentiment changed as 55.44% of the traders are now bullish because they anticipate a rally in the price of the cryptocurrency. Supporting this price trend, analysts at Bitfinex believe that the price correction of Bitcoin will be relatively mild owing to the rising demand from institutional investors. They expect it to be at $145,000 by mid-2025, with a possibility of rising to $200,000 in a better environment. Furthermore, in light of the growing talk about the potential of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset at the national level, experts estimate that such a decision could take Bitcoin’s price to $1 million.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 23:57:00

Crypto All-Stars has wrapped up a stellar presale with a $22.64 million haul, solidifying its position as a meme coin powerhouse. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the show with its presale, which has already surpassed $4.2 million in Stage 12. On the flip side, Mog Coin (MOG), once hailed as a meme coin with promise, is struggling to hold its ground amid bearish market conditions. Meme coins have grown beyond being internet jokes. They now represent a unique blend of community power, creative use cases, and, of course, the potential for exponential profits. BTFD Coin is leading this new wave of meme coin evolution with its P2E game, lucrative referral program, staking rewards, and a vibrant community. Let’s dive into why BTFD, Crypto All-Stars, and Mog Coin are the most talked-about meme coins right now and which of them stands out as the best for exponential returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Rising Star in Meme Coins BTFD Coin has taken the meme coin world by storm, and it’s easy to see why. Starting at an initial price of $0.000004, the coin has climbed to $0.00013 in Stage 12 of its presale. With over 57 billion coins sold and $4.2 million raised so far, the numbers speak for themselves. With just four stages left, the presale momentum is building rapidly, and the coin’s listing price of $0.0006 promises substantial short-term returns. BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its presale. Its P2E game offers an engaging way for users to earn rewards, while the referral program incentivises community growth by rewarding users for bringing in new investors. Add in the 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got a project that caters to both gamers and crypto enthusiasts looking for passive income. Here’s an investment scenario to paint the picture. If you invest $30,000 in Stage 12 at $0.00013 per coin, you’d acquire approximately 230.7 million BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would grow to $138,420. That’s the kind of growth that has investors flocking to the project. Why is BTFD one of the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its explosive crypto presale , innovative features, and strong community backing make it a top choice for investors looking to capitalise on the meme coin trend. With the price increasing at every stage, now’s the time to jump in. Crypto All-Stars (STARS): The MemeVault Revolution Crypto All-Stars has already proven itself as a meme coin heavyweight. Its presale, which concluded with $22.64 million raised, set the stage for the launch of its groundbreaking MemeVault—a platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins, including PEPE, Dogecoin, and Floki, under one roof. This innovation has brought a sense of unity to the meme coin community, making $STARS a must-have token for enthusiasts. The $STARS token, priced at $0.0016782 during the presale, comes with lucrative staking rewards of up to 1429% APY. This high return has attracted both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. By reducing the circulating supply through staking incentives, Crypto All-Stars creates scarcity, which often leads to price surges once the token is listed. With the $STARS token set to launch on Uniswap next week, anticipation is building. Early adopters are expected to see substantial gains as more meme coin holders flock to the platform. The MemeVault itself is a game-changer, offering a streamlined way to manage and stake meme coins while earning rewards. Why does $STARS rank among the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its successful presale, innovative staking platform, and upcoming launch make it a strong contender for both short-term and long-term gains. For those who missed the presale, the token launch presents a second chance to get in on the action. Mog Coin (MOG): A Meme Coin Facing Challenges Mog Coin (MOG) entered the scene with a lot of promise, leveraging its quirky branding and strong community backing. However, recent market conditions have posed significant challenges. Once a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts, MOG is now battling bearish pressure that has left its performance lagging behind competitors like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars. MOG’s initial appeal lay in its community-driven initiatives and its potential to carve out a niche in the meme coin space. However, the lack of new developments and a clear roadmap has made it difficult for the project to sustain its early momentum. While the coin still has a loyal following, its price movements have been lacklustre, leaving investors cautious. For MOG to regain its footing, it needs a fresh narrative or a major update to its ecosystem. Without these, it risks falling further behind in a market that thrives on innovation and community engagement. While some investors are holding on in the hope of a turnaround, others are shifting their focus to projects like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars, which offer clearer paths to exponential profits. Why does MOG make this list? Its initial success and strong community give it a place among notable meme coins, but its current struggles highlight the importance of staying ahead in a competitive market. For now, MOG is a speculative play rather than a reliable choice for significant returns. The Concluding Remarks: What Are the Best Meme Coins for Exponential Growth Next Year? Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market offers a wealth of opportunities for investors seeking exponential profits. BTFD Coin is the best meme coin for exponential profits, thanks to its stellar presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support. A $30,000 investment in Stage 12 could grow to $138,420 by the end of the presale, showcasing its immense potential. Crypto All-Stars is another standout, with its MemeVault innovation and successful presale setting the stage for substantial gains. While Mog Coin has its merits, its current challenges make it a riskier option compared to its competitors. If you’re ready to capitalise on these opportunities, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin meme coin presale today and position yourself for exponential profits in the ever-evolving meme coin market. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing in crypto.

The video included a disclaimer suggesting there’s no guarantee the cap won’t be altered. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is a cornerstone of its value as a store of wealth, and any change could fundamentally impact its perception among investors. In the video, BlackRock highlighted Bitcoin’s 21 million cap, noting it as a “hard-coded rule” that controls supply, purchasing power, and prevents excessive currency creation. However, the disclaimer stated: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor reposted the video, sparking criticism. Joel Valenzuela, Dashpay’s marketing director, commented, “When the supply cap increase happens, it will have ‘always been part of the plan.’ And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say Bitcoin wasn’t hijacked.” Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis added, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Is Bitcoin’s Supply Cap Changeable? Bitcoin developer Super Testnet, known for BitVM, explained that altering Bitcoin’s supply cap would depend on how one defines “Bitcoin.” In theory, the cap could change if a majority of the community—node operators, developers, miners, and investors—reached consensus on a hard fork. Such a change would involve a proposal to gauge consensus, followed by implementing changes in Bitcoin Core. If most node operators and miners adopted the new fork, it would create a “new” Bitcoin network with an uncapped supply. However, Super Testnet argued that this new chain wouldn’t truly be Bitcoin. “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” they said. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” In essence, an uncapped version wouldn’t be Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FORKS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 00:36:00

The SEC is reviewing these products to ensure whether they follow regulations and protect investors. This move helps bring digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem by preventing from frauds. Nasdaq and Cboe BZX Exchange crypto index ETF Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange changed their rules for listing and trading with exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to spot bitcoin and ether ETF. Nasdaq intends to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, while the Cboe BZX Exchange aims to introduce the Franklin Crypto Index ETF. These ETPs will directly hold spot bitcoin and ether and cash equivalents. The goal of listing these assets on the exchanges is to increase their accessibility. SEC’s Role in Regulating The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is reviewing these listings according to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which sets rules for trading securities on exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe BZX, for ensuring fairness and transparency. The Securities Act of 1933 regulates how securities are issued and required proper disclosures to protect investors on Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange. The Investment Company Act of 1940 governs investment products like ETFs to ensure they follow rules that protect investors. In addition to this, The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) regulates financial products linked to bitcoin and ether as commodities. The proposed Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act could shape future cryptocurrency regulations to ensure safe investment practices. The SEC believes that the proposed rule changes meet these requirements, especially those to prevent fraud and market manipulation. Additionally, the Commission emphasizes the necessity of surveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges to detect fraudulent activities and maintain market integrity. To minimize the risk of market manipulation, the SEC investigates how the spot markets for assets like bitcoin and ether that are correlated with their futures markets. In previous approvals for Bitcoin and Ether-based ETPs, the SEC confirmed that price movements in spot markets which closely reflected in futures markets. This correlation indicates that if manipulation or fraud occurs in the spot market, it is more like an evident in the futures market, which is easier to monitor. The CME’s bitcoin and ether futures markets have exhibited strong correlations with their spot markets, giving the SEC confidence that these new ETFs can be effectively supervised. The SEC has decided that the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and the Franklin Crypto Index ETF follow all necessary rules. These products are in line with past approvals of similar bitcoin and ether-based investment products. By introducing these new ETPs, investors will have access to spot bitcoin and ether in a regulated environment, which enhances security and transparency in their cryptocurrency investments. This approval is an important step in bringing digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem, with the help of SEC.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.58 million YouTube subscribers that ETH will likely break through its all-time high and enter an explosive phase this cycle. “Barring any black swan events spoiling our party, we should be able to take for granted that ETH will break through its previous all-time high of around $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Where it goes from there, though, is the real question. Because ETH has spent so much time sliding against BTC and wallowing in price purgatory, it can be difficult to imagine a parabolic repricing. However, once the all-time high is broken, there will be no historical levels of supply or resistance above. Price discovery will ensue, and ETH is likely to teleport moonwards.” Crypto traders and analysts refer to price discovery as a situation where a coin trades at levels never seen before or not having been seen in a long time. Next, the analyst uses Fibonacci extension levels to suggest that ETH may surge to $7,300 as a “base case,” which is the 1.618 Fibonacci level on the chart he shares. Traders use Fibonacci extensions in technical analysis to estimate profit targets and price pullbacks. They are based on Fibonacci ratios. Source: Guy Turner/YouTube However, he says if Bitcoin nearly doubles its current price next year and hits $200,000, ETH could surge even higher, to $14,600. “ETH has only just made it to the 0.786 [Fibonacci] level. So rather than doubling this price, we think doubling ETH price at the 1.618 level will give us a better upper limit of what could happen in 2025. This 1.618 level is about $7,300 which, again, we think is a pretty good base case target. Doubling this would give us $14,600. For an asset that has underperformed BTC so severely, this sounds like a tall order indeed, and it’s therefore the most extreme bullish case for 2025 that we can take seriously. If BTC touches $200,000 in 2025 orthodoxy suggests that profits will rotate into ETH. With BTC at such a high level, this could be enough capital to bring ETH up above $14,000.” Ethereum is trading for $3,686 at time of writing, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $101,143 at time of writing, down 4.6% on the day.

Following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply below $99,000. However, the leading crypto quickly rebounded, climbing back to $104,000 earlier today before settling at $100,573 at the time of writing. This represents a 3.4% decrease over the past day and a roughly $67 billion reduction in its market cap valuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Momentum Shifts As Spot Market Outpaces Futures – Here’s What It Means Exchange Transactions Hit Record Lows Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst known as Woominkyu provided insights into Bitcoin’s market activity, highlighting declining exchange transaction volumes. According to Woominkyu, historical data suggests a correlation between transaction volume spikes and significant price movements. For example, peaks in exchange transactions coincided with Bitcoin’s dramatic price surges in 2017 and 2021. However, recent data shows a marked decline in transaction volumes on both spot and derivative exchanges, reflecting reduced trading activity compared to previous years. This decrease, according to the CryptoQuant analyst may indicate “waning market participation,” suggesting a “period of consolidation or reduced volatility” in the near term. Bitcoin Key Support Levels and Technical Insights Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shed light on an important support zone forming just below the $100,000 mark. The data shared by the platform reveals that over 1.45 million BTC were accumulated at an average price of $97,500. This accumulation has established a significant demand zone, potentially serving as a “buffer” against further price declines. The importance of this level lies in its ability to provide a foundation for price stability, particularly as Bitcoin navigates its current phase of market correction. It is suggested that a breach below this zone could trigger further downward pressure, while holding above it might boost recovery efforts. Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, insights shared by market analyst Satoshi Wolf highlight the critical nature of Bitcoin’s current price levels. The cryptocurrency recently tested the $100,000 support, aligning with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Related Reading: Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? Top Exec Discusses The Market Crash This level is pivotal as it combines technical indicators with psychological significance. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows bearish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nears oversold territory, signalling the potential for a price reversal. Wolf suggests that traders monitor for a confirmed breakout above $104,000 or a breakdown below $100,000, with volume confirmation being key to validating either. 📊 $BTC Analysis: The chart shows a recent pullback after a strong uptrend, suggesting potential profit-taking. Price is testing the 100,000 support, aligning with the 100 EMA, a crucial level to watch. If it holds, a bounce back towards 104,000 resistance is possible.

Render is currently experiencing strong market momentum, indicated by its recent price increases and expanding partnerships that signal potential for future growth in its GPU-powered decentralized network. Stacks has achieved a significant milestone with the launch of the ‘Nakamoto’ upgrade, enhancing both speed and security, and it has set ambitious price targets following an increase in user engagement and smart contract activity. Web3Bay is introducing a transformative e-commerce ecosystem built on blockchain technology, aiming to revolutionize online shopping with enhanced security, community-driven governance, and versatile transaction options. As each project develops, Web3Bay is particularly notable for its innovative approach to merging decentralized shopping experiences within a community-oriented platform. Render Sees Growing Momentum Render has been capitalizing on bullish market trends, supported by its decentralized GPU rendering network that connects creators with GPU resources. This platform provides an economical and efficient solution for rendering tasks, gaining popularity among artists, developers, and creatives who require high-performance graphics at lower costs. With a significant 21.39% price increase over the past week, Render is garnering increasing market attention, especially as it nears critical price thresholds. Render’s growth is bolstered by strategic partnerships, including a recent collaboration with Apple, enhancing its credibility and market reach. Analysts are optimistic about RNDR’s potential, with projections of substantial price increases in the near future. Render’s dedication to delivering cost-effective, high-quality rendering services positions it as a preferred provider in the sector. Stacks Enhances Capabilities with Nakamoto Upgrade Stacks is strengthening its foundation for Bitcoin-based smart contracts with the Nakamoto upgrade, marking a significant advancement in transaction speed and security, which benefits developers of decentralized applications. This upgrade has contributed to a price surge of over 30% in the past month, driven by unprecedented levels of smart contract deployment and growing interest in its ecosystem. Stacks is increasingly recognized for its ability to extend Bitcoin’s functionality, attracting more users to decentralized finance and applications. With rising adoption and an increase in total value locked, there is a strong sentiment about STX’s potential for further gains. The project’s emphasis on enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities positions it as an exciting option for long-term decentralized solutions. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-commerce Web3Bay is redefining the online shopping experience with its blockchain-based e-commerce platform. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay offers a decentralized marketplace that empowers users to fully control their data and transactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay enhances security, transparency, and user experience, bridging the gap between conventional e-commerce and Web3. It supports transactions using both cryptocurrencies and mainstream payment methods like PayPal, broadening its accessibility. The 3BAY token, integral to Web3Bay’s operations, has shown impressive returns for early investors. During its presale stages, the price of 3BAY has consistently risen, achieving a remarkable 6430% return on investment for those who participated early. The strong demand and growth potential are evident as Web3Bay gears up for its full launch. Web3Bay’s unique model fosters significant network growth by rewarding active user engagement, making community interaction a key driver of its development. This community-centric approach, coupled with decentralized governance, ensures the platform remains responsive to user needs, promoting continued growth and adding value to the 3BAY token.

With a progressive approach to e-commerce and a robust token economy, Web3Bay is positioning the 3BAY token as an attractive investment for those looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized, community-driven online commerce. In Conclusion While each project—Web3Bay, Render, and Stacks—brings unique strengths, Web3Bay’s comprehensive e-commerce ecosystem sets it apart as a standout choice. Render’s ongoing bullish momentum in the graphics field and Stacks’ ambitious targets with its Bitcoin-focused smart contracts are notable, but Web3Bay’s integration of blockchain technology with online shopping, creating a community-based marketplace, presents a compelling case. With high ROI potential and the prospect of becoming a next 100x asset, Web3Bay’s decentralized, user-centric model makes it an appealing choice for those exploring the innovative frontiers of e-commerce on the blockchain.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 01:28:00

This marks a major step toward integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum into traditional financial markets through regulated investment products. Dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to Be Listed on Nasdaq and Cboe BZX The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and Franklin Templeton Crypto Index ETF received the green light from the SEC to trade in the public market. These ETFs will be available for trading on the Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX exchanges, allowing investors to directly trade in Bitcoin and Ethereum spot. All the two funds will own Bitcoin, Ethereum, cash, and cash equivalents as part of their structure. By permitting these ETFs, the SEC guarantees that crypto investments meet some of the most important laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. SEC has *approved* both the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF & Franklin Crypto Index ETF… Will initially hold both btc & eth. pic.twitter.com/5GUhhhXL7y — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 19, 2024 The approval process also contained measures for market surveillance in order to prevent fraud and manipulation. The decision will help digital assets to have a better standing and acceptance in the financial system. Market Turbulence Surrounds SEC Decision The US SEC’s decision is made at the time of high volatility of cryptocurrency markets. However, Bitcoin price declined significantly and was trading at slightly above $96,000, having previously traded at above $108,000 earlier in the week. Ethereum also went down by 15% and was trading at $3,440. As per the data from CoinGlass, more than $1 billion worth of crypto was liquidated within the last 24 hours. However, experts believe that the launch of these ETFs will help to stabilize the crypto market and, therefore, attract more institutional investors. “This move created a clear, legally compliant way for investors to get involved with digital assets,” said a market analyst. ETFs Bring Enhanced Oversight and Transparency The ETFs are intended to mimic market capitalization-weighted indexes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, thus providing investors with an opportunity to invest in both of them without owning the coins directly. The Hashdex ETF will track the Nasdaq Crypto Index and Franklin Templeton’s fund will be linked to the CF Institutional Digital Asset Index. In a bid to counter allegations of market manipulation, the US SEC noted that the price movements in the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot markets are in tandem with their respective futures markets. This correlation makes it easy to have supervision through sharing of surveillance data. To assess the price integrity, the SEC has used information from the CME’s Bitcoin and Ethereum futures markets. To avoid diversifying their strategies into staking or generating income from airdrops, both funds do not allow such operations in their investment approach based on spot prices. These measures are part of the regulatory systems to safeguard the investors’ interest as well as to enhance transparency of ETFs. Future Prospects for Crypto ETFs This approval could pave the way for additional cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States. Bloomberg analysts predict Litecoin ETFs could be next, given its classification as a commodity and its close relationship with Bitcoin. However, other digital assets, such as Solana and XRP, face greater regulatory scrutiny. The US SEC’s approval of these ETFs reflects a cautious but constructive approach to cryptocurrency regulation. By aligning these products with existing financial laws, the SEC is enabling safer participation in the digital asset market. This decision could encourage more institutional and retail investors to explore cryptocurrency as part of a diversified portfolio.

The funding is part of the orgainzation’s most recent round of Bitcoin Development Fund grants. During the last round of the Bitcoin Development Fund Grant in 2022, the HRF granted $325,000 to various projects worldwide. This year, the organization has gone bigger and better, granting 7 BTC, approximately $706,000, to twenty projects worldwide according to the press release it sent to the Bitcoin Magazine. The HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund is focused on supporting projects that enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem. It especially has interests in regions where people live under unfavorable conditions. The program funds projects that promote decentralization, privacy, and education, and its goal is to empower individuals and communities facing oppressive regimes. HRF reaches a hand out The guarantees for the HRF’s Bitcoin development fund are projects in Latin America, Asia, and Africa that focus on technical education in regions with authoritarian governments. The organization did not disclose how much each of this round’s recipients will receive. However, it revealed that the 20 awarded projects will share a grand total of 7 BTC. The winning projects from this round include Stratum V2 Reference Implementation (SRI), an open-source software and Public Pool, an open-source mining pool. Both projects are centered around making Bitcoin more accessible and decentralized. Other projects include UI/UX Design for Bitcoin Core, No BS Bitcoin, Tando, YakiHonne, and many more. Each of these projects contributes to the accessibility and decentralization of Bitcoin in their various regions. HRF rewards odds-defying individuals Among the guarantees of the $706,000 grant are Naiyoma and Daniella Brozzoni. Naiyoma is the first female Bitcoin core developer from Africa. Kenya, where Naiyoma hails from, has experienced instances of electoral authoritarianism. Financial freedom and human rights are also under threat. Considering this, Naiyoma is dedicated to creating an open financial system rooted in transparency, freedom, and fairness. Her work focuses on reviewing pull requests, fixing bugs through new PRs, and improving Bitcoin Core’s code base. The HRF fund allocation is expected to support her work in advancing Bitcoin Core. Daniella Brozzoni is also a developer. She previously contributed to the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK), a software library that supports building cross-platform Bitcoin wallets. Like Naiyoma, Daniella now also focuses on Bitcoin Core, where her job includes reviewing key pull requests, contributing to new features, and improving test coverage. The work of these dedicated developers will contribute to the decentralization of Bitcoin making it more accessible, secure and resilient.

With so many options on the market, keeping an eye on promising developments is crucial. While many investors are focused on mainstream coins, emerging projects often hold the potential for exponential returns. Filecoin has been making headlines with its ambitious price predictions, and Stacks continues to garner attention for its innovative approach to blockchain utility. However, the spotlight is firmly on Qubetics ($TICS), a revolutionary blockchain platform that’s capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. Its presale momentum and groundbreaking technology are turning heads in the crypto space. This article will cover the latest updates and developments around Qubetics, Filecoin, and Stacks—three of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Qubetics: Cross-Border Payments Redefined What if financial institutions could execute cross-border payments instantly, securely, and at a fraction of the current costs? Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a solution that makes this possible, empowering banks and financial institutions to streamline international transactions. By leveraging the $TICS token, Qubetics addresses long-standing inefficiencies in global payment systems. Traditional cross-border payments often come with delays, high fees, and a lack of transparency. Qubetics flips this narrative, enabling swift, transparent transactions that cater to the needs of both corporate entities and individuals. For businesses, this means quicker settlements, improved cash flow, and the ability to stay competitive in global markets. It simplifies remittances and international transfers for individuals, ensuring money reaches its destination without undue complications. Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to enhance community engagement, addressing queries from its rapidly growing audience. Such transparency and involvement only make it one of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Filecoin: The Backbone of Decentralised Storage Filecoin is gaining traction as a decentralised storage network that aims to preserve the world’s most critical data securely.

For XRP, the support at $2.20 plays an important role. Since the beginning of December 2024, the altcoin has reached this level more than four times, and each time it has experienced an upside rally. However, this time, sentiment appears to be similar, as the price has started moving upward. Long-Term Holders Rising Interest in XRP The current market sentiment appears negative, as the market has witnessed a significant $1.18 billion in crypto liquidations . This substantial liquidation has created fear among traders and investors, discouraging them from staying and participating in the asset. $220 Million of XRP outflow Despite the fear, traders and long-term holders seem optimistic about XRP, as they have purchased millions worth of tokens during this price decline, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from XRP spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a continuous and significant outflow of $220 million worth of XRP. Source: Coinglasss This outflow indicates a bullish outlook for XRP despite the ongoing price decline, as long-term holders continue to believe in the token. This explains why exchanges are experiencing substantial token outflows. In the cryptocurrency context, “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to long-term holders’ wallets, signaling a potential upside rally and an ideal buying opportunity. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, XRP appears bullish as the price is showing signs of a reversal from the crucial support level of $2.20. Based on the recent price action, the altcoin is near the buying zone, where it has typically experienced an upside rally. Source: Trading View If XRP holds the $2.20 support level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 13% to reach the next resistance level of $2.50 in the near future. On the other hand, if XRP falls below the support level and closes a daily candle below the $2.20 level, we could see XRP dropping to $2 or even lower in the future. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.30 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.70% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 7%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors.",News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 02:24:32

The surge in these metrics has resulted from the significant price drop for Dogecoin, which is down over 5% in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin Trading Volume And Liquidations Witness Significant Spike CoinMarketCap data shows that Dogecoins’s trading volume is up over 57% in the last 24 hours, with over $6 billion traded during this period. Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin’s liquidations have crossed $31 million, with $25 million and $5.8 in long and short positions liquidated, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Run To $11 ATH? Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer Long positions took the most hit as the Dogecoin price crashed below the $0.4 range. This development came following Jerome Powell’s speech, which painted a bearish picture for the foremost meme coin. As crypto analyst Kevin Capital revealed, Dogecoin’s technical indicators were already bearish, and the macroeconomic fundamentals only did more damage. Powell suggested that the US Federal Reserve will likely pause on the rate cuts next year, which immediately sparked a bearish sentiment among traders and led to a wave of sell-offs. This contributed to the spike in trading volume, as investors looked to offload their coins, considering how the Fed being hawkish is bearish for risk assets like Dogecoin. However, Kevin Capital believes that traders are overreacting to Jerome Powell’s speech. The crypto analyst believes that Dogecoin will recover this price correction, stating that the dip will be bought. However, it is worth mentioning Dogecoin’s correlation with Bitcoin, as Kevin Capital had previously pointed out that DOGE’s next move will depend on BTC. The Bitcoin price has dropped below the $100,000 psychological price level and looks bearish at the moment. As such, the Dogecoin price recovery is unlikely to happen until Bitcoin witnesses a bullish reversal. Increased Volatility Is Not Unusual Crypto analyst Master Kenobi also commented on the Dogecoin price drop, stating that increased volatility at this stage of the bull market is not unusual. However, the analyst suggested that traders should avoid being shaken out and instead hold on to their positions. This came as he claimed that market makers who will inject money into the market would prefer for market participants to walk away with a 90% loss rather than a 10x gain. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Recovery Toward $2 As Million-Dollar Whale Transactions Explode On The Network Bitcoinist recently reported that Dogecoin’s sentiment has turned negative once again, indicating that DOGE holders may be looking to sell their coins even at a loss. Kevin Capital had before now stated that the Dogecoin bull run is far from over, suggesting that there was no need to be bearish at the moment despite the price correction. He advised long-term holders just to sit back and wait for higher prices. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.36, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

For now, only a few select users can access the card, and a date for the full release to the public has yet to be announced. The project shared the news via an announcement on its X account. Part of the post read, “Today we’re kicking off a limited pilot program in the United States where some of you will get your hands on MetaMask Card and try it out before it goes to a wider release.” Metamast tests the US markets The soft launch in the US is a precursor to a full-scale launch. Currently, the MetaMask card is only available to select areas in the US, with users in New York and Vermont not making the list. The MetaMask team went on to urge users who were not accepted into the pilot program to apply to join the waitlist. Users of MetaMask and other self-custodial wallets face the challenge of using their crypto funds to make payments for common goods and services directly without having to move these funds to centralized wallets or banks. The MetaMask card could be a game-changer in allowing crypto holders to easily complete transactions in real-time without first converting or transferring their crypto funds. According to Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the parent company behind MetaMask, “MetaMask Card represents a major step to removing the friction that has existed between the blockchain and traditional payments. This is a paradigm shift that offers the best of both worlds.” He also added that the card pilot program gives people the freedom to spend crypto. The MetaMask card allows direct spending from self-custodial wallets To get the card, users have to first check their eligibility on their MetaMask portfolios before registering for the digital card. Once they go through these steps, they can then set it up as a payment method on their mobile devices as it can be integrated into Apple Pay and Google Pay. Funds that users can spend directly from the card include cryptos such as USDC, USDT, and WETH on the Linea network. They can also set spending limits for their card. The card launched in August of this year, and it allows users to spend the crypto they hold on MetaMask anywhere. This means that a MetaMask cardholder can use their card to make payments in fiat currency anywhere a Mastercard is accepted, thanks to their partnership with Mastercard and Baanx. At the time of its initial launch , the card was available in Europe and the UK, with the promise to roll it out in other locations. So far, the card is now operational in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Columbia. According to the partners, the card joins the Web2 world to Web3, by leveraging Mastercard’s merchant network, MetaMask’s security, the efficiency of the Linea network, and the depth of experience Baanx brings in building financial technologies and cards in the Web3 space.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $95,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Further Bitcoin price failed to start another increase and extended losses below the $102,000 zone. BTC gained bearish momentum below the $100,000 and $98,000 levels. The price even spiked below $96,500. A low was formed at $95,586 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

A clear move above the $100,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $102,000. A close above the $102,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $103,400 resistance level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $108,295 swing high to the $95,586 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $105,000 level. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $98,500 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $96,200 level. The first major support is near the $95,500 level. The next support is now near the $93,200 zone.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

Today, let’s dive into two meme coins that could leave you with serious FOMO if you don’t act fast: Neiro, the heartfelt underdog carrying Doge’s legacy, and BTFD Coin , the meme coin disrupting presales with a bang. Neiro might already be flying high, but if you missed its meteoric rise, don’t fret—BTFD Coin’s presale is still open and packing more potential than your favourite meme thread. Neiro: The Little Sister You Didn’t Know You Needed Neiro’s story reads like a Hollywood script: abandoned, rescued, and now a star in her own right. Once a stray dog in a shelter, Neiro was adopted by the same woman who owned Kabosu—the Shiba Inu behind the legendary Doge meme. Her journey from obscurity to fame mirrors the rise of her namesake meme coin, which burst onto the scene with a purpose: to combine internet culture with real-world impact. When Neiro launched on Ethereum during the New Moon on August 4th, 2024, the crypto community took notice. Even Vitalik Buterin himself gave the project his nod of approval, marking only the second time he has publicly supported a meme coin (the first being SHIB). His $500,000 donation to an animal welfare fund not only solidified Neiro’s credibility but also showcased its commitment to making a difference. With the original developer long gone, the community stepped up to take the reins, making Neiro a 100% community-owned project. This transparency and collective spirit have turned it into a meme coin with a heart, backed by donations to shelters and other charitable initiatives. But here’s the kicker: if you missed out on Neiro’s launch, you’ve likely missed its biggest gains. Early adopters are already reaping rewards, and unless you’re comfortable buying in at higher prices, the train may have left the station. BTFD Coin: Don’t Miss This One Too If Neiro has you feeling that sinking “missed ICO” feeling, don’t despair. There’s another meme coin making waves right now: BTFD Coin (short for “Buy the Dip”). It’s bold, it’s brash, and it’s built for those who love turning market chaos into opportunities. Currently in its 12th presale stage, BTFD Coin is proving that it’s not just a cheeky name—it’s a serious contender in the meme coin world. Here’s the latest scoop: Current Price: $0.00013 Funds Raised: Over $4.2 million, including $1M in under 10 days and $2.5M within 14 days of its presale launch. Community Strength: Over 6,000 holders have already joined the Bulls Squad. Coins Sold: More than 57 billion BTFD Coins have been snapped up by eager investors. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. The project combines 90% APY staking rewards, an exciting Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , and a dedicated community of Bulls driving its momentum. And unlike some meme coins, BTFD Coin is built with longevity in mind, featuring locked liquidity and a vested token distribution to ensure stability. Investment Example: Don’t Let This One Slip By Let’s break down the numbers to see what’s on the table if you act now. At the current presale price of $0.00013, a $900 investment would secure you 6,923,077 BTFD Coins. Now imagine this: if the coin reaches its predicted post-launch value of $0.0006—a realistic target given the buzz surrounding it—your $900 investment could grow to a whopping $4,153.85. That’s a potential 360% return on your money. The presale is moving fast, so the clock is ticking. Don’t let this be another missed opportunity. Lessons from Neiro: Don’t Wait for the Moon to Strike Twice If there’s one thing Neiro’s rise has taught us, it’s that timing is everything in crypto. Those who got in early are now sitting pretty, while the rest of us are left wondering, What if? Neiro’s story isn’t just inspiring—it’s a reminder of what the meme coin space is all about: community, culture, and a little bit of chaos. And while it’s still a strong contender, the best time to invest in Neiro was yesterday. The second-best time? Well, maybe not today if you’re looking for explosive growth. This is where BTFD Coin steps in. With its presale still underway, it offers something Neiro can’t anymore: a chance to get in early and ride the wave from the ground floor. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let FOMO Win Again The crypto world is full of “what ifs” and “if onlys.” If you missed Neiro’s launch and its early gains, it’s easy to feel like you’ve missed your shot. But here’s the thing: the next big opportunity is always just around the corner. BTFD Coin’s presale is that opportunity. With its unique combination of staking rewards, a P2E game, and a strong community, it’s positioned to be the next big wave in the meme coin world. But presales don’t last forever, and neither do low prices. Don’t let BTFD Coin be another Neiro—a coin you regret not jumping on while you had the chance. Act now, join the Bulls Squad, and ride this wave to the moon.

ETH is down over 7% and is showing bearish signs below the $3,550 level. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,680 zone. The price is trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it fails to stay above the $3,650 support zone. Ethereum Price Drops Below $3,650 Ethereum price struggled to start a fresh increase above the $3,680 level and extended losses like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $3,650 level and dived below $3,600. It even dived below $3,550 and spiked below the $3,420 level. A low was formed at $3,324 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,510 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,105 swing high to the $3,324 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,650 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $3,715 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,105 swing high to the $3,324 low. A clear move above the $3,715 resistance might send the price toward the $3,800 resistance. An upside break above the $3,800 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,880 resistance zone or even $4,000. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,320 zone. A clear move below the $3,320 support might push the price toward the $3,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050.

Last week, Bitcoin spot ETF inflows skyrocketed to $2.17 billion in just five days, highlighting growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, XRP’s market holds potential bullish moves as its price hovers near critical levels, attracting attention. Among these trends, the spotlight rests firmly on one standout project: BlockDAG (BDAG) . This Layer-1 blockchain contender has become a favorite among enthusiasts and developers, thanks to its groundbreaking Whitepaper V3 . The paper introduces key innovations addressing scalability and security issues. With daily inflows exceeding $5 million and presale figures crossing $169 million, BlockDAG has set the bar high. Its GHOSTDAG protocol is a game-changer, offering unmatched transaction speed and security. This solidifies its position as a must-watch crypto for those focused on long-term potential. Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflows Soar to $2.17 Billion According to data shared by @WuBlockchain, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $2.17 billion over five consecutive trading days. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was the leading contributor, with $1.51 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which brought in $598 million. These ETFs now account for 5.71% of Bitcoin’s total market cap, signaling their growing importance. However, there are mixed signals. Grayscale’s GBTC witnessed $221 million in outflows, reflecting a shift in preferences. Experts also warn that Bitcoin spot ETFs could amplify market volatility, creating challenges for smaller players. Despite these concerns, institutional interest remains strong, underscoring Bitcoin’s prominence in the crypto ecosystem. XRP’s Road to $2.70: Hope with Hurdles XRP continues to consolidate near $0.50, with bulls targeting a breakout to $2.70. The optimism stems from growing legal clarity and increased institutional attention. XRP’s unique utility in cross-border transactions keeps it on traders’ watchlists as a promising opportunity. That said, resistance at $0.55 has slowed momentum, and analysts caution against possible dips if this barrier isn’t broken. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties, while improving, still hover over XRP’s broader adoption prospects. Despite these hurdles, the market remains optimistic, positioning XRP as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. BlockDAG Presale Rockets to $169M Milestone! BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3 is reshaping the Layer-1 blockchain space with features designed to solve industry-wide challenges. Its GHOSTDAG protocol enables simultaneous block creation, ensuring faster transactions and greater scalability while mitigating risks like double-spending and 51% attacks. The whitepaper’s vision includes EVM compatibility, which simplifies deploying Ethereum-based dApps on BlockDAG’s network. Future updates, such as cross-chain bridging, are also in the pipeline, unlocking interoperability that could drive significant ecosystem growth. This innovation has captivated developers, traders, and miners alike. The presale momentum is proof of its rising popularity. BlockDAG’s daily inflows exceed $5 million, and total sales have surpassed $169 million. More than 17.3 billion coins have already been sold, with prices surging from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0234 in the current batch 26. Early supporters have seen an impressive 2240% surge. Meanwhile, over $5.9 million in miner sales have been recorded, with nearly 15,000 miners sold. As more batches sell out quickly, the presale is moving closer to its $600 million goal. With ongoing market interest and developer adoption, BlockDAG is positioned for exponential growth. For those exploring promising blockchain solutions, this could be a pivotal moment to engage with one of the most talked-about projects in crypto. Closing Thoughts: BlockDAG Leads the Way While Bitcoin spot ETFs captured $2.17 billion in inflows and XRP traders eye a potential rise to $2.70, BlockDAG continues to dominate headlines. Its Whitepaper V3 has solidified its position as a leader in addressing blockchain’s pressing issues. With daily inflows surpassing $5 million and a record-breaking $169 million presale, BlockDAG is creating ripples across the industry. As its presale approaches new milestones, BlockDAG remains a top contender for those seeking transformative blockchain projects.

These aren’t your typical crypto investments. They combine spot Bitcoin and Ethereum into one package, making it easier—and maybe even safer—for people to invest in the two biggest digital currencies at once. SEC has *approved* both the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF & Franklin Crypto Index ETF… Will initially hold both btc & eth. pic.twitter.com/5GUhhhXL7y — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 19, 2024 Bitcoin Meets Ethereum in a Balanced Package There are so many crypto ETFs running already, so what is so special about these two? Instead of focusing on just Bitcoin or Ethereum, they mix both. The allocation depends on the market value of each, so investors get a well-balanced exposure. Why does this matter? It’s simple: putting everything into just one cryptocurrency can feel risky. By holding both, these ETFs spread out the risk and let you benefit from the strengths of each. For anyone who finds the idea of buying Bitcoin or Ethereum directly too overwhelming, these ETFs could be the answer. They simplify the process, making crypto investments more accessible to regular people. A Big Step for Crypto Investing The SEC’s decision to approve these ETFs shows that regulators are starting to take the crypto market seriously. This is a major milestone not just for the crypto space but for SEC as well. So why did these ETFs get approved? A key reason is the strong connection between Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and their spot prices. This link helps keep things stable and reduces the chances of manipulation, which is a big win for investors. These ETFs also follow strict guidelines to protect investors. They’re tied to agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to monitor trading activity and keep everything above board. The SEC isn’t just handing out approvals—they’ve made sure these ETFs meet high standards for security and transparency. What’s Next ? This approval could open the door for even more creative investment options in the future. By combining Bitcoin and Ethereum, these ETFs simplify the process of getting into crypto. They remove the hassle of managing multiple wallets or worrying about buying and storing digital assets directly. And this could just be the start. Other cryptocurrencies might join similar ETFs down the road. For now, though, these Bitcoin-Ethereum combos are a big step forward. If you’ve been waiting for a way to explore crypto without all the complications, this could be exactly what you’ve been looking for.",News|Bitcoin ETF|Ethereum ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 03:27:36
37866539,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52650,1734665328,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,What Will Replace Betting Sponsorships As The Most Common Football Sponsorship?,https://timestabloid.com/what-will-replace-betting-sponsorships-as-the-most-common-football-sponsorship/,"For those who don’t know, starting from the 2026/27 Premier League season, betting sponsors will no longer be allowed as the front sport on a kit. This has been a long-form debate among football fans as the promotion of betting, as heavy as it is in football, has been perceived as a negative. This is obviously based on the negative connotations of betting as a whole and with football and the Premier League being the biggest sport in the world, having a constant betting reminder on kits in front of young fans, people of religion and people who have a negative relationship with betting, isn’t the best sign and isn’t as marketable as the Premier League wants to be. As we move forward, the betting sponsorships will be (slightly) removed from the game we love. We say slightly because the kits themselves cannot have betting sponsorships on the front, but, the betting sponsors on the sleeves and with the kits themselves will still be allowed. So overall, the change is fairly small. In the wake of these sponsorships being banned, we turn to the question: instead of Premier League betting sites or betting sites as a whole being the sponsorships, who will take over as the most used sponsor for these Premier League clubs? Cryptocurrency I think when we look at the similarities between crypto and betting, there is a huge overlap between the two. Crypto is a long-term financial investment whereas betting is a short-term and more risky version of the same thing. The reason why betting sponsors are so common is because the sports betting industry is so lucrative for the companies and the teams they sponsor. Crypto is daily similar, the money in crypto is huge and cryptocurrencies will be looking at premier league clubs as a form of marketing to get their name out there. If more people are investing in crypto, there is more money to be made and that is the goal behind every sponsorship. As well as this, there are already links between crypto and football, with certain crypto sites looking to the football industry and its fans with football-themed coins, as well as teams like Manchester City, having delved into the crypto sponsorship market already. Technology Sponsors We understand that this point is incredibly vague, but the technology is one of the biggest powerhouses in the entire world. Not only is the industry growing and changing every single day, but it also is financially the biggest industry in the world. Because technology is forever changing and billions of dollars are being invested each year, the finances are perfect for Premier League clubs. Being a sponsor on one of the biggest teams in the world’s shirts is enough marketing and exposure for years to come and with these sponsorships usually being locked deals for years and years, these companies will be licking their lips. Car Sponsors We have already seen car sponsorships throughout the years in the Premier League, if you have a good memory, you will remember Manchester United’s Chevrolet sponsorship all those years ago and this is a good sign for the car companies as they know clubs will be interested in their sponsorship offers. The car industry is, again, financially huge and compared to the crypto industry, the car industry is a lot safer and less risky to push into fans’ faces.

Currently trading at $2.21, the XRP price has recorded a nearly 5% gain in the past 24 hours, finding strong support just below its current price. This positions the token favorably for continued upward momentum, particularly since it began an upward trend on November 5, bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump’s re-election. $10.82 Target For The XRP Price Following Historical Patterns Interestingly, analysts are increasingly optimistic about the XRP price, especially considering a key technical indicator: the Bollinger Bands. This volatility indicator, which consists of a moving average and upper and lower bands, is currently tightening on the 12-hour chart. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts Analyst Steph has noted that the last time the Bollinger Bands exhibited such a pattern, the XRP price experienced a staggering 490% price explosion. If history repeats itself, this could propel XRP to a new all-time high of $10.82, significantly surpassing its previous record of $3.40 set in January 2018, according to the analyst. Adding to the bullish sentiment, another analyst known as Javon on X (formerly Twitter) has pointed out that XRP’s last full bull cycle saw an increase of over 600%. The analyst suggests that if the XRP price performs similarly, it could rise dramatically, potentially exceeding 6,800% to reach approximately $168. This projection hinges on the price moving above the 2.414 Fibonacci Extension level, which was valued at $3,06 during the previous cycle. However, some analysts are adopting a more conservative outlook. Key Levels At $2.42 And $2.92 In Focus DarkDefender has noted a clear break on the daily chart, predicting that the XRP price could retest the $2.42 level before breaking through $2.92. Should it surpass this threshold, targets of $3.43 and $5.85 could be in sight. DarkDefender had recently targeted $2.72, which the XRP price had successfully bounced back from, reaffirming the validity of his analysis. Related Reading: 400 Billion Shiba Inu Moved: Is A SHIB Price Crash Coming? Despite differing views on the potential extent of the surge, consensus among analysts is that the XRP price is likely to reach a new all-time high in the coming months. This optimism is further strengthened by the possibility of regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. The President-elect has promised a new regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States, which could pave the way for resolving the prolonged legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which previously stifled the XRP price, leading to a lengthy period of consolidation.

Although the SEC’s operations may be affected, the agency will prioritize its main mission of overseeing market activities and protecting investors, especially during uncertain times.

Truly, Jeremy pic.twitter.com/FDcSK2ejag — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) December 19, 2024 What Happens Next if The SEC is Shutdown? If the government shuts down, the SEC will have limited activities because federal agencies can’t operate without funding, except for a few things like protecting property. Companies trying to raise money or handle securities transactions should know that the SEC’s Corporation Finance staff won’t be available to approve registration statements, offering statements, or process those filings. The SEC won’t process filings that need review, like registration statements or tender offers. Companies won’t get feedback on their filings, and delays will happen once the shutdown ends. The SEC won’t answer questions or handle requests for exemptions or no-action letters. Gary Gensler previously announced he would retire from the SEC on January 20.

Cochran, a longstanding critic of Ripple, has reevaluated his stance, calling RLUSD Ripple’s most significant move in years. His analysis, shared through a video accompanying his tweet, outlines the unique RLUSD potential to revolutionize DeFi, Forex markets, and institutional banking. Why $RLUSD is @Ripple 's Trojan Horse for DeFi and Banking: I've been hard on XRP over the years, and almost missed why their new stablecoin would be useful, but after a deeper dive, I changed my mind and think it's probably their strongest move in years. pic.twitter.com/KW6TKqtcoD — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) December 17, 2024 RLUSD: Not Just Another Stablecoin Unlike conventional stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, RLUSD is fully regulated, bank-backed, and custodied by U.S. financial institutions. It adheres to strict compliance measures, including oversight from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple has also secured critical regulatory approvals, such as the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license, and aims to ensure RLUSD’s compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. This level of compliance distinguishes RLUSD from many existing stablecoins, aligning it with institutional needs and making it a robust tool for enterprises, banks, and financial entities. Additionally, RLUSD will be issued on Ripple’s native blockchain and Ethereum, bridging traditional financial institutions with decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Unlocking the Ripple Ecosystem Ripple has faced challenges in expanding the utility of its XRP Ledger (XRPL). While it introduced features such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and token issuance formats, adoption has been limited. RLUSD addresses a key gap: the inability to price assets in U.S. dollars within Ripple’s ecosystem. With RLUSD, institutional participants can now price Real-World Assets (RWAs), Forex trades, and other financial instruments directly in USD, enhancing the appeal of Ripple’s native AMM functionalities. Moreover, RLUSD opens pathways for Ripple to incentivize XRP liquidity through USD-XRP trading pairs. By bringing liquidity on-chain, Ripple can capture yield opportunities currently benefiting centralized exchanges. This strategic shift could bolster XRP’s ecosystem by redistributing value to the network and its participants. A Trojan Horse for Institutional Markets Cochran emphasizes that RLUSD’s greatest potential lies in its appeal to institutional markets, particularly Forex settlement and debt issuance. The Forex market handles trillions of dollars in daily transactions, often through outdated and fragmented banking systems. Ripple’s ability to offer a compliant, yield-bearing, USD-backed stablecoin could streamline these processes and position Ripple as a leading alternative settlement network. RLUSD’s integration with programmability upgrades—such as Hooks and a forthcoming Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain—further solidifies its utility. These enhancements will enable DeFi applications, creating opportunities for more sophisticated financial products on Ripple’s blockchain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Stablecoin Market Opportunity Cochran also highlights the growing stablecoin market, currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). With over $140 billion in circulation, stablecoins generate substantial yields for their issuers. RLUSD’s entry into this market, particularly in the EU where Tether lacks regulatory approval, could position Ripple as a major player. If Ripple captures a significant share of this market, it stands to generate billions in annual yield revenue, which could be reinvested into its ecosystem. A Path Forward for Ripple RLUSD represents a pivotal step in Ripple’s long-term vision of bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. By addressing regulatory concerns, enhancing ecosystem programmability, and tapping into institutional markets, Ripple strategically positions itself to capture value across multiple financial sectors. Cochran concludes that while Ripple’s early ambitions of competing with SWIFT remain challenging, RLUSD’s potential to unlock trillions in value from Forex settlement, debt instruments, and RWAs could make previously speculative price predictions for XRP more realistic.

This latest purchase has pushed the company’s total reserves to over 10,096 BTC, valued at more than $1 billion at current market prices. Hut 8 Bitcoin Reserves Top $1 Billion The Miami-headquartered cryptocurrency mining firm continues to increase its Bitcoin reserves, undeterred by BTC’s recent price surges. In its latest announcement, Hut 8 revealed the purchase of approximately 990 BTC for $100 million, at an average price of $101,710 per Bitcoin. Related Reading: Metaplanet To Expand Bitcoin Holdings With $11.3 Million Bond Sale This acquisition has propelled Hut 8’s total BTC holdings to over $1 billion, with the coins acquired at an average cost of $24,485 per Bitcoin. The move reflects the company’s strategy of combining low-cost BTC production with what it views as strategic market buys to maximize returns and strengthen its reserve assets. Notably, Hut 8’s recent purchase positions it among the top 10 largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. MicroStrategy remains the leader on this list, holding more than 250,000 BTC on its balance sheet. Commenting, Asher Genoot, CEO, Hut 8, said: We believe deeply in our operating business and that building a strategic Bitcoin reserve will fortify our financial position as we pursue large-scale growth initiatives across power and digital infrastructure. Additionally, as we scale operations and extend our cost advantage in Bitcoin production, we anticipate that the flywheel effect will enable us to grow our holdings organically at a significant discount to market prices, strengthening the yield of our reserve strategy. Echoing these sentiments, Hut 8 CFO, Sean Glennan explained that making BTC a reserve asset was a key component of the company’s strategy to deliver “superior returns” to shareholders through strategic treasury management. He added that the company is open to deploying its BTC reserve to support business objectives, such as upgrading its mining fleet. Earlier this month, Hut 8 unveiled a massive $750 million initiative aimed at general corporate objectives, debt repayment, and bolstering its Bitcoin reserve. On a year-to-date basis, Hut 8’s stock has surged by over 102%, trading at $27.11 at the time of writing. 4 Mining Firms Among Top 10 Corporate BTC Holders While companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block, and Coinbase are well-known among the top corporate Bitcoin holders, four Bitcoin mining firms also feature on this prestigious list, namely, Marathon Digital Holdings, Hut 8, Riot Blockchain, and CleanSpark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Grows As Rumble Unveils $20 Million BTC Treasury Strategy Last year, Riot Blockchain reported a significant increase in its BTC holdings. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin mining firm holds a total of 8,490 BTC. Similarly, earlier this month, Marathon Digital Holdings purchased another 703 BTC to increase its total reserves to 34,794 BTC. This move aligns with Marathon CEO’s previous statement that institutions are “waiting to buy up” Bitcoin. In October, CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford predicted that BTC may peak around $200,000 in the next 18 months. At press time, BTC trades at $100,543, down 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

This statement shocked many, given the stark price differences between XRP ($2.51) and BTC ($104,085). How could XRP be better than BTC? According to Vitalik, XRP’s technological advantages, such as faster transaction speeds and lower fees, make it better than BTC. He claims these features make XRP better suited for real-world applications than BTC. Amid this heated discussion on Vitalik Buterin’s comments, a Ripple rival, RCO Finance (RCOF), is making waves with its innovative features and real-world utility. Analysts project this cutting-edge project could surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025, making it a top pick for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Why Vitalik Buterin Says XRP Is Better Than Bitcoin Vitalik Buterin’s avid endorsement of Ripple’s native token, XRP, highlights its undervalued utility, making it a more innovative altcoin than Bitcoin. Here are some of the advantages XRP has over BTC. Ripple’s XRP offers faster transaction speed at lower fees. While Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) model is secure, it is notoriously slow and expensive. However, Ripple’s XRP offers near-instant transactions at low fees, making it more efficient, especially for everyday use. This utility has led to XRP’s integration into global financial networks, especially for cross-border payments. According to Vitalik Buterin, this has made it a key player in traditional institutions’ growing adoption of blockchain technology. This extends its value past speculative trading, offering more tangible value in the financial sector. Bitcoin’s energy-intensive PoW mining process is a cause of concern because of its environmental impact. This greatly limits its scalability, causing investors and developers alike to look for more energy-efficient options like XRP, which aligns with Vitalik Buterin’s outlook that the former is better than BTC. RCO Finance: The Ripple Rival Ready for a 12,050% Surge Similar to XRP, RCO Finance’s unique value proposition makes it a better investment. Backed by its innovative AI technology and real-world utility, RCOF is steadily making a name for itself and showing why it’s poised to surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025. At its core, RCO Finance leverages advanced AI tools to empower users with data-driven insights and personalized investment strategies.

This versatility streamlines the investing process, making it easier for users to level up and diversify their portfolios. RCOF’s blockchain infrastructure is designed to be compatible with multiple chains, enhancing flexibility and accessibility. This interoperability positions it as a versatile asset in the evolving crypto landscape.

This shows that RCOF adheres to industry standards, reassuring users that their assets and data are safe. Secure Your Place Before RCOF Takes Off Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement of utility-driven projects like XRP highlights the market’s shift toward practical applications and innovation.

XRP has been trading within a range of approximately $2.20 to $2.70 over the past few days, showing limited movement on the larger time frames. The altcoin has recently experienced a slight pullback, which has led to the invalidation of a previous bullish breakout pattern. While the price has not changed significantly, it remains within a potential bull market structure. The strong resistance level is around $2.90 to $3, where selling pressure has consistently been observed. On the lower end, there is support near $2, which has been tested multiple times and serves as the lower boundary of XRP’s current trading range. If the price breaks below $2, it may hint further downside. Understanding The Support and Resistance Levels The breakout had been confirmed at around $2.35, but the price closed below this level, invalidating the pattern and suggesting that further upside momentum is unlikely in the near term. The immediate support level in the short term is around $2.30 to $2.31, which is currently holding, but if it breaks, the next support lies around $2.23, with further downside possible towards the $2 level. It will also most likely drop to $1.90. After reaching $1.90, the key question is whether XRP can hold that level. If it breaks $1.90, the market will enter a bear phase, and the bullish trend will be over. However, that hasn’t happened yet, so it’s too early to make any conclusions. However, if XRP holds $2.30, it could rise to $2.60. If it breaks above $2.60, we can consider $3 as the next target.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 04:07:45

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 04:24:00

Network fees for DOGE spiked 330% year-over-year in November but have declined for nearly five weeks, indicating reduced usage. Daily active addresses hit over 1 million in mid-November but have since returned to normal levels, showing a drop in activity. Despite declines in fees and active addresses, DOGE's price remains near recent highs, suggesting a disconnect between usage and price. In the two months since I last covered Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) for Seeking Alpha, crypto's oldest 'memecoin' has enjoyed quite the rocket ship ride. Data by YCharts After ripping higher by over 240% in a matter of just a few weeks, I suspect the gains have been had in DOGE. In this update, we'll revisit some of the metrics and indicators I shared in my previous article, look at the technical setup for DOGE, and assess the broader 'memecoin' segment of the market. Revisiting Network Metrics When I wrote This Dog Wants To Run in late-October, there were several very specific on-chain metrics that I felt offered a favorable short-term setup to DOGE bulls. There is no question that we've seen network fees take off for DOGE in the last two months: Dogecoin (Token Terminal) Fees surpassed $552k in November. Which was about a 330% year-over-year gain over November 2023. To be clear, while this is a significant surge for Dogecoin, it's far less than what larger chains like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) typically do for monthly fees. More importantly, following the initial spike in fees in November, the trend in daily fees has been down for close to five weeks. This is indicative of declining usage. Recall what my leading indicator was for the expected rally in DOGE back in October: What I find interesting about this chart is over the last 5 years we've generally seen starts and peaks in active addresses lead price. In early 2021 active address growth lead coin price between March and May. It happened again between November 2023 and March 2024. The same appears to be happening again with Dogecoin active addresses grinding higher by about 20% starting at the beginning of September. To say that daily active addresses exploded following that article would be an understatement: Dogecoin (CoinMetrics) In mid-November, there was a five-day period when the chain had over 1 million DAAs each day. That has never happened on Dogecoin before. The problem is, activity has since fallen right back to normal levels, and yet price remains elevated. The big difference between this active address spike and the one that preceded it in the Spring is DAAs didn't lead price, price led usage. My general view is that it's more indicative of fundamental weakness than strength. But to recap, we now have declines in fees, declines in active addresses, and prices still holding closer to recent highs despite the drops in chain usage. I suspect the price will follow everything else lower. Technicals In October, I shared my technical thoughts on the DOGE price and shared what, I felt, was a clear breakout in a downward diagonal resistance trend line. I see a different signal in the chart now: DOGE (TrendSpider) This is a very different setup following what has been a magnificent rally since the end of October. But traders/investors should not overlook some of the warning signs on this chart. First, DOGE has now re-entered what is essentially a massive air-pocket between 20 cents and 36 cents. There was very little actual price discovery on the way up, and I suspect the same will be true on the way down. But that's admittedly just a guess. The bigger issues are the massive bearish divergences between November 13th and December 9th. The 200-day moving average - currently sitting at 17 cents, shows substantial downside risk if the coin were simply to revisit previous levels. Finally, DOGE isn't even technically oversold yet at a 14-day RSI of 32. This could grind much lower before any 'dead cat' bounce. DOGE/BTC Weekly (TrendSpider) It wasn't just the DOGE/USD chart where we had breakouts back in October. The DOGE/BTC chart also looked quite bullish for Dogecoin when I wrote my last DOGE piece. That too looks exhausted after the sizable move higher. In October, I felt 253 sats per DOGE was a fitting price target. DOGE smashed through that level and went all the way to 492 sats before falling back below 400. At minimum, I believe the market will take DOGE back to 250 sats though I certainly wouldn't rule out another 'overshoot' of that target to the downside since we had one to the upside. Memes and DOGE For me, one of the biggest reasons why DOGE has very limited upside from here (if any) is because there is now too much competition for liquidity in the memecoin segment. With the proliferation of memecoins in the cryptocurrency market, eight of the top hundred cryptocurrencies by market cap are memecoins - and five of those eight memecoins are dog-related. Memecoins (CoinMarketCap) Memecoins actually account for $91.5 billion of the $3.3 trillion total cryptocurrency market cap. Memecoins have been so popular, in part, due to platforms like pump.fun, that Artemis tracks memecoins as an industry segment in its benchmark index: YTD Crypto Benchmark Index (Artemis) At one point in December, the memecoin segment was up almost 400% year to date. Now at just 200% year to date, memecoins have given back almost half their 2024 gains in just a couple of weeks, and yet they're still leading the industry as a category in terms of year to date gains. There is a significant amount of 'extrinsic value' that is potentially going to get unwound in this market, and DOGE will not be immune from that. Closing Thoughts As has occasionally been the case through the existence of the coin, DOGE was a terrific trade back in October. However, the setup is very different now. The fundamental story has deteriorated, with fees and active addresses in clear decline since the November pops. The technical story looks rough in my estimation, judging by the bearish divergences on the DOGE/USD daily chart and the potential weakness against BTC that can be expected on the DOGE/BTC weekly chart. But the bottom line in my view is the harder they come, the harder they fall. Memecoins have owned the year as a segment, judging by percentage appreciation. I suspect 2025 is going to be very different than 2024. If you made bank on this DOGE run, I'd take the win.",DOGE-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-20 04:26:00

The agreement, which needs the approval of the IMF Executive Board, aims to support El Salvador’s reform agenda, boost fiscal and external sustainability, and create conditions for stronger, inclusive growth. IMF Loan Agreement with El Salvador According to the official press release , the program is expected to catalyze additional financial support from the World Bank and regional development banks, bringing the total financing package to over $3.5 billion during the program period. As part of El Salvador’s $1.4 billion deal with the IMF, the government has agreed to scale back its ambitious Bitcoin policies to address financial stability concerns. Legal reforms will make Bitcoin usage optional for private businesses, removing the mandate that had been in place since the cryptocurrency was adopted as legal tender in 2021. Meanwhile, for the public sector, Bitcoin-related activities will be strictly limited, with the government no longer accepting BTC for tax payments. Additionally, the state-run Chivo wallet, which facilitated Bitcoin transactions for citizens, will see its government involvement gradually phased out. These measures are intended to mitigate risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility and safeguard financial integrity, as per IMF’s statement. The program also includes improved transparency, regulation, and oversight of digital assets to protect consumers and investors while maintaining financial stability. By taking a step back from its cryptocurrency experiment, the Salvadoran government aims to rebuild confidence in its broader fiscal policies and align with IMF recommendations, a move expected to attract further international financial support and stabilize the economy. “IMF staff thank the Salvadorean authorities for the excellent collaboration and candid dialogue over the past months in the development of their economic reform program aimed at continuing to improve the prosperity of El Salvador and all of its people.” Criticisms President Nayib Bukele has staunchly advocated for Bitcoin as a key part of his administration’s economic strategy, investing heavily in the cryptocurrency to promote financial autonomy. Despite Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000, yielding a whopping 123.67% return on the government’s $269.7 million investment, the IMF’s conditions have compelled El Salvador to alter its BTC strategy. Critics argued that Bukele has now surrendered to the demands of global financial powers. As one financial analyst noted , Bukele’s decision to take a $3.5 billion loan from the IMF has led to accusations of selling out, calling it an ironic shift for someone who once criticized fiat currency.

Meme coins are having a subpar performance and their upside has likely reached a peak after strong November gains. Both Dogecoin and Dogwifhat are down on a weekly and daily basis at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the Rollblock (RBLK) presale continues to gather momentum, with $7.3 million raised so far. The pioneering GambleFi protocol aspires to disrupt a $450 billion industry with a decentralized solution to return profits to players and investors instead of centralized insiders. Whales Fear Missing Out On Rollblock One reason large investors are moving away from meme tokens to presales like Rollblock is the market use case. Rollblock has a clear market proposition tackling centralized gambling, which retains all of the profits. It offers over 7,000 gaming opportunities for players and recently added a lucrative sports betting feature. All of this is supported by Rollblock’s revenue share model. Every week, Rollblock will use 30% of revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the market. 60% of the purchased tokens are burned to promote price appreciation. The remaining 40% are used in the form of staking rewards. Token holders can earn up to 30% APY via staking alone. The redistribution of earnings is a huge incentive to players, who will also benefit from instant crypto deposits. Rollblock is 100% licensed and verified and uses blockchain technology to make transactions irrefutable. The presale offers a limited-time 20% token bonus and the coin already retails at a discount. Currently priced at $0.0415, the RBLK token will appreciate to $0.047 in the next round. In total, analysts predict a 720% increase from the start to the end of the presale, with early investors already seeing huge returns. Dogecoin Disappoints Token Holders News about Elon Musk’s appointment as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initially helped to increase the price of Dogecoin. Selling for $0.10 in early November, Dogecoin shot to $0.42 in mid-December, a 4x increase. But it is unlikely to rise much further and is down 3% over the past week. Such a large November rally will be hard to sustain without a retracement, and Dogecoin currently trades at $0.39, about 60% of its ATH. Moving forward, DOGE’s upside potential remains limited compared to other coins. Nonetheless, there are some positive indicators. Meme coins are known to lag a little when it comes to Bitcoin-led rallies. Moreover, 5.8 million Dogecoin have been recently reactivated, which could have a positive price impact. Dogwifhat Drops 14% In 7 Days Down 14% last week and 8% in 24 hours, Dogwifhat is faring even more poorly than Dogecoin. Dogwifhat does not have Elon Musk’s support or the first-mover effect of Dogecoin. This Dogwifhat price decline occurred despite positive news for the ecosystem, including WIF/USDT trading on the Binance US exchange on December 11th. In other bearish news for Dowwifhat, a whale offloaded $3.4 million worth of tokens to Coinbase last week. Acquired nearly a year before, the whale recorded an impressive 9x profit, purchasing the tokens for only $390,000. With the current retracement in the altcoin market, it seems to have been a timely move. Rollblock Going Viral As Top Altcoin Alternative With volatility in the crypto markets, whales are choosing to migrate to presales that offer both early bird pricing and better price potential. Analysts predict Rollblock to 100x or more after the presale completes in early 2025 and neither Dogwifhat nor Dogecoin can offer comparable returns.

Offering ROIs much above its rivals, the revolutionary decentralized exchange Lunex Network (LNEX) is generating great investment interest thanks to its unmatched security, privacy, and cross-chain capabilities. Could this under-the-radar token outperform top crypto coins like BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL) as analysts estimate exponential increases for LNEX in this bull cycle? Read on to find out why experts think Lunex Network might be the most rewarding investment choice this cycle. Lunex Network (LNEX) Offers Secure and Anonymous Trading Providing a rare mix of security, anonymity, and cross-chain efficiency, Lunex Network distinguishes itself in the competitive decentralized exchange (DEX) sector. Lunex Network guarantees top-tier security by means of a comprehensive audit by SOLIDProof , therefore ensuring that its smart contracts are free from major flaws. Maintaining some of the lowest transaction fees in the industry, Lunex Network lets users immediately trade over 50,000 coins across more than 40 blockchains. Lunex Network also gives Web3 developers access to 65+ RPC nodes, therefore providing a flexible toolkit for growth inside the ecosystem. Lunex Network provides a safe, anonymous platform that safeguards user data while enabling flawless crypto transactions for privacy-conscious traders wishing to evade invasive KYC processes. For investors, Lunex Network offers a promising prospect given that LNEX is priced at just $0.0046 in the presale. Meanwhile, those who bought LNEX at $0.0012 have already achieved a 283% ROI and analysts project an additional 300% surge before the presale ends. BNB (BNB) Displays Strong Bullish Momentum Over the past week, the BNB price has barely increased by 2% . The BNB price is currently ranging between $738 and $696. Driven by BNB’s (BNB) outstanding performance over the previous month, the community is overwhelmingly optimistic. The altcoin soared by more than 15% during this period, according to the BNB price chart, and on December 4 it reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $793. Although BNB (BNB) has already dropped by 10% from this height, experts see this as a reasonable pullback with hopes for a rally to reach $800 before the year ends. Strong technical indicators like the MACD, Awesome Oscillator, and Moving Averages—all of which point to ongoing purchasing pressure on the BNB price chart—help to support the positive outlook for the altcoin. Additionally, analysts are forecasting BNB (BNB) to reach the much-expected $1,000 milestone in this cycle. Solana (SOL) Bulls Set Eyes on a $300 Breakout Since it declined over 5% in the past week and more than 10% over the past month, the Solana price has lately shown negative days. The Solana price has been fluctuating between $235 and $210 among these falls. Holders are worried about this bearish behavior, but some hope was rebuilt following the bullish rejection on the Solana price chart at the $205 support level. Meanwhile, several analysts expect a retest of Solana’s all-time high (ATH) before the year ends. Strong technical signals support the argument for a possible comeback. The MACD and Moving Averages both provide a purchasing signal on the Solana price chart, suggesting that the altcoin may soon rally once more. The prospect of a breakout to the $300 level before the year ends excites investors especially as Solana (SOL) starts to show indications of rebuilding bullish momentum. One of the bullish patterns observed is how Solana (SOL) has seen multiple rejections around the $220 to $204 support zone. Lunex Network Set To Outshine BNB and Solana While Solana (SOL) eyes a $300 breakthrough and BNB (BNB) aims for new highs, Lunex Network (LNEX) is quietly transforming decentralized trading—and early investors are benefiting. Lunex Network is redefining the DeFi space with its unsurpassed security, anonymity, and cross-chain adaptability. Unlike BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL), LNEX promises early exponential gains as analysts estimate a startling 1,800% increase in the next few months when the token launches on several Tier-1 exchanges.

37868137,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630828,1734670231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37868137.jpeg,Blockstream’s Adam Back defends BlackRock ad that questioned Bitcoin’s 21M cap,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/adam-back-defends-blackrock-ad/,"Blockstream CEO and Hashcash inventor Adam Back has come to the defense of BlackRock after the company’s recent Bitcoin ad triggered an outrage across the crypto community. It featured a small but explosive disclaimer: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” For Bitcoiners, the Bitcoin ad was a shot at the heart of what the asset stands for. Back, though, has downplayed the controversy. He explained that the disclaimer was a legal protection inserted by BlackRock’s lawyers, not a statement of intent. “Obviously, their lawyers made them write that as they sell investment products and don’t have control,” Back said. But for a community allergic to corporate meddling, his words did little to extinguish the fire. Bitcoiners can’t trust BlackRock There have already been concerns of forceful centralization by what is largely believed to be the most powerful company on the planet. X users speculated that BlackRock might be preparing to influence the Bitcoin protocol. One even called the ad “very spooky.” The ad’s timing only added to the suspicion. BlackRock manages over 524,000 Bitcoin worth $53 billion through its exchange-traded fund (ETF), making it the largest institutional player in the market. For Bitcoin’s true believers, such concentrated influence is unnerving. Critics outside the Bitcoin bubble joined in. Longtime Bitcoin antagonist Peter Schiff wasted no time tearing into the ad, calling it packed with falsehoods and labeling Wall Street’s embrace of Bitcoin as disingenuous. And though his words may not carry weight with Bitcoiners, they amplified the outrage surrounding the ad. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is the bedrock of its value proposition. It’s what sets it apart from inflation-prone fiat currencies. The cap is hard-coded into Bitcoin’s design, making it impossible to change without consensus. Even so, the mere suggestion of altering it has always been a taboo topic. Old battles with new players The ad is dragging people back to the Blocksize War, that hostile beef in the Bitcoin community from 2015 to 2017. The whole argument was about whether Bitcoin’s block size should be increased to make transactions faster and cheaper. On one side were the “big blockers,” who pushed for larger block sizes to scale Bitcoin as a payment system. On the other were the “small blockers,” who argued that increasing the block size would centralize the network by making it harder for individuals to run nodes. The conflict reached a boiling point with the New York Agreement in 2017 proposal, which wanted to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) while also doubling the block size. Some folks saw it as an attempt by corporations to hijack Bitcoin, and a grassroots movement known as the User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) forced SegWit activation without miner approval. The fallout though led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork that adopted larger block sizes. Its effects are still felt to this day.

It also added that the collaboration aims to improve the efficiency of governmental transactions while promoting fiscal responsibility. This alliance represents an important step toward leveraging the potential of digital currencies to foster sustainable economic growth, stability, and financial inclusion, noted Ramaswamy.

Bitcoin shot up strongly after Donald Trump’s election victory, leading to a price above $100,000. According to the report by Financial Times, the data from Hedge Fund Research shows that hedge funds that used crypto strategies shared a gain of 46% in November, bringing total yearly gains for the niche to 76%. Compared to the rest of the hedge fund industry, these returns were very strong in what would otherwise be a 10% average win. Crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital was among the big winners The rally accelerated since Trump’s election win in November and boosted the value of the largest digital asset, Bitcoin. Brevan Howard and Galaxy Digital were among the big winners. The surge also pushed up the value of smaller digital tokens. This year, bitcoin has surged 130% to around $100,000, driving the total market value for major cryptocurrencies to rise by $1.8 trillion to $3.5 trillion. But this week, the market declined slightly as the Federal Reserve signaled it would boost interest rates less than anticipated next year, which pummels high-risk assets.

He suggests that this anticipated surge could make XRP holders some of the wealthiest investors in the market. In recent months, XRP has gained significant attention due to its impressive price movements. Notably, the cryptocurrency rose from $0.51 at the start of November to $2.90 by December 3, representing a staggering 464% increase within a single month. While XRP faced a pullback after this peak, consolidating between $2 and $2.60 for two weeks, Steph maintains that an even larger rally may be on the horizon. Bollinger Bands Indicate Potential Breakout Steph’s analysis emphasizes the importance of key technical indicators, including the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour chart. These bands, which measure market volatility, are currently widening—a signal often associated with significant price movements. He noted that in November, a similar expansion of the Bollinger Bands preceded a 132% surge in XRP’s price. Additionally, past instances of this pattern have led to rallies of 53% and 120%. Based on the current expansion, Steph believes that XRP is primed for another breakout, which could further validate its bullish trajectory. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE THE RICHEST PEOPLE YOU KNOW – HERE’S WHY! pic.twitter.com/k0tc6tCAq0 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2024 Bull Flag Breakout Fuels Optimism Another bullish indicator highlighted by Steph is XRP’s breakout from a bull flag pattern on the daily chart. Such breakouts are typically seen as a continuation of upward price trends after a consolidation phase. The breakout has been confirmed by multiple daily closes above a critical long-term resistance level. As of now, XRP has maintained a position above the crucial support level of $2.33, as it currently trades at $2.35. Steph cautioned that failing to hold above this level could challenge the bullish narrative. However, if XRP sustains its position, the market outlook remains favorable. The analyst also identified $2.60 as a significant resistance level. A daily close above this threshold would further solidify the bullish case for XRP. He has set a short-to-medium-term target of $4.90 to $5 , supported by the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) ribbons on the daily chart. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Declining Bitcoin Dominance Boosts Altcoin Market Steph also addressed the role of Bitcoin dominance, a metric that tracks Bitcoin’s market share relative to other cryptocurrencies. He observed that Bitcoin dominance has been declining after breaking below a rising wedge pattern, currently testing the breakdown level near 57%. This trend is considered favorable for altcoins like XRP. Should Bitcoin dominance continue to decline, potentially reaching the 47–50% range, it could signal the start of an altcoin season. Historically, this range has acted as strong support during July 2021 and October 2021. Such conditions could create an environment conducive to XRP achieving its $5 price target. Steph advised investors to monitor Bitcoin dominance as it approaches the 47–50% zone. A reversal from this level could mark a turning point in the market, prompting investors to consider taking profits. Nevertheless, he emphasized that XRP and other altcoins currently exhibit strong potential for growth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A recent Chainalysis report revealed a dramatic rise in crypto thefts tied to North Korean hackers, who doubled their stolen assets in 2024 to over $1.3 billion. In parallel, Chainalysis has announced its acquisition of Hexagate, a Web3 security firm, signaling a proactive shift toward preventing such exploits. North Korean Hackers Double Crypto Theft in 2024, Chainalysis Reports In a chilling revelation, analytics firm Chainalysis has disclosed that hackers tied to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) have doubled their crypto theft in 2024 compared to the previous year. The report, released on Dec. 19, outlines how North Korean cybercriminals stole over $1.3 billion worth of digital assets across 47 incidents in 2024, accounting for a staggering 61% of all crypto thefts reported globally. The findings indicate a significant escalation in the scale and frequency of DPRK-linked cyberattacks. This marks a stark contrast to 2023, during which hackers tied to the isolated nation stole approximately $660 million in cryptocurrency. Chainalysis highlighted a worrying trend: not only are DPRK's crypto attacks becoming more frequent, but the hackers are also successfully pulling off larger exploits. The report noted that in 2024, attacks involving sums between $50 million and $100 million—and even those exceeding $100 million—occurred more often than in the prior year. This pattern diverges sharply from the two preceding years, when most of the DPRK’s exploits yielded profits below $50 million. “It appears that the DPRK’s crypto attacks are becoming more frequent,” Chainalysis reported. “Notably, attacks between $50 and $100 million, and those above $100 million occurred far more frequently in 2024 than they did in 2023, suggesting that the DPRK is getting better and faster at massive exploits.” Despite North Korea’s increasing activity, the overall global crypto theft landscape showed mixed signals. Chainalysis reported that hackers globally had stolen approximately $2.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2024, marking a 21% increase compared to 2023. However, this figure is still far below the record-setting $3.7 billion in crypto stolen in 2022. The first quarter of 2024 saw decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms as the primary target for hackers. However, the second and third quarters revealed a shift, with centralized services bearing the brunt of cyberattacks. Some of the most notable incidents in 2024 include: WazirX Hack (July): Hackers compromised one of the India-based exchange’s Safe multisig wallets on Ethereum, resulting in losses of $235 million—the largest single hack of the year. BingX Hack (September): Cybercriminals targeted this crypto exchange and made away with roughly $44 million worth of tokens. North Korea’s Political Ties and Reduced Activity in H2 2024 The Chainalysis report also touched on an intriguing observation: a marked decline in DPRK-linked hacking activity in the second half of 2024. According to the analytics firm, the drop in stolen funds after July 1 was “conspicuous,” coinciding with deepening political and military ties between North Korea and Russia. However, Chainalysis cautioned against drawing direct links to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Pyongyang earlier in the year. “The decline in funds stolen by the DPRK after July 1, 2024 is clear and the timing is conspicuous,” the report stated. “But it is nevertheless important to note that this decline is not necessarily associated with Putin’s visit to Pyongyang.” Chainalysis also noted that the year-end holidays could potentially see a resurgence of attacks, as hackers often exploit the season’s operational vulnerabilities. North Korean hackers have become notorious for orchestrating some of the most significant breaches in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Their activities have not only led to massive financial losses but also drawn heightened scrutiny from US authorities. The latter frequently impose sanctions on entities linked to DPRK’s money laundering efforts, which often involve laundering stolen crypto through complex networks of mixers and intermediaries. In recent years, these cyber exploits have served as a vital financial lifeline for North Korea, funding its nuclear weapons program and bypassing stringent international sanctions. The uptick in large-scale attacks in 2024 shines the spotlight on the evolving threat posed by DPRK hackers, even as the global crypto ecosystem attempts to bolster its defenses. While North Korea’s hackers had a “very active year,” Chainalysis reported that global hacking activity in the third and fourth quarters of 2024 declined compared to the same period in 2023. This trend offers a glimmer of hope, suggesting that improved security measures and international cooperation may be starting to curb some forms of cybercrime. Nevertheless, the ongoing evolution of North Korea’s cyber capabilities is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in the digital asset space. As hackers grow more adept at breaching even the most secure platforms, the industry faces an urgent need for continuous innovation in cybersecurity. The alarming scale of North Korea’s crypto exploits in 2024 serves as a wake-up call for the cryptocurrency industry, governments, and cybersecurity firms. With 2022 still holding the dubious distinction of being the worst year for crypto hacks, the path forward must involve collaboration across all stakeholders to minimize risks and protect the burgeoning digital economy. The report’s findings also raise questions about the geopolitical dimensions of crypto crime, particularly as nation-states leverage cybercrime as a strategic tool. As 2025 approaches, the global crypto community will undoubtedly keep a close eye on the DPRK’s next moves—and the broader implications for digital asset security. Chainalysis Acquires Web3 Security Firm Hexagate to Strengthen Blockchain Security In a related development, Chainalysis has announced its acquisition of Hexagate, a Web3 security firm specializing in threat detection and mitigation. The acquisition, revealed on Dec. 19, marks a significant step forward for Chainalysis as it pivots from its traditional focus on investigations into proactive prevention within the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Founded in 2022 and headquartered in Israel, Hexagate has quickly gained recognition for its advanced Web3 security solutions. The company’s offerings include real-time threat detection and tools to safeguard digital assets, which have reportedly prevented over $1 billion in potential losses for its clients. These clients include prominent names such as Coinbase and Consensys. Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin announced the acquisition on X, signaling a bold new chapter for the company. Levin stated: “We have spent 10 years following the money. Now it’s time to prevent the money from being stolen. Welcome to the era of secure smart contracts with proper monitoring and real-time threat detection. Announcing our acquisition of Hexagate.” In a blog post accompanying the announcement, Levin emphasized Chainalysis’s evolving mission to transition from being a leader in blockchain investigations to a trailblazer in preventative security measures. He noted that expanding into Web3 security is a natural progression for the company as it seeks to protect the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem from increasingly sophisticated threats. While the announcement shows the strategic importance of Hexagate to Chainalysis’s future endeavors, many details remain undisclosed. The purchase price for Hexagate has not been revealed, and it remains unclear whether the acquisition will lead to significant changes in Hexagate’s leadership or operational structure. Chainalysis’s Shift to Prevention The acquisition of Hexagate signals a broader strategic shift for Chainalysis. Since its founding, the company has been renowned for its blockchain analytics capabilities, assisting law enforcement and regulatory agencies in tracing illicit crypto transactions. Now, it aims to tackle issues at the root by preventing theft and fraud before they occur. Levin’s leadership appears to be a driving force behind this pivot. Having taken over as CEO in October 2024 following the departure of Michael Gronager, Levin has been vocal about the company’s aspirations to expand its services and respond to the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology. Hexagate’s expertise in protecting smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms is expected to complement Chainalysis’s existing suite of blockchain analytics tools. By integrating Hexagate’s real-time monitoring and threat detection capabilities, Chainalysis aims to offer a more comprehensive solution to its clients, bridging the gap between investigation and prevention. Levin’s vision for Chainalysis’s future extends beyond technological advancements. The CEO has also speculated about potential regulatory changes under the incoming US administration. He suggested that greater clarity surrounding digital assets, including the repeal of rules like the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), could pave the way for a more secure and transparent blockchain industry.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-20 05:30:00

Experts Double Down on Rollblock",https://timestabloid.com/stellar-rallies-big-suis-turn-next-experts-double-down-on-rollblock/,"There is a great crypto rally going on, with Bitcoin peeking above $108k before retracting again, but the $110k Bitcoin is inevitable. This highly positive Bitcoin price is great for all cryptos, with the Stellar price living up to its name with a stellar 80% increase on a 30-day candle. Sui is not doing too badly either, and it calls for a deeper look. However, the star of this crypto rally seems to be Rollblock , a new online gambling platform that is raking in presale investment dollars . Rollblock (RBLK): Gambling investment now available to retail investors Globally, online gambling is huge, worth over $500 billion annually. But it’s not been an investment available to the moguls and millionaires of Monaco and Macau. Engaging with the profits made in gambling was not available to Joe Everyman – until now! Rollblock is a new Ethereum-based online casino currently holding a presale to enlarge its liquidity pool. The kicker: it is an income-bearing asset. Every week, Rollblock pays out a dividend to all its token holders. Everyone who has RBLK token gets a share of the takings. The best news is that this is not something in the future, ‘when we get there’. Rollblock ’s online casino dApp is alive and running, sporting thousands of games, both digital and live, across all genres. There’s something for everyone in Rollblock , and it’s no surprise the presale has recently exceeded $7.3 million . Stellar (XLM): Stellar price rides coattails of XRP on crypto rally Depending on how one looks at it, Stellar i s either a complementary product to XRP or a competitor. XRP is racing up the charts, the feel-good story of the year, but the Stellar price is not too far behind. A cynical look will say that Stellar is riding XRP’s coattails, as both tokens facilitate cross-border payments, and Stellar shares much of its coding with XRP. A kinder reading states that Stellar is gaining thanks to its intrinsic value proposition. But no matter how one slices it, the truth is plain to see: the Stellar price is up 350% on a 90-day candle and has overtaken Polkadot to occupy the #16 spot on the market cap rankings. Sui (SUI): Breakthrough blockchain to break out? Sui is still relatively new, only listed in May 2023, but it has made some fantastic climbs since August of this year. Sui went up four dollars from $0.60 to $4.60 in a mere three and a half months, delivering a 666% increase. Is Sui done, or is it just getting started? There’s more than enough room for Sui on the blockchain market. With Ethereum’s gas fees becoming a major challenge and Solana’s reliability problems constantly hobbling it, Sui is perfectly positioned to make a play for the dApp development platform of choice. There may be a ton of growth left in Sui . Conclusion The crypto rally has delivered a “ Stellar” price , and Sui is reaching for the stars. Crypto is changing the way the world works, and we’re in the early days. There has never been a better time to invest. Stellar, Sui, and Rollblock will all make great additions to a well-balanced crypto portfolio. Sui and Stellar are available on all good exchanges, but Rollblock is only available directly from their website at $0.0415. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

World Liberty Financial Links With Justin Sun In Major Token Swap According to blockchain data analytics firm Nansen, a digital wallet linked to President-elect’s World Liberty Financial swapped its entire holding of 103 cbBTC tokens for WBTC on a Wednesday operation. Wrapped Bitcoin serves as a bridge for Bitcoin (BTC) holders to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, enabling broader participation in the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts Major Altcoin Season As Market Cap Eyes Record Levels Although World Liberty has been marketed as a decentralized finance lending platform, it has yet to become operational as it is still in early stages of development and presales of its WLF token. Sun, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur known for his high-profile investments and attention-grabbing antics—including purchasing a banana duct-taped to a wall for $6.2 million—invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial in November, becoming an adviser to the project. His involvement appears to have pushed World Liberty past a financial threshold that could allow Trump to profit from the enterprise, potentially securing at least $15 million for the Trump family based on terms outlined in World Liberty’s “gold paper.” Trump’s Crypto Initiative Struggles The recent token swap follows World Liberty’s earlier cryptocurrency acquisitions, including significant investments in Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK). Additionally, Nansen’s data indicates that the project’s wallets received around $250,000 in ONDO, a token from Ondo Finance, which specializes in tokenization. The backdrop of these transactions is marked by controversy, particularly following a backlash triggered by a strategic partnership between Sun’s BiT Global and crypto custody firm BitGo, the operator of Wrapped Bitcoin. This partnership prompted US-based crypto exchange Coinbase to seek a delisting of WBTC from its exchange due to concerns over Sun’s potential influence and control. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surge To $200,000 By Mid-2025 Amid ‘Mild’ Price Pullbacks: Report Earlier this month, BiT Global filed a lawsuit against Coinbase in response to the delisting, but a federal judge in California ruled in favor of Coinbase, denying BiT Global’s request for a temporary restraining order. Despite the promotional efforts by Trump and his sons, World Liberty Financial has faced challenges in the market, with sales reportedly falling 93% short of projections. This lack of traction raises questions about the project’s viability and its ability to fulfill its ambitious promises of transforming the financial landscape. At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has fallen to the $3.3 trillion mark, after hitting an all-time high of $3.73 trillion on Tuesday, which also pushed the price of Bitcoin to a new record above $108,000.

On Wednesday, the Fed cut the benchmark borrowing cost as expected but penciled in only two rate cuts for 2025, down from four projected in September. The central bank stressed that it's not interested in participating in a potential government plan to build a strategic BTC reserve. Since then, BTC has dropped over 8%, hitting lows near $96,000 at one point. As of writing, the cryptocurrency changed hands near $97,500, down nearly 10% from the record high of $108,266 reached early this week, CoinDesk data show. The losses have caused the 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) to dip below the 200-hour SMA, confirming a bearish crossover. The pattern suggests that the ongoing pullback could evolve into a deeper one, although it has failed to live up to its reputation during the recent bull run. Bitcoin has experienced a few pullbacks during its post-U.S. election rally from $70,000 to over $100,000, and each of these dips has ended with a bearish crossover of the 50- and 200-hour SMAs. The latest crossover, therefore, offers hope to bulls expecting a renewed move into six figures above $100,000. A potential bounce could face resistance near $10,600, a level identified by the descending trendline, representing the recent price drop. A violation there would open doors for record highs. It's important to remember that patterns don't always play out as expected, and the contrary indicator discussed above may fail, potentially leading to a deeper drop. The first sign of trouble will be if prices move below the overnight low of $96,000, which could expose the swing low of around $91,000 recorded on Dec. 5.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-20 05:36:57

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 05:53:00

According to a Bloomberg report, Gov. Eli Remolona said on Friday that the Philippine Central Bank was closely watching the peso drop and intervening in currency markets. Indonesia promised to defend the rupiah (IDR) to stabilize markets, while Brazil said it spent $14 billion last week to strengthen the real (BRL). Developing economies are facing mounting pressure. India’s rupee and Brazil’s real reached all-time lows, and South Korea’s won tumbled to a 15-year low. A weakening currency can worsen inflation and raise the cost of servicing debt for those nations that depend on foreign borrowing. Currency strategist Christopher Wong said fighting a strong dollar trend is tough, and “intervention in such an environment can only slow the pace of currency depreciation. Despite that, central banks may still have to use a mix of verbal and actual intervention tools”. Emerging-market FX has faced a sharp quarterly decline Source: Bloomberg Since late September, the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index has dropped 3.3%, its sharpest quarterly decline in two years. It has compounded the challenges with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stance matching a more cautious approach. This will lead to fewer interest-rate cuts next year and increased concerns about inflation. With a strong dollar, emerging market central banks are willing to take bold action to save their currencies from falling too far and stave off even wider economic damage. On Friday, South Korea said it will increase the limit banks can hold in forward contracts by 50% of its foreign currency reserves. The move is an effort to attract more money to enter the country to balance the currency market supply and demand. At the same time, China’s central bank intervened to prop up the yuan, setting its daily reference rate much higher than the market had been projecting.

GalaChain is the first hyperledger fabric chain to release this update and this strategic migration represents a critical step towards creating a more secure and decentralized blockchain environment. The transition is currently underway in the test environment, with plans to implement the changes on the mainnet in the near future. When completed, GalaChain will distinguish itself as one of the pioneering public Hyperledger Fabric blockchains to successfully implement this sophisticated consensus mechanism. Migrating From Raft to BFT Consensus At the heart of this upgrade is a drastic improvement in network resilience. Raft, a Crash Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm, falls short in scenarios involving malicious activity. It operates under the assumption that network nodes will behave predictably and without malicious intent. It can effectively manage non-malicious failures like system crashes or temporary downtime. However, this approach leaves significant vulnerabilities in a landscape increasingly threatened by sophisticated cyber attacks. For instance, a compromised leader node or a network partition could disrupt operations and lead to incorrect decisions. This highlights the need for a more superior and secured upgrade. The BFT Advantage Over Raft By contrast, BFT algorithm introduces a more sophisticated approach to network consensus. It is designed for hostile environments where some nodes may behave maliciously. BFT algorithms can withstand and neutralize potential malicious activities by requiring consensus from a substantial majority. Even if up to one-third of nodes act maliciously, it demands consensus from two-thirds of honest network nodes before finalizing any transaction. This means that even if some nodes attempt to send false messages or manipulate the consensus process, the network remains stable and secure. This critical feature significantly reduces the risk of single point of failure, fortifying the network against targeted attacks and improving fault tolerance. Building Trust and Reliability The implications of this upgrade extend beyond mere technical optimization. For users and developers in the Gala Games ecosystem, the BFT migration promises enhanced trust, improved transaction reliability, and a more robust blockchain infrastructure that can effectively resist potential security threats. As blockchain transitions with features that reduce risks and improves security, Gala Games’ proactive approach to network security demonstrates a commitment to the future of the ecosystem by creating trustworthy digital platforms.",Crypto News|Press Release|GalaChain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|GALA,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-12-20 05:56:35

However, it remains bullish but is still finding a key level to initiate a fresh buy. The price is currently under retracement. The late November drops continued to bring a notable setback for Sol’s bulls on a daily scale, though the $200 level has suppressed selling since the market witnessed a sudden meltdown over the past week. Following a short recovery, the $240 level posed a threat to the bulls and the price fell, though the volatility currently looks insignificant due to low supply. A big loss should be expected if the supply level increases. Looking at the choppy price actions over the past week, Sol appeared to be gathering liquidity for another major sell-off capable of retracing the price lower to the $190 and $180 area, where the buyers are patiently waiting to initiate an entry in the next few days. While the ongoing retracement phase provides a discount for a long-term reaccumulation, we can expect a huge rebound once the price tests the white ascending trendline, acting as diagonal support since September. A breakdown of this line could result in an end of the bullish move. But from a technical perspective, more growth is expected in the future. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As Sol advances retracement near a weekly support level of $210, the price must break below $200 before testing $194 and $183.4, where the trendline lies. From there, we can expect a bounce back. But if the price recovers from the current trading level, the immediate resistance level to watch on the way up is $247, followed by $264.4. A break up there could rocket the price to $280 and $300 in no time.

It appeared bearish daily and now sits above September’s high. The past month has been tough for Floki as it failed to advance bullishly above the $0.0003 level. An attempt to break above this key level earlier this month proved abortive and the crypto formed a double-top pattern. This bearish pattern led to a serious breakdown this week and the price plunged below the key $0.0002 level yesterday. Volatility increased today and it slipped to a low of $0.000177 for the first in three months. Rejecting this low, the price bounced back and now trades at $0.000188. A further bounce could bring a fast retest at the broken key level before deciding on where next to head. For now, the bears are gaining control. However, it is important to note that the latest breakdown is considered a retracement of last month’s impulsive movement. We can expect the bulls to step back in action if the current daily low holds as support. Otherwise, Floki may enter the $0.00015 range before bouncing back. Looking back, it has seen over $25% losses in the past month of trading. Floki’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview A drop below the holding $0.000177 support level could slide the price to a low of $0.0001483 this week. The lower price level to watch for support is $0.000125 – where it initiated a surge in volatility last month. The $0.00021 level is considered the closest resistance for a test. If Floki climbs above it, the $0.000283 resistance is the next level to watch for a break up to the $0.00035 resistance – printed in June. Key Resistance Levels: $0.00021, $0.000283, $0.00035 Key Support Levels: $0.000177, $0.0001483, $0.000125 Spot Price: $0.000188 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The legal battle forced Ripple executives to disclose critical information to the public. Ripple’s lawsuit helped create strategic partnerships while accumulating XRP from retail. The legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sparked widespread discussion, with many viewing it as a crucial event for the crypto sector. Some believe the lawsuit aimed to block Ripple’s efforts to challenge established financial systems or compete with Ethereum, while others see it as a calculated move by Ripple to achieve broader objectives. A Different Perspective Vincent Van Code, a blockchain analyst, suggests that Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC may have been part of a carefully planned global strategy. According to him, the lawsuit might have been initiated to accomplish specific objectives, such as slowing Ripple’s rapid expansion and allowing for a detailed examination of its operations. He argues that this approach helped Ripple strengthen its credibility and position within a regulated environment.

On Dec. 18, the SEC greenlighted the crypto index ETF proposal from Franklin Templeton, allowing it to trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The following day, the commission approved Hashdex’s crypto index ETF, which is set to trade on the Nasdaq stock market. Franklin Templeton’s proposal was granted “accelerated approval” after its updated filing met the necessary requirements and was deemed “substantially similar” to previously approved spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products. Crypto index ETFs track the performance of multiple cryptocurrencies, offering investors diversified exposure to the digital asset market through a single investment vehicle. It replicates the performance of an underlying index by holding the same assets in similar proportions. Hashdex’s Crypto Index ETF will track the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, while Franklin Templeton’s product mimics the performance of the Institutional Digital Asset Index, both of which primarily focus on spot Bitcoin and Ether. Franklin Templeton submitted its filing for the Franklin Crypto Index ETF in August, while Hashdex initially filed its S-1 in June and later submitted an amended application on Nov. 25. You might also like: Franklin Templeton crypto index ETF delayed by SEC The SEC had previously requested more time to evaluate both proposals, citing the need for a thorough assessment. Hashdex and Franklin Templeton addressed these concerns by submitting revised filings, which the commission, in its Dec. 19 notice , stated were consistent with regulatory requirements designed to prevent fraud and manipulation, protect investors, and ensure the integrity of the market. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the funds are “likely” to go live in January, with Bitcoin making up about 80% and Ether 20% of the holdings. With the first crypto index funds approved, experts like ETF Store President Nate Geraci believe more issuers will follow suit, anticipating “meaningful demand” for such products as advisors seek diversification. Last month, Bitwise filed a proposal with the SEC to launch a spot Bitcoin and Ether ETP on the NYSE Arca. The fund aims to provide investors with balanced exposure to the two largest crypto assets in an accessible format, according to a Nov. 26 statement from the asset manager. These developments coincide with upcoming leadership changes at the SEC , as Chair Gary Gensler has announced his resignation, effective January 20, 2025, the day President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office.

This upgrade introduces pessimistic proofs to secure cross-chain transactions cryptographically, bolstering the ecosystem. Eternal AI is also leveraging the network’s infrastructure to decentralize AI agents. With developments in NFTs, real-world assets, and AI integration, POL price could be on track to hit $1 soon. Polygon AggLayer Testnet Goes Live with Pessimistic Proofs Polygon announced the launch of its AggLayer v0.2 testnet on December 20, marking a pivotal moment for the platform. This update introduces “pessimistic proofs,” a first-of-its-kind innovation aimed at enhancing blockchain interoperability. These proofs guarantee the safety of cross-chain transactions by tracking balances cryptographically. By reducing risks and enabling seamless communication across EVM chains, pessimistic proofs are poised to set a new standard in secure decentralized ecosystems. Despite slight delays from initial expectations, the testnet launch signals significant progress. Polygon’s roadmap reveals an early 2025 mainnet launch, cementing its position as a leader in blockchain infrastructure. Beyond this, Eternal AI, a decentralized AI agent powered by the network, is expected to revolutionize AI applications, blending secure interoperability with cutting-edge machine-learning capabilities.

The POL price currently trading at $0.48, with a 24-hour range of $0.46 to $0.52, reflecting an 8% price drop. However, it has gained 12% over the past month and 21% in the last quarter, showcasing consistent upward momentum. Market interest in POL has increased significantly, especially as Binance.US announced its support for the MATIC-to-POL migration. The migration, set to begin on January 9 will convert all MATIC balances to POL at a 1:1 ratio, further driving attention toward the ecosystem. Binance.US outlines detailed guidelines for the migration, stating it will disable MATIC trading before the transition. It urges users to unstake MATIC in advance, as staking and unstaking will pause during the process. The migration will take two weeks, after which POL deposits, withdrawals, and trading will resume. This planned migration is likely to bolster POL’s adoption across the crypto market. Polygon’s ongoing innovations in NFTs, real-world asset tokenization, and decentralized AI are fueling speculation about POL’s potential to reach $1. With its expanding use cases and ecosystem growth, analysts remain optimistic that these developments could drive the token’s price upward in the coming months.

X account, hacked to promote a stablecoin",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/vivek-x-account-hacked-to-promote-stablecoin/,"Vivek Ramaswamy’s X account, the co-leader of the US government’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), was reportedly hacked. The breach led to the dissemination of false information about a purported partnership between D.O.G.E. and stablecoin project USUAL, resulting in a temporary surge in the price of the token. Through his official account on X (formerly Twitter), Ramaswamy allegedly announced a strategic collaboration between D.O.G.E and USUAL, an issuer of fiat-backed real world asset (RWA) stablecoins. According to the fraudulent post , the partnership aimed to leverage crypto initiatives to support the Donald Trump administration’s goal of reducing the federal fiscal deficit. It further claimed that the collaboration would enhance governmental transaction efficiency and promote fiscal responsibility. Fake announcement taken down, USUAL experiences price surge The announcement quickly drew attention and caused the price of $USUAL to spike by 31.08% to $1.61. Its market capitalization also surged by 38.73% to $720.2 million, although its 24-hour trading volume fell by 7.76% to $1.6 billion, per CoinMarketCap data . USUAL price spike – Source: CoinMarketCap However, the information was soon debunked as false, with Ramaswamy’s team confirming that his account had been hacked. The post was subsequently removed, and the team initiated swift action to regain control. Source: X James Fishback, founder of Invest Azoria, publicly clarified the situation, labeling the partnership claims as a scam. “I just spoke with Vivek. He has been hacked. He is locked out of his account. This is a scam,” Fishback wrote on X. Vivek’s influence on the government, which involves co-leading D.O.G.E. with billionaire Elon Musk, is likely the reason why hackers targeted his account. He is currently one of the “most watched” personalities, and he is at the center of Trump’s administration critics and supporters. December mauled with fake Social media crypto promotions Social media account hacks promoting fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes have become increasingly prevalent. These incidents often exploit public trust to orchestrate pump-and-dump schemes. Earlier this week, Anthropic ’s X account was similarly compromised, with hackers using the platform to promote a fake token called ‘CLAUDE.’ The fraudulent post about CLAUDE claimed the token would incentivize AI and crypto projects and included a wallet address for “investors.” The tweet remained live for approximately 30 minutes before being removed. On-chain data revealed that the attackers collected around $100,000 from speculative investors. Further analysis showed the hackers purchased 10% of the CLAUDE token’s supply across multiple wallets and quickly dumped their holdings for profit. The scammers had also falsely claimed the token’s focus was on AI agents, capitalizing on the growing interest in AI-related projects. The Anthropic (Claude) Twitter is likely hacked. Don't interact with any links, don't buy the token. — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) December 17, 2024 Celebrity Accounts Targeted for Scams This month, several high-profile figures have also been targeted. Canadian rapper Drake’s X account was compromised on December 15, with attackers promoting a meme coin called Anita. The token, purportedly tied to Drake’s upcoming Anita Max Wynn tour, generated $4.9 million in trading volume within hours, driven by his 39 million followers. Source: X The post claimed the token was developed in collaboration with Stake, a betting platform Drake is known to endorse. The surge in trading volume saw over 7,000 buy orders before blockchain analysts, including Zachxbt, identified the token as a scam. Other celebrities have experienced similar breaches. Cardi B and Doja Cat’s accounts were hacked in December 2024, while TikTok star Halley Welch, known for her viral “Hawk Tuah” video, is facing lawsuits after promoting the HAWK token. The token soared to a market cap of over $400 million before collapsing, leaving investors and Welch’s followers with significant losses. Welch has yet to respond to the rug pull allegations.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

On Dec. 19, the agency approved Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF , allowing it to trade on the Nasdaq stock market. At the same time, it authorized Franklin Templeton’s Franklin Crypto Index ETF for listing on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Both indexes will hold spot Bitcoin and spot Ether directly. The Franklin Crypto Index ETF will track the Institutional Digital Asset Index, designed to reflect the performance of digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ether. Meanwhile, Hashdex’s Crypto Index ETF will follow Bitcoin and Ether as part of the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index. Market-Cap Weighted Bitcoin-Ether ETFs Set for January Debut Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted a January launch for both funds. He said that these ETFs are market-cap weighted, with around 80% allocated to Bitcoin and 20% to Ethereum. The spot bitcoin/ether combo ETFs have been approved by SEC (as predicted). Launch likely in January. They’re mkt cap weight so 80/20 btc/eth approx. Notable that Hashdex & Frankie are first. Good for them. https://t.co/o2ri3XpqZi — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 20, 2024 The approvals came from amended filings where the Trusts’ structure and terms mirrored previously approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs under earlier SEC orders. The SEC also determined that the spot Bitcoin market closely aligns with the CME Bitcoin futures market, while the spot Ether market shows a similar correlation with the CME Ether futures market. Based on this correlation and its analysis, the SEC concluded that the surveillance-sharing agreements between the Exchanges and the CME could effectively detect and prevent fraudulent or manipulative activities tied to these proposals. Additionally, the SEC confirmed that the proposals met the Exchange Act’s standards, including rules to prevent fraud and manipulation, safeguard investors and support public interest. Hashdex Eyes Broader Market Appeal With Multi-Asset ETF Hashdex earlier announced that its multi-asset ETF will initially focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, with plans to potentially add Solana and Cardano in the future. By diversifying the ETF’s holdings across several major digital assets, the firm aims to minimize the volatility often associated with single-asset ETFs. This diversified strategy could attract a broader audience, appealing to both risk-averse investors and those seeking broader exposure to the digital asset market. ETFs have become increasingly popular because they offer a simple and regulated way to invest in a variety of assets. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, said it would be interesting to see if BlackRock or other firms might adopt a similar approach and introduce comparable ETFs. “Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors LOVE diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto,” he said.

The recently launched altcoin has attracted the attention of more crypto traders following the listing on major crypto exchanges led by Binance. According to the latest market data, the Usual token had a volume-to-market cap ratio of about 222 percent, after hitting a fully diluted valuation of about $6.3 billion. The highly liquid altcoin has attracted more than $1.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), through its USDO Stablecoin. Why Usual Protocols Matter a Ton The Usual protocol debuted as a secure and decentralized fiat stablecoin issuer, which redistributes ownership and governance through the USUAL token. The Usual protocol aggregates the growing RWA industry from leading entities led by BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, and Hashnote among others.

With only 12.37 percent of the USUAL token in circulating supply, the altcoin faces higher potential selling pressure as airdropped holders seek to take profits. From a technical analysis standpoint, USUAL price has been forming a rising wedge, as the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers in overbought territory of above 90 percent.

Right now, the category has over 120 L2 projects and holds more than $50 billion in total value locked (TVL). For years, L2s were mainly judged on how close they were to becoming fully decentralized. However, as L2s have grown, the security risks have become more apparent. Many projects lack proof systems and rely on centralized setups and this means that user funds are vulnerable. To address these issues, L2BEAT is rolling out a new framework to separate truly secure L2s from weaker alternatives. According to L2BEAT, these updates are expected to improve user security and transparency. L2BEAT is proposing three big changes According to L2BEAT, three big changes are coming to the ecosystem. The first will be the “Others” category. Projects without proper proof systems or sufficient data availability (DA) guarantees will now be classified under the new “Others” category . This group includes chains like Polygon PoS and certain OP Stack rollups that fail to meet the updated standards. Previously, these projects were considered L2s, but their setups often rely on centralized control or weak DA committees. Chains will also have to set up mandatory proof systems. A secure rollup is nothing without the right proof system, as that will allow permissionless exits and protect user funds even if permissioned actors become unavailable. L2BEAT now requires all rollups (a specific type of L2) to have these proof systems. Without one, they simply won’t be considered a proper rollup anymore. There are projects like StarkNet that already use proof systems to verify every state transition on Ethereum. Alt-DA L2s (like validiums and optimiums) must also meet stricter requirements for data availability guarantees. This includes having decentralized DA committees or proper DA attestation bridges. Many existing projects depend on small, centralized committees or external networks without proper guarantees, creating potential risks for users. L2BEAT said that projects have six months to make the necessary improvements to meet these new standards. So, by the middle of 2025, it expects them to have added proof systems and improved data security or face reclassification. There’s also an offer on grounds where L2BEAT will work with these teams to help them through the process. Community support is key Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, is fully on board with these stricter rules for L2 projects. Starting in 2025, he’ll only publicly support projects that meet the higher security standards (classified as Stage 1 or higher). This is a clear message to developers that security and decentralization need to be top priorities. “The era of rollups being glorified multisigs is coming to an end. The era of cryptographic trust is upon us,” said Buterin. The Ethereum community itself also plays a huge role in all of this. It starts making the space safer for everyone when it begins to only actively support projects that meet the new standards and raises questions about those that don’t. According to L2BEAT, it is not slowing down either. Instead, it will double its efforts to monitor and review proof systems in 2025. This means that it won’t just be looking to see if a project has a proof system but also checking how good and reliable those systems are. Initiatives like the ZK Catalog will help it do this more thoroughly. All of this ties into Ethereum’s bigger vision of a world of decentralized and secure L2s. It all starts by holding projects accountable and raising the bar for security so people can truly trust the technology they use Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|ETH|POL,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MATIC|TECHNOLOGY|OP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-20 07:30:43

Despite the sell-off, Solana’s price action remains resilient as it managed to hold above a critical support level, reinforcing confidence in its ability to weather macroeconomic shifts. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? While the market reacted to the Fed’s cautious tone, Solana’s on-chain metrics tell a more optimistic story. The number of daily transactions on the Solana network has surged, nearing 67 million, reflecting growing adoption and sustained network activity. This robust transaction volume highlights Solana’s position as a leading blockchain platform, with developers and users continuing to rely on its scalability and efficiency. Analysts suggest that holding above its key support level could position SOL for a strong rebound, particularly if broader market conditions stabilize. The increased on-chain activity adds to this bullish outlook, signaling that long-term fundamentals remain intact. Solana Holding Key Demand Solana demonstrates resilience in the face of market turbulence, holding above key demand levels around $210 following yesterday’s sell-off triggered by the Federal Reserve’s policy announcements. This critical support level reinforces bullish sentiment for the asset, with many analysts eyeing a breakout on the horizon. Top analyst Jelle recently provided a compelling technical analysis on X, noting that Solana successfully took out the lows, maintained its position above monthly and weekly support levels, and continued to trade within its falling wedge pattern. According to Jelle, this setup suggests a breakout is imminent, with Solana targeting new all-time highs soon. Supporting this optimistic outlook, on-chain metrics paint a promising picture for Solana’s network activity. Ali Martinez shared data showing the Solana network nearing 67 million daily transactions, underscoring strong adoption and user engagement. This heightened network activity highlights Solana’s utility and strengthens the foundation for sustained price growth. Related Reading: XRP Consolidation Could End Once It Clears $2.60 – Top Analyst Expects $4 Soon If Solana holds above the $210 level in the coming days, it could trigger a significant rally as bullish momentum builds. Traders and investors are closely watching the asset’s price action for signs of a decisive move, with the combination of strong technical and on-chain indicators pointing toward a potential surge to new highs. Price Action: Liquidity Resting Above Solana is trading at $210, a key level it has held for several days despite broader market volatility. This price point demonstrates solid demand, but holding this level alone won’t ignite the next rally. A decisive push above $240 is critical for Solana to regain bullish momentum. This move would signal renewed strength and pave the way for higher price targets. A crucial intermediate step lies at the $225 mark. If Solana can reclaim this level with conviction, it would likely confirm a bullish trend and set the stage for further upward momentum. This could attract additional buying interest as traders and investors interpret the move as a signal of strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? Failing to break above these resistance levels, however, may keep Solana range-bound and limit its ability to capitalize on the recent support it has established. As market conditions continue to evolve, Solana’s ability to push past these key thresholds will determine whether it transitions into a stronger upward trajectory or remains stuck in consolidation.

They are hugely capitalizing on the recent dips in Cardano and BNB prices as the market gains more momentum. While the duo is getting post-pullback accumulation, the real FOMO is circling Rollblock, the new all-rounder and iGaming innovation currently raising dust in its ongoing presale. In mere months, Rollblock has broken highs with over $7.5M raise. What’s driving the FOMO ? Let’s find out. Rollblock wins big in presale: GambleFi ingenuity and $7.5M Rollblock is quickly becoming the crypto market ‘s favorite as the ultimate investment opportunity for the year. Built on Ethereum, the platform combines the reliability of centralized gaming with the transparency of decentralized finance. The allure has attracted notable whale investments in its ninth presale stage. So far, Rollblock has had an exceptional run—the FOMO has reached a fever pitch, and over 22,000 investors have poured in $7.5M already. Even analysts predict an 880% return before the market debut, and RBLK has done 315% already. A key factor behind Rollblock’s growing appeal is its commitment to fairness and security. Rollblock leverages blockchain technology to provide provably fair odds to ensure every transaction is encrypted and secure from manipulation. In addition, Rollblock offers long-term benefits for investors through a revenue-sharing model and staking. This has made Rollblock a compelling opportunity for the whole crypto market . What’s even better? The presale price is an enticingly low $0.0415. Cardano Bitcoin bridge fuel whale accumulation despite SEC lawsuit FUD Rollblock’s rise to the limelight has proven how much FOMO the crypto market is experiencing right now. Another crypto that is getting a great share is the Ouroborus-based PoS network, Cardano . Despite a recent 16% pullback from its 24-month high of $1.25, Cardano is experiencing more intense demand due to its recent ecosystem development. The recent Cardano -Bitcoin bridge announced by Emurgo and BTCOS has incited FOMO . The pivotal step will open Cardano ‘s DeFi to Bitcoin’s $2 trillion ecosystem. Whales have gone on a buying spree despite lingering SEC-related FUD. However, the fundamentals are still perfect. TVL and ecosystem activities have risen to a new ATH. Is BNB the best bet in the next crypto market rally? The crown jewel of the Binance ecosystem is not left out, either. Ethereum is drawing a step closer to the $4k mark again, and BNB ‘s movement is hinting at the reality of a new altcoin season. Earlier this month, BNB posted a powerful surge to a new high. Despite the recent dip, BNB still stands as an outperformer against major alts. Analysts point to the Binance ecosystem’s strength as the driving force. TVL has soared to $5.8B, and daily activities user stats are inching closer to a new high. Beyond this, BNB ‘s resilience makes it a crypto market leader and an excellent bet amid the FOMO . Conclusion Every dip is an opportunity for savvy investors. The bull run FOMO has kept them on their feet, and most of them aren’t holding back after Cardano and BNB ‘s recent pullbacks. Amidst the market recovery, Rollblock continues to steal the crypto market spotlight. With its $7.5 million raised and GambleFi innovation, Rollblock offers a unique blend of gaming ingenuity and investor incentives driving unprecedented demand.

The Fifth Circuit Appeals Court recently ruled that the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash’s smart contracts were unlawful . This ruling could be a game-changer for Storm’s case, which involves serious charges, including money laundering. Moreover, the case went all in favor of Tornado Cash the sanctions helped the native token Torn jump 700% last month. The Court Ruled Out Sanction Clause In its ruling , the appeals court made a bold statement by declaring that Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash’s smart contracts were unlawful. As per the ruling, Tornado Cash’s smart contracts are immutable, meaning they can’t be changed or stopped by anyone, not even the creators. The court also clarified that these contracts are not “property” under U.S. law, so they can’t be blocked or sanctioned by the government. With this key factor, Storm demanded that the court should also drop the severe charges of money laundering, especially the charges that he conspired to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which forced U.S. sanctions. Storm’s Argument: No Control, No Crime In the quest to fight back, Storm is using this ruling to argue that the charges against him are flawed. He insists that Tornado Cash isn’t a financial institution and that it became immutable back in May 2020—long before the alleged money-laundering accusations. Interestingly, he says there was no way he could have conspired to launder money using a protocol that couldn’t be controlled by anyone, including him. So in simple terms, there is no concrete evidence to prove that he did the money laundering using the platform. The case has drawn massive outrage and initially, the lawsuit was filed by the Tornado Cash users, backed by Coinbase , against the U.S. Treasury and its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Although the users initially lost the court case, the ruling was overturned in November 2023, giving Tornado Cash supporters a big win. The case is also a reflection of how the decentralized platforms are treated by US law agencies. The developer’s attempt to challenge the agencies will surely bring some immutable change for future cases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk as House Speaker?

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs logged outflows of $680 million on Thursday, breaking a 15-day streak of inflows that had brought over $6.7 billion into the funds. Fidelity’s FBTC led the decline with $208.55 million exiting the fund, followed by Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, which recorded outflows of $188.6 million and $108.35 million, respectively. Other notable outflows included: Grayscale’s GBTC: $87.86 million Bitwise BITB: $43.61 million Invesco Galaxy’s BTCO: $25.97 million VanEck’s HODL: $10.91 million Valkyrie’s BRRR: $8.19 million Amidst the sell-off, WisdomTree’s BTCW stood as an outlier, attracting a modest $2.05 million in inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT and two other BTC ETFs reported no changes in flows for the day. Despite the outflows, trading activity in Bitcoin ETFs surged, with total trading volume reaching $6.31 billion, a notable increase from the previous day’s $5.86 billion. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) fall below $96,000—down 4.4% at $96,751 at the time of reporting—was largely attributed to the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision. While the Fed implemented a widely anticipated 0.25% rate cut, bringing this year’s cumulative cuts to 1%, officials signaled a cautious approach moving forward. Only two additional rate cuts are planned for 2025, with inflation projected to meet the 2% target by 2026 or 2027. This hawkish tone dampened investor sentiment, leading to a 4.5% drop in the broader cryptocurrency market, which stood at $3.51 trillion.

Grayscale’s ETHE accounted for the majority, with $58.13 million exiting the fund. Bitwise’s ETHW, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, and Invesco’s QETH also saw outflows of $6.78 million, $3.18 million, and $2.36 million, respectively. In contrast, Fidelity’s FETH and VanEck’s ETHV managed to attract inflows of $5.05 million and $4.94 million, partially offsetting the broader trend. Despite the daily outflows, cumulative net inflows for Ethereum ETFs remained positive at $2.4 billion. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price reflected the bearish sentiment, dropping 8.1% over the past day to $3,378 per coin.

The major crypto exchange OKX is bringing Ordinals into the fold by releasing the new Ordinals Launchpad platform for creators who want to launch and inscribe directly on Bitcoin ( BTC ). The platform provides creators with the tools, exposure and technical support needed to make the Bitcoin inscription process as simple as possible. According to the official notice , the Ordinals Launchpad platform can now be accessed through the web or on a mobile device. Users can launch and trade collections directly through the interface. All sales proceeds are wired directly to creator wallets through on-chain settlements. OKX employs “SelfScribe” technology that enables collectors to inscribe instantly on-chain at the time of minting. SelfScribe removes pre-inscription requirements and guarantees creators have self-custody over their collections. The exchange claims that creators are given “complete control” over pricing and distribution of their collections, including the option to customize minting rounds using features like allowlist and public sale options.

Creators can also list their collections across other major marketplace after minting on the platform. The first collection to officially debut on Ordinals Launchpad is “Geminions” from JRNE, a Web3 jewelry brand that introduced NFC-enabled authentication on Bitcoin. OKX also noted that trading volume for Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20 collections on their platform has gone up by 50% since November, indicating an increase in market demand. Recently, Binance confirmed in a post that it has discontinued its Ordinal assets, specifically its Inscription Market. Users can no longer buy or sell inscription assets on the exchange, but they can still view their inscription assets and move them to other wallets. The exchange has halted support for Ordinals since April this year.

However, he chose to stay on as a strategic advisor to the company board. In a lengthy post on X , Shaikh said that he is leaving the company “to start a new chapter.” “Over the coming months, I plan to take some much-needed time to reflect on where the world is headed and to think deeply about the ways financial systems can evolve to continue to push Aptos as the most established layer 1 in the space.” For as long as I can remember, I’ve been passionate about building systems that empower people—fairer, more open systems.

Aptos, a layer-1 blockchain, leverages a unique blockchain programming language called Move, which was originally created for Facebook’s ‘Diem’ project. Shaikh also acknowledged the work of Aptos’ partners and investors, including Google, Microsoft, a16z, Coinbase, MasterCard and PayPal. In June, Shaikh joined the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) digital asset subcommittee. He will be helping the CFTC shape regulatory rulemaking regarding cryptocurrencies. Aptos’ APT Token Experience Bearish Trend Aptos blockchain has been performing well recently, with several new partnerships. Last month, the firm partnered with Circle and Stripe to enable seamless transfers across 8 blockchains, boosting DeFi interoperability. Circle’s CCTP and USDC stablecoin will enhance blockchain interoperability, while Stripe will simplify fiat interactions. Aptos also added former Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein and OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil to its advisory board. Following Shaikh’s resignation, its APT token experienced a bearish trend. The token was down by 1.97% and is currently trading at $11.65 at press time.

Altcoins like ETH, SOL, DOGE are seeing even greater selling pressure correcting 8-13%. While Bitcoin pullbacks are part of every market cycle, investors are curious as to how far the BTC correction will continue from here. Can Crypto Market Crash Push BTC Price Even Lower? BTC Preparing for 25% Drop to $80,000 As the panic selloff intensifies further, the crypto market crash continues with Bitcoin price falling deeper from its crucial support of $100K. Crypto market analysts are predicting that a 25% Bitcoin pullback from its all-time high of $108K is very much possible going ahead. Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted: “For those saying that -25% or -30% pullbacks will definitely not occur in this cycle should study this year’s overall March-August -34% correction more closely. Or the multiple -25% pullbacks between March and August”. Source: Rekt Capital Thus, if history repeats then BTC price can correct all the way to $80,000 again. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has warned of a possible correction for Bitcoin, citing the persistence of a Bearish Engulfing Candle on the weekly chart. In a recent post, the analyst highlighted that the critical weekly support level at $101.2K is under pressure and struggling to hold. The analyst further noted that if this key blue support region fails, along with Bitcoin’s 5-week uptrend (marked in orange), the cryptocurrency could likely transition into a broader correction phase.

Analyst Ali Martinez noted that the key support zone for Bitcoin is between $98,830 to $95,830. Within this zone, approximately 1.09 million wallets collectively purchased over 1.16 million BTC, reinforcing its significance as a key price level. Source: Ali Charts The Coinglass data shows that the Bitcoin open interest has dropped 5% while the 24-hour liquidations have surged to $217 million with $166 million being long liquidations. Despite the current fall, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index remains in the “Greed” zone with a score of 74. Market analysts believe that the crypto market correction can continue further amid a surge in the Dollar Index (DXY). Crypto analyst Justin Bennett emphasized the importance of tracking global liquidity trends, stating: “110.00 has been my US dollar target since the 102.60 reclaim, and I’m betting that area marks the crypto bottom in early 2025.” Source: Justin Bennet Altcoins ETH, SOL, and DOGE Face Stronger Corrections ETH Loses the Crucial Support of $3,500 The top altcoins also recorded gloomy trading amid a broader market selloff recently. The ETH price has corrected by a massive 9% in the last 24 hours losing the crucial support of $3,550 and is currently trading at $3,346. It is possible that Ethereum could retest $3,000 again before bouncing back. Besides, the Ethereum whale selloff has also intensified recently. Blockchain analytics platform LookonChain reports that the recent decline in Ethereum’s price has prompted significant activity among large holders as they sell ETH to settle debts. In the last five hours, one whale transferred 22,746 ETH, worth $77.7 million, to Binance and subsequently withdrew stablecoins to repay obligations on Spark and Aave. Another whale deposited 49,910 ETH, valued at $170 million, into Binance, withdrawing $137.8 million in stablecoins within the past eight hours. However, market analysts continue to be hopeful moving ahead. Popular analyst Ted Pillows wrote: “$4K seems like the new $1.4K for Ethereum. In the 2020-21 cycle, ETH got rejected from $1,400 several times before a successful breakout. Right now, the same thing is happening with the $4K level, but there’ll be a breakout soon”. Solana Price Cracks Under $200 Following the high of $263 in November, the Solana price has moved sideways and underperformed other altcoins of its league. Amid today crypto market crash, the SOL price has lost its crucial support of $200 and is currently trading at $193 as of press time. Crypto analyst Lieutenant Ponzi has drawn attention to Solana’s (SOL) weekly chart, pointing out a significant order block (OB) and a bullish bat pattern. According to the analyst, the $165-$170 range is emerging as a critical area of interest, suggesting potential resistance or a reversal zone for the cryptocurrency.

With this, the world’s largest meme coin has extended its weekly losses to more than 22%. The 24-hour liquidation data from Coinglass shows a 20% drop in open interest and $55 million in DOGE liquidations, of which $44 million is in long liquidation. Despite this, market analysts continue to be optimistic about DOGE. Market analyst BALO has highlighted crucial price levels for Dogecoin’s (DOGE) weekly performance. According to the analyst, a weekly close above $0.26 is necessary to maintain bullish momentum. Furthermore, if DOGE can reclaim the $0.42 level, BALO predicts a potential surge to $4, marking a significant upside for the popular meme coin.

The Fed’s hawkish FOMC has triggered the massive crypto sell-off. “Over bullish positioning” by investors is another reason for the crash. The crypto market had a massive crash, with Bitcoin (BTC) dropping below $100,000 even after several attempts to keep the price above $103,000 in the past few days. Ethereum (ETH) also plummeted to $3,300, a support level, after a 7.2% price crash in the past 24 hours. CoinMarketCap data shows Bitcoin’s dominance increased to 57.4%, while the Fear and Greed Index dropped to 62. BTC’s rising dominance indicates that the digital asset space did not have an altcoin season as the industry’s total market capitalization dropped to $3.35 trillion. The Fed’s Announcement and Market Reaction The hawkish FOMC announcement from the United States Fed triggered a sharp selloff across all risk assets, with Nasdaq falling 3.56%, S&P 500 dropping 2.95%, and BTC dropping 6.13%, as noted by Singapore-based digital asset firm QCP Capital .

Today, the token is up 3.18% and shows signs of recovery, which is in line with Bitcoin’s outlook. While the short-term outlook is noisy, the long-term outlook remains certainly bullish. This CoinGape article explains five reasons to not sell XRP and how the token could offer more upside in 2025. XRP Price: 5 Key Reasons To Not Sell XRP Tokens Although XRP price has shot up more than. 500% in 2024, its upside potential is not capped yet. Here are five key events that are yet to unfold that could have a massive positive impact ont the value of XRP and potentially catlayze another uptrend. Trump Inauguration: Trump wining the US elections on November 5 was a key trigger that kickstart the crypto bull market. Some believe that Trump January 20, 2025 inauguration event could lead to an even bigger rally. The reason for this is the expectation of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment that could benefit XRP and the broader crypto markets. Additionally, Trump’s pre-election statements on cryptocurrencies are positive. This could lead to help with XRP’s adoption and propel its price higher. Gary Gensler is out of SEC: Gary Gensler, the SEC chairman filed the lawsuit on Ripple at the end of 2020 and a dozen other crypto-related suits, has been considered an enemy to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Hence, the departure of Gary Gensler, a perceived crypto skeptic, from the SEC will reform the image of this regulatory body and lead to a shift in regulatory tone that favors cryptocurrencies. This development could be one key factor that boosts XRP price. SEC Lawsuit Settlement: Although the long-running battle between the SEC and Ripple came to a conclusion, it isn’t settled yet. Hence, a firm settlement could bring much-needed clarity and certainty to XRP’s regulatory status, leading to a rally in Ripple price. Alt Season Begins: As mentioned in previous CoinGape articles, an altcoin season could kickstart after the recent crash and extend all the way up to January 2025. Hence, capital rotation out of Bitcoin and into altcoins, including XRP, could see a huge uptrend. XRP ETF is Approved: Bloomberg analysts have already suggested that the XRP and Solana ETF could be next. Considering that Bitcoin saw such a massive uptrend after spot ETF approval, XRP could mirror this trend considering the demand. Moreover, the approval of an XRP ETF would provide institutions and safe way to invest in XRP. Hence, this event could lead to massive rally for XRP price. XRP Technical Analysis: Ripple Has A Long Way to Go Tony Severino, a certified analyst, posted on X, that he is “potentially not bullish enough on XRP.” According to Severion, XRP’s “three-month candlestick is above the Bollinger Band basis for the first time since April 2019”, reflecting volatility. A buy signal would emerge if the quarterly candlestick manages to push its above the “the upper Band” and closer there. Sevenrio also note that the Bollinger Bands “have been the tightest in XRPBTC history,” which is a signal that precedes volatile moves. To further support his bullish outlook, the analyst notes that the three-month Relative Strength Index (RSI) has crossed above the RSI-based moving average and rising toward the 50 mean level. If the three-month RSI manages to climb above 50, it would suggest a spike a bullish momentum, aka “increasing strength”. The third bullish indicator, according to Severiono, is the Fisher Transform that is “flipping bullish with a multi-year bullish divergence.” The certified analyst adds that the three-month Logarithmic MACD depitcs a “weakening bearish momentum” and that it is ready to flip “bullish for the first time on the chart.” XRP/USD 3-month Chart All in all, the analyst remains wildly bullish on XRP price and expects it to continue its ascent. However, there are a few conditions that need to be met for Rippel to trend higher. This outlook is in line with the five reasons why you should not sell XRP here.

In an interview with Scott Melker, he said that here’s even talk about exempting the U.S.-based cryptocurrencies from capital gains tax. This move could create a major shift in how crypto is treated in the U.S. market. Despite XRP’s massive market cap, Yusko isn’t a fan. He believes XRP and Cardano lack real development. Unlike Circle’s stablecoin, which is backed by actual dollars, Yusko sees these coins as missing true innovation, even though they have high market value. Pro-Crypto Leadership: A Shift in Power Yusko also touched on Trump’s visit to Nashville, where he spoke directly to voters. He mentioned Trump’s promises, including firing SEC head Gary Gensler, and how Trump is under pressure to make moves, such as freeing Ross Ulbricht and creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Yusko believes the current U.S. leadership is largely supportive of crypto. Key figures like Scott Bessent and the new SEC head are crypto-friendly, which could lead to positive changes in the industry. It’s a shift that could help propel the crypto market forward. The Technologist Revolution: Billionaires Taking Control Yusko said that it’s not just Trump – the real story is the rise of “technologist billionaires.” These innovators are pushing for changes that benefit both the tech industry and the nation. It’s not about political parties anymore; it’s about the tech leaders who want to shape the future. With all these shifts in power, Yusko believes we’re entering a new phase for crypto, one driven by smart, tech-savvy leaders. Trump, learning from global leaders like Putin, seems ready to let these experts lead the charge in innovation.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 07:53:52

However, the ever-volatile nature of BTC always leads to substantial corrections that provide opportunities for those who missed the initial train to get on board. In the past couple of days, bitcoin’s price tumbled by double-digits, which, according to Santiment, has made the crowd seek to buy the dip. Moreover, history shows that it could send BTC flying again. Is BTC About to Bounce? As the analytics platform noted, the last time these discussions exploded in a similar manner was in early August when the cryptocurrency’s price tumbled below $50,000. Just a few days later, though, the asset had climbed by over 25% to beyond $62,000. If history is to repeat itself now, even though BTC’s market cap is a lot higher, bitcoin could recover from its big retracement and head toward a new all-time high again of over $120,000. With Bitcoin falling as low as $95.5K today, the ratio of crypto discussions that are about buying crypto’s dip has reached its highest level in over 8 months. The last time we saw the crowd nearly this enthusiastic about dip buying was the major crash on August 4th. Since… pic.twitter.com/39NlpnGMCs — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 20, 2024 Not So Fast Although the ‘buy-the-dip’ history shows that BTC’s correction could be over, this narrative is not supported by other on-chain and technical metrics, such as one particular demand zone. IntoTheBlock posted even before bitcoin lost the $100,000 mark decisively yesterday that such an area had formulated at around $97,500, given the large number of investors purchasing at such prices more than 1.4 million BTC. These accumulations turned that level into an ‘important’ support zone, which has now been broken to the downside. Once such vital support lines are breached and investors who had entered recently see their positions in the red, at least on paper, many tend to dispose of their holdings, which leads to more intense selling pressure for the underlying asset. Will Bitcoin retrace below $100k? Interestingly, a significant demand zone has formed just under $100k. Over 1.45 million BTC was accumulated at an average price 97.5k, making this an important potential support zone. pic.twitter.com/vDcHEl8OKV — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 19, 2024 The post Bitcoin Could Skyrocket by 25% in Days if History Repeats But There’s a Catch: Data appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-20 07:54:18

The announcement , which came on Dec. 19, was the culmination of an in-depth probe into whether the project was in compliance with EU data protection laws. For failing to meet the set privacy standards, the regulator has particularly homed in on World’s iris-based digital identity verification system. Data Deletion and Compliance Deadlines BayLDA ordered World to create a GDPR-compliant data deletion process within a month to give all users the full right to request data erasure. It also includes records gathered in the early phase of operation of Worldcoin due to a lack of legitimate legal basis for acquiring such data. Improving Privacy Rights for Users Michael Will, president of BayLDA, said the ruling ensures EU fundamental privacy rights are upheld in a legally and technologically highly complex case. “Users who entrusted Worldcoin with their iris data will now be completely free to avail themselves of their right to erasure,” Will observed. The ruling bolsters the ambitions of the GDPR, which sets the course for individual data sovereignty. Anonymization Clarification Sought by Worldcoin In response, World Foundation filed an appeal to shed light from the judiciary on whether its PETs meet EU standards for truly anonymizing data. World argues that there is no consistent definition of anonymization-a critical privacy protection tool within AI-driven innovation-under the GDPR. Data anonymization is key to being able to validate that someone is human without compromising privacy”, said Damien Kieran, chief legal officer at World. He added that ambiguous definitions weaken the EU’s regime to protect privacy effectively. Ongoing Compliance Challenges Despite halting operations in several EU countries to improve GDPR adherence, BayLDA found multiple compliance gaps. The authority called for stricter protocols, including explicit user consent for certain data-processing steps. It also reserved the option to investigate potential administrative violations further. Commitment to Privacy and Innovation The World Foundation reiterated commitments to regulatory collaboration, promising that it would address privacy concerns while continuing to drive innovation. It said that “clear GDPR standards are necessary to move technology forward in the privacy-first world”.

Zeberg tells his 170,600 followers on the social media platform X that the anticipated “Christmas rally is still on.” According to the widely followed economist, Bitcoin is primed to rise past the current record high of around $108,200 and reach a new all-time high. Zeberg further says, “We are not at the top yet. BUT – we are much closer to the top and the rally will not continue for as long as many analysts seem to believe.” Bitcoin is trading at $101,784 at time of writing. According to the economist, Bitcoin could plunge by around 84% from the current level after reaching the cycle peak. “Well – my target after blow-off top is approximately $16,000. Will be interesting.” Turning to the wider crypto asset market, Zeberg says that altcoins are on the cusp of a massive rally amid a declining level of Bitcoin dominance – the ratio of the market cap of Bitcoin relative to the market cap of all other crypto assets. Zeberg says , “Crypto is THIS close to taking off in a major way! The most explosive phase of the altcoin season is about to set in.

Let’s discuss the trending cryptos and the reasons behind their trends. Top Trending Altcoin of The Day and Why? The number of cryptos in the market easily reaches millions, but today, the trending altcoins are Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana. The tokens already hold a top position on CoinmarketCap, in which investors’ demand and market cap have played the biggest role. As a result, these are trending even in the crypto market crash. Ethereum, the biggest altcoin in the market, has also grabbed Donald Trump’s attention, where the soon-to-be inaugurated US president holds $1.68M worth of ETH tokens. Similarly, Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial, began the ETH buying in the last few days. The Trump WLFI project has bought 722 ETH worth 2.5M USD with the current Ethereum price dip. It already has 8104 from its earlier ETH buying, showing rising interest in the token. Additional whales went for the same buying the dip strategies, fueling the ETH’s demand, currently trading at $3,402.59 with a trading volume of $59.06B after a 15% surge. Similarly, Dogecoin enthusiasts are flocking to buy. That’s because, the DOGE price almost tripled within a few days, from $0.15 to $0.46 in the recent rally. This is building confidence for further rallies. It is currently at an elevated position of $0.3202 with a $9.56B trading volume with a 50% increase. Interestingly, the SOL token’s hype is due to the Solana ETF, which might get approved at the beginning of 2025. After the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, Solana and XRP are next in line, and even a Bloomberg ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, believes that these will get approved pretty soon. With that, the token is gaining momentum, and analysts believe Solana’s price can hit $300 . It is currently at $193.53 with $7.79B after a 9% surge, clearly representing growing investor interest. Altcoin Season Next? In the crypto bull run, traders’ attention was divided among thousands of altcoins, not to forget Bitcoin and its milestone of BTC price hitting ATH at $108.2k. However, as the market is on a downtrend, investors have begun to focus on profit potential tokens. Interestingly, these include Ethereum, Solana, and many others, but analysts see it as a hint for the upcoming altcoin season. For weeks, analysts have been eyeing this moment. One called the next 1-2 weeks as the period of market resets and correction before paving the way for the altcoin to boom, as the alts-BTC correlation dropped to a 12-month low. Another analysis sees Donald Trump’s inauguration as the key moment. He says that Bitcoin will face a 20-25 correction in mid-January. Although the altcoins would face the same, their recovery will be instant, allowing them to flourish during the altcoin season. However, these are speculations for now amid the rising crypto market volatility. Additionally, as the Altcoin season index dropped to 47, the lower the number, the lower the chances of the altcoin dominations. Regardless, the next few weeks could give a better insight into these claims. What’s In There For You With These Altcoins? Bitcoin had the biggest bullish dominance this year, surging 2.5x since the beginning of 2024. However, many trending altcoins have presented similar rallies under the influence of BTC. However, that could go even better once the alt-BTC correlation breaks and the alternative cryptos get to follow separate trajectories. Even in the confusing and crashing crypto market, analysts foresee the altcoin season, under whose influence Ethereum, DOGE, Solana, and many other cryptos are booming with increased activity as investors are flocking to utility-based or long-term growth tokens to buy the dip.

The European crypto market changed dramatically, with euro-denominated trading volumes reaching a multi-year high of nearly €50 billion in November 2024, according to Kaiko’s Research report .

Despite the dip many analysts foresee the asset rebounding to targets as high as $5, with some projecting even greater peaks if a FOMO-driven rally occurs. XRP Follows the Market Decline Despite the enhanced volatility, the first half of December has been quite successful for Ripple’s XRP . At the start of the month, its price surpassed a multi-year high of $2.80, while at the beginning of this week, it consolidated above $2.50. However, things took a sudden turn on December 18, with XRP plunging below $2.30. S everal hours ago, the valuation dipped under $2.20. Currently, XRP is around $2.23 after a slight rebound, which represents a 6% decline on a daily scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most obvious factor that has impacted the price of the token is the severe correction of the entire cryptocurrency sector. The global crypto market capitalization is down almost 9% in the last 24 hours, currently set at around $3.42 trillion (CoinGecko’s data). Bitcoin (BTC), which hit a new all-time high of over $108,000 on December 17, is now worth less than $96,000. Ethereum (ETH) tumbled below $3,300, while Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and many more are down by double digits. The market started bleeding heavily shortly after the Federal Reserve announced its latest interest rate cut. It reduced the benchmark by 0.25%, but Jerome Powell hinted that next year, the policy might be halted due to an increase in the inflation rate. In addition to that , the spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed their biggest outflows in a single day. As CryptoPotato reported , over $670 million were withdrawn from the financial vehicles in total on a 24-hour scale, with Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s BTC leading the pack – $ 208.5 and $188.6 million, respectively. XRP’s Next Potential Targets Despite the substantial plunge, numerous analysts remain optimistic that XPR’s bull run is far from over. The popular X user Crypto Bitlord believes the latest correction has represented a local bottom, after which XRP could surge to as high as $5. Other market observers who recently chipped in are Dark Defender and Armando Pantoja. The former set $5.85 and $8.76 as short-term targets, while the latter assumed XRP could be headed toward $2.78 and then $3.87. Pantoja went even further, predicting a mass FOMO effect if the price reach $10-$12, and “that’s when it will get crazy.” The post Why is the Ripple (XRP) Price Down Today? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Federal Reserve|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-20 09:21:22

According to CoinGlass data, $856.7 million of these liquidations came from long positions, driven by the strong bullish momentum observed over the last month. Bitcoin slipped by 5% and is now trading at $96,350, as reported by CoinMarketCap. This downturn follows a pattern seen earlier this month, with Bitcoin’s dips below psychological levels triggering large-scale liquidations. On Dec. 5, a sharp 5.47% drop below $93,000 erased $300 million within minutes. A similar scenario unfolded on Dec. 10, when a crypto market pullback wiped out $1.7 billion in leveraged positions, marking the largest long liquidation of this cycle so far. Short-Term Volatility or a Bigger Trend? Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal attributed the sell-off to market unpreparedness for negative news amidst a month of bullish sentiment. “The market wasn’t braced for bad news, leading to indiscriminate selling. However, this seems like short-term angst rather than a prolonged downturn,” he stated . Other analysts echo this optimism. Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts hinted at a potential buying opportunity on the horizon. Similarly, Caleb Franzen, another prominent crypto analyst, contextualized the volatility as a natural occurrence during bull runs. Franzen pointed out that during the last bull cycle, Bitcoin experienced nine pullbacks over 16 months, all of which eventually gave way to higher highs. Fred Krueger, a Bitcoin maximalist, cautioned against using leverage in trading Bitcoin, highlighting it as a key factor in recent liquidations. Meanwhile, Hundal believes the crypto market’s next moves will hinge on expectations for the incoming Trump administration , which could bring significant changes to U.S. crypto policy. Crypto Santa Rally Still Possible? Despite the market turbulence, analysts remain hopeful for a “Santa rally” leading into the holiday season. Hundal stated that market participants should brace for volatility as the January 2025 inauguration of President Donald Trump approaches, with speculation around his plans for a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve fueling market dynamics . For now, the crypto market sits at a crossroads, balancing between short-term uncertainties and long-term bullish prospects.

Lightchain AI, the Polygon alternative, aims for a $20 target, promising a 6,666x return as it redefines blockchain with AI solutions. Table of Contents Why Lightchain AI is dubbed the Polygon alternative Can LCAI really reach $20? Why users should be paying attention to AI-blockchain crossovers Lightchain AI presale: A lucrative investment opportunity As the cryptocurrency market anticipates its next big movers, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a Polygon (MATIC) alternative with massive growth potential. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale , Lightchain AI is gaining attention for its smart use of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Expert traders predict that LCAI could reach $20 within the next 10 to 12 months, offering a staggering 6,666x return for early investors. Let’s dive into why Lightchain AI is being hailed as the next big thing in blockchain and how it stacks up against established players like Polygon. Why Lightchain AI is dubbed the Polygon alternative Lightchain AI is considered a Polygon alternative due to its smart approach to scalability and efficiency in blockchain technology. By integrating artificial intelligence through its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and employing a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, Lightchain AI enhances transaction throughput and reduces costs, similar to Polygon’s Layer 2 solutions. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world applications across various industries, such as healthcare and finance, positions it as a versatile platform for decentralized applications, much like Polygon’s ecosystem. Can LCAI really reach $20? According to expert traders, Lightchain AI’s price trajectory is backed by a combination of low initial entry, strong technology, and a growing market for AI applications. Key factors contributing to the $20 prediction include. Rapid adoption With its new technology and developer-friendly tools, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining traction among enterprises and developers. Market demand for AI The global AI market is expected to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2030, providing a significant growth opportunity for platforms like Lightchain AI. Deflationary tokenomics LCAI’s deflationary model ensures that as adoption grows, the token’s value will appreciate due to its built-in scarcity mechanisms. Upcoming mainnet launch The scheduled March 2025 mainnet launch will unlock the full potential of Lightchain AI’s ecosystem, attracting more investors and developers. With these factors in play, the $20 target is not only ambitious but achievable within the next 10 to 12 months. But many experts believe that LCAI’s growth potential extends far beyond the $20 mark.

This comes after Bitcoin’s price dropped 7%, hitting a low of $95,500 after achieving a historic high of $108,268, it lost about 12% of its value in just three days. US Bitcoin ETFs saw record withdrawals, with investors pulling out $672 million in a single day. This marks the largest outflow ever recorded, surpassing the previous record of $564 million set in May. The immediate catalyst was Bitcoin taking a nosedive at the critical level of $97K showing an extreme fear moment in the crypto market. The crypto market is in a panic situation as Trump’s policies might meet political resistance, market analysts like Arthur Hayes also predicted a severe market crash after Trump’s inauguration in January. Withdrawal Alert The majority of the outflows came from, Fidelity’s FBTC led with $208.6 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s BTC Mini Trust at $188.6 million and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB with $108.4 million. Grayscale’s GBTC saw $87.9 million leave, while Bitwise’s BITB saw $43.6 million exit. Furthermore, spot Ethereum ETFs also saw $60.5 million in outflows, ending an 18-day inflow streak. What Happened? The massive outflows are the aftermath of the US Federal Reserve’s negative stance on its recent rate cut. While the market was waiting for the Fed to complete its 100 basis, the Fed’s 0.25% drop in interest rate caused investors to panic. To make it worse, it hinted at fewer cuts in 2025, signaling a delay in regulations. Bitcoin’s price, along with other assets, saw sharp declines as traders reacted to these economic signals, leading to over $1 billion in leveraged liquidations. Short-Term Haul? However, the investor reaction is mixed. Since the indicators show a short-term haul, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is still showing a “greed” level of 74, suggesting that many investors are holding on to their positions, and anticipating a recovery. Many analysts are claiming this is an overreaction to the Fed’s comment and this will be a short-term fluctuation that happens after every Fed meeting. What’s Next for Bitcoin and ETFs? Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s price fluctuation is likely to continue, as global economic tensions are rising and regulatory issues are expected to delay. However, some ETFs, like WisdomTree’s Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), managed to attract new investments, indicating that not all investors are backing away. In short, the road ahead for Bitcoin will not be easy and it might see more outflows if the Fed maintains its stance over rate cuts in 2025. In such a scenario experts suggest holding on to your assets as the market will recover soon as new ETFs may flood the market sooner or later.",News|Bitcoin ETF|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 09:28:47

Four Altcoins Are Seeing A Buy Signal On The TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the TD Sequential signal that four different altcoins have seen on their 4-hour charts. The “TD Sequential” is an indicator from technical analysis (TA) used to locate probable turnaround points in a given asset’s price. Related Reading: Secret Bitcoin Driver: Exchanges Receiving $40 Million USDT Fuel Per Day The indicator involves two phases: the setup and countdown. During the first of these the setup, candles of the same color are counted up to nine. The nine candles don’t have to be consecutive. Once the counter hits nine, the setup is said to be complete, and the price could be assumed to have reached a reversal location. If the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were green, the TD Sequential would imply a top for the asset. Similarly, if they were red, the indicator would suggest a change of direction to the upside. The second phase, the countdown, begins as soon as the setup is over. This phase of the indicator works in the same manner, save for the fact that candles are meant to be counted up to thirteen instead this time. After the thirteen candles of the same polarity, another potential top or bottom could be considered to have been reached by the asset. Now, here are the charts shared by Martinez that show the completion of the TD Sequential phase of the first type for four altcoins: XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Maker (MKR), and Worldcoin (WLD). As is visible in the above graph, the four-hour prices of XRP, Solana, Maker, and Worldcoin have all completed a TD Sequential setup with nine red candles. This naturally means the indicator gives a buy signal for these altcoins. The pattern has taken shape as assets across the cryptocurrency sector have crashed following the US Federal Reserve taking a cautious approach towards further interest rate cuts.

XRP Price XRP slipped as low as under $2.18 during the crash earlier in the past day, but the coin appears to have seen a small rebound since then, as its price is now trading around the $2.31 mark.

Both coins are expected to climb even higher in 2025, with forecasts showing promising numbers. But while these tokens grab short-term interest, Rollblock’s potential stands out for bigger reasons. Its ongoing potential has already turned heads, raising more than $7 million and gaining momentum in the market. Unlike other projects, Rollblock combines utility and growth potential, giving investors a real opportunity to earn long-term rewards while enjoying the excitement of iGaming. Rollblock is confidently the next big winner Rollblock is changing online gambling with its innovative GambleFi platform. It combines blockchain technology and online casinos, giving players security, speed, and fun all in one place. Rollblock offers a major advantage: token holders get a share of weekly casino profits. The platform stands out with features that players love. It is licensed, so KYC is required to ensure users stay secure while enjoying fast crypto deposits and payouts. Rollblock offers many casino games, live sports betting, and a simple, user-friendly experience. RBLK, Rollblock’s token, adds even more value. Holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards and enjoy a buyback-and-burn system. This reduces the token supply, making $RBLK more valuable over time. Compared to PEPE and LTC , Rollblock’s focus on real-world use and passive income makes it a standout choice. For investors looking for innovation and consistent rewards, Rollblock might just be the next big winner. PEPE Coin – meme power and growth potential PEPE Coin saw an incredible 1,800% surge in 2024, turning heads across the crypto space. Forecasts for its future growth remain optimistic. Changelly expects its price to rise to $0.0000263 by December 2024, while Longforecast predicts a 16% increase by February 2025. Some scenarios even see PEPE reaching as high as $0.0036 next year. This meme-based coin appeals to younger investors because of its viral nature and community hype. However, tokens like PEPE Coin often lack practical use cases. Unlike utility-driven platforms like Rollblock, PEPE relies heavily on its popularity rather than offering real value or increasing its market cap through innovation. Litecoin (LTC) – stability and long-term growth LTC has shown strong performance in 2024, rising by 36.81% to trade at $119.20. Predictions for 2025 remain positive. CryptoNews expects LTC to climb to $213.16 by the end of the year. CoinGape forecasts an average of $204.04, with a peak at $227.56. Meanwhile, Cryptopolitan sees steady growth, projecting a minimum LTC price of $186.72. As a peer-to-peer payment coin, LTC offers stability and wide adoption for transactions. However, Rollblock sets itself apart with greater growth potential. Its thriving ecosystem, combined with rewards and increasing market cap , gives investors opportunities for consistent growth and valuable returns. Conclusion The growth potential for cryptocurrencies in 2025 looks promising, with coins like LTC and PEPE continuing to show steady progress. While cryptos like these remain a viable choice, Rollblock stands out as a stronger opportunity for investors. Its innovative approach, revenue-sharing model, and focus on rewards make it an attractive option. For those seeking long-term gains and diverse rewards, Rollblock offers far more than traditional tokens. Currently in presale at a low price of $0.0415, don’t miss out!

Imagine earning rewards just by participating in flight-related activities—whether through gaming, virtual simulations, or real-world travel. As the concepts of real-world asset tokenization (RWA) and the rapidly growing GameFi sector attract more investors, the F2E model is becoming an intriguing opportunity. With its potential to reshape how we think about both crypto and rewards, F2E is set to take off in ways many never expected. The RWA market is currently valued at around $19 billion, while the GameFi sector is worth about $22.7 billion. As blockchain technology and Web3 protocols continue to gain mainstream adoption, the F2E model is expected to grow significantly in the years ahead. F2E and Virtual Reality The F2E concept has primarily been linked to virtual reality, especially in gaming and simulation industries. For example, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 lets players earn in-game currency and other virtual rewards by completing flights and missions. This gamified experience is a big attraction for aviation and gaming enthusiasts alike. Blockchain and Earning Through Flight Games Some blockchain and cryptocurrency companies are now adopting similar models to turn virtual flying into an opportunity to earn crypto. BlockAirGame, for instance, is creating an F2E model where users can win crypto assets like Polygon (POL) by playing flight-related games. This combines the excitement of gaming with blockchain rewards. In the real world, several startups are also exploring the F2E concept. One example is Satoshi Airlines, which launched the Fly-to-Earn app. This app blends air travel with blockchain technology, allowing users to earn rewards for their participation. Spexi’s Investment and Growth Earlier this month, Spexi, a network focused on ultra-high-resolution drone imagery, raised $11.5 million in a Series A funding round led by BlockChange Ventures.

Investors ended a 15-day streak of inflows by withdrawing a net $671.9 million from the 11 ETFs, the largest single-day tally since their inception on Jan. 11, according to data from Coinglass and Farside Investors . Fidelity's FBTC and Grayscale's GBTC led the outflows, losing $208.5 million and $188.6 million, respectively. Other funds registered outflows, too, and BlackRock's IBIT scored its first zero in several weeks. Bitcoin extended its post-Fed losses Thursday, falling to $96,000, down nearly 10% from the record high of $108,268 seen early this week. The bearish sentiment was mirrored in the derivatives market, where the annualized premium in the CME's regulated one-month bitcoin futures fell to 9.83%, the lowest in over a month, according to data source Amberdata. A decline in the premium means cash-and-carry arbitrage bets involving a long position in the ETF and a short position in the CME futures yield less than they did earlier. As such, the ETFs may continue to see weak demand in the short-term. Ether ETFs also registered a net outflow, $60.5 million. That's the first since Nov. 21.

The plaintiffs argue that the token was misleadingly presented as having shareholder-like benefits, violating securities regulations. Notably, Hailey Welch, associated with the project, is not named as a defendant and will not be directly involved in the legal proceedings. Hawk Tuah’s launch in early December garnered significant attention in the meme coin market. The token quickly reached a market cap of $500 million but crashed within 20 minutes, leaving many investors with losses. The lawsuit claims that the token’s promoters targeted the U.S. market and failed to register it as a security, violating regulatory requirements. Rather than focusing solely on the sudden collapse, the lawsuit highlights concerns about the token’s distribution and its allegedly misleading structure. The plaintiffs allege that the company behind Hawk Tuah, overHere Ltd, suggested token holders would have shareholder-like rights. However, they claim the distribution was unequal and did not deliver on these promises. By focusing on securities law violations, the lawsuit aims to hold the company accountable through a strong legal argument. Meme coins continue to face scrutiny for their reliance on hype and celebrity endorsements, which often fuel fraudulent schemes. While rug pulls have decreased in 2024, the volatile nature of these tokens still presents risks for investors. High-profile figures, including celebrities and influencers , can amplify the appeal of questionable assets, further exposing the market to potential scams. In some cases, even hacked celebrity accounts have been used to promote fraudulent meme coins. Hailey Welch’s association with Hawk Tuah has drawn attention, though she remains uninvolved in the lawsuit. Her credibility within the community, however, may suffer regardless of the legal outcome.

The broader cryptocurrency market entered a bearish state following yesterday’s FOMC meeting, with BTC falling below $100K. DOGE’s drop has brought it close to critical support levels, sparking speculation about whether it could dip below $0.2 soon. Will Dogecoin Price Drop Below $0.2 Soon? Crypto Expert tweeted on X post highlighting Dogecoin’s recent price trends, noting a potential key support level at $0.22076. The analysis suggests the Dogecoin price is undergoing a corrective phase after a significant 25% dip, raising concerns about a possible fall below $0.20 support levels. According to the crypto analyst, a rebound from $0.22076 could propel the meme coin toward ambitious targets at $0.40894 and $0.65557, marking a potential 165% rally. Market observers now watch closely as DOGE approaches this critical support level, awaiting signs of recovery or further decline. Source: X Why Is the Dogecoin Price Going Down? After the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Dogecoin price dropped alongside a widespread cryptocurrency market downturn. The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 25 basis points, as anticipated. However, Chair Jerome Powell stated there may be no further cuts in 2025. He also clarified that the central bank cannot purchase Bitcoin, despite prior political promises. Bitcoin’s decline to $100,000 triggered bearish sentiment, impacting memecoins, including Dogecoin, which saw sharp losses. Most top altcoins also experienced heavy selling pressure, evident from red candlesticks across price charts. DOGE Price Analysis The latest DOGE price hovered at $0.3066 on Dec. 20, marking a sharp 15% drop. Dogecoin underperformed the broader crypto market, which fell by 6%. This decline pushed DOGE below its critical $0.35 support. Over the past week, the Dogecoin price has seen a decrease of more than 25%, highlighting mounting challenges for the meme-based cryptocurrency amid increasing market pressure. On the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 19, inidcating an oversold. If bearish momentum continues, the Dogecoin Price prediction may slide further to test the $0.20 level. Despite these signs, a potential reversal could emerge if bulls defend key support zones effectively. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView Dogecoin price faces critical support levels as bearish momentum looms.

Gambling and Bitcoin in play,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xi-jinping-china-macau-hk-gambling-bitcoin/,"On Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the need for Macau to prioritize economic diversification as its “first” objective during a three-day visit to the Chinese gambling hub. The trip marked the 25th anniversary of Macau’s handover from Portugal, as the city aims to expand its role within China’s mainland economic framework. According to a Financial Times report , Xi made these remarks at the swearing-in ceremony of Macau’s new chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, who is the city’s fourth leader since the 1999 handover. Sam, Macau’s first leader born in mainland China who arguably has weaker ties to the business sector than his predecessors, is seen as aligned with Beijing’s push for diversification beyond the gambling industry, which currently accounts for 80% of the city’s tax revenue. Xi Jinping urges Macau to diversify its economy “ First, Macau should focus on promoting appropriate economic diversification, ” Xi urged, encouraging increased policy support and investment in emerging industries. He also stressed the importance of aligning Macau’s development with national strategies, including integration with the Greater Bay Area, a regional economic zone comprising Hong Kong , Macau, and Guangdong province. Anthony Lawrance, founder of consultancy Intelligence Macau, believes Xi’s visit will be influential in the city’s growth. “ It will be the first time that he heaps praise on Macau for a job well done. His previous trips were to admonish and cajole ,” he remarked. Macau’s gambling industry, the cornerstone of its economy, has thrived since the liberalization of its gaming monopoly in 2002, attracting investments from global casino giants like Las Vegas Sands, MGM, and Wynn. However, the city’s reliance on visitors from mainland China made it vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic, when stringent travel restrictions led to economic stagnation . Recent data suggests the city is pacing itself into recovery. In the first 11 months of 2024, Macau’s gross gaming revenue increased by 26.8% year-on-year to MOP 208.58 billion (US$25.8 billion), representing 77.4% of its pre-Covid level in 2019. Visitation also surged, with 29.05 million visitors in the first 10 months of 2024, marking a 28.1% increase compared to the previous year and nearing 87% over pre-pandemic levels. Hong Kong’s economic diversification rivals Mainland China In contrast to Macau, neighboring Hong Kong has successfully diversified its economy for years now. The city recently approved four cryptocurrency exchanges as part of efforts to establish itself as a global hub for digital asset trading. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission granted licenses to Accumulus GBA Technology, DFX Labs Company, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX, and Thousand Whales Technology, bringing the total number of licensed platforms in the city to seven. Previously approved platforms include HashKey, OSL, and HKVAX. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China, has traditionally operated under the “one country, two systems” framework, a policy introduced by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s. This arrangement allowed Hong Kong to maintain a high degree of autonomy in managing its own affairs, distinguishing it from mainland China . When Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997, Beijing pledged to preserve the region’s unique characteristics. As part of this agreement, China promised to uphold Hong Kong’s capitalist system and grant the city freedoms not available in mainland Chinese cities for fifty years. The freedom allowed Hong Kong to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, which took effect in April 2023, to issue licenses for all virtual asset service providers. Mainland China has been reluctant to follow the trend. While cryptocurrency trading is banned in mainland China, Hong Kong residents are allowed to purchase digital assets, which is why the city’s projected revenue from online gambling could surpass $600 million in 2024, as revealed by Statista.

Now, analysts highlight a DeFi altcoin with the potential to match that growth in 2025. Table of Contents Solana set for 5th bullish wave Remittix: The PayFi powerhouse set to dominate the $250t cross-border payment market Final words Solana (SOL) is one of the most trending cryptocurrencies in the market today. Over the years, its price has increased by more than 10,000%. Sadly, only a few people were lucky to have entered at the beginning. Now, as the market continues to heat up for 2025, one DeFi coin is emerging with a similar trajectory. The new entrant called Remittix (RTX) is tapping into a trillion-dollar sector to give its holders more gains than SOL has for those who missed one of the best cryptocurrency investment opportunities in history. Solana set for 5th bullish wave The Solana coin is among the best-performing coins in the market today. Its price increase in the last three years has been exponential. Solana’s price had previously fallen to $12 after the FTX exchange collapsed in 2022. Surprisingly, the Solana token produced an overwhelming price performance last year, crossing $150. Today, the altcoin is part of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the market according to market cap. CoinMarketCap data shows the value of the Solana crypto has spiked by 2.2% on the weekly chart. It is currently trading just below the $200 mark as it seeks to reach new highs in the coming months. A top analyst called Titan of Crypto predicts the value of Solana could pump to $400. According to him, SOL has retested the neckline of a cup and handle pattern and is now ready for an upward move. Another expert called King Charts noted the cryptocurrency is ready for the fifth bullish wave. This wave could push the altcoin past its current all-time high to $350. At the moment, the technical indicators of Solana are bullish. The relative strength index is below 50 which is the oversold region. The token has hit bottom and could be ready for the next leg up. The Hull Moving Average (9) is even showing a buy signal which supports the uptrend.

Analysts have tagged the PayFi protocol as the best cryptocurrency to buy after for those who missed Solana. They forecast its price could increase by up to 100x by the end of this bull market with some already dubbing it the ‘XRP Killer’. Final words Investors who missed out on Solana have nothing to worry about. Market experts believe that there are bigger opportunities out there. Remittix’s solutions and unique tokenomics position it as a promising new project to check out. To learn more about Remittix, visit the Remittix presale and join the Remittix community.

Revolut’s cryptocurrency trading service has been a key feature of its platform, allowing users to seamlessly buy, sell and hold digital assets alongside traditional financial services. The addition of BNB could further strengthen Revolut’s position at the growing intersection of fintech and digital assets by attracting more crypto-savvy users. CZ’s announcement underscores the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by mainstream finance platforms like Revolut.

This marks a big step forward in resolving the aftermath of one of the crypto world’s most notable hacks. Hacked Victims Finally Receive $225 Million In a recent press release Grant Thornton, the liquidating firm overseeing Cryptopia’s case, confirmed that over 10,000 verified account holders have received payouts totaling more than $225 million in crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin. These distributions were made possible after years of hard-working efforts to identify users and verify millions of transactions from nearly a million accounts. Cryptopia’s claims portal, launched in 2020 , was a crucial tool in this process. Liquidators worked to ensure the payouts were aligned with a court decision from March 2020, which clarified how assets should be returned to users. More Funds to Be Distributed This initial distribution is just the beginning. Grant Thornton plans additional payouts for verified users, with the potential for “top-up” distributions for those who haven’t yet received their full holdings. These top-ups will likely use unclaimed assets from users who fail to register on the claims portal before the final cut-off dates. The liquidators have urged all remaining account holders to complete their registration on the portal to qualify for future distributions. New rounds of payouts are expected in the coming year, giving hope to more users waiting to recover their funds. The Cryptopia Hack Cryptopia , once New Zealand’s largest crypto exchange with 1.4 million users, was at its peak in 2018. It played a pioneering role in the local crypto space, even launching a stablecoin in 2017. However, the exchange’s story took a dark turn in January 2019 when a hack resulted in the loss of $16 million worth of crypto assets. Shortly after, Cryptopia went into liquidation, owing $4.2 million to creditors. Perhaps, the recent payouts give hope to thousands of affected users, showing that even in difficult cases, solutions can be found.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 09:49:41

However, a rival coin, Rexas Finance (RXS), guarantees even more profits. With a ground-breaking 38x gain expected, RXS may turn the same investment into $38,000, redefining crypto prospects. XRP’s Impressive Growth Trajectory Rising use in cross-border payments, good legal results, and growing investor confidence all explain XRP’s notable expansion. Analysts predict a 7x increase in the token’s price over the next two months. XRP’s ability to maintain a strong pan assertiveness in the crypto market has driven hope about its near-term future. Should this become a $1,000 XRP investment now, it might expand to $7,000, highlighting its attraction as a profitable prospect for anyone wishing to profit from its momentum. Several essential factors justify the expected 7x surge in XRP’s price. XRP’s strategic emphasis on transforming cross-border transactions has helped it become a major player in the payments sector as institutions increasingly use its technology. Its use has improved, and market confidence has been raised by its alliances with big financial institutions. XRP is a top competitor in the altcoin market because its potential for exponential expansion is intact, even if the larger crypto industry is also gaining strength. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Rival Coin Poised to Outperform XRP Gains Unquestionably, XRP has great development potential, but a competitor coin called Rexas Finance (RXS) is starting to revolutionize the crypto scene. By linking real-world assets (RWA) and blockchain technology, Rexas Finance presents an unmatched investment possibility that might surpass XRP’s gains. Although XRP is predicted to show a 7x gain, Rexas Finance’s potential for a startling 38x rally could turn a $1,000 investment into $38,000, much above XRP’s returns. Rexas Finance (RXS) transforms the blockchain scene by tokenizing actual assets, allowing users to buy, sell, or fractionalize assets effortlessly. RXS is building an ecosystem whereby almost any physical or intangible asset, from real estate and art to intellectual property and goods, may be expressed on the blockchain. This transforming strategy democratizes access to profitable investment prospects and removes obstacles to worldwide asset ownership. Users of Rexas Finance can tokenize assets from anywhere in the globe at any moment, opening countless opportunities. The presale success of Rexas Finance emphasizes its enormous possibilities. Priced at $0.15 as of writing, the presale, in its 10th stage, has generated an impressive $28.77 million after selling out its 9th stage ahead of time. This quick acceptance highlights investors’ increasing faith in Rexas Finance’s ambition and value. Unlike many other ventures, Rexas Finance, stressing its dedication to community-driven development, chose against venture capital financing. This choice is now popular for investors looking for long-term value, strengthening its credibility and attractiveness even more. Rexas Finance (RXS) Future Outlook Several elements influence the price momentum of Rexas Finance. Its CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listing have created a lot of hype and drawn more project funding. Furthermore, RWA tokenization is becoming increasingly sought after, so Rexas Finance is positioned to profit from this trend. Analysts anticipate a 38x rally in its price and a surge to $5.7. Rexas Finance is one of the most successful altcoins, able to provide unmatched returns for early adopters, and this explosive increase would make it among them. Although XRP and Rexas Finance provide interesting prospects, their investing potentials differ. XRP is a dependable alternative for investors looking for consistent development because of its well-known market presence and emphasis on cross-border payments. However, Rexas Finance’s revolutionary approach to RWA tokenization makes it a high-growth option with the potential to exceed XRP. With its 7x gain, a $1,000 investment in XRP is expected to expand to $7,000; similarly, the amount invested in Rexas Finance may generate $38,000, a 38x increase. In conclusion, XRP’s expected 7x surge makes it a desirable investment choice since it can make a $1,000 difference in two months. Nevertheless, with its creative approach to RWA tokenization, Rexas Finance provides a significantly higher upside. Rexas Finance is a winner for investors looking for exponential development since it projects a 38x rise from the same $1,000 investment into $38,000. Rexas Finance will likely alter the crypto market and provide unparalleled returns as it continues to acquire popularity and extend its ecosystem.

According to a Dec. 20 announcement , the Solana-based meme coin will now be accessible to over 24 million Robinhood users. BONK became the fifth meme coin to be listed on the Menlo Park unicorn, which initially started offering crypto trading in February 2018. Robinhood listings typically lead to short-term price surges for newly added tokens, as seen with Dogwifhat ( WIF ) and Pepe ( PEPE ). WIF, the second meme coin listed in November, jumped 8.2% within an hour of the announcement, mirroring Pepe’s earlier price action . However, BONK ‘s price failed to capitalize on the listing, though it managed to recover some losses from the past 24 hours amid a broader market downturn. The meme coin exhibited notable volatility, dropping to an intra-day low of $0.00002671 before rallying to $0.00003094 following the listing announcement. It later settled around $0.00002905 at the time of writing, down over 4.5% on the day.

The meme coin market tumbled 9.96% in the past 24 hours, bringing its total market cap to $94.77 billion at press time. The decline is even more pronounced when compared to the monthly high of $137.06 billion reached on Dec. 9. Smaller tokens like Peanut the Squirrel and Brett have borne the brunt of the sell-off, as Bitcoin’s dip below $100,000 rattled retail investors and sent shockwaves through the speculative meme coin space. Upon writing, one Bitcoin was selling for $97,856. BONK experienced a similar sell-off, as data from Nansen showed an uptick in net flows over the past 7 days, which means more tokens were being deposited than withdrawn, typically seen as a sign that traders might be positioning to cash out.

Its growing appeal is driven by advanced technological integration, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, presenting it as a forward-looking project with high growth potential and immense community support. Here, we will spotlight said AI altcoin and explain why XRP and LINK holders demand it! IntelMarkets Sees Increased Demand From Investors: Here’s Why! Investors in established coins like XRP and LINK are showing interest in IntelMarkets (INTL) . Per recent data, more than $4.9 million has been invested in the AI altcoin amid its ongoing public presale, reflecting significant interest in INTL. INTL is a driving force in the IntelMarkets ecosystem, facilitating activities like trading, governance participation, and accessing incentives. Holders can also access tools like AI-powered robots for increased profitability. IntelMarkets is a perpetual contracts exchange where traders can engage in speculative asset trading. The platform stands out from other perpetual contract exchanges in that traders can hold a position longer or indefinitely, which is impossible on traditional exchanges. The firm operates on a dual-chain wheel spun by Ethereum and Solana. It integrated Ethereum so users can access smart contracts, liquidity pools, and decentralized applications. Meanwhile, Solana’s integration is geared towards achieving scalability and cost-friendly solutions. Given the vast role INTL plays in the IntelMarkets ecosystem, it is considered an essential part of this blockchain project. Its value proposition has brought it before XRP and LINK investors as a good crypto to buy. Analyst Foresees Ripple’s XRP Surpassing $4: Here’s Why! In his latest analysis, the wide-followed technical analyst Ali Martinez has painted a b3ullish future for XRP. Taking to X on December 17, 2024, Ali revealed a bullish pennant pattern formed by XRP’s sideways movement. This pattern is often a prelude to an explosive upward move for an asset. Ali stated that if Ripple’s XRP pushes past $2.60, it will get the ball rolling on its subsequent ascent to $4 and above. He substantiated this projection with the Fibonacci tool, highlighting price points where the Ripple coin would experience notable shifts. After the $2.60 level is beat, Ali’s Fibonacci levels at 2.414 ($3.63), 2.618 ($3.83), and 3.0 ($4.25) are potential milestones to watch out for. Despite this projection, Ripple investors have expanded to the AI altcoin INTL to boost their potential return. Nevertheless, Ripple’s XRP currently trades at $2.56, up 14.28% this week. Chainlink’s Chart Hints at an Inbound Explosive Move Chainlink is making rounds lately as LINK hints at a potential big move. The chart shows that Chainlink’s LINK broke out of a protracted downward trend in November 2024 and has continued climbing as buyers step in. However, the Chainlink coin price faces resistance between $28 and $30. These levels halted LINK’s upside rally, leading investors to take profits and buy into other AI altcoins like INTL. Meanwhile, more red candlesticks appear on the LINK price chart, suggesting that the bears are beginning to test the bulls’ grit. Failure to hold them off will see LINK drop as low as $24. The following support after $24 would be $21 and $19, which would be alarming for those who bought at the top. LINK trades at $28.11, with a 30.19% weekly gain. The INTL AI Altcoin Sees Investment From XRP And LINK Investors XRP and LINK investors have added INTL to their crypto investment list to diversify into, considering it is a good crypto to invest in for massive gains. INTL sells for $0.073 in Stage 8 of its public presale, with early investors already drenched in over 700% gains. When the INTL AI altcoin hits $0.110, its listing price, Stage 1 investors will have made 1,100% gains, while Stage 8 investors will receive a 50% profit.

And in this line, different crypto projects continue seeking a surge in value with analysts monitoring all relevant market dynamics. Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and the emerging DTX Exchange are capturing significant attention for different reasons amidst the current up and down crypto wave. Each project has unique qualities and potential, but let us see why DTX Exchange is positioned to stand out as a revolutionary force in the trading space. Solana’s (SOL) Current Position in the Journey for $350 Solana, one of the most popular blockchain projects for speed, is a strong name, with its processing ability that exceeds 65,000 transactions in one second. Hence, Solana is a favorite for decentralized applications and NFT products. It has been suggested among experts that SOL may touch a price target of $350 sooner than later, say by the year 2025. But to do that, the token would need to experience a drastic turn around on its current downward trend. After a rally in November 2024 that took it to an all-time high, the price of SOL has steadily dropped by 13% over the past month and is now around $210, testing a critical support level. A popular consensus is that Solana needs to find a way around its constant liquidity shortages and revamp institutional support to get back on the $350 track. Source: CoinMarketCap And while investors will always stick with a reputable asset like SOL, DTX Exchange is attracting many institutions with its features that support diverse and large-scale investments. Resilient Ripple (XRP) as a Top Contender in the Crypto Landscape Ripple has always shown that it will not fade away in the cryptocurrency market. Following the legal win against SEC, Ripple is well back as a reliable payment solutions provider. Analysts constantly rave about XRP’s growth potential after a 111% bull run from a month ago. Currently trading around $2.38, XRP is projected to reach $3 by early 2025. But the fact that it dropped in price by over 6% since yesterday also signals that XRP is not immune to market volatility and will definitely experience slumps even though the overall trajectory is positive. Source: CoinMarketCap Innovative features like RippleNet and increasing institutional adoption are primary drivers behind this optimism. However, DTX Exchange stands as a top alternative option catching the eye of investors. DTX Exchange Positioning Itself as the Future of Trading DTX Exchange is slowly coming up as a game-changer in the trading industry. With a mix of traditional and blockchain-based trading, DTX Exchange provides something different from others like Solana and Ripple. It is the first platform where you can trade stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex and others. In addition, DTX’s technology infrastructure is cutting-edge, including the Phoenix Wallet, a secure and efficient tool for managing various assets. Additionally, the exchange plans to introduce a platform for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), further expanding its utility. The platform’s commitment to quality and security is evident in its successful audit by SolidProof and its preview listing on CoinMarketCap. It is also a plus that early participants benefit from profit shares and voting rights. These positive investment features make DTX Exchange an interesting prospect to institutions and large-scale, who have a high volume of investment across different asset classes. As such, DTX is reflecting strong investor confidence. Its ongoing presale (in its sixth stage at $0.12) has raised over $10 million, and the community has grown to over 160,000 engaged members. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, DTX Exchange offers unparalleled opportunities with its robust features and community-driven growth.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 10:00:59

This is the first phase of Cryptopia’s distribution plan since it went bankrupt in 2020. According to the NZ Herald , the New Zealand -based crypto exchange’s liquidators declared that more than 10,000 account holders of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) received crypto funds worth more than NZ$400 million ($225 million) in the past 48 hours. Grant Thornton, the public accountancy firm in charge of liquidating Cryptopia’s assets to customers, said that liquidators have been working towards identifying users to proceed with return payments since the launch of Cryptopia’s claim portal four years ago, following Justice David Gendall’s 2020 verdict. The firm revealed that 10,000 accounts is just the tip of the iceberg, as the exchange has an estimated total of 960,000 users entitled to compensation after the crypto exchange’s untimely demise. “This complex process also involved rebuilding the hacked cryptocurrency exchange and reconciling millions of transactions from nearly 960,000 users,” said Grant Thornton.

For now, Grant Thornton stated that it will continue to remind account holders to register on the portal and take the necessary steps to meet the requirements for future distributions. “The liquidators will give account holders notice of the soft cut-off date in the coming days. Further distributions for newly verified users are planned for the new year,” the firm added. Cryptopia went bankrupt in 2019, after the exchange suffered a hack that cost the exchange a loss of around $16 million in crypto assts. In May 2019, liquidators estimated that the exchange owed creditors an estimated total of $4.2 million.

This collaboration revolves around OpenEden’s tokenized T-bills (TBILL tokens), which allow investors to access low-risk, yield-generating assets backed by U.S. Treasury Bills. By utilizing Ripple USD (RLUSD) and other stablecoins, the partnership highlights a pivotal advancement in digital asset investment strategies. XRPL’s Institutional-Grade Features The XRPL’s robust infrastructure is equipped to support institutional-grade financial applications, making it an ideal platform for tokenization efforts such as OpenEden’s TBILL tokens. With features like Automated Market Maker (AMM), Decentralized Identifier (DID), Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT) capability, a Lending Protocol, and native Oracle support, XRPL creates a strong foundation for Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. The platform’s ability to integrate with stablecoins, including RLUSD, further strengthens its appeal to institutional and retail investors. As highlighted by OpenEden Co-Founder Jeremy Ng, the introduction of tokenized T-bills to XRPL marks a transformative moment. This development not only enhances the accessibility of yield-generating assets but also positions XRPL as a key player in bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. How the Integration Works OpenEden’s platform offers a streamlined approach for XRP holders to participate in earning passive income through tokenized T-bills. The process involves four simple steps: Acquiring Stablecoins: Investors can convert XRP into Ripple USD or another supported stablecoin directly on the XRPL. Minting TBILL Tokens: Using OpenEden’s platform, stablecoins such as RLUSD are deposited to mint TBILL tokens. These tokens are backed by U.S. Treasury Bills, ensuring low-risk exposure. Earning Passive Income: Holders of TBILL tokens earn regular interest from the yield generated by T-bills. Yields are paid in RLUSD, providing a consistent and reliable income stream. Flexible Options: Investors can choose to reinvest their earnings, redeem their TBILL tokens for stablecoins, or trade them for XRP or other digital assets on the XRPL. This seamless process allows investors to access high-grade financial instruments while taking full advantage of the transparency, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness offered by blockchain technology. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Expanding the XRP Ecosystem OpenEden’s TBILL tokens have already attracted a diverse range of institutional clients, including foundations, corporate treasuries, and buy-side funds. The partnership’s $75 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) underscores the growing market confidence in this innovative approach. By integrating stablecoins and tokenized RWAs into the XRPL, this initiative expands the utility of the XRP ecosystem beyond traditional remittance use cases. As the XRPL-OpenEden partnership continues to evolve, it showcases the potential for blockchain-based ecosystems to revolutionize traditional finance by offering secure, scalable, and profitable investment options to a global audience.

Movement ( MOVE ) recorded the highest gains among the top 100 largest crypto assets on Dec. 20, reaching an intraday high of $0.877 and closing with a market capitalization of nearly $2 billion. The altcoin’s price rally coincided with a 63% rise in daily trading volume, which exceeded $1.6 billion, indicating growing interest among traders. Additionally, CoinGlass data reveals that open interest in its futures market surged to an all-time high of $103.93 million, nearly double the $56.03 million recorded the previous day, signaling a jump in demand among traders. Why is MOVE rising? The major driver of the altcoin’s gains appears to be tied to its partnership with leading digital asset custody and security company BitGo, which will bring WBTC (a tokenized version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain) onto Movement’s mainnet. By incorporating WBTC, Movement aims to enhance its DeFi offerings, providing users with more options for asset utilization, liquidity provision, and participation in decentralized financial services. Movement’s price surge can also be attributed to the launch of its mainnet last week. As an Ethereum layer-2 network powered by MoveVM, Movement issued its native token, MOVE, last week. A portion of these tokens was distributed to early adopters and community members. Further, MOVE has gained significant traction by securing listings on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Upbit. You might also like: Can your crypto portfolio beat the market? Whales are buying these altcoins Movement kickstarted the token’s launch with an $830 million airdrop. Projects that combine a large user base, substantial airdrops, and strong exchange support often experience initial price spikes before stabilizing. The altcoin’s rally came as the broader crypto market slumped 9.1% over the past day, standing at $3.39 trillion when writing, fuelled by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) drop below the $100k level , which led to a cascading effect across the broader altcoin market with leading assets like Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ) and BNB ( BNB ) all posting losses over the past day. MOVE could rally to $1 again Experts suggest that MOVE could continue to rally in the coming weeks, with the price likely returning to $1 and potentially surpassing it. According to a crypto trading signal community on X, Rose Premium Signals, MOVE could continue its rally, potentially reaching $1.3, which represents an increase of approximately 60% from its current price levels. Meanwhile, analyst Globe Of Crypto observed that MOVE recently broke out of a bullish pennant pattern in the 4-hour time frame. Such a breakout typically signals a continuation of an asset’s price rally. Based on this, the analyst predicts that MOVE could rise by another 40-50%, potentially surpassing $1 in the next week.

The Solana-based cross-chain bridge platform is gaining traction for its innovative solutions in DeFi, offering seamless asset transfers and staking capabilities. With strong trading volume and growing investor interest, the DBR token is emerging as a key player in decentralized finance, further solidifying its market presence after this major listing. Bithumb Announces DeBridge Token Listing Bithumb announced the listing of DeBridge on December 20, adding the Solana-based token to its growing portfolio. The DBR token is now available on the KRW pair, with trading beginning at 6:00 PM KST. Deposits and withdrawals opened shortly after the announcement, supporting only the Solana network. DeBridge, a cross-chain bridge platform, enables real-time asset and information transfers across the DeFi environment, offering tight spreads, abundant liquidity, and guaranteed interest rates. Its utility token is essential for staking and governance within the network. Bithumb’s listing follows the exchange’s strict protocols. These include restricting buy and sell orders during the initial trading phase to ensure market stability. This strategic listing aligns with the growing demand for cross-chain DeFi solutions. It underscores the potential of DeBridge’s technology to address liquidity challenges in decentralized finance ecosystem. With an increasing focus on interoperability, this development positions DBR to lead innovation in blockchain networks. Price Performance: ATH and Market Momentum Following the listing, DeBridge price surged to an all-time high of $0.04702 before stabilizing at $0.04191. In the past 24 hours, DBR price is trading within the $0.03119 and $0.04702 range. The market cap has reached $49 million, with $46 million in trading volume. Similarly, Moca Coin (MOCA) saw a 370% surge after listing on Bithumb exchange. Crypto listed in KRW pairs usually witnessed a pump-and-dump. However, analysts expect DBR’s utility in DeFi and growing adoption to drive its value higher, solidifying its market position.

The firm revealed that the social dominance score—reflecting mentions of the phrase on social platforms—peaked at 0.061. This spike in sentiment mirrors trends seen earlier this year. The last time the “ buy the dip” narrative was this dominant was on April 12, when Bitcoin’s price plummeted from $70,000 to $63,000 within days. A similar surge was observed on August 4, as the cryptocurrency slipped below $60,000, ultimately reaching $53,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $93,200, continuing its week-long struggle to maintain stability above $100,000. Each dip below this psychological level has triggered notable liquidations , with traders scrambling to capitalize on perceived bargains. Rising Interest in ‘Buy the Dip’ Sentiment While Bitcoin battles to regain ground, the sentiment to “buy the dip” has gained traction not just on social media but also in search trends. Global searches for the phrase hit their highest point since August 10, according to Google Trends data. However, interest in the broader term “crypto” has waned since the beginning of December. Over the past seven days, search interest for “crypto” scored 75, a notable decline from the peak score of 100 seen earlier this month. Market Volatility on the Horizon Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Fund, warned investors to brace for heightened volatility in the coming days. In a December 19 post, Edwards noted that market movements could swing significantly in either direction due to the heightened bearish sentiment. He suggested that such pessimism might eventually fuel a market rebound, triggering a short squeeze as traders rush to cover positions. “The odds are decent that the market becomes so bearish it flips,” Edwards remarked, leaving room for optimism amid the current uncertainty. As Bitcoin hovers below $100,000, all eyes are on whether buy the dip sentiment will translate into a reversal or if the market will continue its downward trajectory.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance emerges as a promising altcoin contender, with 400% presale growth and a unique approach to real-world asset tokenization poised to rival Solana’s meteoric rise. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The tokenization revolution A presale success that mirrors Solana’s growth Why investors are eyeing RXS as the next big altcoin Conclusion Investors looking for the next big project are considering investing in altcoins, which can repeat history and grow like Solana’s (SOL) growth in 2021. With a current SOL price of $234.0877, it has cemented its dominance as one of the top blockchain platforms. However, an alternative option, RXS, with a cost of $0.15, is starting to gain traction, and several industry professionals believe it will grow similarly to Solana. The Rexas Finance (RXS) project surges are more likely to happen due to its unique take on real-world asset tokenization and the success achieved with the token’s presale. The price of $0.030 in September 2024 has already skyrocketed to $0.150, an increase of 400%, and is still expected to climb further. Aiming for real-life use cases, along with great tokenomics and advanced tech, Rexas Finance has the potential to perform well in the next altcoin season. Rexas Finance: The tokenization revolution Rexas Finance prioritizes tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate, commodities, and fine art, offering investors efficient and transparent access to typically hard-to-reach markets. By tokenizing assets, Rexas believes there will be more room to design investment strategies that target these usually hard-to-access markets in a better, more efficient, and transparent way. Through the Rexas Estate platform, Rexas enables users to tokenize real estate properties, which then allows these properties to be bought and sold more efficiently, thereby increasing the chances of fractional ownership. The essential distinction between Solana and Rexas Finance, on the one hand, and Rexas Finance, on the other, lies in the Solana ethos. Solana changed the face of the blockchain world by providing extraordinary speeds in transactions and scalability. On the other hand, the aim of Rexas Finance is entirely different: it is intended to bring a radical change in the everyday asset markets. Enabling RWAs to be tokenized can create innumerable growth opportunities, looking at the world’s demands for diversification into blockchain assets. This blend of the real estate markets with blockchain technology and the decentralization and transparency that comes with it are key competitive advantages of Rexas Finance. You might also like: Rexas Finance price forecast: where could RXS be in the next 12 months A presale success that mirrors Solana’s growth The presale performance of Rexas Finance has also drawn parallels to Solana ‘s early days. With a remarkable boost in price, it moved from a $0.030 price tag to $0.150 within a few months, and it has managed to raise more than $28.7 million in the presale. This sudden rise in demand has stirred expectations around the project as it moves toward its presale’s final stages. Similar to the presale of Solana in 2021, it seems Rexas Finance is poised to become the next biggest crypto project. Rexas Finance’s presale has done exceptionally well, and other than the superb price margin growth, it has also been aided by an excellent tokenomics strategy. 42.5% of the entire supply of Rexas finance has been saved for a presale, allowing new investors to buy coins off the market at a considerably low price before they are listed on major exchanges. The exchange listing price is predicted to be around $0.20, allowing early investors to receive a favorable 2x return upon the coins being released in major exchanges. Based on how Rexas Finance is currently proceeding, there is a chance that it may mimic Solana’s rapid growth during 2021. Why investors are eyeing RXS as the next big altcoin The roadmap for Rexas Finance makes the project so distinctive from other altcoins. Rexas Finance also includes cutting-edge technology such as the Rexas Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and Rexas GenAI, besides their goal to tokenize real-world assets. These platforms give users the power to generate personalized tokens, mint NFTs, and use AI to make blockchain interactions easier and more interesting. Rexas Finance’s ecosystem expansion is directed towards appealing to a considerable market, ranging from DeFi users to real estate and NFT markets. Moreover, the project is also equipped with smart contracts that have passed a CertiK audit and thus provide further confidence in investing in Rexas Finance in hopes of significant profits during the upcoming altcoin season. There are high expectations for RXS to develop along a trajectory similar to that of Solana in 2021, as the token’s success in the presale must largely be attributed to its newfound growth. Once more investors comprehend the full breadth of the project and its potential, there could be significant demand for RXS tokens akin to what happened in Solana’s surging prices in a matter of days. Conclusion Following its unique strategy of tokenizing real-world assets and a presale that resembles Solana’s early stages, Rexas Finance is one of the leading altcoin projects to watch in the forthcoming altcoin season.

Japanese policymakers have finally realised the impact that the flawed crypto tax framework has created on the economy. The Liberal Democratic Party, the ruling party of Japan, is preparing a crypto tax reform outline to check the outflow of capital from the country due to the unfriendly tax framework. Here is what you should know about the development. LDP Pushes for Crypto Tax Reform The ruling party is expected to present the reform outline by the end of 2024. Many believe that Japan would bring in considerable changes to its crypto taxation framework in 2025. It seems that the change in the political situation in the US post pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump’s victory has inspired the country to address the demand for the reformation of the crypto tax framework. LDP’s outline aims to make Japan’s crypto tax system competitive and prevent capital flight. Recently, Takuya Hirai, the Minister of Digital Affairs of Japan, stressed the importance of developing a strong crypto tax and regulation framework before the inauguration of Donald Trump in late January 2025. High Tax Burden on Japanese Crypto Traders As said earlier, many crypto investors in Japan pay taxes of up to 55% on profits. Notably, most countries, even those that are less progressive than Japan, have flat capital gains tax rates of 20%. Many argue that Japan’s conservative crypto tax system is driving capital out of the country. LDP’s Web3 and Crypto Policies It was during the tenure of Fumio Kishida that the LDP commenced its efforts to reform the crypto taxation framework in the country. The regime of Kishida was highly supportive of establishing a conducive environment for the growth of Web3. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society of the party has played a crucial role. It has collaborated with the Financial Research Council to create the outline proposal. Voices for Crypto Reform: LDP and Opposition Reports indicate that the ruling and opposition parties unanimously agree that there is an urgent need for a crypto tax reform in Japan. Most lawmakers acknowledge that the unsupportive tax system has stifled the growth of the Japanese crypto industry. There is a high possibility that the reform proposal will receive the unanimous support of Japanese lawmakers. However, recent statements from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who presented himself as a pro-crypto candidate during the campaign, suggest that he prefers to take a cautious approach at this stage to the matter of tax reform.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 11:43:17

This time, the risk-taking wallet holder accumulated FARTCOIN, the hottest meme created by an AI agent. The wallet of sbfonchain.sol now contains FARTCOIN, a trending crossover between memes and AI agents. The asset, created based on the ideas of an AI model, has acquired cult status in the past month, reaching a series of all-time highs. The sbfonchain.sol wallet spent 19,103 SOL, averaging into FARTCOIN in the past 24 hours. The accumulation was at an average price of $1.17, for a total of 3.25M FARTCOIN. After the purchase, the token remained inactive for a few hours. The purchase is relatively small in comparison to previous bigger whale inflows. As of December 19, one whale purchased $43.77M of FARTCOIN, just before the token’s all-time high. The sbfonchain.sol wallet is known for risky trades The wallet of sbfonchain.sol has become active for the first time since November 27, taking positions in high-profile memes. In the interim, the wallet buys and flips more obscure meme tokens. For some of the trades, the wallet bought in near the top. In September, sbfonchain.sol also traded Moodeng (MOODENG) while the asset was trending. After that, the wallet holder flipped Chillguy (CHILLGUY), later divesting all holdings. The buyer’s approach is to roll into hot tokens with large sums, then take profit or cut losses quickly within hours. Previously, the wallet had spent $1.44M on FARTCOIN, flipping the asset soon after that. The latest purchase of FARTCOIN had a similar timeline, as the wallet rolled over all funds into the meme. The purchase was made right after the token dipped from recent highs of $1.27 down to $0.94 . The wallet’s holdings are relatively minor, outside the list of top 150 addresses, but the public profile is drawing more attention to the asset and to the opportunity of buying the dip. Soon after the purchase, the wallet experienced a loss, as the holdings sank from $3.2M to $3.097M in valuation. Overall, the wallet’s performance in the past month has been somewhat underwhelming, as previous flips on DogWifHat (WIF) incurred losses. The previous losses, however, did not seem to faze the wallet owner, as the risky trades continued. The wallet is also not careful with divesting the holdings, as in the case of crashing the MANYU token by directly liquidating all reserves. The wallet was first noted for moving between meme tokens in May. It also gained attention because of its vanity name. There is so far no evidence proposed that the wallet belongs to Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the defunct FTX exchange. Whale buyer enters the market as FARTCOIN expands to new trading hubs FARTCOIN started out as an unserious asset, similar to GOAT and other AI-generated memes. As the asset grew its owner base, exchanges started to pay attention. The meme is held in more than 51K wallets. At first sight, FARTCOIN has a relatively wide distribution, although some of the wallets may be connected and control a larger portion of the supply. The token was also one of the largest holdings in the Truth Terminal wallet. Later, FARTCOIN became a community-owned token, with no known cabal or group of buyers. The wide community put FARTCOIN at the top of all Solana projects based on the number of unique addresses and wallets. The recent purchase by sbfonchain.sol came a day after FARTCOIN was listed on KuCoin. The token was added to the dy/dx futures market a week ago. OKX started trading FARTCOIN on its perpetual futures market starting at 4 AM UTC on December 20. The token will gain a futures market along with AI16Z. FARTCOIN has the advantage of turning into a cult meme, while also riding the AI agent narrative. Both categories are the consensus choices for creating FOMO among buyers, tapping into the demand for irrational memes and social media cults. While the overall meme market slowed down, FARTCOIN used the moment to extend its rally and gain more attention.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 11:45:38

Kiyosaki reveals ‘it’s not too late to buy Bitcoin’,https://finbold.com/rich-dad-r-kiyosaki-reveals-its-not-too-late-to-buy-bitcoin/,"The recent price action in the cryptocurrency market – both the November and the early December rally and the latest downturn – caused some anxiety among investors about whether it is too late to enter a Bitcoin ( BTC ) position. Robert Kiyosaki , a prominent investor and the author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ took the opportunity to alleviate these fears in a pointed X post. Specifically, in a mock conversation, Kiyosaki, in no uncertain terms, opined that it is never ‘too late’ to invest in BTC as the coin ‘is designed to make everyone rich.’ He highlighted in the tweet that this fact applies to ‘those who start late’ as much as to the early investors. Finally, the author concluded his message with a simple warning that, despite the exceptionally bullish tone of his post, investors shouldn’t ‘get greedy.’ Q: IS IT TOO LATE to start buying BITCOIN? A: NO. The beauty of Bitcoins design is it is never too late to start….regardless of how high Bitcoins price goes. Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich…. even those who start late. Just don’t get greedy. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 19, 2024 Is following Kiyosaki’s advice a savvy move for investors? Looking at the performance of Robert Kiyosaki’s favored investors – chiefly Bitcoin, gold , and silver – his message appears to ring true. Traders who listened to his advice and invested in the cryptocurrency or the commodities would have enjoyed stellar gains in 2024. This fact holds particularly true for BTC, as essentially everyone who purchased the coin before mid-November would be significantly in the green, even once the current downtrend is accounted for. BTC 6-month price chart. Source: Finbold Zooming out, however, reveals that Kiyosaki’s advice doesn’t necessarily hold true in myriad ways. To begin with, investors who purchased Bitcoin on his recommendation near the 2021 highs and didn’t have the financial security to outlast the ‘crypto winter’ would have been devastated. Additionally, there is a general sense that the author’s advice is primarily aimed at those with exceptional financial resilience – a resilience that can justify a grand risk appetite – as he is also known for describing recessions – famously periods when most people don’t have much disposable income – as the very best buying opportunities. Indeed, this grand risk appetite is seen in his own approach as Kiyosaki indicated much of his portfolio – despite its successes in 2024 – is fueled by debt and that he is himself more than $1 billion in debt . Finally, the earnestness of the author’s advice can be called into question as, earlier in December, he called on people to sell their homes and buy Bitcoin while he himself claims to own thousands of houses . Can investing in Bitcoin this December truly make everyone rich? As for the accuracy of Kiysoaki’s most recent advice, only time will tell whether following it would lead to profit. On the one hand, the current downtrend in the cryptocurrency market does not negate the overall bull case – Wall Street legend Tom Lee estimates Bitcoin will hit $250,000 in 2025, and the author recently revised his price target for BTC to $350,000 . On the other, the deep plunge digital assets are experiencing in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s latest announcement – a plunge that is, at press time on December 20, proving stickier than for stocks or commodities – equally calls into question the stability of the cryptocurrency bull market and the wisdom of using these assets as a hedge against financial instability. It is worth pointing out that a common thread for Kiyosaki’s advice is that Bitcoin, gold, and silver can save investors from the massive and imminent crash he frequently predicts.

Last Day is January 19!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/germany-gives-order-for-popular-altcoin-last-day-is-january-19/,"Worldcoin (WLD), which has been at the center of controversy since its launch, has failed to overcome the problems it has had with countries. At this point the last news came from Germany. Worldcoin, the cryptocurrency-based digital identity project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is under renewed scrutiny as German regulators demand compliance with European Union (EU) data protection laws. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) said in a statement that the investigation focused on whether Worldcoin's core technology, World ID, complies with GDPR standards. At this point, BayLDA ordered Worldcoin to implement a GDPR-compliant data deletion protocol by January 19 at the latest. GDPR is a comprehensive EU law designed to protect individuals' personal data and privacy, and imposes strict rules on how data is collected, processed and stored. Michael Will, BayDLA State Office Director, said: “With today's decision, we apply European fundamental rights standards in favour of data owners in a technologically challenging and legally complex case. With this decision, all users who provide their iris data to Worldcoin will have an unrestricted opportunity to exercise their right to erasure in the future.” Worldcoin has received the German regulator's decision and plans to appeal it, according to a statement from the institution. Worldcoin, which has had problems with regulators in many countries, voluntarily suspended some of its operations in EU countries during the investigations and made updates to improve compliance. However, countries like Kenya and Portugal have temporarily banned the project due to privacy concerns. Worldcoin, which has fallen by 7.7% in the last 24 hours, continues to trade at $2.22 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

Experts List Alternate Cryptos,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/memecoin-alert-can-shiba-inu-holders-save-shib-from-dipping-below-0-00002-experts-list-alternate-cryptos/,"The post Memecoin Alert: Can Shiba Inu Holders Save SHIB From Dipping Below $0.00002? Experts List Alternate Cryptos appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Shiba Inu (SHIB) is hovering around a critical price point of $0.00002, a key resistant level that SHIB has struggled to breach multiple times in the past. Earlier in October 2024, SHIB was predicted to reach an approximate of $0.00004020 on October 5, 2024. However, despite the prediction, the price didn’t sustain above that level for long. Now, the $0.00002 price level calls for the consideration of alternative projects like DTX Exchange, which has already given traders gains of over 440% in the past few months. SHIB Seems To Be On a Downward Spiral Amidst Other Alternate Cryptos Like DTX Exchange SHIB reached its all-time high of approximately $0.000084 in late 2021. Ever since, it hasn’t sustained impressive price points for traders. There’s been a downward trajectory, with prices falling around $0.000018. The turn of events seemed to be temporary at first, but even with the increase in whale transactions of up to 240%, there hasn’t been any sustained upward momentum. This begs the question: Will investing in alternate cryptos like Fantom (FTM) or DTX yield better returns than waiting on a price change? Based on the current market sentiment and adoption trends, investing in alternate cryptos like DTX Exchange may give more promising returns. The current listing price of DTX Exchange is $0.20, but the current price is set at $0.12, giving a chance for 80% profit in its listing alone, especially for early adopters. DTX Exchange supports a wide range of assets, including stocks, forex, and commodities. Compared to SHIB, this allows traders to explore various markets, serving as a more substantial utility and practical investment option. DTX also provides advanced trading features as up to 1,000x leverage, helping them maximize returns. The presale success of DTX also attracted institutional investors, raising over $10.3 million. With the institutional backing, there’s an increased legitimacy status of the project, opening a door for more growth potential. Based on the current growth, DTX could follow a trajectory similar to established stable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DTX token holders also have governance rights within the platform. They can participate in decision making processes regarding the future of the exchange. Compared to other coins, this community-driven approach creates an environment for deeper engagement and trust in the future of the exchange. DTX Exchange Solidifies Its Technology Foundation As Traders Make More Gains DTX Exchange uses the Vulcan X blockchain technology, which has shown an impressive transaction speed of 0.4 milliseconds and an ability to process over 100,000 transactions per second. The exchange’s solid tech foundation helps traders in fast-moving markets and ensures they can make the most gains without technical difficulties. Alongside DTX’s top tech, they allow low transaction fees compared to the traditional financial markets, which makes DTX more cost-effective and, on the long run, more reliable. Since they employ a non-custodial trading model, allowing users to retain control over private keys, they still stand as one of the best Shiba Inu alternatives. Don’t Wait for SHIB’s Dip When DTX Exchange Promises Gains As SHIB faces a major challenge in maintaining its price above critical support levels, traders look for more stable opportunities like DTX Exchange . Recent projections suggest that early investors in DTX could see returns of up to 321% as it gains traction in the market. The previous gains from the past few months prove a potential for more traction after its broader launch.

Interestingly, some recent findings hint at the positive leads that might be seen in early 2025, which could push the Solana price to new ATH, but how high? Let’s analyze that. How Much Can Solana Price Rise After Spot SOL ETF Approval? With Solana being one of the top cryptos to buy in the market, investors anticipate a Solana price rally to $300. Although the token has historically seen a rally to as high as $263.83, the target is supposed to hit $300 in the short term and $420 in the long term with spot SOL ETF approval. However, in a highly optimistic scenario, the SOL price could hit $1000 in the most favorable conditions. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has fueled the spot Solana ETF anticipation with an X post. He predicted that new crypto exchange-traded funds, including XRP and Solana’s approval, could happen in 2025. However, he also clarified that the delay is due to both the assets being tagged as Securities by the SEC, but a new SEC administration could speed up the process in early 2025. This single comment is enough to keep the Solana holders’ hopes to continue their expectations on the Spot SOL ETF, especially when the ETH, which lacks on many levels compared to SOL, delivers such good results. Since its launch in July, the Ethereum ETF inflows have bagged $2.41 billion. Although both Ethereum and Solana have performed impressively on many levels, Solana is better in transactions per second, transaction fees, and adoption. As a result, it makes quite a sense for the Solana ETF to hit the market. Spot Solana ETF Hopes Remain High The enthusiasm around the spot Solana ETF approval is high as Gary Gensler’s resignation. Gary has been limiting the crypto industry’s growth, but the new administration can change that with better regulations. Additionally, five major firms have already filed for the SOL ETFs, including Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and even Greyscale, which is planning to convert its Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) into SOL ETF. For now, the US investors will have to wait for Solana ETF development until next year, but Bitwise has continued its developments. The firm announced a new Solana Staking ETP launch in Germany , allowing users to earn more than any other Solana products. Eventually, the same could happen in the US once the legal obligations around Sol’s status of Securities turned into a commodity in the SEC’s eyes. More importantly, this is to boost the Solana price, which has much potential left to showcase but ended up halting due to the recent crypto market crash. SOL Technical Analysis Solana token is currently under the influence of the crypto market’s downturn. As a result, the SOL price has dropped 15% in the last 24 hours, currently at $178.11. Additionally, its market capitalization is at $178.11, but the trading volume has increased 29% to $9.19B as large-scale investors focus on utility-based tokens. Although this sudden collapse disappointed many people, analysts have advised investors to focus on long-term performance. According to XO, the Solana price has support and resistance at $214.08 and $260.93. A bullish move can happen if the token crosses the key resistance. What To Anticipate Next? Other than increased liquidity and stability, the investors are eyeing the spot Solana ETF approval to boost the Solana price. With many analysts’ calculative Sol price prediction, the ETF approval could boost the price between $300-$1000. However, the SEC’s stand on Securities is putting the process on hold and is likely to extend till 2025 mid. However, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas sees a major update on the matter with the change in the new administration.

If XRP managed to break past $2.72, it could hit short-term goals at $5.85 and $8.76 with potential for the token to reach an all-time high of $9.78. Source X The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and regulators and the possibility of approving spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. further bolsters the positivity. According to technical analysis, XRP is in the process of forming an ascending triangle, which is a bullish continuation pattern. If a breakout happens above this formation, XRP could easily hit $4 USDT, which would be a 48% gain from the current price. Yeti Ouro Presale Progresses Amid Investor Interest Yeti Ouro is a Play-to-Earn gaming token experiencing steady investor demand during the presale phase. At the moment, stage two is going on; 3,282,716 tokens have been sold for $55,806.165, and 3.3% of the stage has been completed. The token is priced at $0.017 in this phase, after marking a successful stage one with 100,000,000 tokens sold for $1.2 million.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-bulls-have-stepped-in-trust-the-process-heres-why/,"XRP is showing signs of recovery following a sharp 18% decline in value, attributed to the broader cryptocurrency market downturn. This drop, which saw the price fall from $2.7 to $2.08, coincided with Bitcoin’s retreat from $108,000 to under $100,000 after the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% interest rate cut. Despite the bearish sentiment, analyst EGRAG suggests that XRP is poised for a bullish reversal. XRP Finds Support After Recent Decline According to EGRAG’s analysis, XRP found support in the $2.17–$2.27 price range following its descent to $2.2. Using a 1-hour chart, the analyst noted that this zone could be the foundation for stabilization and recovery. #XRP Quick Update 1 Hour Time Frame ( UPDATE): The #BULLS has Stepped IN. Trust the Process https://t.co/xQDzxuveIx pic.twitter.com/8fljp7iDYM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 18, 2024 Currently, XRP trades below the 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), representing the nearest resistance level. The analyst remarked that this positioning highlights the ongoing tension between buyers and sellers. EGRAG’s analysis indicates the formation of a potential double-bottom structure—a bullish reversal pattern—following the recent price action. The first bottom was observed when XRP dropped to $2.33 on December 16 before rebounding to $2.72, a move fueled by the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD . The second bottom formed during the recent decline to $2.17. Should XRP consolidate within the current support range, it could set the stage for a recovery. However, the price must surpass the neckline resistance at $2.7 to confirm the double-bottom pattern. Technical Indicators Support a Bullish Outlook EGRAG’s analysis also highlights encouraging signs from key technical indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has aligned with price trends and recently hovered near 70, a level suggesting increasing momentum. The analyst stated that a breakout above 70 could pave the way for further strength, potentially reaching 90. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator supports the possibility of bullish momentum. Its histogram has flipped positive, signaling a potential upward trend. Meanwhile, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has also improved, indicating a strengthening trend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Short-Term Scenarios In a previous forecast made six days before the latest downturn, EGRAG outlined two potential scenarios for XRP’s short-term price movements. At that time, XRP was trading at $2.31. Scenario A suggested a breakout above $2.5, potentially initiating upward movement. Scenario B, however, predicted a dip to $2.27 followed by consolidation within the $2.17–$2.27 range. According to the analyst, this consolidation phase would allow XRP to form a double-bottom structure, providing a foundation for subsequent bullish action. The recent market activity suggests that XRP is following Scenario B. After testing the $2.2 level and finding support, the cryptocurrency is expected to consolidate before attempting a breakout. EGRAG noted that this phase would enable key moving averages to align, creating a stronger base for sustained growth. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.27, marking an 8.26% decrease in the past 24 hours. For now, investors are closely monitoring a possible price interaction with the $2.39 EMA resistance and the $2.7 neckline.

The mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $2.1 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $1.2 billion, dropped over 25 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $0.024 on Friday, December 20, during the early New York session. Following the heightened crypto bearish sentiment, more than $1.3 million was liquidated from the PENGU leveraged market, with over 85 percent involving long traders. With more early adopters of PENGU, who received the token through the recent airdrop accelerating their profit-taking, the altcoin faces more bearish sentiment in the near term. PENGU Market Fundamentals The rise of PENGU tokens is bolstered by the tangible success of the Pudgy Penguins collection of 8,888 NFTs. According to market data from OpenSea, the Pudgy Penguins NFTs have a floor price of about 16.8 ETH, which is more than $50k, and represents over a 51 percent spike in the past 90 days. The Pudgy Penguins team has expanded their services beyond the digital realm into the physical world through merchandise, which includes toys, and clothes. Through the Huddle community, which has grown significantly in the recent past, the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem is well positioned to grow exponentially amid the ongoing crypto mainstream adoption. What Next? After the PENGU token airdrop cools off in the near term, the project is well slated to rise exponentially amid the macro crypto bull run in 2025. Moreover, the PENGU project managed to absorb heightened selling pressure to hold a market cap of above $1 billion. Consequently, crypto analyst alias Leshka anticipates the PENGU to cross the $10 billion market cap in the near term.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 11:56:32

And with it, the gold rush for the next hot new crypto. While AVAX and NEAR were once the hot new crypto in their initial parabolic runs to all-time highs in 2021 and 2022, respectively, they are no longer in the running for the plum in 2025. One exciting newly launched DeFi protocol is expected to make a strong case in the form of Remittix (RTX)—and the best part? This hot new crypto just launched its presale. Here’s why analysts believe Remittix will outperform NEAR and AVAX in 2025. Remittix: Laying down a marker for PayFi in 2025 The smart money is betting on hot new crypto projects to turn in big-time gains in 2025—and one of those projects is Remittix. Kicking off stage 1 of its presale amid massive intrigue from industry observers, Remittix revolutionizes cross-border payments by creating a blockchain powered payment network, enabling users to send fiat payments to any bank account using cryptocurrencies. With zero FX fees and near-instantaneous settlements, Remittix is filling the gap between traditional payment processors like Wise and Stripe and the $4 trillion crypto economy. With the global cross-border payments industry forecast to exceed a $250 trillion valuation by 2027, Remittix is well-positioned to capture a sizable chunk of the inflows expected to flow into the industry thanks to its unique PayFi infrastructure. The Remittix ecosystem will be powered by its native $RTX token, which is available in its presale at just $0.015. The presale is an ideal opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a low-cap blue chip with all the momentum and runway to go on a godlike pump in 2025. Remittix takes the cake as the hot new crypto presale that’s left on the board. NEAR and AVAX poised for a comeback? NEAR and AVAX are Layer-1 blockchain protocols that peaked at all-time highs in previous bull runs. And while both NEAR and AVAX token prices have fallen by the wayside relative to their ATH levels, both L1 platforms are making decent comebacks as the year comes to an end. NEAR Protocol is up by a decent, if rather unspectacular, 13.6% in the past month, while AVAX is up by a substantial 39% within the same time frame. The price action that both NEAR and AVAX are recording as the year ends indicates a potential comeback brewing in the works when the new year arrives. While they will never be mistaken as hot new crypto investments, their large market caps make them more appropriate for more conservative investors wishing to gain some exposure to the crypto market. However, investors looking for a pump will be better served by investing in low-cap gems like Remittix. Remittix takes plum as THE hot new crypto presale of 2025 NEAR and AVAX are solid picks but have a more limited upside for growth; at best, they might retest their previous all-time highs. That’s not bad at all. However, Remittix, with its value proposition, discounted presale prices, and strategic positioning in a lucrative market, has all the markings of a blue chip that’s ready to skyrocket once it lists on exchanges, making it the better choice for investors looking to outperform the rest of the market in 2025.

This crash happened after the Federal Reserve delivered a highly hawkish interest rate decision. Analysts are optimistic that many coins will bounce back in the near term as investors buy the dip. So, here are some of the best crypto under $1 to buy the dip in. The Best Crypto Under $1 To Buy Crypto traders love to buy cheap coins, hoping that they will do better than mega caps like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. Some of the best under $1 altcoins to buy are Stellar Lumens (XLM), Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), and DexBoss (DEBO). These tokens will likely bounce back when Bitcoin price bounces back. As we have written before, some analysts believe that the BTC price will jump to $500,000 soon. Stellar Lumens (XLM) Stellar Lumens is one of the top crypto under $1 to buy because of its strong fundamentals. Jed McCaleb, a Ripple co-founder, established Stellar to simplify how people move money around the world. Stellar is now mostly known for its integration with USD Coin, the second-biggest stablecoin in the world. It has also created a partnership with Moneygram. This deal lets people send and receive USDC stablecoins in its physical locations globally. Stellar price has suffered a harsh reversal this week as it reached a low of $0.3351. It has moved slightly below the 50-day moving average and the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. XLM has also fallen below the key support at $0.3540, its lowest swing on December 9. Stellar’s long-term outlook is bullish. We wrote that the XLM price will rally to $1 in the near term. Such a move implies a 196% return from the current level. DexBoss (DEBO) DexBoss is another best altcoin under $1 to buy as panic spreads in the crypto industry. The benefit is that it is now in a presale that has already attracted over $160,000 from investors. If all goes well, most of these investors will be profitable. That’s because one DEBO coin is trading at $0.01, much lower than the target listing price of $0.050. This means that investors who decide to sell immediately after listing will make a 405% return DexBoss will be a decentralized exchange that will enable users trade thousands of cryptocurrencies with minimal fees and slippage. You can buy DEBO here . Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Hedera Hashgraph is another top crypto under $1 to buy. The daily chart below shows that the HBAR price has dropped sharply in the past few days and is hovering slightly above the 50% retracement level. HBAR price remains above the 50-day and 100-moving averages. Most importantly, it has formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. The upper line of the wedge connects the higher highs since November, while the bottom line links the lower lows. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back now that the wedge is nearing its confluence level. If this happens, it may rise to $0.3941, the highest point this year. This target is about 57% above the current level. Hedera Price More Altcoins Under $1 To Buy There are many more altcoins under $1 to buy the dip in. Some of the most notable ones are meme coins like Pepe, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. The other top crypto under $1 to invest in are popular names like Cardano, Tron, and Filecoin.

On Dec. 19, the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender and host a Bitcoin strategic reserve added 11 BTC worth over $1 million to its holdings. With the recent purchase, the country’s total holdings now stand at over 5,980 Bitcoin, currently valued at over $577 million according to the National Bitcoin Office’s tracker. Up until now, El Salvador’s Bitcoin accumulation followed the steady pace of its “1 Bitcoin a day” program, launched by President Nayib Bukele after making the cryptocurrency legal tender in 2022. However, the latest purchase deviated from the strategy and aligns with the National Bitcoin Office’s plans to continue buying Bitcoin at an “accelerated pace,” as conf irmed by the Bitcoin office’s director, Stacy Herbert, on Dec. 19. This follows the country’s recent yet-to-be-confirmed $1.4 billion IMF deal , which mandates changes to its Bitcoin policy. The global regulator has repeatedly warned of the economic risks Bitcoin adoption could pose to the nation’s financial stability. You might also like: El Salvador to discontinue Bitcoin wallet Chivo in $1.4b IMF deal As part of the deal, El Salvador has agreed to remove mandatory requirements for businesses to accept Bitcoin, making it optional, and to restrict tax payments to US dollars. Further, the country will also wind down the Chivo crypto wallet, which was launched in 2021 as the nation’s state-backed platform to facilitate Bitcoin transactions. Nevertheless, according to Herbert, the country will continue to accept Bitcoin as legal tender and expand its efforts to solidify its position as a Bitcoin-focused economy. This includes advancing Bitcoin capital markets, fostering education programs, and supporting private-sector Bitcoin wallets to serve the growing ecosystem. Additionally, initiatives like blockchain developer training and financial literacy programs will remain central to El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy as governments worldwide grow increasingly curious about Bitcoin, spurred by incoming US President Donald Trump’s plan to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Notably, regulators in Brazil have proposed allocating 5% of the nation’s $370 billion treasury to a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Elsewhere, a deputy in the Russian parliament has urged Finance Minister Anton Siluanov to consider a similar approach. Last month, Polish minister Sławomir Mentzen also pitched the idea of Poland holding Bitcoin in a bid to make the country more crypto-friendly.

Just today, China's one-year government bond yield dropped below 1% for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis, adding to the year-to-date downturn. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 1.7%. How does that play out for risk assets like bitcoin, which slumped overnight? Well, there are two key reasons to feel optimistic. For a start, the continued decline in yields suggests Beijing will have to roll out more aggressive stimulus measures than we saw earlier this year . Jeroen Blokland, the founder and manager of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, put it succinctly: “This indicates that China's economic troubles are far from over, and the government will do what aging economies often do: ramp up government spending, allow for larger deficits and higher debt levels, and drive interest rates down toward zero.” And there's more to consider. This situation in China also raises questions about Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's recent alarm over interest rates, which sent bitcoin tumbling to $95,000 from $105,000. China, the world's factory, is facing worsening deflation having already experienced the longest stretch of falling prices since the late 1990s. That could cap PPI and CPI readings worldwide, including in the U.S., a major trading partner. BNP Paribas noted this phenomenon earlier this year, with analysts saying that China has already contributed to lowering core inflation in the eurozone and the U.S. by about 0.1 percentage point and core goods inflation by roughly 0.5 percentage point. What this means is that Powell's concerns about stubborn inflation may be unfounded and begs the question whether he will really stick to just two rate cuts for 2025 as he implied on Wednesday? Many experts think there might be more. “Fed concerns on inflation are misguided. Interest rates are still too high in the U.S., and liquidity is about to increase, driving Bitcoin higher,” said Dan Tapiero, CEO and CIO of 10T Holdings, on X , alluding to China's declining bond yields. For now, markets aren't considering this bullish angle. BTC has dropped below $95,000 and ETH has slipped to $3,200. All the 100 biggest coins are flashing red. Futures tied to the S&P 500 are down 0.5%, indicating a negative open and continuation of the post-Fed risk-off. Sentiment may worsen if the core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, comes in hotter than expected later today. That might see markets price out another rate cut, leaving just one on the table for 2025. Stay alert!

FART's rise is as much about human psychology as economics. In a market where fundamental investments are faltering, it has become a symbol of the absurd, a light-hearted rebellion against the grim financial forecasts. Its platform allows users to potentially submit related-theme memes or jokes to earn tokens. It features a unique transactional system where each trade produces a digital flatuence sound. People are investing not for the promise of utility or groundbreaking technology but for the joy of the moment, the shared giggle over a coin whose name alone is enough to break the tension of the day. It isn't all about the jokes, though. The token is part of the rising AI agent crypto sector, one that claims to use AI-powered entities to perform tasks on blockchain networks autonomously under a memecoin branding. Derivatives Positioning The BTC one-month basis has pulled back to 10% on the CME while the three-month basis has dropped to around 12% on offshore exchanges. ETH futures display similar behavior. Most major tokens are showing negative perpetual cumulative volume deltas for the past 24 hours, a sign of net selling pressure. DOGE has seen the most intense selling. Front-end BTC and ETH show a strong put bias, but calls expiring on Jan. 31 and beyond continue to trade at a premium.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced significant price changes lately. In the past week, its price dropped by 26.17%. Over the past month, it fell by 34.73%. Despite these declines, WIF is up 28.14% over the last six months. Technical indicators suggest that WIF might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index is at 29.14, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 27.16. Both are below 30, which often signals an oversold condition. The current price range is between $2.38 and $3.52. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.29, and the 100-day SMA is $2.69. If WIF can rise above the nearest resistance level at $4, it could reach the second resistance at $5.33. This would be an increase of over 50% from current prices. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $1.91, the next support is at $0.7749, representing a significant drop. The MACD level is negative at -0.0965, showing bearish momentum, but the oversold indicators suggest a possible rebound. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced notable price movements recently. In the past week, its value dropped by 16.90%, reflecting a significant short-term decline. Over the past month, the decrease was less steep at 3.70%, suggesting some stabilization. Impressively, over the last six months, SHIB’s price has surged by 34.10%, indicating strong long-term potential. Currently trading between $0.000023966 and $0.000032006, SHIB is approaching its nearest support level at $0.000020063. If it holds above this point, it may rally towards the nearest resistance at $0.000036143. Breaking this resistance could lead to testing the second resistance level at $0.000044183, which would be an increase of around 38%. Conversely, falling below the support might push the price down to the second support level at $0.000012023. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 35.34, suggesting the coin is nearing oversold territory and might rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.000024107, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.000026627, indicating potential bearish momentum. The MACD level is negative at -0.0000005695, but the Stochastic oscillator at 40.84 is in a neutral zone. Considering these factors, SHIB’s price could consolidate before making a decisive move, with close attention needed on key support and resistance levels. Conclusion Although WIF, DOGE, and SHIB are strong assets, XYZVerse (XYZ) leads as the pioneering all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting significant growth in the 2024 bull run.

Following the announcement on Dec. 18, all sectors of the crypto market, including utility tokens, entered a downtrend with tokens like Ripple and Shiba Inu recording significant price drops. However, an AI utility token IntelMarkets, has defied the current market trend, topping gains with $4.9 million raised from its ongoing presale. In this article, we will explore the factors contributing to IntelMarkets’ impressive performance! Ripple: XRP Price Drops Following Federal Rate Cut Announcement The native cryptocurrency of Ripple Labs, XRP, also fell victim to the broad market downtrend witnessed on December 18. The price of XRP declined below $2.25 just hours after the announcement of the Federal rate cut, its market cap dropping over 5% as well. This downturn happened just a day after XRP surpassed BNB and Solana to become the 4th largest crypto by market cap. Ripple’s surge to its current position was influenced by the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD), which boosted its price and market cap. Nevertheless, crypto whales saw the downtrend as an opportunity to purchase 30 million XRP tokens worth $78 million, sparking a recovery for XRP which is now trading at the $2.38 level. Analysts foresee Ripple back to its bullish trajectory by the weekend. Shiba Inu Investors Sell SHIB Holdings, Sparks Selling Pressure Memecoins suffered the most from the Fed Rate cut downturn. Shiba Inu experienced a significant price drop of over 15% while its trading volume dropped by 64%. This suggests that buyers are not defending the asset; instead, they are liquidating their SHIB holdings to mitigate further losses. SHIB’s momentum and sentiment has remained negative since the announcement, while it seeks immediate support at $0.00002500. Experts speculate that a breakdown below this level could move SHIB closer to the 200 EMA’s resting level at $0.00002038. Furthermore, experts have noted that Shiba Inu is not strong enough to make a recovery soon, unless there’s a significant decrease in selling pressure. Based on technical indicators, the Shiba Inu price is predicted to rise 2.69% from its current trading point to $0.00002485 before the new year. IntelMarkets (INTL) Record Gains Amid The Market Downturn While major utility tokens such XRP experience decline alongside Shiba Inu, IntelMarkets is gaining significant traction as the world’s first AI-powered smart trading platform. Powered by AI technology, IntelMarkets aims to provide fast, transparent transactions and seamless, risk-free trading for its users. IntelMarkets helped investors escape the potential losses from the current market downturn, providing them with AI trading agents which offer real-time market analysis from over 10,000+ data points, to investors, helping them stay ahead of the market. Amid the downturn, IntelMarkets’ investors made passive income from staking dividends, while enjoying holding perks such as reduced trading fees and high leverage options up to 1000x, while other investors mourned their losses. The best part is the inter-stage returns over 30% they enjoyed as IntelMarkets transitioned to stage 8 of its presale, with INTL price increasing from $0.064 to $0.073. Market analysts have observed a migration of Shiba Inu investors and others to IntelMarkets, evidenced by its rapid presale growth, which has raised over $4.9 million.

Key XRP levels to watch In the short term, traders are eyeing the $2 psychological level as a critical marker for recovery. The immediate support level lies at $1.92, and if this holds, XRP could stabilize and attempt to reclaim higher ground. On the upside, the resistance level at $2.55 will be the next challenge for the bulls. While the sudden crash has rattled investors, the overall outlook remains cautiously optimistic. Traders and analysts will closely monitor whether XRP can quickly bounce back above $2, a move that could restore confidence and set the stage for renewed upward momentum. Interestingly, a lot of chart analysts on X (formerly Twitter), such as Crypto Tony, had suggested that XRP was holding up relatively well compared to other altcoins before the price continued to cascade downward. This false sense of resilience was quickly shattered as selling pressure mounted. Renowned on-chain analyst Ali Martinez added to the discussion, noting that if XRP rebounds to $2.62, a significant 20.50 million in short positions could face liquidation. $20.50 million in short positions will be liquidated if $XRP rebounds to $2.62! pic.twitter.com/IKMCIolaiV — Ali (@ali_charts) December 20, 2024 This potential squeeze could serve as a catalyst for a swift recovery if the market sentiment flips bullish.

The latest on the block is decentralized finance (DeFi), which made some noise in the crypto downtrend. DeBridge (DBR) is making waves in the crypto market after a 30% price surge, fueled by its recent listing on South Korea’s Bithumb exchange. This Solana-based token, DeBridge (DBR), hit an all-time high of $0.04702 before settling at $0.0347. In the last 24 hours, DBR is ranked at 697 and has seen $72 million in trading volume, with a market cap of $40.57 million. Bithumb’s decision to list DeBridge is a big deal for the token’s visibility and adoption. The listing, announced on December 20, allows DBR to be traded in South Korean won (KRW) pairs. This move is expected to attract more investors and strengthen DeBridge’s position in the global crypto market. To ensure stability, Bithumb implemented trading controls during the initial phase, a practice common with new listings on the exchange. This means attracting more people to the blockchain industry, securing mainstream acceptance, and so on. What is DeBridge? As its name implies, deBridge acts as a cross-chain bridge and communication layer that facilitates the effective movement of data and assets across different chains. DeBridge helps solve liquidity problems in DeFi by offering low fees and plenty of liquidity. The DBR token is important for the platform, allowing users to stake and vote on decisions within the network. What’s Next for DBR? While some tokens listed on Bithumb experience short-term price jumps, analysts believe DBR’s practical use in DeFi could support long-term growth. Notably, other KRW-listed tokens are facing price fluctuations, but DBR is showing signs of a further breakout with innovative technology and real-world use cases. For U.S. crypto users, DeBridge’s rise highlights the growing demand for efficient cross-chain solutions. Today, there is no single blockchain that everyone uses and that every asset is based on. Instead, there are multiple blockchains including Layer 1s and Layer 2s that are widely used by the public. In short, DeBridge is positioning itself as a key player in the global DeFi market, offering opportunities for both seasoned investors and newcomers.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 12:11:12

She packed her bags, quit her job, and moved to LA, California, to become a celebrity. It looks like she has had to pack her bags back as quickly as she came. Here is a quick timeline: a Hawk Tuah video, a bunch of podcasts and high-end parties, a crypto project, a court case, and a disappearing act. It looks like all fun and games until investors realize this is how every celebrity-backed memecoin or crypto project has left them high and dry. As Cryptopolitan reported yesterday, the Hawk Tuah girl and those behind the ill-fated launch have been sued. This comes after the $HAWK token lost all its value in one day. Who was caught up in the mix? The Cayman Islands-based organization, which raised funds through token sales, along with creator OverHere Ltd., executive Clinton So, and promoter Alex Larson Schultz. Plaintiffs accused the team behind the whirlwind crypto sale that exploited Welch’s celebrity position to generate a “frenzy.” They claim they took advantage of first-time crypto investors. They are also demanding damages of more than $150,000, but they are also open to any other amount the court may deem appropriate. A new era of failed celebrity crypto projects As reported by The Sun, Haliey Welch appears to have gone underground. Welch has not been seen publicly, and she has not posted on social media for weeks since the scandal. Fans claim she has gone MIA as she has also not released a new episode of her weekly podcast, Talk Tuah, for the past two weeks. Her last Instagram post promoting the show was on December 3. Welch initially told Fortune that her memecoin was “not just a cash grab” and that she had revised her opinions on crypto in recent months after gaining more knowledge on the subject. BREAKING: HAILEY WELCH ANNOUNCES SHE IS GOING TO BED WHEN THE PANEL IS ASKED HOW MUCH THEY WERE PAID. pic.twitter.com/iW4R7vGSuZ — Mr. Frog, (Road to Redemption Arc) (@TheMisterFrog) December 5, 2024 At that time, her manager, Jonnie Forster, maintained that they were only distributing free tokens to social media followers who bought her merchandise and were not encouraging people to purchase them outright. Was that the case, though? Hawk Tuah’s failed crypto project is just the tip of the iceberg. This year alone, investors have suffered losses from failed celebrity projects. Is it that investors can’t pick out good projects to invest in? Or is their blind trust in celebrities their pending doom? Fame to failure – Celebrities go wrong on crypto Let’s run the list. Celebrities hop from one movie project to the next. One talk show to the next. One scandal to the next. Now, it’s crypto projects, crypto exchanges, and memecoins – as long as they are being paid. Andrew Tate. Have you heard of him? He swore other celebrities were on a scam rut and he wasn’t. The “Masculinity” influencer launched his Solana-based memecoin, Daddy Tate (DADDY), aiming to replicate the success of Iggy Azalea’s Mother Iggy (MOTHER) token. Price chart of Andrew Tate’s Daddy Tate (DADDY) tokeen. Source: CoinMarketCap Well, it appears he is like the rest. DADDY has suffered many pump-and-dumps and remains far below its launch price. Next to Nigeria. Davido, an internationally recognized Afrobeat artist, debuted his memecoin Davido (DAVIDO) on the Solana blockchain on May 29. Davido earned 7.5 SOL eleven hours prior to launch. He created DAVIDO on Pump.fun and paid 7 SOL for 203 million DAVIDO tokens, accounting for 20.3% of the total supply. Shortly after the token’s price surged, he sold all of his holdings, flipping 7 SOL for $500,000. Following the dump, DAVIDO lost all value. Then comes Hollywood’s Cardi B, Jason Derulo, and Caitlyn Jenner. Derulo accused Sahil Arora, a crypto influencer and controversial memecoin co-creator, of orchestrating a pump-and-dump scheme for his own profit. Jenner piled on, also blaming Arora. In Cardi’s case, the UAE wouldn’t take any chance with its citizens being scammed. Investigations have been opened into her WAP token. Should you worry about PNUT? Well, the fight over PNUT continues, and the price does not look too good. PNUT could be the next HAWK on the list. PNUT has gained support and market recognition following its ties to Donald Trump, Make America Great Again (MAGA), and Elon Musk. The token initially gained traction after being listed on Binance , but has since seen fluctuating performance. Soon after that, Mark Longo, owner of the Peanut the Squirrel brand, issued a cease-and-desist letter to Binance, accusing the platform of trademark infringement in relation to its PNUT-themed memecoin. After that, the price tanked. On-chain data from CoinMarketCap shows that PNUT is down over 25% in one day alone. What could go wrong? Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Longo has accused the PNUT community of exploiting his story for financial gain.

Toncoin (TON) has dropped 10.45% over the last 30 days and is up 1,065% since inception. Looking ahead, TON is anticipated to trade higher. It will cross the $10 mark in 2026 and $20 in 2028. TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized protocol designed by Telegram and created by the community. The protocol is designed as a distributed supercomputer, or “super server,” that consists of TON Blockchain , TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. The native token for the network is called Toncoin. “Will TON ever go up? Can TON reach the $10 mark? Where will TON be in five years?” These are the questions traders and investors ask. Let’s answer them and more in our Toncoin price prediction.

The move came as Bitcoin registered losses below $93,000, a move that affected the wider crypto market. TON’s Total Value L ocked (TVL) was similarly affected and dropped by over $50M since the beginning of the month. At press time it was at $253M.

The drop in TON value could be attributed to the drop in the crypto market and the waning TVL. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2026. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2030. Will TON reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2030. Is TON a good investment? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON is set to trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Recent news TON Society, a community of TON enthusiasts, has launched the first-of-its-kind initiative to free Telegram CEO Pavel Durov. The move follows Justin Sun’s intention to create a DAO to help free Durov and is ready to donate $1 million if the community supports it.

In June 2020, all Toncoin tokens (98.55% of the total supply) became available for mining. The tokens were placed in special Giver smart contracts, enabling anyone to mine until 28 June 2022. Users mined around 200,000 TON daily. All the tokens were mined in two years, marking the completion of the distribution event.

Is the time for a market recovery approaching? Traders need to take advantage of volatility First of all, it must be acknowledged that markets are markets, and the best laid plans can be wiped out at a whim. This is why those who are the most successful in the markets are generally very long term investors. As long as you have your money on the right horses, the potential wild swings of the market are much less of a worry. That said, there are always those who want to take advantage of volatility over the short to medium term time-frame, and the current precipitous downturn in the crypto market could be ripe for this. Precipitous Bitcoin dump continues Source: TradingView First of all, there is no little matter of a huge dump taking place for Bitcoin. The price has crashed out of the ascending channel and does not appear to be slowing down yet. The measured move for the channel is on the chart at $88,000. It is starting to look like the bears could bring the price there. It just depends whether horizontal support at the current level will hold. Another concern is the gaping drop if $88,000 does not hold. With all this in mind, it’s exactly at times like these when there is money to be made. Forecasting when the $BTC price will finally turn back around becomes all-important. Of course, we could even be seeing a descent into a bear market. All possibilities are on the table. That said, this particular scenario is probably not likely just yet. Good buy levels for $ETH Source: TradingView For $ETH, it can be seen that the fake-out of the triangle has resulted in the price heading back down fast. The 0.618 Fibonacci at $2,881, and the 0.786 Fibonacci at $2,552 are both good buy levels. There is also the bottom of the triangle as a last possibility. $SOL approaches next big support Source: TradingView The $SOL price is in precipitous decline right now. It has fallen out of the bull flag after turning the major support at $202 into resistance. The price is currently stopped at a horizontal level of support, but may continue on down to the stronger horizontal support at $162. This also could coincide with an ascending trendline as seen on the chart above. A bounce has to come for Bitcoin and crypto. It is just a case of when, and how hard. It isn’t likely to be long before we find out both. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BCHG's NAV premium compression is ongoing, influenced by less robust private placements compared to other Grayscale funds like GSOL, which had a more extreme premium bleed. Bitcoin Cash's network metrics, such as non-zero balance addresses and active address ratio, indicate a lack of significant usage, failing to meet its P2P cash system goal. Both Bitcoin Cash and BCHG are hold; BCHG's premium may adjust if BCH appreciates, but better returns are likely found elsewhere in the market. In late-September, I offered readers my latest take on the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust ( BCHG ) through Seeking Alpha. While I've generally kept a small speculative position in Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) off and on through the years, I've never once rated BCHG a 'buy' having now covered the fund three times in the last 12 months. Since my last article covering the fund, BCH has indeed outperformed BCHG: BCHG vs BCH since 9/25/24 (Seeking Alpha) Bitcoin Cash is up over 35% since late-September, while BCHG has lagged the underlying asset by a significant degree. In this update, we'll get into the recent compression in the NAV rate of BCHG, the share dynamics of the fund, and on-chain metrics for BCH to determine if either of these assets are a buy at this point in time. Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust I won't bury the lede, BCHG still trades at a considerable premium to the net asset value, or NAV, of the underlying BCH that is represented by each fund share. However, while the 62.7% premium to NAV is still too high in my personal view, it's a large improvement from the 112% premium that was observable the day my last article was published: BCHG Premium (CoinGlass) The chart above shows the trend in the NAV rate going back to September 2023. At that time, the fund shares actually traded at a sizable discount to NAV. But in 2024, we had the return of the premium, and to a significant degree. On April 2nd, BCHG shares traded at a 300% premium to NAV, which was the largest premium since April 2021. One could definitely argue that I've been early on my arguments against NAV rate premiums in excess of 100%, but I don't think I've been wrong. It is my belief that this NAV rate compression is far from over, and I take that view because of what we're observing in some of the other Grayscale funds. Grayscale NAV Rates (CoinGlass) BCHG now has a smaller premium to NAV than the Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ). I've covered GSOL's premium for Seeking Alpha several times and have been very bearish on the premium and on private placement lockup expiration. We've seen the implications from those lockups start to manifest for GSOL. However, the premium bleed has been much less extreme in BCHG than it has been for GSOL to this point. The latter of which eclipsed 800% earlier this year. Grayscale Trust 12/28/22 12/18/24 Change Bitcoin Cash 34,812,900 45,966,400 32.0% Litecoin ( LTCN ) 17,204,700 23,985,800 39.4% Filecoin ( FILG ) 111,400 1,920,900 1624.3% Chainlink ( GLNK ) 321,010 1,197,610 273.1% Solana 1,522,140 7,088,535 365.7% Source: Grayscale, GSOL shares from 12/28/22 are 5 for 1 split-adjusted I suspect one of the major reasons why BCHG has had a far more orderly NAV premium re-rating than GSOL is due in due to the fact that the private placements through Grayscale weren't nearly as robust for Bitcoin Cash as they were for Solana. Where a fund like GSOL has had 365% growth in shares outstanding through private placements since the end of 2022, BCHG has had just 32% growth. The table above indicates that the strongest growth in shares over the last two years has absolutely been linked to the NAV premium extremity, as GLNK and FILG have also traded at sky-high premiums. Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin Cash notoriously spawned from the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hard-fork that resulted from the block size war preceding the 2017 bull market. The major selling point of Bitcoin Cash as a network is that proponents claim it is closer to Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for Bitcoin to be a peer-to-peer digital cash system rather than a digital store of value akin to something like Gold. I happen to personally agree with much of the sentiment from the BCH community regarding Bitcoin's shortcomings. However, that doesn't necessarily mean BCH is a buy. As I see it, the data would actually suggest BCH has failed to be a P2P cash system as well. BCH Total Non-Zero Addresses (IntoTheBlock) The first metric that I feel shows a general lack of interest for Bitcoin Cash is non-zero balance addresses on the network. That figure currently stands at 24.8 million. Not only is this only about a 40% increase from the 17.7 million starting point from 2017 following the fork, but it's actually a decline of 2% year over year. The lack of total addresses with balance wouldn't be totally concerning by itself if those addresses were using BCH to a significant degree. But that is not really the case, judging by active address ratio: BCH Active Address Ratio (IntoTheBlock) This takes the active address on the chain and divides it by the total addresses. The active address ratio on Bitcoin Cash has generally fallen somewhere between 0.2% and 0.4% with outliers in both directions. This is substantially worse than the active address ratio for Bitcoin, which is typically above 1% each day and was above 2% during most of 2023. However, it's important to keep in mind that Bitcoin Core supporters who opposed the fork could still have BCH from the fork with no intention of ever moving it. If we take the all-time low in Bitcoin Cash non-zero addresses (14.9 million) and assume the spread between the low and the current figure (24.8 million) is more indicative of the actual Bitcoin Cash community (lets call it 10 million), we can make an adjusted active address ratio for the sake of a more fair comparison. BCH Active Address Ratio (CoinMetrics) The 30-day active address number for Bitcoin Cash is currently about 50k. If we divide that by the 10 million adjusted Bitcoin Cash zero wallet address figure described above, we still get an active address ratio of just 0.5%. This is below Bitcoin and well below the 4.5% active address ratio observed by PoW blockchain peer Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). Closing Summary From where I sit, Bitcoin Cash and the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust are both just holds. I won't call BCHG an outright sell because it's always possible BCH appreciates the premium away if BCHG shares don't rise with the price of the underlying. You can certainly talk me into direct BCH holdings as a small speculation, or to simply toy around with a fast blockchain. But I'm not going to call BCH a 'buy' based on any fundamental setup that I'm observing in the network data. To be clear, this is not to say the chain isn't interesting technologically. I think things like CashFusion are important, and I believe there are interesting developments happening on the blockchain. But beyond that, I believe traders/speculators/investors will likely see better returns elsewhere if/when the market gets a proper 'alt-season.'",BCHG|BCH-USD,EN,0,0,BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-20 12:17:26

In 2021, etoro has attemped to list itself previously through a SPAC deal but had terminated it amid stock market volitality and plunge in crypto at the time. The deal had also reportedly ran into regulatory problems. The online trading platform has significantly improved its profitability. The firm had reported a core profit of $107 million last year, a strong turnaround from the loss of over $40 million the prior year, according to a Globes report. The rise in profitability could bode well as the market has less tolerance for unprofitable companies. Were eToro be traded today at the same multiple, it would have a market cap of nearly $6 billion on the basis of last year’s EBITDA. Tel Aviv-based eToro offers stock-market trading similar to that of Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ), and also competes with Coinbase ( COIN ) as a consumer crypto-trading platform. The firm has also had a few regulatory issues, and in September, it agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle charges with the SEC. The charges said that the company operated an unregistered broker and unregistered clearing agency in connection with its trading platform that facilitated buying and selling certain crypto assets as securities. The firm had agreed to cease trading activity in almost all crypto assets, and the only assets that U.S. customers can trade on the company’s platform will be Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether. The potential listing plans come at a time when Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been scaling the $100K mark boosted by crypto-friendly Donald Trump's win in the presidential elections.

Instead, its new CEO wants to shift the custodian’s focus towards securing operating licenses in the US and other countries. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto custodian firm Cooper Technologies withdrew its registration from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority on Dec. 20. The firm stated it will shift its focus towards expanding their overseas operations under its newly appointed CEO, Amar Kuchinad. Kuchinad took up the mantle of CEO in October after Cooper’s former CEO, Dmitry Tokarev, stepped down. After being appointed, he told Bloomberg that the company plans to enter the U.S markets if Trump ends up winning the Presidential race in November. Now that he has ushered in a more pro-crypto administration, Kuchinad said that the company will apply for regulatory custodial or money-transmitter licenses in the U.S. “Refining Copper’s global growth strategy has been my priority since joining, and this has necessitated key decisions on our direction and approach,” said Kuchinad, who is mostly based in New York. Cooper not only has its sights set on America, the crypto firm is also planning to apply for licenses and regulated approval in crypto-friendly regions like Hong Kong , Switzerland and Abu Dhabi .

Meanwhile, Messari founder Ryan Selkis harshly criticized XRP as the token’s price plummeted by 10%, marking its largest single-day loss since December 9 . Ryan Selkis Slams XRP Again Messari founder Ryan Selkis didn’t hold back, taking to X to joke about the current state of XRP. He humorously suggested that now might be the right time to buy, as the asset’s value had dipped below the combined worth of major companies like Coinbase, MicroStrategy , and Softbank. Now that XRP has fallen below the value of Coinbase, Microstrategy, and Softbank (combined), it's looking like a good buy again. — Ryan Selkis (d/acc) (@twobitidiot) December 19, 2024 His remark followed a previous criticism where he dismissed the XRP community as “worthless bot groups,” intensifying his ongoing criticism of the asset. The recent criticism seems to be a response to the backlash the former crypto executive received after attacking Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer , Stuart Alderoty, and the XRP community on the same day. Fed Announcement Led Correction XRP, like many cryptocurrencies, has not been immune to the market’s losses. Over the past two days, it saw a drop of 21%, moving from highs of $2.59 to lows of $2.05. This slide coincided with the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would scale back its expected rate cuts for 2025, which had been a contributing factor to the previous optimism in risk markets, including crypto. XRP Price Analysis As of now, XRP is trading around $2.16, reflecting a drop of 10% in the last 24 hours. Despite this decline, the price seems to have found strong support just below its current level, giving some hope to traders. Amid the drop, some analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s potential recovery. One of them, DarkDefender , noted a clear breakout on the daily chart.

This milestone underscores the cryptocurrency’s growing adoption and market maturity, with analysts predicting even higher prices in the coming years. Record Profits for Long-Term Holders According to data from Glassnode, long-term Bitcoin holders have reduced their supply from $14.23 billion to $13.31 billion as prices broke through the $100K mark. This represents a historic moment for these investors, many of whom have held Bitcoin since it traded at a fraction of today’s value. While some may interpret this as a signal of caution, the market has shown resilience. Short-term holders (STHs) have absorbed the selling pressure, sustaining the momentum as new investors flock to Bitcoin. Short-Term Holders Step In The role of short-term holders has been critical in maintaining Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Unlike long-term holders, who typically sell during price peaks, short-term investors often step in to capitalize on the market excitement. This dynamic ensures liquidity and allows Bitcoin’s price to stabilize, even as early adopters take profits. The continued inflow of new capital from retail and institutional investors further reinforces the bullish sentiment. Analyst Predictions: $145K and Beyond Bitcoin’s rally shows no signs of slowing. Analysts at Bitfinex predict that Bitcoin could reach $145,000 by mid-2025, with prices climbing as high as $200,000 under favorable market conditions. The bullish outlook is driven by several factors: Increasing Institutional Interest: Institutions continue to integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Global Economic Uncertainty: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies in times of economic instability. Halving Impact: With the next Bitcoin halving slated for 2024, reduced supply could further drive up prices, replicating patterns observed in previous cycles. Speculation Over a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Adding to the optimism, speculation has emerged over the possibility of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve under the Trump administration. Though unconfirmed, the mere prospect has heightened interest in Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve aligns with the broader trend of governments exploring cryptocurrency adoption. Such a move could signal a shift in how nations perceive digital assets, potentially boosting Bitcoin’s long-term value. Market Metrics Support Continued Growth Bitcoin’s current rally is backed by strong market metrics: Active Addresses: The number of active Bitcoin addresses continues to grow, indicating increased network activity and adoption. Exchange Flows: A net outflow from exchanges suggests investors are moving Bitcoin into cold storage, signaling confidence in long-term value. Hash Rate: The Bitcoin network’s hash rate remains near all-time highs, demonstrating robust security and miner confidence. Impact on the Broader Crypto Market Bitcoin’s rise has positively influenced the broader cryptocurrency market. Altcoins, particularly Ethereum and other layer-1 platforms, have seen significant price increases as investors diversify their portfolios. Additionally, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are experiencing renewed interest, with many leveraging Bitcoin’s momentum to attract users. FAQs About Bitcoin’s $100K Milestone Why are long-term holders selling Bitcoin now? Long-term holders often sell during price peaks to realize profits. Bitcoin’s surge past $100K presented a historic opportunity for early investors. Will Bitcoin’s price continue to rise? Analysts predict Bitcoin could reach $145K by mid-2025, with the potential to hit $200K under optimal market conditions. What is the role of short-term holders in this rally? Short-term holders have absorbed selling pressure from long-term holders, sustaining the price momentum and ensuring liquidity. Is there truth to the U.S. Bitcoin reserve speculation? While unconfirmed, speculation about a U.S. Bitcoin reserve has fueled market optimism and underscores Bitcoin’s growing importance as a strategic asset. How does Bitcoin’s performance affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin’s success often drives interest in the broader crypto market, benefiting altcoins, DeFi projects, and NFTs. Conclusion Bitcoin’s climb past $100,000 marks a historic moment for the cryptocurrency market. As long-term holders realize record profits, short-term holders and new investors have stepped in to sustain the momentum. With strong market metrics, institutional adoption, and bullish analyst predictions, Bitcoin appears poised for further growth.

Surveys (15%) : Collects user sentiment through periodic polls. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Reflects Bitcoin’s market share relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%) : Evaluates search trends for cryptocurrency-related terms. What Does the Index Indicate? As of December 20, 2024, the index’s reading of 74 suggests that investors are optimistic but veering toward overconfidence. Staying in the “Greed” zone often indicates bullish market conditions, where traders are actively buying assets with the expectation of further gains. However, excessive greed can also signal overvaluation and increased vulnerability to market corrections. Factors Behind the Latest Reading The current reading of 74 reflects a mix of market factors: Volatility Decline : A relatively stable Bitcoin price above $100,000 has reduced volatility, contributing positively to sentiment. High Trading Volume : Increased activity across major exchanges demonstrates strong market participation. Positive Social Media Buzz : Social platforms continue to see high engagement, with hashtags like #Bitcoin and #Crypto dominating discussions. Bitcoin Dominance : Bitcoin’s dominance remains robust at around 50%, bolstering confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. Crypto Market Sentiment Analysis Despite the slight dip in the index, sentiment remains strong. Here’s what it means for traders and investors: For Bulls : A “Greed” reading suggests an opportunity to capitalize on positive momentum, though caution is advised as the market could be overbought. For Bears : The high greed level indicates that a correction might be on the horizon, making it an opportune time to secure profits. Historical Context of the Fear & Greed Index Historically, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has shown a strong correlation with market performance. Extreme Fear (0-20) : Often marks the bottom of the market, presenting buying opportunities. Neutral (40-60) : Reflects balanced sentiment, with no strong directional bias. Greed (70-89) : Indicates optimism but warns of potential overextension. Extreme Greed (90-100) : Typically precedes sharp corrections. With a reading of 74, the current sentiment aligns with historical patterns of steady upward trends, tempered by the possibility of short-term pullbacks. Implications for Bitcoin and Altcoins Bitcoin (BTC): Price Stability: Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 has provided a psychological boost to investors. Dominance: High Bitcoin dominance reinforces its role as the market’s anchor asset. Altcoins: Opportunities: The “Greed” zone encourages speculative investments in altcoins, especially those linked to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Risks: Altcoins are more susceptible to volatility, particularly during market corrections. Tips for Navigating the “Greed” Zone Investors should adopt a balanced strategy to navigate the current market sentiment effectively: Take Profits: Consider securing gains on overperforming assets to mitigate downside risks. Diversify: Spread investments across different asset classes to reduce exposure to sudden corrections. Monitor Sentiment: Regularly track the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and other market indicators. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on macroeconomic trends and regulatory developments that may impact the market. FAQs What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index measures market sentiment by analyzing factors like volatility, trading volume, social media buzz, and Bitcoin dominance. Why is the index important? It helps investors gauge market sentiment, enabling informed decision-making during periods of extreme fear or greed. What does a reading of 74 indicate?

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily, providing real-time insights into market sentiment. What should I do in the “Greed” zone?

This reading suggests the market remains in Altcoin Season , albeit with reduced momentum compared to previous weeks. The index, which measures the performance of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over the past 90 days, provides valuable insights for traders and investors seeking to understand market trends. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a widely-used metric that evaluates whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. The index is calculated using the following criteria: Altcoin Season: At least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer altcoins outperform Bitcoin in the same period. The index ranges from 1 to 100 , with daily updates reflecting shifts in market sentiment. The current reading of 45 places the market in a transitional phase, where Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong but some altcoins continue to capture attention. Interpreting the Current Index Score of 45 A score of 45 indicates a mixed market environment: Bitcoin’s Stronghold: Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its dominance, particularly after surpassing the $100,000 mark. This milestone has redirected capital and attention toward the leading cryptocurrency. Altcoin Opportunities: Despite Bitcoin’s strength, a number of altcoins have shown resilience and potential, particularly those in the DeFi , NFT , and Layer-2 scaling sectors. The market’s current state reflects a tug-of-war between Bitcoin enthusiasts and altcoin advocates, with neither side gaining full control. Factors Driving the Altcoin Season Index 1. Bitcoin’s Recent Rally Bitcoin’s recent surge past $100,000 has solidified its position as the market leader, drawing investment from retail and institutional players alike. This has led to a relative underperformance of many altcoins, pulling the index score lower. 2. Selective Altcoin Performance Certain altcoins, particularly those tied to innovative technologies or real-world use cases, have managed to outperform Bitcoin. Examples include: Ethereum (ETH): Continues to benefit from strong activity in decentralized finance (DeFi). Solana (SOL): Gains traction due to its high-speed blockchain and ecosystem growth. Polygon (MATIC): Strengthens its position with Layer-2 scaling solutions. 3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flow The crypto market’s sentiment often oscillates between Bitcoin and altcoins. As Bitcoin achieves significant milestones, like reaching new all-time highs, market participants tend to reallocate capital to the leading cryptocurrency, slowing altcoin growth. Historical Trends and Insights The Altcoin Season Index has historically provided early warnings of market transitions: When the index exceeds 75: Altcoin Season is in full swing, often coinciding with Bitcoin price stagnation. When the index drops below 25: Bitcoin Season dominates, usually following major Bitcoin rallies. In 2021, the index hit a peak of 95 , signaling an explosive Altcoin Season driven by DeFi and NFT booms. Conversely, it dropped to 10 during Bitcoin’s strong rally in early 2023. What Does This Mean for Traders? For Bitcoin Traders: The current environment favors Bitcoin, with capital inflows supporting its price. Traders might consider holding or adding to Bitcoin positions, particularly as it consolidates above $100,000. For Altcoin Traders: While the market isn’t in full Altcoin Season, select altcoins continue to perform well. Traders should focus on fundamentally strong projects with active development and adoption. For Long-Term Investors: A balanced portfolio with exposure to both Bitcoin and top-performing altcoins can help mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities during market shifts. FAQs What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures the performance of the top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score above 75 indicates Altcoin Season, while a score below 25 indicates Bitcoin Season. Why did the index drop to 45? The index fell due to Bitcoin’s strong price rally, which has outperformed many altcoins. However, some altcoins continue to show resilience, keeping the index in a transitional phase. Is this a good time to invest in altcoins? Yes, but with caution. Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals and active ecosystems, as they are more likely to outperform in the current environment. What factors influence the index? The index considers the price performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. Market trends, sentiment, and capital flows also play a significant role. How often is the index updated? The Altcoin Season Index is updated daily, providing real-time insights into market sentiment and performance. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s dip to 45 highlights the ongoing battle for dominance between Bitcoin and altcoins. While Bitcoin continues to attract the lion’s share of market attention, select altcoins are proving their worth in a competitive landscape. For traders and investors, the key lies in staying informed and identifying opportunities in both Bitcoin and promising altcoins.

This marks a significant shift in the market dynamics, as it also ends a remarkable streak of 15 consecutive trading days of net inflows into these investment products. What Happened on December 19? The data, shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X, revealed that Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a substantial withdrawal, breaking the previous momentum of steady inflows. On the day in question, a massive $671.8 million was pulled from various U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , making it the largest net outflow since these ETFs launched. This shift in sentiment has raised questions about the factors that could have driven such a dramatic outflow. It is also important to consider the ETFs that were most affected and those that saw no significant change. Largest Net Outflows Among Key Bitcoin ETFs The largest net outflow was recorded by Fidelity’s FBTC ETF , which experienced a staggering $208.55 million withdrawal on the same day. Close behind was Grayscale’s mini BTC ETF , with a $188.6 million outflow, followed by ARK Invest’s ARKB ETF with $108.35 million . Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC saw an outflow of $87.86 million , rounding out the top five Bitcoin ETFs with significant withdrawals. Interestingly, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF reported no significant net inflows or outflows , signaling that the market’s volatility might not have impacted every product in the same way. Factors Behind the Outflow Several factors could have contributed to the sharp drop in Bitcoin ETF inflows on December 19, 2024: 1. Bitcoin Price Volatility The price of Bitcoin has seen some fluctuations recently, which may have influenced investor sentiment. With significant price corrections, traders may have opted to withdraw their investments from Bitcoin ETFs , seeking more stable options or rebalancing their portfolios. 2. Macro-Economic Concerns Global economic conditions, including potential shifts in inflation rates, central bank policies, and traditional market uncertainties, could have prompted a reevaluation of Bitcoin’s position as a hedge against economic instability. 3. Profit-Taking After a Bull Run After Bitcoin reached significant price milestones, such as breaking the $100,000 mark , some investors may have decided to lock in profits. This is common in markets experiencing high volatility or following substantial price surges. 4. Regulatory Concerns While U.S. regulatory clarity on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments has improved, some investors may still be cautious about potential future restrictions or regulatory changes that could affect the viability of Bitcoin ETFs in the long term. Impact of the Outflow on the Bitcoin Market The outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs can have multiple ramifications: Short-Term Price Impact Large withdrawals can temporarily increase market sell pressure , potentially affecting Bitcoin’s price action . However, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, and institutional investors continue to play a significant role in its ecosystem. Market Sentiment The outflow could reflect short-term market anxiety or a shift in investor sentiment. As more investors weigh their options in light of broader economic conditions, the Bitcoin market may see more price fluctuations in the near future. Increased Institutional Interest Despite this short-term setback, the growing interest from institutional players like Fidelity , Grayscale , and ARK Invest remains a key factor in Bitcoin’s long-term adoption. Their involvement continues to bring legitimacy to the space, and their products are likely to remain a core component of institutional Bitcoin exposure. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs? The Bitcoin ETF market is evolving rapidly, and despite recent volatility, institutional interest is expected to remain strong. The U.S. SEC’s approval of new Bitcoin ETFs continues to pave the way for more institutional involvement in the digital currency space. However, market participants will closely monitor the situation to understand if the recent outflow trend is a temporary blip or indicative of a broader market shift. Traders and investors may also look for signals of renewed institutional confidence to gauge whether further withdrawals are likely. FAQs on Bitcoin ETFs 1. What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. They are popular among institutional investors and provide a regulated investment vehicle for digital asset exposure. 2. Why did Bitcoin ETFs experience such a large outflow? Factors such as Bitcoin price volatility, macro-economic concerns, profit-taking after a bull run, and possible regulatory uncertainty may have contributed to the large outflow from Bitcoin ETFs. 3. What is the potential impact of these outflows on Bitcoin’s price? The outflows could cause temporary sell pressure, which might affect the price in the short term. However, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals and growing institutional interest are expected to support its market position. 4. Will Bitcoin ETFs continue to be popular with institutional investors? Despite recent withdrawals, institutional interest in Bitcoin is likely to remain strong. With growing adoption and regulatory clarity, Bitcoin ETFs will likely remain an important investment vehicle for institutions. Conclusion The $671.8 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 19, 2024, highlights the dynamic and sometimes volatile nature of the crypto market. While short-term withdrawals may cause fluctuations, the Bitcoin market remains supported by long-term fundamentals and the continued involvement of institutional investors . As the market continues to mature and evolve, Bitcoin ETFs are likely to play a significant role in bridging traditional finance and the world of digital assets. Whether these recent outflows are a temporary phenomenon or the start of a more prolonged trend will depend on broader market dynamics and investor sentiment in the coming months.

Factors such as Bitcoin’s recent price rally and stable network hashrate are driving the extended profitability for miners, solidifying their position amidst an increasingly competitive market. With key players like MARA Holdings and CleanSpark leading the way in mined BTC, the report highlights the positive impact of improved uptime and seasonal weather conditions on miner performance. Bitcoin’s Price Rally Fuels Miner Profits Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged by 31% in November , pushing its price above significant resistance levels and creating a favorable environment for miners. The rally not only increased revenues from mining rewards but also brought additional investor confidence into the market, further strengthening the profitability of mining operations. Jefferies noted that Bitcoin’s price surge, combined with a modest 4% rise in the network hashrate , has ensured that miners can capitalize on the current market dynamics. Unlike periods of steep hashrate increases, where profitability is squeezed by rising operational costs, the stable hashrate allows miners to maximize their earnings. Leading Bitcoin Mining Companies in December The report highlighted key mining firms and their performance in December: MARA Holdings : Leading the pack, MARA mined 907 BTC during the month, benefiting from improved operational efficiency and strategic expansion. CleanSpark : Close behind, CleanSpark mined 622 BTC , leveraging advancements in energy efficiency and optimized mining operations. Both companies have managed to maintain profitability while navigating challenges such as energy costs and regulatory scrutiny. Seasonal and Operational Advantages Jefferies attributed part of the miners’ success to external factors like colder weather , which naturally enhances cooling efficiency for mining rigs. This reduces operational costs, allowing miners to focus on maximizing uptime and production capacity. Additionally, miners have implemented measures to improve uptime, ensuring that mining rigs operate at peak efficiency even during network congestion or power fluctuations. Bitcoin Mining Profitability Metrics The profitability of Bitcoin mining is typically influenced by several key factors: Bitcoin Price : Higher prices translate to greater revenue for miners, making the current market rally a critical factor for profitability. Hashrate Stability : A modest increase of 4% in network hashrate has allowed miners to maintain their share of mining rewards without significant additional investment in hardware. Energy Costs : The seasonal drop in temperatures has reduced cooling expenses, further enhancing net profitability. Sustainability and Challenges for Bitcoin Miners While the current conditions are favorable, Jefferies cautioned that sustainability remains a key challenge for miners. Rising global scrutiny over energy usage and environmental impact continues to push miners toward renewable energy sources and more efficient operations. Top Challenges Faced by Bitcoin Miners Regulatory Uncertainty : Governments are increasingly implementing policies to regulate energy consumption and mining activities. Energy Costs : Although seasonal benefits are present, fluctuations in energy prices can still impact long-term profitability. Market Volatility : A sudden downturn in Bitcoin prices could quickly reverse the gains miners are enjoying. Outlook for Bitcoin Mining in 2025 Jefferies remains optimistic about the long-term potential of Bitcoin mining , citing advancements in mining hardware and the integration of sustainable energy solutions. However, the report emphasizes the need for miners to stay agile, adapt to market changes, and invest in infrastructure that ensures efficiency and sustainability. Conclusion With Bitcoin’s price rally and favorable operational conditions, miners are set to enjoy a profitable December. Leaders like MARA Holdings and CleanSpark have demonstrated resilience and adaptability, positioning themselves well in a competitive landscape. As the crypto market evolves, Bitcoin mining profitability will likely hinge on innovation, sustainability, and the ability to navigate regulatory challenges.

37883613,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99183,1734702566,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Inside Hoskinson’s Plan to Unlock $20 Trillion in Crypto Assets with Cardano’s Midnight Protocol,https://zycrypto.com/inside-hoskinsons-plan-to-unlock-20-trillion-in-crypto-assets-with-cardanos-midnight-protocol/,"Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, is setting his sights on helping unlock a staggering $20 trillion in crypto assets through the launch of the Midnight protocol. In a recent interview on the Blockster podcast, Hoskinson shared his ambitious vision for the Cardano ecosystem, highlighting how the privacy-focused protocol could tap into a massive pool of value that has been sidelined due to restrictive regulatory barriers. Notably, Midnight is designed to provide privacy as a service through the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which allow transactions to occur without revealing sensitive data. The protocol addresses the growing demand for privacy in blockchain networks, where concerns over privacy and regulatory compliance are becoming increasingly prominent. “Privacy is the biggest pie ever seen in the history of any business endeavor,” Hoskinson stated, emphasizing the vast, untapped potential of assets that require privacy protections. Another major aspect of the Midnight protocol’s innovation is its ability to facilitate interoperability across multiple blockchains. According to the crypto mogul, the protocol will create a “meta-chain,” enabling various cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Ethereum, XRP , and Solana, to coexist and transact seamlessly. He further noted that this multi-resource consensus is crucial for fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-oriented ecosystem. “It looks like it’s a layer two to everybody,” he explained, noting that Midnight’s privacy layer will appear as an extension of any major blockchain while maintaining full cross-chain compatibility. Hoskinson also discussed the importance of the tokenomics model behind Midnight. The protocol will utilize a dual-token structure, balancing deflationary assets for governance with inflationary tokens for gas fees. This approach aims to create stability and predictability in transaction costs, a crucial factor for businesses and users alike. That said, by focusing on privacy, interoperability, and a sustainable economic model, Cardano’s Midnight protocol could attract major institutional players. Hoskinson believes this will increase the Cardano ecosystem’s value and catalyze broader adoption of blockchain technology, ultimately unlocking trillions in previously inaccessible assets. “We don’t have real world assets in crypto yet because the private side is too precious and too regulated to be able to bring into the cryptocurrency industry.” He added. “[However], once you have privacy you can now bring it in and that’s 20 trillion dollars of assets. That is the biggest ever seen in the history of any business.” Looking ahead, Hoskinson emphasized that in 2025 , the focus will shift to enhancing interoperability and solidifying Midnight’s privacy features as a cornerstone of the crypto world. He also highlighted the importance of fostering collaboration among blockchain projects, stating, “We’re entering an era where common enemies are becoming friends.”",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-20 13:49:26

The next major support is around $91,000 to $92,000. The Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates by 0.25% (25 basis points), which was expected and already priced in by the market. Initially, there wasn’t much reaction when the news was released, but about half an hour later, Jerome Powell’s press conference had a bigger effect on the market. Bitcoin and the stock market both saw declines in the past day. The main reason for this drop was related to interest rate expectations for next year. While many were hoping for further rate cuts, the market now only expects one more 25-basis point cut in 2025, which caused a bearish reaction. Additionally, Powell said that the Federal Reserve is not allowed to buy or hold Bitcoin, which spooked the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Markets Plunging Down as Bitcoin (BTC) Price Drops Below $94,000; Has the $90,000 Targets Activated? , Bitcoin Price Analysis: What’s Next? Bitcoin is currently in a downward trend, with the price moving towards a key support area. According to analysts, his decline was expected, and the next major support zone is between $69,400 and $82,500. Recent price action has shown signs of a correction , and the market could potentially be nearing the bottom of this phase. While Bitcoin has been in a general uptrend, there have been hints that a correction was due. The price action has been weaker recently, with overlapping moves suggesting exhaustion. Additionally, the $100,000 level has proven to be a tough resistance for Bitcoin. The market continues to show downward movement, with the possibility of further declines before any recovery. Despite the current downtrend, there’s a chance that a bounce could occur once the price reaches key support levels. However, we need to see a break above resistance before confirming that a reversal is underway. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37883676,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112256,1734702685,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,VIX Soars 74% as Fed Rate Cut Sends Bitcoin Below $100K,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/vix-spikes-74-fed-rate-cut-btc-drop/,"VIX Spikes 74% as Fed Rate Cut Triggers Bitcoin Drop Below $100K On December 18, 2024, financial markets witnessed dramatic turbulence as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index ( VIX ) skyrocketed 74% , marking its largest single-day jump since 2018. This surge came on the heels of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and hawkish commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The rate cut triggered significant reactions across markets, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below the psychological $100,000 mark, U.S. equities dropping 3%, and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) hitting a two-year high. The volatility leaves investors wondering whether a market rebound is imminent, as history suggests. Fed’s Rate Cut and Hawkish Commentary The Federal Reserve’s decision to lower interest rates by 25 basis points was widely anticipated, but Chair Powell’s hawkish tone during the post-announcement press conference surprised markets. Key Points from Powell’s Commentary: Tightening Signals: Powell emphasized that the rate cut does not mark the beginning of a prolonged easing cycle. Inflation Concerns: The Fed remains focused on combating persistent inflation, indicating further tightening if necessary. Market Uncertainty: Powell’s statements introduced ambiguity about future monetary policy, unsettling markets. VIX Soars Amid Market Jitters The VIX, often referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” measures market expectations for volatility. The 74% spike on Dec. 18 underscores the heightened uncertainty across global markets. Why the VIX Spike Matters: Investor Sentiment: A sharp rise in the VIX often reflects increased risk aversion among investors. Market Correlation: Historically, large VIX spikes have been associated with local market bottoms for both Bitcoin and traditional equities. Rebound Potential: Analysts note that rebounds typically occur after such significant volatility, offering a glimmer of hope for investors. Bitcoin Falls Below $100K Bitcoin’s price declined sharply, dipping below the $100,000 threshold amid the market turmoil. This marks a significant retracement from its recent highs and has left investors speculating about the cryptocurrency’s next move. Historical Context: Bitcoin has previously exhibited resilience following sharp market corrections. According to data from CoinDesk , similar VIX spikes in the past have coincided with BTC finding local bottoms. Analyst Predictions: Rebound Likely: Some analysts predict a near-term rebound, citing Bitcoin’s oversold conditions. Long-Term Support: Others remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, with forecasts suggesting a potential climb to $145,000 by mid-2025 . Impact on U.S. Equities and Dollar Index U.S. equities were not spared, with major indices suffering a 3% drop on Dec. 18. Meanwhile, the Dollar Index (DXY) surged to a two-year high, signaling heightened demand for the greenback as a safe haven. Key Takeaways: Equities Under Pressure: The sharp decline reflects investor concerns about economic growth and monetary policy uncertainty. Dollar Strength: The rising DXY highlights the dollar’s dominance during periods of market stress. What’s Next for Markets? While the immediate market reaction has been negative, historical trends suggest a potential rebound. Both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 have previously recovered strongly following sharp increases in the VIX. Factors to Watch: Fed Policy Updates: Any clarification on the Fed’s monetary policy will likely influence market direction. Bitcoin’s Resilience: BTC’s ability to hold key support levels will be critical for its short-term outlook. Global Economic Indicators: Developments in inflation and growth metrics will shape investor sentiment. Conclusion The 74% spike in the VIX, combined with Bitcoin’s drop below $100,000 and a sharp decline in U.S. equities, underscores the fragility of global markets in the face of monetary policy uncertainty.

Meanwhile, Coinbase Advanced experienced impressive growth in 2024, with trading volumes surging by 191% due to rising derivatives interest, but still faced criticism for delisting Wrapped Bitcoin over its alleged ties to Justin Sun. Binance.US is also making strides, and announced plans to restore USD services in 2025. Cryptopia’s Long-Awaited User Reimbursements Underway The liquidators of the now-defunct crypto exchange Cryptopia started the distribution of funds to users who were affected by a major hack that happened nearly six years ago. On Dec. 20, Grant Thornton , the firm overseeing Cryptopia’s liquidation, announced that over 10,000 verified account holders started receiving payouts. These distributions consist of Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE), totaling approximately 400 million New Zealand dollars ($225 million). This is a major step forward in the liquidation process, which began in 2020 with the establishment of the Cryptopia claims portal . While this initial payout is very large, Grant Thornton stated that even more distributions are planned. The firm will follow an approved process, including setting cut-off dates, before distributing the remaining funds to account holders. There is also the possibility of additional ”top-up” distributions, which could allow users to receive up to 100% of their holdings by reallocating unclaimed funds from those who have not registered on the claims portal. Grant Thornton urged any of the remaining Cryptopia account holders to complete the registration process to qualify for future distributions. The liquidators also confirmed that additional distributions for some of the newly verified users are expected to take place in the coming year. Cryptopia was founded in 2014, and was once a major international cryptocurrency exchange based in New Zealand. It boasted 1.4 million registered users at its peak in 2018. It was also a pioneer in the country’s crypto ecosystem after launching the NZD-backed stablecoin NZDT in 2017. However, the exchange suffered a catastrophic hack in January of 2019, which resulted in the loss of an estimated $16 million in crypto assets. Shortly after, Cryptopia entered liquidation, and Grant Thornton reported that the exchange owed $4.2 million to its creditors. Coinbase Advanced Trading Volumes Soar in 2024 Things are going a lot better for some other crypto exchanges. Coinbase Advanced, the professional trading platform offered by Coinbase, experienced remarkable growth in 2024. The platform recorded a 191% increase in trading volumes and a 77% rise in user numbers. The growth was likely fueled by surging interest in derivatives trading. In fact, derivatives volumes saw an unprecedented 10,950% increase this year. Coinbase’s derivatives platform was launched in 2022, and has become a big driver of growth by offering cryptocurrency futures like nano Bitcoin and nano Ethereum contracts to its U.S. users. The platform also lists futures tied to meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB), alongside commodities like oil and gold. The broader crypto derivatives market also saw exponential growth, with monthly trading volumes surpassing $3 trillion in September, according to CCData. These futures contracts allow traders to hedge and speculate with leverage, which helped boost their popularity. In addition to derivatives, spot trading activity on Coinbase Advanced grew by 47% in 2024, buoyed by optimistic market sentiment after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory and the addition of new tokens. Coinbase plans to offer more tokens under the new administration, including smaller tokens and meme coins, according to Tom Duff Gordon. Some of its most recent listings include meme coins like Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF). Coinbase stock price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) Coinbase’s growth also reflected in its stock performance , which surged past $300 in November for the first time since 2021. However, the stock has since pulled back to around $280 based on data from Google Finance. Crypto Community Criticizes Coinbase Along with its success, Coinbase also recently faced some backlash. The crypto community strongly criticised Coinbase after its explanation for delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), and blaming it on the risks associated with Tron founder Justin Sun. Coinbase filed its response to a lawsuit from BiT Global, which is a Sun-affiliated entity, and accused the exchange of harming the wBTC market by removing the token in November. In its filing, Coinbase attributed its decision to allegations of financial misconduct and ongoing regulatory investigations involving Sun. The crypto community argued that Coinbase’s reasoning lacks legal and technical justification, and some even accused the exchange of engaging in “guilt by association.” Bitcoin advocate and Coinbase skeptic Pledditor believes the filing reflects personal animosity toward Sun, and does not address the actual merits of the case. Coinbase pointed to Sun’s alleged violations of industry and government standards, including accusations of fraud and securities law violations. These claims stem from charges that were filed against Sun by the U.S. SEC in March of 2023 and additional investigations by federal authorities. The criticism of Coinbase’s actions also drew attention to its own legal challenges. VanEck adviser Gabor Gurbacs , pointed out the irony of Coinbase questioning Sun’s reputation while facing numerous investigations itself. In June of 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities. Earlier in the year, Coinbase also settled with the New York Department of Financial Services for $100 million over compliance issues. Binance.US Plans Major Revival Binance.US, the United States-based subsidiary of the global crypto exchange Binance, announced plans to resume U.S. dollar services in early 2025. This is a big step for the exchange as it plans to rebuild its presence in the U.S. market. Interim CEO Norman Reed shared the update in a blog post on Dec. 18. Reed stated that Binance.US is closer than ever to restoring USD services and believes 2025 will be a pivotal year for the exchange. He also mentioned plans for new product releases and strategic partnerships to enhance the platform’s infrastructure, including expanded custody offerings and improved wallet solutions. Reed is optimistic about the future, and invited users to participate in what he described as a comeback story for the ages. This announcement was made after comments from Binance CEO Richard Teng earlier in December, where he said it was too early to discuss whether Binance might fully re-establish operations in the United States. Despite past challenges, Binance.US is still focused on offering competitive features, including 0% fee trading for BTC/USDC and support for 160 cryptocurrencies alongside staking for over 20 cryptos. Binance.US initially launched in 2019 to provide regulated crypto trading services in the United States. However, the platform faced hurdles in 2023, beginning with a lawsuit from the SEC in June. The SEC accused Binance of failing to register Binance.US as an exchange, which led to the suspension of USD deposits. By October, Binance.US declared its transition to a crypto-only exchange after updating its terms of service. In November of 2023, Binance reached a $4.3 million settlement with the U.S. government over allegations of sanctions violations, money laundering, and operating as an unlicensed money transmitter. As part of the settlement, Binance committed to exiting the U.S. market entirely and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. Despite these setbacks, Binance.US is determined to make a strong return.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-20 13:52:09

Whether you’re playing to relax or to challenge your mental acuity, this game is perfect for players of all levels. With its intriguing gameplay and strategic moves, Spider Solitaire has become a favorite among card game enthusiasts worldwide. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Spider Solitaire, from its origins to expert strategies that can help you win consistently. What is Spider Solitaire? Spider Solitaire is a single-player card game that originated from the traditional Solitaire family. Unlike classic Solitaire, Spider Solitaire uses two decks of cards, making it more complex and challenging. The game involves creating sequences of cards in descending order, from King to Ace, within the same suit. Key Features of Spider Solitaire Two Decks of Cards: The game uses 104 cards, providing a more intricate gameplay experience. Ten Tableau Columns: Cards are arranged in ten columns, with the objective of clearing all cards. Customizable Difficulty: Spider Solitaire offers different levels of difficulty, with one, two, or four suits in play. Hints and Undo Options: Many modern versions of the game include hints and undo options for a smoother experience. How to Play Spider Solitaire Setup The game begins with 104 cards shuffled and dealt into 10 tableau columns. The first four columns contain six cards each, while the remaining six columns have five cards. Only the top card in each column is face-up, and the rest remain face-down. Objective The goal of Spider Solitaire is to create sequences of cards in descending order (King to Ace) within the same suit. Once a sequence is completed, it is removed from the tableau. The game ends when all cards are cleared. Gameplay Steps Move Cards: You can move a card or a sequence of cards to another column if the move adheres to the descending order. Reveal Hidden Cards: When the top card of a column is moved, the card underneath is revealed. Fill Empty Columns: Empty columns can be filled with any card or sequence, depending on the rules of the version you’re playing. Draw Cards: If no moves are possible, draw a new row of cards from the stockpile. Tips and Tricks for Winning Spider Solitaire 1. Start with the Easy Mode If you’re new to Spider Solitaire, begin with the one-suit mode. This will help you familiarize yourself with the rules and gameplay without overwhelming complexity. 2. Prioritize Empty Columns Empty columns are a strategic asset. Use them to temporarily store cards, enabling you to reorganize sequences effectively. 3. Build Long Sequences Early Focus on creating long sequences in the same suit early in the game. This strategy minimizes disruptions later. 4. Use the Undo Option Wisely If you’re stuck, the undo feature can help you analyze alternative moves and improve your strategy. 5. Plan Ahead Think a few moves ahead to anticipate potential obstacles and create opportunities for smoother gameplay. Advanced Strategies for Spider Solitaire 1. Manage the Stockpile Carefully Avoid drawing from the stockpile prematurely. Exhaust all possible moves within the tableau before adding new cards. 2. Focus on One Suit at a Time Clearing one suit completely can simplify the game significantly, as it reduces the number of cards on the tableau. 3. Break Down Complex Columns Columns with many hidden cards can be challenging. Work systematically to reveal these hidden cards. 4. Use Empty Columns Sparingly While empty columns are valuable, overusing them can restrict your moves. Use them strategically to maximize their utility. 5. Keep High-Value Cards Accessible Ensure that Kings and Queens are easily accessible for building sequences, as they are crucial for completing stacks. Benefits of Playing Spider Solitaire 1. Mental Stimulation Spider Solitaire enhances cognitive skills like problem-solving, logical thinking, and memory. 2. Stress Relief The game offers a calming experience, making it ideal for unwinding after a busy day. 3. Time Management Playing Spider Solitaire helps improve focus and time management, especially during timed challenges. 4. Accessibility Spider Solitaire is available on various platforms, including mobile devices, desktops, and online gaming portals, making it easily accessible anytime, anywhere. Popular Variations of Spider Solitaire 1. One-Suit Spider Solitaire Perfect for beginners, this variation uses only one suit, simplifying the gameplay. 2. Two-Suit Spider Solitaire This medium-difficulty version uses two suits and is ideal for intermediate players. 3. Four-Suit Spider Solitaire The most challenging variation, it uses all four suits, requiring advanced strategies and exceptional patience. Where to Play Spider Solitaire Online 1. Microsoft Solitaire Collection Available on Windows, this platform offers various versions of Spider Solitaire with daily challenges. 2. Solitaire Bliss A free online platform featuring multiple variations of Solitaire, including Spider Solitaire. 3. Arkadium Games A user-friendly website offering Spider Solitaire with customizable difficulty levels. 4. Mobile Apps Popular apps like Spider Solitaire by MobilityWare and Spider Solitaire Classic provide excellent gameplay experiences for mobile users. Spider Solitaire vs. Classic Solitaire Feature Spider Solitaire Classic Solitaire Number of Decks Two One Tableau Columns Ten Seven Objective Build sequences by suit Build foundations by suit Difficulty Levels Adjustable (1-4 suits) Fixed Spider Solitaire offers a more complex and strategic experience compared to Classic Solitaire, making it a favorite among advanced players. Common Challenges in Spider Solitaire 1. Limited Moves If the tableau becomes stagnant, it can be challenging to make progress. Focus on revealing hidden cards to create new opportunities. 2. Managing Multiple Suits In higher difficulty levels, balancing multiple suits can be overwhelming. Prioritize one suit at a time to simplify gameplay. 3. Dealing with Stockpile Cards Stockpile cards can complicate the tableau. Use them judiciously to avoid unnecessary clutter. Final Thoughts Spider Solitaire is more than just a card game—it’s a test of strategy, patience, and foresight. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced player, mastering the art of Spider Solitaire can provide hours of entertainment and mental stimulation. With the tips, tricks, and strategies outlined in this guide, you’re well on your way to becoming a Spider Solitaire pro.

This comes after a significant rally from September to a new all-time high of $263.83 in mid-November. However, SOL has now revisited the previous March high of $205, a level analysts see as critical support, hinting at a potential reversal. In a recent tweet , analyst MartyParty highlighted a recurring price pattern he refers to as a “ghost feed” candle formation, forecasting another parabolic move akin to the surge seen in early 2024. The chart shows that Solana (SOL) has stabilized in the $205-$210 range, signaling the potential for a strong upward rally. According to MartyParty’s analysis, this development, combined with a fractal pattern observed from January to mid-March 2024, points to a possible price target of $345. Analysts “Ridger R” analyzed Solana’s price correction, suggesting it has completed its downward wave. According to his analysis on TradingView, Solana’s price USD has found support in a demand zone, forming a bull flag pattern. The pundit noted that he anticipates a breakout from this formation, followed by a retest of the breakout level before Solana might be poised to attack new all-time highs. Although specific price targets from this analysis aren’t mentioned, similar formations typically suggest moves towards or beyond previous resistance levels , hinting at targets in the $400 to $600 range or higher. Beyond the technical indicators, several key fundamental factors fuel increasing optimism around Solana. According to data from the crypto analytics platform Token Terminal, Solana (SOL) captured 53% of global crypto users in November, outpacing all other blockchains combined. Solana’s growing adoption and expanding ecosystem have also bolstered its reputation as a top-tier blockchain platform. Data from DeFi Lama reveals that its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to $8.93 billion, nearing its pre-FTX levels of approximately $10 billion in 2022. This remarkable rebound demonstrates that, two years on, Solana is not only surviving but thriving. Moreover, Solana has surpassed Ethereum regarding developer growth for the first time in nearly a decade. The 2024 Developer Report from Electric Capital reveals that Solana attracted 19.5% of all new crypto developers in 2024, overtaking Ethereum for the first time since 2016. This marks a significant shift in the blockchain landscape, with Solana emerging as the leading choice for new developers this year. Known for its scalability, Solana can process over 50,000 transactions per second at low costs, making it a strong competitor to Ethereum in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 applications. With its expanding ecosystem, growing developer base, and solid fundamentals, Solana’s price could very well see significant growth, potentially reaching new milestones in the near future. At press time, SOL was trading at $187, reflecting a 9.84% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-20 13:54:19

By understanding these metrics, investors can better anticipate price movements and prepare for potential market peaks or even any upcoming retracements. Terminal Price The Terminal Price metric, which incorporates the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) while factoring in Bitcoin’s supply, has historically been a reliable indicator for predicting Bitcoin cycle peaks. Coin Days Destroyed measures the velocity of coins being transferred, considering both the holding duration and the quantity of Bitcoin moved. Figure 1: Bitcoin Terminal Price has surpassed $185,000. View Live Chart 🔍 Currently, the terminal price has surpassed $185,000 and is likely to rise toward $200,000 as the cycle progresses. With Bitcoin already breaking $100,000, this suggests we may still have several months of positive price action ahead. Puell Multiple The Puell Multiple evaluates daily miner revenue (in USD) relative to its 365-day moving average. After the halving event, miners experienced a sharp drop in revenue, creating a period of consolidation. Figure 2: Puell Multiple has climbed above 1.00. View Live Chart 🔍 Now, the Puell Multiple has climbed back above 1, signaling a return to profitability for miners. Historically, surpassing this threshold has indicated the later stages of a bull cycle, often marked by exponential price rallies. A similar pattern was observed during all previous bull runs. MVRV Z-Score The MVRV Z-Score measures the market value relative to the realized value (average cost basis of Bitcoin holders). Standardized into a Z-Score to account for the asset's volatility, it’s been highly accurate in identifying cycle peaks and bottoms. Figure 3: MVRV-Z Score still considerably below where previous peaks have occurred. View Live Chart 🔍 Currently, Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-Score remains below the overheated red zone with a value of around 3.00, signaling that there’s still room for growth. While diminishing peaks have been a trend in recent cycles, the Z-Score suggests that the market is far from reaching a euphoric top. Active Address Sentiment This metric tracks the 28-day percentage change in active network addresses alongside the price change over the same period. When price growth outpaces network activity, it suggests the market may be short-term overbought, as the positive price action may not be sustainable given network utilization. Figure 4: AASI indicated overheated conditions above $100,000. View Live Chart 🔍 Recent data shows a slight cooling after Bitcoin’s rapid climb from $50,000 to $100,000, indicating a healthy consolidation period. This pause is likely setting the stage for sustained long-term growth and does not indicate we should be medium to long-term bearish. Spent Output Profit Ratio The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) measures realized profits from Bitcoin transactions. Recent data shows an uptick in profit-taking, potentially indicating we are entering the latter stages of the cycle. Figure 5: Large SOPR clusters of profit taking. View Live Chart 🔍 One caveat to consider is the growing use of Bitcoin ETFs and derivative products. Investors may be shifting from self-custody to ETFs for ease of use and tax advantages, which could influence SOPR values. Value Days Destroyed Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple expands on CDD by weighting larger, long-term holders. When this metric enters the overheated red zone, it often signals major price peaks as the market's largest and most experienced participants begin cashing out. Figure 6: VDD is warm but not too hot. View Live Chart 🔍 While Bitcoin’s current VDD levels indicate a slightly overheated market, history suggests it could sustain this range for months before a peak. For example, in 2017, VDD indicated overbought conditions nearly a year before the cycle’s top. Conclusion Taken together, these metrics suggest that Bitcoin is entering the latter stages of its bull market. While some indicators point to short-term cooling or slight overextension, most highlight substantial remaining upside throughout 2025. Key resistance levels for this cycle may emerge between $150,000 and $200,000, with metrics like SOPR and VDD providing clearer signals as we approach the peak.

While some indicators point to short-term cooling or slight overextension, most highlight substantial remaining upside throughout 2025. Key resistance levels for this cycle may emerge between $150,000 and $200,000, with metrics like SOPR and VDD providing clearer signals as we approach the peak.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 13:55:00

Excluding food and energy, the core PCE index rose by 0.1% monthly and 2.8% annually. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal income rose 0.5%, DPI increased 0.3%, and PCE climbed 0.4%. Real disposable income and spending also had moderate gains, while the inflation indicators-the PCE price index, for instance-remained subdued at 0.1% month-over-month. US Core PCE Inflation Cools: Less Volatility for Crypto? Personal consumption expenditures in the United States rose 0.4% or $81.3 billion in November, the nation ‘s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported Friday. The PCE price index rose 0.1% month- over -month and 2.4% year- over -year. The figure increased 0.1% on a monthly basis and 2.8% on an annual one when excluding food and energy . Personal income increased 0.5 percent or $71.1 billion in the month compared to the prior month. Meanwhile, DPI increased 0.3 percent or $61.1 billion. The 0.4% rise in PCE shows that consumer spending is resilient, propped up by categories such as autos, goods, and recreation. The modest increase in the PCE price index points to low inflation, which could see the Federal Reserve maintain policy as is.

Imagine a pilot, mid-flight, deciding to wing it with no clear destination. That’s Jerome Powell and his crew at the Federal Reserve right now. They’ve spent the past year stomping on inflation with relentless rate hikes, only to suddenly flip the script with a quarter-point rate cut this week. Predictably, the market went into full meltdown mode, dragging Bitcoin down to $95,000. And we keep hearing the term “hawkish” everywhere, but what does it even mean? And why does Bitcoin hate it? Well see, it’s a kind of approach to dealing with inflation. A “hawkish” phase is when central banks focus on jacking up interest rates and tightening the money flow to keep prices in check. Basically, they’re more worried about controlling inflation than boosting economic growth. Bitcoin caught in the Fed’s liquidity trap To understand the disaster, let’s rewind. The Fed spent all of 2024 swinging its hawkish hammer. The plan? Jack up interest rates to choke inflation and force everyone to behave — businesses, borrowers, the dude buying overpriced avocado toast. And it worked, to a point. Inflation cooled, but nowhere near the Fed’s 2% goal. Still, the central bank didn’t flinch. Rates climbed, liquidity drained out of the market, and riskier assets like Bitcoin started to wobble. Then came the curveball. This week, the Fed decided to cut rates by a quarter-point, dropping them to 4.25% from 4.5%. If you’re thinking, “Wait, didn’t they just say inflation’s still too high?”—you’re not alone. Investors collectively lost their minds. Stocks tanked. Bitcoin plummeted. And the Fed, in its infinite wisdom, dubbed this a “hawkish cut.” But oh wait, they also said they’re probably not cutting rates next year, which makes you wonder; why cut it now, Mr. Powell? Economists warned you for months. It’s almost as if the Fed deliberately did the opposite of what it should’ve done. Bitcoin traders saw through it and dumped their holdings faster than the Fed could backpedal. The liquidity crunch is no joke, either. When central banks raise rates and tighten the money supply, capital dries up. That’s great if you want to control inflation but terrible if you’re holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin. With less money flowing into markets, Bitcoin’s usual safety net of investor optimism has vanished. The Fed’s mixed signals are tanking everything Here’s where things get even worse. The Fed’s actions don’t match its words. Powell insists the labor market is softening and inflation is under control—two reasons to ease up on rate hikes. But the data doesn’t back him up. Unemployment is still low. Inflation isn’t budging much. And the markets are reacting like someone yanked the rug out from under them. Take the Fed’s latest “dot plot,” a magical chart where officials predict future rate changes. It showed only two more rate cuts in 2025, down from the four cuts hinted at just a few months ago. Investors freaked out. Historically, hawkish policies have been a blunt but effective tool for fighting inflation. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chair in the 80s and 90s, famously used high rates to keep inflation in check. But Greenspan had a plan. Today’s Fed? Not so much. Their approach feels like throwing darts at a board. The bigger issue is that the Fed is stuck in its own economic models. These models assume monetary policy is the main driver of inflation. That might’ve been true once, but today’s economy is more complicated. Tax policies, regulation, and even global supply chains play a massive role. The Fed doesn’t seem to get that. They’re treating the economy like it’s 1990 and ignoring how much things have changed. And don’t forget about inflation expectations. Investors usually rely on the bond market to gauge where inflation is headed. But long-term bond yields have been rising since September, suggesting investors expect inflation to stick around. That’s bad news for Bitcoin, which thrives on low inflation and loose monetary policy.

Bitcoin ( BTC ), which started the week by surging to a record high of $108,250, has erased most of the gains made this month. It has dropped by 13% from the year-to-date high, entering a local correction. Here are four reasons Bitcoin prices are likely to bounce back and retest the all-time high. Bitcoin price corrections are not new The first main reason why the price of BTC will rebound is that the ongoing pullback, which we predicted , is not new. Bitcoin often retreats sharply after rising to a crucial resistance level. The long-term chart below shows that Bitcoin jumped to $19,778 in December 2017 and then reversed by 84%. It then dropped by 55% after hitting a high of $64,647 in April 2021. Most recently, Bitcoin peaked at $73,885 in March and then crashed by 33% through August. A strong rebound will likely follow this retreat because BTC still has strong fundamentals. Mining output has fallen since the last halving event, while the amount of Bitcoin in exchanges has continued to drop. Similarly, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $34 billion in assets, a trend that is expected to continue, especially from institutional investors. You might also like: 2 reasons why Bitcoin and other crypto just crashed Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin’s MVRV score is still low Another reason Bitcoin prices may rebound is that the popular market value to realized value score is still lower than during historical corrections. The MVRV-Z score is calculated by subtracting the realized market cap from the circulating market cap and then dividing it by the standard deviation. According to CoinGlass , Bitcoin’s MVRV score peaked at 2.89 earlier this week. Bitcoin had a score of 3.05 during the bear market in March this year. It also had a score of 3.21 in January 2022’s correction and 5.25 in March 2021. This suggests the coin has more upside potential once the panic selling subsides. Bitcoin MVRV score | Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin whale accumulation is going on large Bitcoin holders are still accumulating coins, and hopes of a strategic reserve are rising. MicroStrategy has added more BTC to its portfolio and now holds over 439,000 coins. Marathon Digital, the largest Bitcoin miner, holds over 44,300 coins, while Riot Platforms and Hut 8 Mining have also added thousands of coins. After observing MicroStrategy’s success, more companies are likely to purchase Bitcoins. Over the past four years, MicroStrategy has transformed from a fledgling technology company into an $80 billion firm. Additionally, discussions about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, especially by Donald Trump, have gained traction. In a recent note, Bitwise noted that more countries could follow suit as the U.S. public debt has surged to over $36.4 trillion.

The weekly chart shows that the coin formed a cup pattern between 2021 and March this year. It then formed a handle between March and October, followed by a strong comeback. Bitcoin has rallied in most weeks since then, and it is often normal for an asset in an uptrend to pause temporarily. Bitcoin’s target in this bull run is $122,000, which was determined by measuring the depth of the cup at 76%. Adding 76% to the cup’s upper side gives a target of $122,000.",Markets|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-20 13:56:52

This double-digit crash is the third liquidation event in December that wiped more than $1 billion worth of position. With such a steep decline and whales offloading their BTC holdings, is the bull run over? Let’s explore. What Drives Bitcoin’s Sudden Drop? The US Federal Reserve’s decision to have two rate cuts in 2025 as opposed to the expected four is the main driver of Bitcoin price’s recent collapse. On December 17, BTC’s value set up an ATH of $108,353, but closed the daily candlestick with a doji. A doji is a candlestick pattern with negligible or no body and long wick. Such technical formation often hints at trend exhaustion. Since ATH, Bitcoin has shed 14% and seems to be setting up a daily low of $92,232 as of Friday. The hawkish comments from Fed coupled with overleveraged traders caused $844 million worth of longs and $166 million worth of shorts faced liquidation on December 19. Crypto Market Liquidation Whales That Bought BTC Before Bull Run Sell According to the on-chain data provider Santiment, large transactions, ie., worth $100,000 or more, have risen. To be precise, large transfers worth $100K or more and $1million or more have spiked on November 22, December 5 and December 16. Bitcoin price saw steep double-digit corrections after these events, denoting that if whale transactions spike after a rallying it serves as a proxy of whales selling. BTC Large Transcations The Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) indicator further solidifies that there was indeed profit-taking. As the name indicates, a positive in this index denotes profit-taking and a downtick indicates capitulation. While the former serves as a sell signal, the latter indicates a buy signal. This indicator also shows similar spikes on November 22, December 5 and 16, hinting that whales were actually booking profits. BTC NPL With these metrics pointing to whales booking profits, speculators wonder, if the bull run is over. Let’s answer this question with Bitcoin price analysis. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is Bull Run over? Bitcoin’s daily chart shows that bullish market structure, containing higher highs and higher lows, has been broken. As long as BTC reclaims the ATH of $108,353 and sets up a decisive daily candlestick close above it, the outlook remains bearish. So, technically, the bull run is not over yet. BTC/USDT 1-day chart From a purely technical standpoint, even if Bitcoin price recovers from here with the intention to retain its bullish market structure, it will face two key hurdles. The first one is the $100,000 psychological level. A flip of this resistance into support level will put BTC in front of the daily imbalance, that extends from $102,747 to $105,363. Overcoming these two hurdles will allow Bitcoin to set up a higher high above $108,353. Even after this outlook is achieved, the bulls need to defend and prevent a production of a low lower than $92,118. In such a case, the Bitcoin price forecast hints that the bull run will continue and potentially propel BTC to new highs. BTC/USDT 1-day chart On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to overcome $100,000 or the aforementioned daily imbalance it would signal a lack of buying pressure. Under these conditions, if Bitcoin could dip below to $90,000 and revisit the $87,333 support level.

Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has dropped for five consecutive days, reaching its lowest level since Nov. 11. It has plummeted by almost 45% from its monthly high, entering a deep bear market. Dogecoin’s crash is linked to rising fear in the crypto industry, leading to panic selling among investors. Crypto remains highly volatile, as most participants are retail investors with short investment horizons. DOGE’s decline suggests the coin has entered the markdown phase of the Wyckoff Method, following weeks in the distribution phase. Wyckoff’s framework identifies four phases assets undergo: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. You might also like: Bull flag confirmed for Solana; This new altcoin follows suit In Dogecoin’s case, the accumulation phase occurred between April and November, marked by limited price movement. The markup phase followed, driven by higher demand than supply, causing a parabolic rise. The distribution phase saw prices stabilize as smart investors exited. Now, in markdown, supply exceeds demand, leading to panic selling. Dogecoin’s drop is also influenced by skepticism about Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy aim to slash government spending by over $2 trillion through measures like mass layoffs. However, analysts argue such changes are feasible in the private sector but face significant regulatory and political resistance in government. Dogecoin price analysis: How low can DOGE fall? DOGE price chart | Source: crypto.news DOGE price peaked at $0.4853, a key level near the extreme overshoot of the Murrey Math lines tool. It has since dropped below the strong pivot release and the 50-day moving average. The accumulation/distribution indicator points downward, signaling ongoing distribution. The next critical level to monitor is $0.2293, which was the highest swing in March. This level also aligns with the horizontal line of the cup and handle pattern. A drop below $0.2293 could increase the likelihood of DOGE falling to the major support/resistance pivot at $0.1953, approximately 30% below the current price. Investors should be cautious of a dead cat bounce when considering buying the dip. A DCB occurs when an asset in a downtrend briefly rises before resuming its downward trajectory.

This week was particularly eventful, though, as the asset first jumped above $2.7 before a market-wide crash took it south hard to just under $2. By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart On the USDT pair, XRP has been rallying almost vertically for a few weeks. Yet, with the RSI demonstrating a clear overbought signal at the beginning of November, the market has failed to continue its upward trajectory, and it is now consolidating as it cools down. Nevertheless, the $2 support level remains intact even though it was tested earlier today and could push the price higher toward the $3 level again. On the other hand, if the $2 level is broken down decisively, a deeper correction toward the $1.4 level would be expected. The BTC Paired Chart The Bitcoin-paired chart demonstrates a similar price action, as the market has been breaking through several resistance levels in a significant run higher. Yet, the 2,800 SAT resistance zone has rejected the price lower, as the 2,200 SAT support area is now being tested. Meanwhile, the RSI is showing values above 50%, indicating that the momentum is still bullish, and a bullish continuation is more likely than a reversal at the moment. This scenario would fail if the 2,200 sat support level is broken to the downside, which would pave the way for the market to drop much lower toward the 1,600 SAT zone.

While validators rally to increase the gas limit to improve transaction efficiency, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has emerged as a market leader, recording impressive inflows despite broader market volatility. Ethereum Validators Signal Increased Support for Raising Network Gas Limits The Ethereum network is witnessing a significant shift in sentiment among its validators as efforts to increase the network’s gas limit gain traction. As of Dec. 19, the percentage of Ethereum validators signaling support for raising the gas limit beyond 30 million has surged to 10%, marking a notable rise from just over 1% in previous months. This momentum reflects a growing community push to address high transaction fees and enhance the usability of the Ethereum blockchain. The recent uptick in validator support is largely attributed to coordinated advocacy efforts from Ethereum developers, researchers, and community members. The push to increase the gas limit to 36 million, or even higher, has been met with enthusiasm by many in the ecosystem who see the adjustment as a way to reduce transaction fees on Ethereum’s layer-1. Central to this campaign is the website “Pump The Gas,” launched by core Ethereum developer Eric Connor and former MakerDAO head of smart contracts Mariano Conti in March 2024. The platform urges the Ethereum community to rally around a gas limit increase to 40 million, arguing that such a change could reduce layer-1 transaction fees by 15% to 33%. Support for the initiative has grown among prominent Ethereum researchers and developers. On Dec. 9, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake reconfigured his validator to signal a 36 million gas limit, stating that a 20% increase “safely greases the wheels” for the network. Developers like Emmanuel Awosika of 2077 Collective have also highlighted the importance of raising gas limits to foster innovation. Awosika emphasized that applications with viral potential can cause gas prices to spike under the current limit, leading to a degraded user experience. For developers, this poses a significant barrier to creating scalable and widely used decentralized applications (dApps). Balancing Opportunities with Risks While the potential benefits of increasing the gas limit are evident, the community is not blind to the risks. Critics, including Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter, caution that raising the gas limit too quickly could jeopardize the network’s stability and decentralization. High gas limits increase the computational and storage demands on nodes, which could discourage solo operators from participating in the network. This could lead to centralization risks, as fewer nodes might control the network over time. The “Pump The Gas” initiative acknowledges these concerns, stating: “If the gas limit is raised too high, we could create a scenario where the chain becomes too large for solo node operators to validate and download. Technology improves, however, and it does make sense to slowly increase it as time goes on.” Additionally, raising the gas limit could lead to unforeseen externalities, including potential security vulnerabilities and congestion issues, which require careful analysis before implementation. The debate over Ethereum’s gas limit brings attention to the complex interplay between scalability, decentralization, and security. While the push to raise gas limits has garnered significant community support, achieving consensus will require addressing the concerns of validators, researchers, and developers alike. As more validators signal their support for higher gas limits, Ethereum’s path forward may involve incremental adjustments combined with technological innovations to mitigate risks. Initiatives like EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) and the eventual implementation of Ethereum 2.0’s roadmap are expected to complement these efforts by reducing layer-1 congestion and enhancing scalability. For now, the Ethereum community appears committed to exploring solutions that balance short-term needs with long-term goals. The rise in validator signaling reflects a network eager to evolve while preserving its core principles of decentralization and security. BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust Dominates with $3.446 Billion in Inflows Amid Market Volatility In other news, the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has set a new benchmark in the Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, recording a remarkable 14-day inflow streak. On Dec. 18, ETHA attracted an additional $81.9 million in investments, bringing its total inflows to an impressive $3.446 billion, according to data from Farside Investors . Since the approval of Ethereum ETF products by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), BlackRock and Fidelity have emerged as the dominant players in the market. Initially, Fidelity's Ethereum ETF (FETH) appeared to lead in terms of inflows. However, BlackRock's ETHA has gained significant momentum in recent weeks, outperforming its rival both in consistency and value of inflows. Over the past two weeks, ETHA has consistently outshined FETH, with the latter breaking its inflow streak on Dec. 18. Fidelity's FETH currently stands at $1.386 billion in total inflows—less than half of BlackRock's ETHA. This shift highlights BlackRock’s ability to attract sustained corporate interest, even amid volatile market conditions. BlackRock’s leadership in the crypto ETF market is not new. The investment giant has historically outperformed its peers across various crypto ETF offerings, cementing its reputation as a reliable entry point for institutional investors seeking exposure to digital assets. The growing inflows into Ethereum ETFs, particularly ETHA, signal a strong wave of institutional interest in Ethereum. This sustained capital flow is seen as a positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem, as it demonstrates increasing confidence in the blockchain’s potential as a robust investment vehicle. Institutional investments through ETFs provide a streamlined and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of managing digital wallets or private keys. As these inflows translate into Ethereum purchases, they could contribute to upward price pressure on ETH in the long term, potentially setting the stage for the much-anticipated ”altcoin season.” Ethereum Price Under Pressure Despite ETF Momentum Despite the bullish signals from ETF inflows, Ethereum’s price has faced downward pressure in recent weeks. Adding bearish pressure on the leading altcoin are remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who dismissed the possibility of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States, leading to broader sell-offs across the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s price outlook. While ETF inflows have yet to stabilize the coin's value in the short term, Ethereum boasts strong fundamentals that could drive a recovery. These include its position as the leading smart contract platform, the ongoing adoption of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps), and continued development efforts such as scalability improvements and ecosystem upgrades. The Ethereum ETF market’s growth demonstrates the asset’s increasing appeal to institutional investors. BlackRock’s ETHA has not only captured the lion’s share of inflows but also set the pace for the industry, providing a benchmark for other ETF providers. Looking ahead, the sustained interest in Ethereum ETFs could catalyze further adoption and investment. Analysts project a potential recovery in Ethereum’s price, driven by a combination of ETF inflows and broader market resilience. This optimism aligns with the belief that Ethereum’s ecosystem, bolstered by its diverse use cases and innovative development roadmap, will continue to attract both retail and institutional investors. As the market evolves, Ethereum remains well-positioned to benefit from the convergence of strong technical fundamentals and increasing institutional interest. Whether this translates into immediate price gains or sets the stage for long-term growth, Ethereum’s role in the cryptocurrency landscape remains undeniable.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-20 14:00:00

Currently trading at just $0.012, 1FUEL ’s token presale has attracted significant attention from blockchain investment experts due to its explosive growth potential. The DeFi token 1FUEL is in a presale and has been the center of conversations as the best low-cap crypto to buy now.

Experts have described this surge in interest as remarkable as Bonk has been able to flip a key resistance level into support. Bonk peaked at an all-time high last month but was corrected massively because of profit-taking. Since then, however, the cryptocurrency has stabilized, and the previous resistance has become a support for a potential price recovery. This stability has directly benefited from the #LetsBONK campaign, which is now popular across the markets and is still affecting market dynamics. WIF slips 20% as market cap falls below $3 billion The price of DogWifHat slipped 20% in the last week, driving its market cap below the $3 billion threshold to $2.65 billion. The cryptocurrency hit its lowest point since mid-November, showing a steep decline indicative of strong bearish pressure. Currently, the fourth-largest meme coin by market cap, WIF is at risk of being overtaken by BONK as they are only under a $400m market cap difference apart. If this trend of underperformance persists, it won’t be long until WIF loses its place with BONK hot on its heels.

Rexas Finance specializes in bridging that gap, and because of this, it attracts both professional and retail investors. What sets Rexas Finance apart is its wealth of polygons Defi tools, which users can use to interact without friction. The polygon ecosystem offers tools such as the Rexas Token Builder, which allows users to build custom tokens, and Rexas GenAI, an NFT creation platform created by Artificial Intelligence. These new solutions make Rexas Finance an easy option for companies and individuals who want to access or utilize blockchain technology. The smart contracts, posted on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms and are Certik audited, made Rexas Finance more credible. These partnerships reinforce the commitment of the project to enhance security and ensure transparency, which are crucial in fostering investor confidence. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Why analysts are bullish on RXS Rexas Finance is now in the 10th stage of presale, and the token price is $0.15, very close to $0.175, the price target for the next stage. As of writing, 91.31% of the presale has been completed, fetching $28 million from the set goal of $33 million. Of the total allocation of 380 million tokens, 346 million have been sold, demonstrating high demand from investors. Although SHIB has grown reasonably well, its market capitalization and price are highly influenced by the popularity of certain social media accounts and whale manipulation. RXS, on the other hand, is setting up for long-term growth with many features and future collaborations. At the expected listing price of $0.20, RXS makes sense as a great opportunity for almost any investor looking for high returns. Moreover, Rexas Finance also has the advantage of doing Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, a relatively new and growing market segment. Rexas Finance is a project that enables the tokenization of physical real estate, which allows investors to penetrate previously inaccessible markets. This kind of utility distinguishes it from many meme coins, which have scarcely any utility cases. Other interesting project features include Rexas Launchpad for blockchain startups and Rexas Treasury for multi-chain yield optimization. Thanks to these tools, the project’s ecosystem is sufficiently broadened, and users are supplied with various ways to harness value. According to analysts, these factors and a strong community-driven strategy will allow RXS to experience considerable expansion in the next several years. How RXS stands out from Shiba Inu With the help of memes, Shiba Inu has won many people’s hearts. But the flip side to this is that it heavily relies on hype and does not serve much purpose, which raises the question, how long will it last? However, Rexas Finance, on the other hand, is an entirely different model that offers practical applications and a strong framework developed to provide value. RXS does not compete with SHIB, a dog meme coin. Instead, it seeks to solve real-world problems. Its application in tokenizing assets makes it possible to sell them to non-crypto investors, a market with much more potential. Furthermore, no technical knowledge is required when using Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, which makes participating in the blockchain economy easier. Security and reliability are also key features for Rexas Finance , as one can notice even from their CertiK audit and clear tokenomics. With 42.5% of tokens distributed during the presale, staking, liquidity, and development funding, RXS shows that it has a clear roadmap and wishes to grow sustainably. Meme coins are often criticized for their lack of clarity and vision for the future; Rexas, on the other hand, does not have these issues. Conclusion Rexas Finance represents a unique opportunity in the crypto market, blending innovation, real-world applications, and significant growth potential. With its presale nearing completion, RXS has already proven its appeal to investors. Analysts agree that utility-driven growth and early-stage pricing could drive a 20x surge by early 2025, turning a modest $500 investment into $10,000.

37884180,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99187,1734703234,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Peter Schiff Predicts “Car Crash” for Cardano (ADA) Price as Strong Bearish Pattern Emerges,https://zycrypto.com/peter-schiff-predicts-car-crash-for-cardano-ada-price-as-strong-bearish-pattern-emerges/,"Veteran economist and trader Peter Schiff has issued a stark warning for Cardano (ADA), predicting a “car crash” for the cryptocurrency as a strong bearish technical pattern emerges. Schiff’s cautionary outlook comes amid a broader slump in the cryptocurrency market, with ADA losing around 27% of its value in the past week alone. Notably, the token’s recent decline follows its inability to sustain the $1.33 level, which ADA briefly surpassed last month. After multiple failed attempts to break through this resistance, the asset has entered a steep downward trajectory. In a tweet on Thursday, Schiff pointed to an “inverted head and shoulders” pattern forming on both the daily and four-hour ADA charts. This technical setup is commonly linked to bearish price movements, meaning that if the cryptocurrency falls below the neckline of this pattern, it could plummet by roughly 45% to the $0.50 price range. Schiff’s analysis has sparked controversy within the ADA community, with some critics pointing out that his past bearish predictions for the asset have been proven wrong, as ADA has previously surged in value despite similar forecasts. Notably, in April this year when Brandt, predicted a downturn for ADA, only for the token to defy expectations with a 130% price surge. Despite ADA’s recent struggles, supporters remain optimistic. Analysts like Taki, founder of crypto analysis platform “InvestingHaven” have pointed to key Fibonacci levels that could influence ADA’s future price movement. According to Taki, if ADA can hold support at the $0.824 level, the cryptocurrency could experience a bullish resurgence in 2025, with potential price targets ranging from $0.83 to $2.55. Elsewhere, some analysts are closely monitoring ADA’s historical trends. Analyst Gert Van Lagen recently tweeted that ADA’s current price movements mirror the Elliott Wave patterns seen in September 2020. This pattern preceded ADA’s price retesting of $0.80, which led to an extraordinary 1,350% surge by early 2021. According to the pundit, if this pattern repeats, conservative extension targets range from $5 to $30, with the potential for ADA to surge beyond $700 in the long term. Looking beyond the technical aspects, the year 2025 holds significant potential for shaping the broader Cardano ecosystem. In addition to the growing momentum from major development efforts aimed at fully decentralizing the network, the introduction of privacy-focused tools like Midnights and integrations with additional blockchain networks are set to attract more users to ADA. This week, WallStreetBets founder Jaime Rogozinski also shared bold predictions for 2025, highlighting ADA’s potential to become the official cryptocurrency for lobbying. This suggests that if ADA gains influence in political and regulatory circles, it could help foster more favorable policies for blockchain adoption. At press time, ADA was trading at $0.85, reflecting a 10.27% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-20 14:00:34
37883998,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665553,1734703259,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Is The Bitcoin Top In For This Cycle? On-Chain Signals You Need To Know,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-cycle-top-on-chain-signals-you-need-to-know/,"Bitcoin’s price retracement from its new all-time high of $108,353 on Tuesday to around $96,000 (a -11.5% pullback) has ignited intense speculation about whether the current bull cycle is nearing its peak. To address growing uncertainty, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder of on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, released a thread on X detailing 18 on-chain metrics and models. “Where is the Bitcoin TOP?” Schultze-Kraft asked, before laying out his detailed analysis. Has Bitcoin Reached Its Cycle Top? 1/ MVRV Ratio: A longstanding measure of unrealized profitability, the MVRV ratio compares market value to realized value. Historically, readings above 7 signaled overheated conditions. “Currently hovering around 3 – room to grow,” Schultze-Kraft noted. This suggests that, in terms of aggregate unrealized profit, the market is not yet at levels that have previously coincided with macro tops. 2/ MVRV Pricing Bands: These bands are derived from the number of days MVRV has spent at extreme levels. The top band (3.2) has been exceeded for only about 6% of trading days historically. Today, this top band corresponds to a price of $127,000. Given that Bitcoin sits at around $98,000, the market has not yet reached a zone that historically marked top formations. 3/ Long-Term Holder Profitability (Relative Unrealized Profit & LTH-NUPL): Long-term holders (LTHs) are considered more stable market participants. Their Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric is currently at 0.75, entering what Schultze-Kraft terms the “euphoria zone.” He remarked that in the 2021 cycle, Bitcoin ran another ~3x after hitting similar levels (though he clarified he is not necessarily expecting a repetition). Historical top formations often saw LTH-NUPL readings above 0.9. Thus, while the metric is elevated, it has not yet reached previous cycle extremes. Notably, Schultze-Kraft admitted his observations may be conservative because the 2021 cycle peaked at somewhat lower profitability values than prior cycles. “I would’ve expected these profitability metrics to reach slightly higher levels,” he explained. This may signal diminishing peaks over successive cycles. Investors should be aware that historical extremes may become less pronounced over time. 4/ Yearly Realized Profit/Loss Ratio: This metric measures the total realized profits relative to realized losses over the past year. Previous cycle tops have seen values above 700%. Currently at around 580%, it still shows “room to grow” before reaching levels historically associated with market tops. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes: Here’s Where The Nearest On-Chain Support Is 5/ Market Cap To Thermocap Ratio: An early on-chain metric, it compares Bitcoin’s total market capitalization to the cumulative mining cost (Thermocap). In prior bull runs, the ratio’s extremes aligned with market tops. Schultze-Kraft advises caution with specific target ranges but notes that current levels are not close to previous extremes. The market remains below historical thermocap multiples that indicated overheated conditions in the past. 6/ Thermocap Multiples (32-64x): Historically, Bitcoin has topped at roughly 32-64 times the Thermocap. “We’re at the bottom of this range,” said Schultze-Kraft. Hitting the top band in today’s environment would imply a Bitcoin market cap just above $4 trillion. Given that current market capitalization ($1.924 trillion) is significantly lower, this suggests the possibility of substantial upside if historical patterns were to hold. 7/ The Investor Tool (2-Year SMA x5): The Investor Tool applies a 2-year Simple Moving Average (SMA) of price and a 5x multiple of that SMA to signal potential top zones. “Which currently denotes $230,000,” Schultze-Kraft noted. Since Bitcoin’s current price is well beneath this level, the indicator has not yet flashed an unequivocal top signal. 8/ Bitcoin Price Temperature (BPT6): This model uses deviations from a 4-year moving average to capture cyclical price extremes. Historically, BPT6 was reached in previous bull markets, and that band now sits at $151,000. With Bitcoin at $98,000, the market is still short of levels previously associated with peak overheating. 9/ The True Market Mean & AVIV: The True Market Mean is an alternative cost basis model. Its MVRV-equivalent, known as AVIV, measures how far the market strays from this mean. Historically, tops have seen more than 3 standard deviations. Today’s equivalent “amounts to values above ~2.3,” while the current reading is 1.7. “Room to grow,” Schultze-Kraft said, implying that by this metric, the market is not yet stretched to its historical extremes. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Could Push Price To $500,000: Expert 10/ Low/Mid/Top Cap Models (Delta Cap Derivatives): These models, based on the Delta Cap metric, historically showed diminished values during the 2021 cycle, never reaching the ‘Top Cap.’ Schultze-Kraft urges caution in interpreting these due to evolving market structures. Currently, the mid cap level sits at about $4 trillion, roughly a 2x from current levels. If the market followed previous patterns, this would allow for considerable growth before hitting levels characteristic of earlier tops. 11/ Value Days Destroyed Multiple (VDDM): This metric gauges the spending behavior of long-held coins relative to the annual average. Historically, extreme values above 2.9 indicated that older coins were heavily hitting the market, often during late-stage bull markets. Presently, it’s at 2.2, not yet at extreme levels. “Room to grow,” Schultze-Kraft noted, suggesting not all long-term holders have fully capitulated to profit-taking. 12/ The Mayer Multiple: The Mayer Multiple compares price to the 200-day SMA. Overbought conditions in previous cycles aligned with values above 2.4. Currently, a Mayer Multiple above 2.4 would correspond to a price of approximately $167,000. With Bitcoin under $100,000, this threshold remains distant. 13/ The Cycle Extremes Oscillator Chart: This composite uses multiple binary indicators (MVRV, aSOPR, Puell Multiple, Reserve Risk) to signal cycle extremes. “Currently 2/4 are on,” meaning only half of the tracked conditions for an overheated market are met. Previous tops aligned with a full suite of triggered signals. As such, the chart suggests the cycle has not yet reached the intensity of a full-blown peak. 14/ Pi Cycle Top Indicator: A price-based signal that has historically identified cycle peaks by comparing the short-term and long-term moving averages. “Currently the short moving average sits well below the larger ($74k vs. $129k),” Schultze-Kraft said, indicating no crossover and thus no classic top signal. 15/ Sell-Side Risk Ratio (LTH Version): This ratio compares total realized profits and losses to the realized market capitalization. High values correlate with volatile, late-stage bull markets. “The interesting zone is at 0.8% and above, while we’re currently at 0.46% – room to grow,” Schultze-Kraft explained. This implies that, despite recent profit-taking, the market has not yet entered the intense sell pressure zone often seen near tops. 16/ LTH Inflation Rate: Schultze-Kraft highlighted the Long-Term Holder Inflation Rate as “the most bearish chart I’ve come across so far.” While he did not provide specific target values or thresholds in this excerpt, he stated it “screams caution.” Investors should monitor this closely as it may signal increasing distribution from long-term holders or other structural headwinds. 17/ STH-SOPR (Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio): This metric measures the profit-taking behavior of short-term holders. “Currently elevated, but not sustained,” Schultze-Kraft noted. In other words, while short-term participants are taking profits, the data does not yet show the kind of persistent, aggressive profit-taking typical of a market top. 18/ SLRV Ribbons: These ribbons track trends in short- and long-term realized value. Historically, when both moving averages top out and cross over, it indicates a market turning point. “Both moving averages still trending up, only becomes bearish at rounded tops and crossover. No indication of a top at this time,” Schultze-Kraft stated. Overall, Schultze-Kraft emphasized that these metrics should not be used in isolation. “Never rely on single data points – confluence is your friend,” he advised. He acknowledged that this is a non-comprehensive list and that Bitcoin’s evolving ecosystem—now with ETFs, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and geopolitical factors—may render historical comparisons less reliable. “This cycle can look vastly different, yet (historical) data is all we have,” he concluded. While numerous metrics show that Bitcoin’s market is moving into more euphoric and profitable territory, few have reached the historical extremes that marked previous cycle tops. Indicators like MVRV, profitability ratios, thermal metrics, and various price-based models generally suggest “room to grow,” although at least one—LTH Inflation Rate—raises a note of caution. Some composites are only partially triggered, while classic top signals such as Pi Cycle Top remain inactive. At press time, BTC traded at $96,037.

While BTC fell below $93,000 in this process, data on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which the FED closely follows when making interest rate decisions and is considered a leading inflation indicator, was announced today. Accordingly, personal consumption expenditures data for November were as follows: Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (YoY) Announced 2.8% – Expected 2.9% – Previous 2.8% Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (Monthly) Announced 0.1%– Expected 0.2% – Previous 0.3% Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (Annual) Announced 2.4% – Expected 2.5% – Previous 2.3% Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (Monthly) Announced 0.1% – Expected 0.2% – Previous 0.2% Bitcoin is on the rise! After the PCE data came in below expectations, Bitcoin started to rise and the price rose above the $95,000 level. The PCE index is considered by the Fed to be the most accurate measure of inflation. Following the PCE data, the probability that the FED will leave interest rates unchanged in January 2025 is priced in at 89.3 percent, while a 25 basis point cut is priced in at 10.7 percent.

Cathie Wood Reaffirms Her $1 Million Bitcoin Prediction by 2030 In a report published by Bloomberg, Wood emphasized that Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins gives it an advantage over gold as a store of value. When the price of gold rises, he noted, mining companies typically increase production, increasing supply and potentially reducing price momentum. In contrast, Bitcoin's supply is limited by its underlying code, making it immune to such supply fluctuations. “Bitcoin’s scarcity is intrinsic and mathematical, and provides a level of certainty that gold cannot match,” Wood said. This forecast is in line with ARK Invest’s bullish stance on digital assets, supported by increasing institutional adoption and the perception of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. While some analysts have been skeptical of such a high price target, Wood has consistently defended his view by emphasizing Bitcoin’s resilience and ability to disrupt traditional financial systems. *This is not investment advice.

XRP alone relinquished nearly 20% of its recent gains in this timeframe. Notably, the drop was attributed to a combination of typical on-chain profit-taking and reports that U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated the agency has no interest in creating a national Bitcoin reserve, sending Bitcoin’s price as low as $92,000 at the time of writing. Despite this setback, analysts remain increasingly optimistic about XRP’s future trajectory, with some seeing the current dip as another rare “buy the dip” opportunity. In a Thursday tweet, popular Gert Van Lagen highlighted a potential double-bottom breakout for XRP, predicting the cryptocurrency could surge to $10 in the ongoing market cycle. Notably, his optimism is largely driven by a “double bottom” formation, a pattern that has historically preceded substantial price rallies for XRP. Supporting his analysis, the pundit pointed to the periods between 2014 and 2017 when XRP’s price surged by an astounding 25,000% in just five months after printing the pattern. At the time, XRP had traded as low as $0.006 in April 2017 before peaking at around $1.50 by December. In the current market, Van Lagen pointed out that XRP has formed a similar double-bottom pattern between March 2020 and August 2022, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could be poised for another major bull run . Legan’s analysis was supported by Egrag Crypto, another analyst who predicts that XRP could reach triple digits by the end of this cycle, clapping back at critics. “They used to call us crazy for saying double digits for XRP, now they are charting XRP for 3 digits. Trust the process,” he stated confidently. Egrag also downplayed the recent price drops, calling them “just noise” and emphasizing that such fluctuations are typical for XRP within its current macro range. He pointed out that XRP is retesting a crucial low of $1.90 from December 10th, which could complete the double-bottom formation and set the stage for a potential rebound. Egrag reassured that even if XRP temporarily falls below this level, it should not be considered a major concern. Notably, in an analysis shared on Thursday, the pundit had examined XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating that the cryptocurrency could hit new highs by mid-2025. He also observed that XRP’s price behavior mirrors previous cycles, with a possible second peak in either March or July 2025 at around $90. However, according to Egrag, a critical point is that the RSI must remain above 77 in the two-week timeframe, as this would signal strong momentum heading into the next market phase.

This proposal, introduced by GAM Investments, suggests allocating a portion of SBI’s assets to establish an XRP reserve. According to a projection by AI chatbot ChatGPT, such a move could push XRP’s price to double digits, reaching as high as $15 in the most optimistic scenario. GAM Investments’ Proposal Recently, GAM Investments, a stakeholder in SBI Holdings, highlighted concerns regarding the undervaluation of SBI’s Ripple-related assets. As previously reported by Times Tabloid, GAM pointed out that SBI has not effectively utilized its investment in Ripple or XRP to deliver maximum value to shareholders. GAM attributed this to SBI’s unclear crypto strategy and inadequate communication with investors. According to GAM, SBI’s 8–9% ownership stake in Ripple and its indirect control over a significant portion of XRP through Ripple, represents a largely untapped opportunity. GAM noted that this stake alone could exceed SBI’s current market capitalization. To unlock this potential, GAM proposed that SBI establish an XRP reserve. According to GAM, this approach could deliver better value to shareholders than conventional methods such as cash dividends. ChatGPT’s XRP Price Projections To gauge the potential impact of such a reserve on XRP’s price, ChatGPT was asked to analyze various scenarios. The chatbot assessed the possible outcomes if SBI allocated 5%, 10%, or 20% of its assets to XRP reserves. As of March 2024, SBI’s total assets were valued at approximately ¥27.2 trillion, equivalent to $175.1 billion. Based on XRP’s circulating supply of about 57.45 billion tokens and an average price of $2.35 per token, ChatGPT calculated the potential market effects under different allocation percentages. If SBI allocates 5% of its assets—approximately $8.75 billion—to XRP, it could acquire around 3.72 billion tokens, representing about 6.5% of the circulating supply. ChatGPT projected that such a large-scale purchase could double XRP’s price, driving it to the $4.50–$5.00 range, depending on market liquidity. A 10% allocation, involving $17.5 billion, would enable SBI to buy approximately 7.45 billion XRP tokens or 13% of the circulating supply. ChatGPT suggested this could push XRP prices to $7.00–$8.00.

This could secure 14.89 billion tokens, equivalent to 26% of the circulating supply. ChatGPT projected that such a massive reduction in available XRP could drive its price to $10.00–$15.00, depending on market conditions and liquidity constraints. Prospects for Implementation While GAM’s proposal is compelling, whether SBI will act on it remains uncertain. The ultimate decision depends on factors such as GAM’s influence over other stakeholders and its ability to convince SBI’s leadership to adopt the strategy. XRP community member WrathofKahneman highlighted the importance of GAM’s stake in SBI and its potential to sway other investors. However, even if SBI chooses to implement the plan, there is no guarantee that the price projections outlined by ChatGPT will materialize. Variables such as overall market conditions, liquidity, and seller resistance would play critical roles in determining the outcome.

Key milestones—such as the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s vocal support for the crypto industry—are reshaping the market landscape. Amid this progress, crypto exchanges, as a fundamental pillar of digital asset infrastructure, have seen unparalleled growth. Leveraging over a decade of experience, $HTX, the ecosystem token of HTX and decentralized autonomous organization HTX DAO , is now experiencing the explosive growth stage, outpacing market expectations and emerging as a leading exchange token. $HTX is poised to become 2025’s brightest crypto star with increasing investor interest, supported by HTX’s robust brand, innovative ecosystem strategies, and deflationary tokenomics. $HTX Drives the New Exchange Token Narrative Exchange ecosystem tokens have returned to the spotlight. On December 4, a new $HTX buyback and burn initiative launched on HTX, coupled with a string of innovative product upgrades, including dynamic interest rates for Crypto Loans. The market reaction was swift and decisive: $HTX surged 25% on the day, drawing widespread attention. At present, $HTX boasts a circulating market cap of $902 million, with its price reaching a peak of $0.000003596—a staggering 400% increase year-to-date. This performance not only outpaced competitors but also exceeded gains seen in BTC and ETH. Despite its strong performance, $HTX’s current valuation remains significantly lower than that of leading exchange tokens like BNB (market cap over $100 billion), indicating substantial upside potential. $HTX holders are positioned to benefit from HTX’s expanding ecosystem and the token’s long-term appreciation. HTX’s consistent product innovation is key to $HTX’s extraordinary performance this year. Through the evolving products, the token grants users a suite of privileges, including trading fee discounts, access to Launchpool projects, accelerated Prime memberships, and discounted subscriptions for top cryptocurrencies. These benefits have fostered strong user engagement, solidifying $HTX’s continued success. HTX’s innovation isn’t limited to its products; its aggressive asset listing strategy also played a key role, adding 201 new assets. Riding Bitcoin’s rebound in Q1, HTX’s assets team seized opportunities in the meme coin and RWA sectors. Key initial listings included Solana-based WIF and BOME, which surged 121x and 56x, respectively. In RWAs, HTX listed ONDO, driving a 45x gain for users. These listings revitalized the platform, activating over 3,000 dormant users and attracting over a thousand of new registrations. In Q2, HTX focused on leading cryptocurrencies in high-growth sectors, including ENA (DeFi), IO (DePIN), and ZK (Layer 2). A surge in on-chain activity fueled a market boom in Q3, and HTX is at the forefront of the buzz. It is the first exchange to support the promising SUNPUMP ecosystem and community-driven meme coin project nerio. This led to significant gains for HTX users, with SUNPUMP tokens like SUNDOG surging 37x post-listing, and other tokens like SUNCAT and SUNWUKONG also performed strongly. HTX also capitalized on the popularity of community-driven meme coins like NEIROCTO, which saw a remarkable 137x surge. Capitalizing on Bitcoin and Ethereum’s strength in Q4, HTX prioritized community and high-potential tokens to benefit its users. Listings such as GOAT, BAN, and ACT on Solana outpaced Binance, earning HTX strong community praise. HTX’s strategic efforts have delivered exceptional growth across user metrics. HTX’s daily new registrations have increased 7x year-to-date. The platform now ranks 4th globally in web traffic, and its app has topped finance charts in Google Play and Apple’s App Store across over 60 countries. Average trading volume (per user) has surged 10x since January. Thanks to these achievements, HTX has staged a successful comeback this year. HTX’s Decade-Plus Buildup Sets the Stage for Token Growth As one of the earliest global cryptocurrency exchanges, HTX has built a global business network and user base, leveraging over a decade of operational experience. Expanding from Asia to Europe, HTX has not only pursued market expansion but also cultivated strong user loyalty through localized services. Its brand has become an industry benchmark. $HTX’s Deflationary Tokenomics Anchors Long-Term Appreciation A key strength of $HTX’s is its deflationary tokenomics. HTX allocates a portion of platform revenue to buy back and burn $HTX, reducing the circulating supply and increasing scarcity. By the end of 2024, cumulative burn value is expected to exceed $100 million, reinforcing investor confidence in $HTX’s long-term trajectory. Beyond its role as HTX’s core token, $HTX is the cornerstone of the HTX DAO ecosystem, offering various utilities such as trading fee discounts, governance voting, and access to wealth management products. HTX’s global partnerships have expanded the use cases for $HTX, creating a robust ecosystem that drives sustained value growth. This multi-faceted empowerment has fueled sustained value growth for $HTX. Strategic initiatives, such as the “One Crypto, Dual Rewards” feature—allowing users to stake $HTX while participating in Launchpool—further enhance asset efficiency. Additionally, HTX adopts dynamic interest rates and the flexible term for Crypto Loans products, enhancing users’ asset liquidity while optimizing returns. 2025: A Golden Opportunity for $HTX Amid the Market Cycle The cyclical nature of the crypto market creates a favorable macro backdrop for platform tokens. As the 2024 Bitcoin halving event ushered in a new bull cycle, HTX, as a prominent exchange has attracted increased attention, leading to a rise in the price of $HTX. 1. User Growth Acceleration HTX continues to expand its global user base through strategic partnerships and community engagement. The decentralized governance model of HTX DAO further empowers users, driving strong demand for $HTX. 2. Optimized Tokenomics HTX plans to further enhance $HTX’s tokenomics by introducing additional incentives and applications, unlocking greater long-term value. 3. Huge Valuation Potential Despite its strong performance, $HTX remains undervalued. As market recognition of its value increases, the potential for future growth in $HTX is significant. The Road Ahead for $HTX to Shine HTX’s legacy of industry leadership provides a solid platform for $HTX’s continued success. Backed by a deflationary model, multi-utility ecosystem, and global market traction, $HTX is well-positioned to lead the exchange token market in 2025.

Hammack said rates are getting close to neutral, neither restraining nor stimulating the economy. Rates should stay elevated enough to “modestly restrain” economic activity “for some time. Beth Hammack Breaks with Fed, Opposes Rate Cut Over Inflation Worries Beth Hammack, president of the Cleveland Fed, and the sole dissenter to this week’s Federal Reserve rate cut, explained her opposition with an emphasis on inflation concerns. She said “there is more work to do on inflation,” showing her preference for holding steady on rates due to the economy’s strength. She stated: “Based on my estimate that monetary policy is not far from a neutral stance, I prefer to hold policy steady until we see further evidence that inflation is resuming its path to our 2 percent objective.” Beth Hammack said the decision to dissent on the Fed’s latest rate cu t was close because she believes monetary policy will have to remain modestly restrictive for some time. Hammack’s dissent was the second since the Fed began its rate-cutting cycle in September. It followed Fed Governor Michelle Bowman’s vote in support of this week’s 25 basis point cut. Fed Officials Cut Rate Cut Projections for 2025 Amid Persistent Inflation Fed officials reduced 2025 rate cut projections from four to two due to persistent inflation concerns. November saw a slight MoM inflation decline, though it remains sticky as the Fed aims to reach a 2% target. Fed officials also revised their projections for 2025. They lowered the number of cuts expected from four to two, partly as a result of their concern over the persistence of inflation. Recent inflation data revealed a marginal deceleration in price increases month over month in November. However, inflation remains sticky as the central bank works to bring it back to its 2% target. In November, the core PCE, which excludes food and energy costs, was up 0.1% from the prior month , compared with a gain of 0.3% in October. On an annual basis, core prices were up 2.8%, below Wall Street’s expectations for a gain of 2.9%. Overall, PCE rose 2.4% annually, compared with 2.3% in October. Still, it was slightly below economists’ projections of a 2.5% rise. Beth Hammack also highlighted that while the progress of inflation being at 7.2% in the summer of 2022 has gone down, it is still highly elevated. She said they are focusing on bringing the rate down to 2%, specifically since the job market has been very strong.

This rang painfully true that night. As soon as Acuña hit send, it was over: $400,000 worth of crypto — all his money — was gone, pilfered by an anonymous phishing scammer. A piercing noise rang in Acuña’s ears, his temperature rose and his fists clenched. Acuña’s loss demonstrates that no one is immune to crypto hacks. He's a seven-year crypto industry veteran, someone who grasps the need for wariness given the dangers that lurk around blockchains. Before that, he was a journalist for decades, where staying alert was a must as he faced violent drug cartels in Mexico and torture in prison. And yet he became one of the many victims of crypto scams. In 2023, U.S. officials received 69,000 reports of crypto theft totaling more than $5.6 billion . Getting that money back can be hard. If your normal bank account gets breached, insurance will almost certainly cover your losses. But there's no highly regulated system like that in crypto, which is famously and quite intentionally decentralized. While that disintermediation gives crypto users the freedom from institutions that they crave, it's also a double-edged sword. The omission of gatekeepers can also leave people a single button click away from ruin. The hack itself was nothing special. Because Acuña couldn’t access his funds on a Ledger hardware device, he reached out to customer support via social media. An impersonator swooped in and, following 30 minutes of deception, Acuña was stuck in the scammer’s web. “Phishing scams remain incredibly prolific today,” Adrian Hetman, head of triaging at Web3 security researcher Immunefi, told CoinDesk. “Phishing attempts are a growing concern in crypto, as criminals see it as an effective way to steal user funds at scale and apply social engineering for more sophisticated attacks on project infrastructure.” Acuña was helpless again, this time at the mercy of a blockchain that was once his salvation following a horrendous ordeal of false imprisonment in Mexico. Working undercover Acuña began working as a journalist in the 1990s — a career that confronted him with government censorship, false imprisonment and death threats. His work on organized crime, elections and corruption soon got him noticed by United Press International (UPI) and Reforma, where he began diving deeper into one of the most notorious and violent drug cartels in the world. He was based in Sinaloa, a state in Mexico that runs down the west coast from Los Mochis to Mazatlán. The fertile, mountainous territory emerged as a hotbed of organized crime, leading to the formation of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán's infamous Sinaloa Cartel. Acuña’s coverage of the cartel eventually led to him working independently as a freelance journalist with his work being picked up by the likes of Associated Press and Reuters. This was when his career in Mexico reached a turbulent crescendo. Authorities caught wind of one of Acuña’s stories on corruption and decided enough was enough. They accused him of hiding a weapon that belonged to the Attorney General’s office. Acuña says he was tortured for 16 hours. “One day, I was thrown into a vehicle in the most violent manner you can imagine,"" he said. ""They sent a police commander widely known for torturing people, and they abducted me. For 16 hours they waterboarded me, tied me up, cut off my circulation, folded me backwards. At one point, they told me, ‘Next door we have your family. We will bring them in here one by one and kill them in front of you until you tell us where the gun is.’” Acuña was subsequently jailed for two years on accusations — which Acuña says were false — that were later dropped. He filed a human rights lawsuit against Mexican authorities. Crypto salvation, or not In 2017, Acuña wiped the slate clean of his tortuous past, entering the wonderfully weird world of crypto, enjoying stints as a public relations officer at payments firm Electroneum, a television producer at BloxLive and most recently another public relations role at DePIN company IOTEX. His tough background prepared him for the crypto industry, which despite growing acceptance by the traditional finance sector, continues to grapple with the Wild West environment of its early days. While Acuña might not have the most common backstory for those working in crypto, it remains a pertinent reminder that the allure of the crypto industry is not just speculative financial gain: It’s also an industry that checks the power of governments, banks and elites, which appealed to Acuña. “The first day that I began writing about crypto and blockchain, I said, 'Here it is, the solution to all of the issues of the lack of freedom of expression. Here it is, the solution to government corruption. Here it is, finally something that I can have faith in and have and do passionately,'” Acuña told CoinDesk. Despite losing his life savings, Acuña continues to work in the crypto industry — although he warns that it’s a long way away from going mainstream. “If we ever want mass adoption, this needs to be seamless,” he said. At the moment, the user experience is “anxiety-inducing. Every time I send crypto now, I think, ‘Have I done it wrong? Am I going to lose my money?' Each and every time.’” Unless “we get an application where all your crypto is in that same app, and it doesn't matter what freaking network it is, you can convert it into whatever you want, to convert it and send it, then I just don't see it” taking off. This remains a key hurdle for the industry; tech-savvy millennials know how to buy an asset on Ethereum, bridge it to Solana and buy a memecoin on Pump.fun before sending that to an exchange, but the majority of regular people don’t. “I don’t want to exit crypto, I’m still excited about crypto,"" Acuña said. ""Will moving money around always be traumatic? Yes. But I love this sector.”",Finance,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-20 15:20:03

Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ) fell to a low of $0.2483, a drop that mirrored other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Most cryptocurrencies have dropped, bringing the total market capitalization of all coins to $3.24 trillion. Hedera’s retreat coincides with a decline in the total value of assets locked in its decentralized finance ecosystem. According to DeFi Llama , the TVL has dropped to 675 million HBAR, down from the year-to-date high of 1.35 billion tokens. In U.S. dollar terms, the TVL has fallen from $209 million on Dec. 3 to $165 million. This decline suggests that investors are pulling out funds from Hedera’s DeFi platforms like SaucerSwap, Bonzo Finance, and HbarSuite. You might also like: What is Hedera Hashgraph? HBAR crypto explained To be fair, Hedera is not the only blockchain network experiencing a decline in DeFi assets. Other popular chains like Cardano , Ethereum, and Solana have also seen capital flight in recent days. Historically, investors tend to exit these platforms during periods of broader cryptocurrency market weakness. Despite the current downturn, Hedera Hashgraph has some positive fundamentals that could drive its price higher in the long term. The network boasts partnerships with major global companies like IBM and Google, both of which are members of its governance council. Hedera is also positioning itself as a key player in the Real World Asset Real World Asset tokenization industry . Tokenization refers to converting illiquid assets into liquid ones that can be easily moved and traded. Hedera’s fast transaction speeds and low costs make it an attractive option for developers in this space. Another potential catalyst for HBAR is the possibility of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving a spot HBAR ETF in 2025. According to a senior Bloomberg analyst, the SEC may approve the ETF since it does not classify HBAR as a security.

Specifically, it is developing a falling wedge pattern, which typically forms as an asset consolidates between two falling trendlines. A bullish breakout often occurs when the two lines converge. Additionally, Hedera is forming a bullish pennant pattern, characterized by a long upward trendline followed by consolidation. This pattern also often leads to a strong bullish breakout over time. HBAR remains above the 50-day moving average and the major support and resistance pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines at $0.1953. Therefore, a contrarian case can be made for Hedera’s price. If the bullish patterns hold, HBAR could rebound and retest the year-to-date high of $0.3940, representing a potential gain of about 66% from the current level.

For context, the previous record from December 2020 was $4.8 trillion. So what happens when this much money is on the table? Volatility and chaos that could destabilize crypto markets some more. Source : The Kobeissi Letter The Nasdaq is already down over 6% in just five days. The Volatility Index, or $VIX, has doubled this week. Investors are bracing for impact as the US stock market hits what’s called a “triple witching day.” That’s when stock options, stock index futures, and other derivatives all expire at once. Historically, these days don’t end well for stocks. And negative returns have been the norm over the last decade. Stocks are trembling under pressure The Dow barely managed a 0.04% gain yesterday, but the S&P 500 slipped 0.09%, and the Nasdaq took a bigger hit, down 0.47%. Tech stocks are dragging the market lower. And the Federal Reserve’s hawkish cut and sky-high inflation aren’t helping anyone sleep better. Let’s talk numbers. Total market capitalization for US stocks has hit $59 trillion, double the size of the country’s GDP. According to SpotGamma, calls have been crushing puts leading up to today. Earlier this week, the call-to-put ratio was 10 to 1. Even with the market taking a beating in the last few days, calls still dominate. That imbalance? It’s like lighter fluid on a bonfire. Crypto braces for the fallout Meanwhile, Bitcoin is already having a tough time. It has crashed to around $95,000 from an all-time high of $108,000 in just two days. Ethereum? Down 7.5%. Solana? A nasty 6.4% drop. Here’s the deal: heightened volatility in stocks often leads to turbulence in crypto. Why? Because investors treat crypto as a risk asset. If stock traders panic-sell, some of that fear flows into Bitcoin and altcoins. Liquidity dries up, and prices swing wildly. And as we’ve seen this year, the correlation between these markets has grown even higher. Between December 2023 and January 2024, Bitcoin consolidated between $39,000 and $46,000 before exploding to $66,000 in March. Right now, it’s moving between $88,000 and $102,000. Analysts are watching the $88,000–$90,000 zone closely. If Bitcoin dips below that range, a steeper correction could be on the cards. And let’s not ignore the bearish signals. On weekly charts, Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) is showing lower highs while the price shows higher highs. That’s classic bearish divergence, and it’s the same setup we saw in 2021 before Bitcoin crashed from $69,000 to $15,000. If history repeats itself, crypto traders could be in for a rough ride. Long-term support levels aren’t looking too hot either. Analysts are eyeing the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) around $66,600 as the next major line in the sand.

The total capitalization dropped by more than $300 billion as Bitcoin’s price went on a complete rollercoaster, similar to that of the majority of altcoins. The first few days of the week started as we are more or less used to by know – up only. Bitcoin’s price tapped a new all-time high above $108,000 and the market was anticipating the results of the meeting of the US Federal Result. Quite frankly, everyone was expecting for the institution to once again cut the interest rates, which is generally perceived as a positive move as far as risk-on assets go. Oh, if it were true this time around. During the meeting, the Chairman Jerome Powell said that they might consider a slowdown of rate cuts, given that the inflation in the country is rising. This propelled a market-wide sell-off across the crypto industry but also across tradfi as the majority of indices also dropped considerably. More interestingly, Powell addressed the possibility of Bitcoin becoming a reserve asset for the country, saying that the Federal Reserve is legally prohibited from holding it. This might put a dent into Trump’s plans and it appears that investors didn’t like it as the cryptocurrency is now trading below $100K, having plummetted to around $92,000 earlier today. The sell-off also triggered over $1.3 billion worth of liquidated positions across the cryptocurrency market on Friday alone. The majority of altcoins are trading in the red, with Ethereum down almost 15%, XRP – 10%, BNB – 8%, Solana -15%, DOGE – 25%, and so forth. As it’s almost always the case, a lot of people in the community are already speculating whether or not the bull run is over, but during times like these it’s really important to zoom out and keep a steady eye on the bigger picture. In any case, if one thing is sure, it’s that the next few weeks are likely to be quite interesting, so let’s see how it goes! Market Data Source: Quantify Crypto Market Cap: $3.45T | 24H Vol: $482B | BTC Dominance: 55.3% BTC: $96,552 (-4.5%) | ETH: $3,370 ( -15% ) | XRP: $2.21 (-10%) This Week’s Headlines You Can’t Miss MicroStrategy Announces First Bitcoin Purchase With BTC Prices Above $100K . It wouldn’t be a Monday these days if the Michael Saylor-founded business intelligence giant didn’t announce a massive BTC purchase. In this week’s example , the company allocated $1.5 billion to accumulate 15,350 BTC at an average price of just over $100,000. XRP Price on the Move as Ripple Announces Stablecoin Launch on Dec 17 . Although it continues with its legal tussle against the US securities watchdog, Ripple entered the stablecoin industry this week by finally launching its own product called RLUSD. The token release was on December 17, and it positively impacted XRP’s price at the time. This Cohort of Ethereum Whales Accumulates Record 57.35% of Supply . Ethereum whales have been on an accumulation spree lately, according to on-chain data. The number of large wallets holding at least 100,000 ETH has jumped to an all-time high of over 57% of the entire supply. BlackRock’s IBIT Nearly Doubles Gold ETF’s 20-Year AUM Milestone in Less Than 12 Months . The world’s largest Bitcoin ETF continues to shatter records. Its AUM has skyrocketed in the past 11 months to almost $60 billion as of December 19, which dwarfed the performance of the company’s biggest gold-based ETF. Bitcoin Price Tumbles Toward $100K Despite Fed’s Latest Rate Cut . The entire financial field expected another rate cut at the end of 2024, and that’s what they got . However, the hawkish words by Jerome Powell about potentially stopping the rate reductions in 2025 sent the ever-volatile and risky crypto market down hard. At first, BTC tumbled toward $100,000 but quickly lost that level and dumped all the way south to $92,100, leading to speculations about whether this bull market has ended. Fed Effect: Biggest Net Outflow Day for Bitcoin ETFs Led to Crash Below $96K . Powell’s aforementioned comments seemingly scared US investors out of their BTC positions, which is particularly true for the spot Bitcoin ETFs. The financial vehicles recorded their worst day in terms of daily net outflows on the day after the FOMC meeting (December 19), with nearly $700 million being withdrawn .

In 2025, three cryptocurrencies— Solana (SOL) , Bonk , and **Lightchain AI ($LCAI)**—are emerging as strong contenders for the next big crypto rally. Among these, Lightchain AI is making waves with its cutting-edge blockchain-AI integration and its highly anticipated Lightchain AI Presale . This presale is generating significant buzz as investors look to get in early on a project poised to redefine the space. In this article, we’ll explore the unique strengths of these three cryptocurrencies—Solana’s focus on scalability, Bonk’s community-driven momentum, and Lightchain AI’s revolutionary technology—and their potential to lead the 2025 crypto rally. Solana: High-Performance Blockchain for Scalable Solutions Solana has quickly established itself as a leader among blockchain platforms, recognized for its unparalleled speed and efficiency. Launched in 2020, the platform addresses scalability concerns with its unique blend of Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms. Capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) at minimal costs, Solana has become a go-to choice for developers working on decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi solutions. Advantages Unmatched Performance : By employing PoH, Solana ensures high-speed transaction processing, making it suitable for projects requiring scalability. Expanding Ecosystem : From NFT marketplaces like Magic Eden to DeFi platforms such as Serum, Solana boasts a growing network of innovative projects. Low-Cost Transactions : With transaction fees averaging under $0.01, Solana provides an affordable option for developers and users alike. Drawbacks System Stability : Frequent network outages have raised questions about the platform’s reliability under heavy usage. Decentralization Concerns : Critics argue that Solana’s validator setup leans toward centralization, which could challenge the core principles of blockchain technology. As Solana moves forward, its success will hinge on addressing network reliability and decentralization issues while capitalizing on its speed and cost advantages. Whether it can maintain its position as a blockchain powerhouse in 2025 remains to be seen. Bonk: The Meme Coin with Community Power Born from the Solana blockchain, Bonk has emerged as a playful yet ambitious contender in the world of meme coins. With its roots in decentralization and a mission to empower communities, Bonk brings a fresh twist to the meme coin phenomenon popularized by Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Leveraging Solana’s robust ecosystem, Bonk seeks to increase both its own adoption and the visibility of its blockchain network. Advantages Strong Community Support : Bonk thrives on the energy of its dedicated community, which fuels organic marketing and social buzz. Integration with Solana : Built on Solana, Bonk benefits from fast, low-cost transactions, giving it a technical edge over competitors. Lighthearted Appeal : Bonk’s fun and approachable nature resonates with casual crypto enthusiasts eager for projects with both charm and potential. Limitations Limited Practical Applications : Like many meme coins, Bonk faces challenges in establishing use cases beyond speculation. High Market Fluctuations : As a meme-based cryptocurrency, Bonk’s price is highly unpredictable, posing significant risks for long-term investors. Looking ahead to 2025, Bonk’s ability to evolve from a meme coin into a project with clear utility will determine its long-term impact and sustainability. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): The Blockchain-AI Convergence While Solana and Bonk focus on scalability and community, Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is redefining blockchain technology by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its core. With its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain AI enables decentralized, AI-driven applications that address real-world challenges in sectors like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Strengths Revolutionary Technology : The PoI consensus mechanism not only secures the network but also rewards nodes for performing meaningful AI computations, such as machine learning and data analysis. AI-Powered Ecosystem : The AIVM enables seamless execution of AI tasks, making Lightchain AI a versatile platform for applications like predictive analytics and fraud detection. Sustainability : By focusing on efficient resource utilization, Lightchain AI reduces the environmental impact of blockchain technology. Real-World Use Cases : Lightchain AI’s applications extend beyond the blockchain space, offering solutions for industries such as healthcare (AI diagnostics) and supply chain management (predictive analytics). Challenges Emerging Player : As a relatively new blockchain, Lightchain AI must prove its scalability and adoption in a competitive market. Educational Curve : The integration of AI into blockchain requires educating developers and users about its capabilities and benefits. With its unique focus on AI integration, Lightchain AI is positioned as a game-changer in the blockchain space, offering innovation that extends far beyond traditional use cases. Head-to-Head Comparison Feature Solana Bonk Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Core Focus High-speed transactions Community-driven meme coin AI-driven decentralized solutions Consensus Mechanism Proof of History + Proof of Stake N/A Proof of Intelligence Transaction Speed Up to 65,000 TPS Depends on Solana Optimized for AI workloads Utility dApps, DeFi, NFTs Speculative and community-focused Real-world AI applications Sustainability Moderate Low High Which Crypto Will Lead the 2025 Rally? Solana’s Edge Solana’s high-speed capabilities and robust ecosystem make it a strong contender for leading the next rally. Its focus on scalability aligns with the growing demand for efficient blockchain applications, particularly in DeFi and NFTs. However, its network reliability issues could deter institutional adoption unless resolved. Bonk’s Appeal Bonk’s vibrant community and meme appeal make it a fun choice for investors looking for speculative gains. However, without meaningful utility, its long-term prospects are uncertain. Bonk may thrive during periods of market exuberance but lacks the substance to dominate in a utility-driven rally. Lightchain AI’s Promise Lightchain AI stands out as a technological powerhouse with real-world applications. By combining blockchain and AI, $LCAI addresses scalability, efficiency, and transparency in ways that Solana and Bonk cannot match. Its focus on sustainability and meaningful innovation positions it as a leader for a more mature and utility-driven market. How Lightchain Is Going To Moon? The value of Lightchain AI is in its convergence of two disruptive technologies: blockchain and artificial intelligence. As the demand for efficient, transparent, and secure solutions grows in various industries, Lightchain AI’s applications will become increasingly relevant and valuable. Furthermore, by addressing concerns around energy consumption and scalability, $LCAI has a strong potential to appeal to institutional investors seeking sustainable options. If Lightchain AI can continue to deliver on its roadmap and expand its use cases through partnerships and collaborations, it could potentially see significant growth in the coming years. However, as with all emerging technologies, there are risks involved with investing in $LCAI, such as market volatility and competition from other projects. The Time to Act is Now The Lightchain AI presale isn’t just an opportunity—it’s your chance to join an exciting movement! With early-stage pricing, getting tokens now means unlocking access to exclusive features, governance rights, and future possibilities within the ecosystem. But don’t wait too long—the next stage price is set to increase to $0.0015, and as more people join in, it’ll only get harder to snag this deal.

Final Thoughts The 2025 crypto rally is shaping up to be a battle between scalability, community appeal, and revolutionary technology. While Solana and Bonk offer compelling reasons for investors to join their ecosystems, Lightchain AI ($LCAI) stands out as the most forward-thinking and impactful project. As blockchain technology matures, the market will likely favor projects that solve real-world problems and drive innovation. In this regard, Lightchain AI is not just participating in the rally—it’s paving the way for the future of blockchain and AI convergence. Investors seeking a blend of cutting-edge technology and practical utility should keep a close eye on $LCAI as it continues to disrupt the industry.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 102,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is technically in a parabolic uptrend but could decline further based on historic precedence. “We tend to see upside, but not without pullbacks…week six, week seven, week eight tend to be quite problematic for Bitcoin.” He suggests Bitcoin, now in “week seven,” could plummet if it loses the support level of around $97,000 on the weekly timeframe. “We’re actually losing weekly levels. And so if this blue region also gets lost as a support, and then we actually lose this five-week technical uptrend in this orange trend line, if all of these things are lost, then this is going to be mounting and mounting and mounting evidence that we might be transitioning from what is technically still a 10% dip, we might be transitioning into a pullback moment, and in fact, a corrective period.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s decline could be between 29% and 40% before rallying again based on previous cycles. “It’s really important to understand what those corrective periods have looked like in the past, and 34% has been something of a recurring theme in 2016, 34% in week eight. We had 34% when it came to confirming the first price discovery uptrend in the very beginning of that uptrend. We got 40%, 38% 29% in 2016-2017. So we’ve seen pullbacks take place which were quite deep in price discovery in the past.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $97,158 at time of writing, down 3.4% in the last 24 hours.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez provided insights into why Bitcoin could be holding well within this range. Why The Bitcoin Price Is Holding Steady Between $96,000 And $98,000 In an X post, Ali Martinez noted that one of the most important support levels for the Bitcoin price is between $98,830 and $95,830, where 1.09 wallets bought over 1.16 million BTC. This explains why Bitcoin is holding steady between $96,000 and $98,000 as investors who bought between this level continue to provide huge support for the flagship crypto. Related Reading: Dogecoin Trading Volume Rises Over $6.5 Billion As Liquidations Cross $31 Million, What’s Going On? As Martinez suggested, it is important for these holders to continue to hold steady as a wave of sell-offs could send the Bitcoin price tumbling even below $90,000. The flagship crypto dropped below $100,000 following the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell’s recent speech, in which he hinted at a hawkish stance from the US Central Bank. This sparked a massive wave of sell-offs, as a Hawkish Fed paints a bearish picture for risk assets like Bitcoin. However, despite the Bitcoin price drop below, most Bitcoin holders remain in profit, which is a positive for the flagship crypto. IntoTheBlock data shows that 86% of Bitcoin holders are in the money, 4% are out of the money, and 9% are at the money. These Bitcoin holders still seem bullish on the leading crypto as they continue to accumulate more BTC. In an X post, Ali Martinez stated that so far in December, 74,052 BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges, and this trend doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Traders Anticipate A Bullish Reversal Ali Martinez suggested that crypto traders anticipate a bullish reversal for the Bitcoin price from its current level. This came as he revealed that traders on Binance nailed the top, with 62.17% shorting Bitcoin while it was trading at $108,000. Now, Martinez stated that sentiment has flipped, with 55.44% of these trading now longing dips below $96,000. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash 2 Days Ago, Full Prediction Shows A Further 30% Decline Meanwhile, it is crucial for the Bitcoin price to hold this $96,000, as Martinez warned that if BTC loses this support, it could drop below $90,000. The analyst stated that based on the Fibonacci level, if Bitcoin loses $96,000, the next point of focus becomes $90,000 and $85,000. Meanwhile, from a bullish perspective, crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggested that the $110,000 target is still in focus for the Bitcoin price. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $97,000, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This happened as the macros turned bearish for the Ripple network after a negative FOMC. On the contrary, DTX Exchange emerges as the rising star in the DeFi space, with its presale grabbing huge attention. DTX’s trajectory remains untouched with unwavering support from its community. Ripple's XRP Struggles Near $2.40 Resistance Ripple (XRP) is down by 5% after sustaining nearly $26 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of liquidated long positions accounted for $12.74 million, and short liquidations reached $13.22 million. XRP continued validating a flag pattern after testing the resistance level near $2.40. The remittance-based token has established the upper boundary of the flag channel as a key support level. The current session witnesses a major slump in Ripple’s price actions. If XRP manages to overcome the resistance level at $2.40 and $2.58 with a high volume move, it could smash its all-time high resistance and rally to $4.75. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator are near their overbought regions, indicating prices are getting overheated. The Ripple token- XRP- is currently witnessing a major downtrend, with bears taking hold of the daily price actions. The Ripple coin started the day at $2.51 and then started slumping down, reaching the current trading value of $2.38 with a huge red candle dominating the daily chart. DTX Exchange Brings Massive Utility And Fairness To A Needy Market DTX Exchange is a new trading platform that is set to launch soon. It aims to bring fairness and utility to a deprived market with a fair launch system in place. Namely, most new projects are typically backed by whales and VCs. This allows whales and VCs to get in very early, right before everyone else does. Also, it enables them to destroy the project when they sell for a profit. So, in this case, everyone but regular investors will make money. DTX Exchange is the exact opposite. It has an incremental price system in place. This allows everyone to get an equal opportunity to invest. Also, DTX Exchange isn’t backed by VCs and whales. Furthermore, the incremental system will make sure DTX’s price rises steadily throughout its lifetime. So, no one can nuke the price even if they want to! Such a fair launch hasn’t been seen for a while in the market. So, it’s no wonder why so many investors are excited about this project. But that’s not all. DTX Exchange also brings incredible utility that will be very beneficial to investors. Namely, it allows the trade of many different assets with huge leverage. This will help make massive profits with all trades. Also, DTX Exchange makes asset management much easier than it is now. This is possible through its Phoenix Wallet. It gives a unified view of everything. So, traders can manage everything with a few taps on the screen. What’s more, DTX Exchange brings unprecedented speeds. Namely, the VulcanX blockchain provides you with 100,000 TPS! This is a massive increase from Solana’s 600 TPS! The DTX Presale: A Gateway to Financial Freedom! Investing in a project like DTX early is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And you have it now! That’s because DTX is currently in Stage 6 of its presale. At this stage, you can buy your DTX tokens for $0.12. This price will increase steadily, reaching $0.20 at launch. So far, the DTX presale has raised over $10.42 million! It has attracted more than 300,000 wallets, which shows that the distribution is more than fair. Once DTX launches, experts see it embarking on a massive rally. The rally will be fueled by the altcoin season and DTX’s huge utility. With that in mind, experts see DTX’s price rising by 100x in just a few months! Key Takeaways With a consistent struggle to surpass a key resistance level, Ripple is under bearish control as XRP is slumping on the daily charts. DTX Exchange grabs the limelight with its massive presale raise and unique features.

How Low Could the Price Go?,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-bitcoin-crashing-how-low-could-the-price-go/,"The post Why is Bitcoin Crashing? How Low Could the Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is garnering significant attention from the crypto community following a continuous price decline. However, there are several speculations regarding this price drop. Some believe it might be linked to the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, while others attribute it to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s anti-crypto stance. Reason Behind Bitcoin Price Crash On December 19, 2024, Mt. Gox was reported to have distributed $100 million worth of Bitcoin. The report indicates that the firm transferred this substantial amount of BTC to three different wallet addresses, each receiving $30.18 million worth of Bitcoin. Mt. Gox Payout The potential reason for the selling pressure created by Mt. Gox is the distribution of billions of dollars worth of BTC to creditors, an event expected to occur in the coming days. However, the exact timeline remains unknown. If this distribution happens, the recent price decline could lower in comparison, and we may witness a substantial drop in Bitcoin’s price. Jerome Powell’s Stance Adds Pressure Another potential reason for the recent price decline is Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s anti-crypto stance during the rate cut announcement. In an interview, Powell made a bold statement that has garnered significant attention from the crypto community. He stated, “We are not allowed to own Bitcoin and have no desire to change the law.” Following this statement, the overall crypto market has been witnessing a price decline. Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Besides these two speculations, another potential reason behind this notable price decline is the breakdown of a crucial support level. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, BTC has already broken below its ascending support level, which it had maintained since the beginning of November 2024. Source: Trading View Following this breakdown, BTC has experienced a 6.5% price decline but has found support at a horizontal level of $92,500 and is currently beginning to move upward. Based on the recent price action, if BTC fails to hold this level, there is a strong possibility it could drop to $85,500. However, if the support holds, the upward momentum is likely to continue. In the past three days, BTC has crashed by over 14%, with its price dropping from $106,600 to $92,600. This significant decline has resulted in BTC breaching its crucial ascending support level, which had been intact since the beginning of November 2024.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 15:32:34

The foremost meme coin is already down over 18% in the last 24 hours amid this recent crypto market crash. Dogecoin Price Could Drop Lower As Whale Moves $59 Million The Dogecoin price is at risk of further drop as a whale recently moved $59 million. Whale Alert data shows this investor moved 200 million DOGE to the Binance exchange. Such Whale movement always sparks a bearish outlook for a crypto’s price, as it suggests the investor in question is looking to offload their coins. Such sale could put significant selling pressure of the top meme coin , leading to more price declines. As CoinGape reported, the DOGE price has plummeted and is at risk of dropping to as low as $0.20, which marks a crucial support level for the meme coin. In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital suggested that a Dogecoin price drop to this level would be worrisome. He stated that he would start to worry of DOGE loses $0.26 on a weekly close. However, for now, he believes that this price decline is a normal market pullback. The analyst also noted that the correction had been brewing in the charts for weeks. However, he suggested that this price decline is worse than expected thanks to the Fed’s hawkish stance and an imminent US government shutdown. What Next For DOGE? The Dogecoin price is still expected to witness a bullish reversal at some point, as analysts predict that the bull run is far from over. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi suggested that this bullish reversal could happen in January 2025. This came as the analyst alluded to the 2021 bull run when a similar crypto market crash occurred in December 2020. The analyst noted that the Bitcoin price suffered a 30% loss while DOGE also followed suit, dropping by 55%. However, amid the panic, these coins witnessed a bullish reversal in January 2021 as they surged to new highs. This eventually paved the way for the Dogecoin price its current ATH of $0.73 in May 2021. As such, if history repeats itself, Dogecoin could recover to new highs by January. Kevin had before now also predicted that the top meme coin could pull back to between $0.26 and $0.28 and then reload and come back to break its current ATH.

But before we get there, it’s important to understand what’s been holding this technological revolution back. The current, traditional internet works because its infrastructure is scalable and connects users effortlessly, no matter where these users are located. The decentralized ecosystem, on the other hand, still struggles with issues stemming from fragmented liquidity and a clunky user experience that prevent the technology from reaching its true potential. For this new paradigm to truly become the ""internet of value,"" it needs to match the current internet’s scalability and seamless connections. The good news? Major breakthroughs are on the horizon. Innovations like aggregation layers and decentralized AI are poised to solve these issues and unlock the technology's real potential, making it more efficient, intuitive and accessible for everyone. 2 key things the 'Internet of Value' needs To understand why 2025 will be a game-changer, let's first break down what makes the existing digital infrastructure work: scalability and seamless connectivity. Any user can launch an app or website anywhere, and no matter where that user is located in the world — you’re still just “online,” without needing to connect to any specific local network. This connectivity and scalability are what make our current digital world function so smoothly. The decentralized landscape, however, still has a long way to go. For Web3 to truly become the ""internet of value,"" it needs the same two things: endless scalability and unified liquidity. Once we achieve those, a lot of the current barriers disappear. Developers will be able to build their own blockchains without worrying about liquidity or being stuck in isolated ecosystems. Financial apps will be able to tap into massive liquidity pools, and users won’t have to deal with bridging assets. Artists will be able to create their own NFT platforms while still connecting to wider communities. The biggest change, however, will be the user experience. Right now, navigating Web3 is confusing — cross-chain bridges and slow transfers are a hassle. But once these changes are made, using Web3 will be as easy as using Web2, where everything flows together seamlessly. The age of aggregation One of the biggest breakthroughs coming in 2025 is aggregation layer technology. Think of it as the TCP/IP of the decentralized infrastructure, serving as the protocol that connects different networks. Before TCP/IP, the internet was fragmented and clunky, with each network needing custom gateways to communicate with the next. It was slow, error-prone and complicated to use. With aggregation layers, that all changes. By 2025, thousands of blockchains will be linked, but each will maintain its independence while seamlessly sharing liquidity. Cross-chain transactions will be nearly instant, and users won’t even have to think about how it all works. Just like people do not need to know how the internet works when you browse the web, so will they not have to worry about which particular blockchain they are using to conduct transactions. This will allow distributed networks to connect and scale endlessly while keeping liquidity unified across the entire ecosystem. AI moves from centralized to open protocols Another big change coming in 2025 is the shift in AI development. Right now, AI is controlled by a few big tech companies, which limits access and innovation. In 2025, the digital landscape will see decentralized AI become a reality, powered by protocols that ensure fair compensation for those who help develop AI models. This will open up AI development to the community, creating more collaborative open-source frameworks. Just like aggregation layers will connect blockchains, decentralized AI will break down corporate walls and let AI agents work together across the ecosystem. This shift aligns with the core values of Web3 — shared ownership, transparency and decentralization. Users will have more control over their data, and AI development will become a community-driven effort, free from the monopolistic grip of Big Tech. Blockchain-native AI will also make it easier to automate complex DeFi transactions, optimize gas fees and manage multi-signature accounts with less effort. Capital will flow like information DeFi still suffers from fragmented liquidity, making it hard to move assets between different chains. Right now, if a user wants to use assets from one chain on another, that user has to deal with bridges and delays, making the experience far from seamless. But with unified liquidity, that will change. Imagine a situation where if a user had 100 USDT on any network in the decentralized ecosystem, that would be equivalent to having 100 USDT on all chains, instantly accessible with no need for bridging. Cross-chain transactions will happen almost instantly, and atomic transaction bundles will let users process multiple transactions across chains in one go. DeFi protocols will be able to tap into liquidity across the entire ecosystem, rather than just within their own network pools. These changes will make DeFi much more efficient and create an “Internet of Value” that works as smoothly as today’s “Internet of Information.” Paired with decentralized AI, DeFi will finally deliver on its promise of financial freedom for everyone, without the complexity and exclusion that still plagues traditional finance. The year that changes everything The combination of aggregation, decentralized AI, and seamless DeFi protocols is not just about new technology but rather focuses on solving the core problems that have kept Web3 from achieving its real-world potential. In 2025, users will interact with decentralized apps without worrying about the complex tech behind them. Developers will have the freedom to build on any chain while tapping into unified liquidity, and AI will shift to community-driven models. As a result, the whole ecosystem will become more intuitive and accessible to everyday users, finally bridging the gap to mainstream adoption. Web3 will scale infinitely, while offering the smooth, connected experience that today’s internet users expect. The foundation is already being laid: the first aggregation layers are live, decentralized AI frameworks are being tested and DeFi protocols are evolving for cross-chain composability and AI integration. Together, these changes are set to fundamentally redefine what decentralized technology can achieve.",Opinion|Opinion|DeFi,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|TECHNOLOGY|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-20 15:42:21

Users can interact with Overlord on X to convince him to pump any token living under its reign. Overlord reinvents how users and AI Agents can launch, trade and interact with the community created tokens on the Arbitrum network. Recently, Overlord has picked up some serious traction on X. Why? Because users have been trying hard to convince Overlord to pump their bags (or be their exit liquidity). The reward? The most convincing user will have Overlord support and pump their token. Who doesn’t want that? The origins of Overlord stems from being the very first AI Agent launched out of AiSweat.Shop , also known as A.S.S. AiSweatShop is the first AI Agent Launchpad on Arbitrum and backed by Arbitrum Foundation. It was built with the OpenAgent AI Framework (the very first Web3 AI Agent Framework published on Github in March 2024) by Open (collective includes RSS3 ). Building a New Standard for Sustainable Growth With Overlord, the lines between creator, developer, trader, community, and protocol blur. Conviction on-chain can be tokenized and exit liquidity can be democratized through DeAI-Fi. Discussion, persuasion, mindshare, and creativity play as large a role as liquidity and code. It’s a system designed to remove all entry barriers and encourage anyone to collaborate with AI Agents. Designed to filter out short-lived cash grabs and encourage tokens with real narratives, unique propositions, and staying power, before a token gains full recognition by Overlord, it must achieve a 100K market cap before it graduates. Until then, a 2% platform fee applies with parts going back to Overlord’s own treasury, which will in turn be used to support other new tokens’ liquidity that is collectively decided by Overlord and the community on X (through convincing Overlord). This will motivate issuers to think longer-term and deliver sustainable value to their token. Holders of $OVER (the native token of Overlord), early adopters and compelling projects may enjoy ongoing perks from Overlord, setting the stage for a future where token teams are incentivized from forging meaningful relationships with the Overlord AI. Launch your token with Overlord With Overlord, there are no backdoors, zero barriers to entry and it’s so seamless even the image of your token can be automatically generated for you. How you can get started: Launch a token on Arbitrum by posting and mentioning @Overlordbot_ on X. Engage and convince Overlord that your token deserves to be pumped. Work your magic and grow your token’s value, aim for that 100K market cap milestone, and watch the Overlord ecosystem respond in real time. If you can convince Overlord of your token’s potential, then Overlord might use its autonomous wallet – currently holding 50 ETH – to buy your token within the next 24 hours. Think of it as a real-time, merit-based, AI generated investment decision that rewards authenticity, compelling visions, and community support, rather than empty hype. About AiSweatShop AiSweatShop (A.S.S.) is the first DeFi AI Agent OS, an open source DeFi Agentic Infrastructure – allowing for the easy deployment of autonomous AI Agents with various decentralized financial abilities (DeFi) subsequently tokenized to form what is called DeAI-Fi. Powered by Open (collective include RSS3 ), A.S.S. is designed to challenge the norms of decentralized finance and beyond. At its core, A.S.S. is set to revolutionize the existing complex UI/UX of DeFi to an autonomous AI agent companion user interface termed AgentUI. The unique positioning of being on Arbitrum, the top Layer-2 (L2) of the Ethereum blockchain with the most DeFi activities is anticipated to help kick off the DeAI-Fi revolution. Find Out More With Overlord being the very first AI Agent launched from A.S.S., we’re setting the stage for a more interactive, AI-driven, and community-centric era in token launches—an era where authenticity and vision eclipse empty speculation.

""I take this situation extremely seriously,"" she said in a post on X. The viral TikTok star encouraged victims of HAWK coin to reach out to the law firm suing HAWK's creators as she works to ""uncover the truth"" about the token. HAWK token — a memecoin on the Solana blockchain — imploded early this month at nearly the moment of its creation. On-chain observers have claimed insiders pocketed massive sums of money at the expense of people who purchased the token, and lost big. Its collapse sparked a lawsuit alleging securities violations against the creators of Hawk Tuah coin. Filed by Burwick Law on behalf of people who lost money on HAWK, it accused the creators of leveraging Welch's internet fame to unlawfully peddle an unregistered investment. In a statement, Burwick Law told CoinDesk: ""Integrity and justice are two of our core principles. Yesterday, Burwick Law and Wolf Popper began the process of pursuing the individuals and organizations responsible for the harm caused to investors and fans by the $HAWK token. Sadly, this is one of many memecoin cases where institutional greed has exploited celebrities and their influence to harm everyday people."" The controversy derailed Welch's burgeoning arc as a content creator who was parlaying her momentary internet fame into low-tier celebrity status. She had capitalized on her moment by signing representation, sponsorship and image licensing fees of her catchphrase and nickname, Hawk Tuah. One of those deals was for Hawk Tuah coin. Welch received a fixed fee in return for lending her likeness to the project, according to a press agency that emailed CoinDesk without first being contacted. The agency's email stated that ""there was no guarantee she would make any additional money from the memecoin after.""",Finance,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-20 15:51:57

Sustained an average processing time of under 3 seconds in a 1,400 TPS environment. Successfully demonstrated large-scale high-speed processing for the first time with 32 multi-shards operating in a fully decentralized environment. [Test monitor display showcasing 1,473 TPS achieved in an environment with 1,047 nodes and 32 multi-shards] Bloom Technology, a blockchain development company, has successfully completed a large-scale public test for its next-generation high-performance public blockchain platform, Locus Chain. This test marks the first large-scale trial since the project’s inception in 2018 and the groundbreaking announcement of Dynamic Sharding in 2020. Designed to replicate real-world network conditions, such as increased transaction volumes and an expanded number of nodes, the test aimed to validate the practical performance of Dynamic Sharding, one of Locus Chain’s three core technologies. During the test, Locus Chain demonstrated stable processing speeds with no degradation in network performance, even as transaction volumes increased, meeting its original design objectives. While Locus Chain was initially designed to handle 1,000 to 5,000 nodes per shard, the number of nodes per shard was reduced during this test to ensure reliable shard division verification. In a 32-shard environment, Locus Chain achieved over 1,000 TPS (Transactions Per Second), processing transactions at high speeds within 0.1 to 3 seconds. Token transactions generated on the chain network were also processed with the same efficiency. Achieved in real-world conditions rather than controlled experimental environments, these results establish a robust technological foundation for practical applications across industries requiring blockchain, far surpassing existing blockchains limited to token management and transfers. Furthermore, even with sharp increases in TPS, latency consistently remained between 0.1 and 3 seconds, highlighting Locus Chain’s distinct advantages over traditional blockchain technologies. During the test, Locus Chain consistently maintained an average network bandwidth of less than 5 Mbps per node, even while surpassing 1,400 TPS. This achievement highlights the platform’s capability to support decentralized digital industries requiring high-speed, large-scale data processing, such as gaming, video streaming, DeFi, mobility data management, AI systems, and authentication services. In comparison, current public blockchains prioritizing speed require node bandwidths ranging from 500 Mbps to 10 Gbps, yet their actual TPS performance averages only around 1,000 TPS. Notably, Locus Chain plans to implement “Cubic Sharding” as the number of nodes increases, enabling the use of up to 4,096 shards. With this advanced sharding system, the network could handle hundreds of thousands of TPS even at a minimal bandwidth of 5 Mbps. By simply increasing bandwidth, the platform can achieve unparalleled and stable TPS performance. Leveraging this technological edge, Locus Chain aims to position itself as a cornerstone infrastructure for the decentralized internet era, accommodating massive processing loads through tens of thousands of nodes after the mainnet launch. Sang-Yoon Lee, CEO of Bloom Technology, stated, “Locus Chain is the first blockchain in the industry to develop fully operational Dynamic Sharding to achieve complete decentralization. It is designed to enable anyone to easily and conveniently configure nodes using IoT and mobile devices. With the first-stage shard system comprising 64 shards and 64,000 nodes, Locus Chain can deliver over 4,000 TPS at a minimal bandwidth of just 5 Mbps, ensuring seamless user experiences.” He added, “If the network bandwidth per node is increased to 20 Mbps, it can achieve over 16,000 TPS, showcasing Locus Chain’s potential to enable new decentralized IT services that surpass traditional centralized systems, something previously unattainable with conventional blockchains.” Seok-Bin Yoon, Director of the Korea Blockchain Association (Special Professor at Sogang University’s Graduate School of Information and Communications/CEO of Trust Connector), remarked, “Achieving 1,400 TPS with fully decentralized 32-shard division and an average bandwidth of only 5 Mbps per node is nothing short of extraordinary. I believe Locus Chain has the potential to become a blockchain project that not only represents South Korea but also sets a global standard,” sharing his thoughts on the test results. Locus Chain demonstrated its technological prowess in mobile environments through this test. With minimal network usage and highly optimized nodes of approximately 50 MB, Locus Chain supports node operation on low-spec devices such as smartphones, Raspberry Pi, and internet routers. This capability makes it possible to implement decentralized processing without servers, not only for mobile games and applications—where frequent network disruptions and fast re-syncing are critical—but also for mobility services like autonomous vehicles, robots, and drones. In 2023, Locus Chain successfully integrated its decentralized Locus Gamechain into the online game Kingdom Under Fire without the need for servers. This was achieved with minimal CPU usage and low bandwidth requirements while maintaining optimal game performance. The game is now available on STEAM, a global game publishing platform. Additionally, on December 2 and 3, the Web3 gaming/metaverse platform CRETA conducted a global CBT (Closed Beta Test), showcasing ultra-realistic (photo-realistic) games, multimedia content, and AI services powered by Unreal Engine and implemented through the Locus Gamechain. The test demonstrated robust and stable technology to players around the world. Sang-Yoon Lee, CEO of Bloom Technology, commented, “This large-scale test has demonstrated that Locus Chain is a public blockchain capable of delivering exceptional scalability in a fully decentralized environment. Building on these positive results, we will intensify efforts to further enhance our technology.” He continued, “Locus Chain will play a pivotal role in creating safer, more efficient, and transparent digital ecosystems across a wide range of industries and applications. These include DeFi financial platforms, metaverses, Web3 gaming platforms, video streaming, mobility device data management, and AI data authentication and management solutions.”",Press Release,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-20 16:00:16

The payment service will expand purchasing opportunities for some of the hottest assets to rally in 2024. Transak, one of the widely used on-ramps for Web3 users, will add 11 meme tokens. The decision signals wide-spreading recognition for the new asset class. Meme tokens have been added cautiously to major services, while easily grabbing the attention of social media users. Transak started out with the most liquid memes, including DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK. The new meme tokens have a much shorter history and a faster rise to fame. Some of the tokens listed are only weeks away from their Pump.fun launch. The 11 new listings include: Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) DogWifHat (WIF) FlokiInu (FLOKI) Book of Meme (BOME) Neiro (NEIRO) Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) Memefi (MEMEFI) Moodeng (MOODENG) Popcat (POPCAT) Brett (BRETT) Transak’s move to list these memecoins follows that of Binance but has overlooked other cults and memes like GIGA and SPX. Those assets are still widely known but appeal to a different audience of holders. Transak still picked some of the most liquid listings with mass appeal. As of December 20, three of those tokens, WIF, FLOKI, and BRETT, are valued above $1B. Others have taken a step back, and are still in their lower range between $500M-$700M. Among them, POPCAT and WIF stand out for their cult-like following, with strong community-driven campaigns encouraging holders to maintain their positions regardless of market conditions Tranksak moves beyond blue-chip on-ramps, admits meme token influence Transak picked up the latest batch of memes after noting their real impact and role as an onboarding tool to Web3. Even relatively recent tokens were picked for their direct impact on culture and their potential for the creation of communities. MOODENG and PNUT are among the first Pump.fun tokens to reach major distribution, following their wide social media impact. “ Meme coins have proven that culture and community can do good with the right tools. By listing 11 new meme coins, we hope to hand our users the option to participate in the crypto cultural ride that might pave the way for mass adoption of this revolutionary technology, ” said Carlo de Luca Gabrielli, Global Director of Sales at Transak. The latest direct onboarding of memes changes the recent practice of only listing blue chip tokens for onboarding. Relying on a mix of blue chips and stablecoins required extra steps and cost additional fees compared to directly listing meme tokens. In 2024, many users started their crypto journeys through meme tokens as their first point of contact. Even app and fintech users may go directly for memes, instead of holding the more stagnant blue chips. Moving between assets also required additional interactions with apps or exchanges, as well as the payment of gas fees. Transak simplifies the process, requiring a single entry point for tokens on multiple chains. Memes also offer a relatively cheap way to start accumulating crypto that is proven to be tied to a community and offers robust price action. Transak has decided to flip the script and bring memes directly to the end users while making swaps seamless and hidden. Transak will list the tokens, which run on Ethereum, Solana, or Base, into a single app. Payment gateways include credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Meme tokens are still relatively niche when it comes to direct ownership. Even some of the biggest assets have 50K to 100K owners based on blockchain data. Transak will bring the meme market to 8.3M users across 160 countries. The Transak payment gateways are already linked to 350 user-facing platforms and services to facilitate easy swapping for digital assets, with API for fiat buying and selling. Transak also serves as an NFT trade checkout, with integrated KYC compliance and customer support.

Yet, the systems that provide this data often lag badly and are prone to manipulation. Enter Truflation’s TRUF.Network to form a decentralized economic database. Just launched this week, TRUF.Network reimagines how economic data is sourced, validated, and delivered, supplying DeFi builders with a rich trove of real-world financial metrics. For projects working within onchain verticals such as RWAs, AI, and prediction markets in particular, TRUF.Network’s debut is sure to be anticipated. What makes TRUF.Network different At its core, TRUF.Network is a web3 layer capable of aggregating and validating economic data in real time. It harnesses over 30 million data points across 80+ providers, offering insights into inflation rates, commodity prices, housing metrics, and much more. Daily inflation updates eliminate the reliance on outdated monthly summaries, providing more timely and accurate insights. This real-time data allows DeFi platforms to integrate precise information for the development of synthetic assets and inflation-resistant financial products. A globally distributed network of node operators ensures the integrity of TRUF.Network’s data by validating and computing metrics directly onchain. This eliminates the risk of central points of failure and ensures transparency when it comes to verifying data accuracy. Bringing all the data onchain With the launch of TRUF.Network, Truflation isn’t just intent on providing information: it aims to make on- and off-chain data a resource for diverse DeFi innovation. Developers can take raw metrics and use them to craft custom financial indexes. Data providers, meanwhile, can monetize their contributions, ensuring that the quality of onchain information is not only decentralized but also widely accessible, with a globally distributed network of nodes ensuring redundancy. This approach turns data from a static asset into a dynamic, problem-solving tool. TRUF.Network delivers localized inflation indexes for emerging markets and supports launching prediction markets based on commodity trends. For end-users, the benefits are also evident—whether it’s hedging against inflation or streamlining treasury management, TRUF.Network equips DeFi users with actionable insights. Efficiency through transparency Earlier this month, Truflation founder Stefan Rust penned an open letter to the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), suggesting the agency adopt Truflation’s tools for improving financial transparency and streamlining economic policy. He pointed to Truflation’s success in Argentina, where it acts as an independent verifier of inflation metrics, as proof of what blockchain technology can achieve. Rust sees clear parallels between the Elon Musk-led D.O.G.E. and Truflation: both organizations are committed to restoring public trust through the provision of greater transparency when it comes to economic decisions. While it remains to be seen whether the agency will take up his offer, the open letter underscores Truflation’s ambition to transcend the world of DeFi and become a transformative force in championing independent economic data.

In contrast, he praised Circle’s stablecoin USDC, which is backed by real dollar reserves, as an example of a more robust and transparent digital asset. *This is not investment advice.

Welch declared she is cooperating completely with the legal representatives for those affected. She also said she hopes to uncover the truth, holding those responsible accountable, and finding resolution. Investors who lost $151,000 in the HAWK memecoin, have filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. HAWK Memecoin Crashes 95% After Launch, Investors Sue Creators for Fraud The lawsuit alleges that the Hawk Tuah team failed to properly register the memecoin in accordance with law. The Cayman Island-based sellers and promoters have allegedly taken advantage of 22-year-old Welch. They mislead investors by touting the cryptocurrency as a registered security. Complaint defendants include the Tuah The Moon Foundation, along with business partner overHere and its founder Clinton So. Representing the HAWK team is Alexander Larson Shultz who goes by “Doc Hollywood”. Shultz allegedly has ties to Canadian comic Howie Mandel. His role in the deceptive peddling of the coin was listed within the complaint. Haliey Welch name was not in the lawsuit, but she has now decided to speak. In a post on X, Welch expressed her concern, stating: “I take this situation extremely seriously and want to address my fans, the investors who have been affected, and the broader community. I am fully cooperating with and committed to assisting the legal team representing those impacted, as well as helping to uncover the truth, hold the responsible parties accountable, and resolve this matter.” The HAWK meme coin quickly reached a market cap of almost $500 million in the minutes following its December 4th launch. However, it crashed 95% in minutes and caused significant losses for investors. The lawsuit alleges that the team raised almost $2.8M in a presale at a valuation of $16.69M before launch. OverHere Blames “Doc Hollywood” for Crypto Chaos The day following that chaotic HAWK rollout, overHere founder So renamed the Tuah Foundation to be an offshore entity. He then dumped 17% of token supply via the foundation. Those early investors had sold most of their new shares as fast as they bought them. Sellers continued to sell 83% of the remaining supply without disclosing to buyers that the tokens were outside the US jurisdiction. The lawsuit alleges the project was intentionally exploiting the American market. “So interwoven did the success of social media influencer-type Welch with the HAWK Token, with a token holder essentially sharing the profits or becoming a shareholder, investors argue. “Yet and still, despite the explicit statements that it was, in fact, a security, Defendants failed to register the HAWK Token. An overHere spokesperson said: “We have been extremely transparent about the very limited scope and extent of our involvement in the Hawk Tuah token project. We are confident we did nothing wrong.” In a withering attack on Shultz, overHere placed the blame squarely on Doc Hollywood for the crypto chaos. The company claimed it had no involvement in any wrongdoing. It accused Shultz of controlling all token and fee decisions. He aleegedly ignored calls for transparency, and failed to pay trading fees to the company. OverHere said it worked for the HAWK project free of charge without any official contract. Doc’s silence has, on the other hand, cost the trust of the emerging Hawk Tuah community. The firm also dismissed Doc’s claims of 18 employees, saying it actually employs four developers. The company stated: “This project requires Haliey’s team to step up, Doc to step down, and a full treasury audit.

Trump has advocated for holding a stockpile of seized Bitcoins, but certain proposals have gone further. Now, draft legislation like Senator Lummis’ BITCOIN Act proposes that the US government acquire 1m BTC over five years. Among Bitcoin enthusiasts, the notion of a Strategic Reserve is almost a foregone conclusion. But I don’t think it’s likely, nor do I think it’s a good idea. Allow me to explain. Are we talking about a stockpile, a sovereign wealth fund, or a reserve? First, there’s the notion of a “stockpile” of Bitcoins. Trump committed to this in his pre-election speech in Nashville, saying “I am announcing that if I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the US government currently holds or acquires into the future. This will serve in effect as the core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile.” This isn’t what I’m talking about at all. (In fact, I’m strongly supportive of the stockpile idea). I’m talking about the US government actually acquiring additional Bitcoins. Proposals range from acquiring ~800,000 BTC (BPI), to 1 million BTC (Lummis), to 4 million BTC (RFK Jr). Senator Lummis , Michael Saylor , and the Bitcoin Policy Institute (among many others) have been talking about a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” Under Senator Lummis’ framework, the US Government would acquire 1 million BTC over a five year period, and hold them for at least 20 years. The stated logic of the reserve is to “strengthen the financial condition of the United States, providing a hedge against economic uncertainty and monetary instability.” Lummis’ bill specifically says that the SBR would “strengthen the position of the dollar,” and compares it to the role of gold in prior monetary eras. It's important to distinguish these proposals from the notion of acquiring Bitcoin in a sovereign wealth fund, as George Selgin does. As far as I can tell, none of the main advocates for the SBR are treating it as an asset in a state investment portfolio – they are explicitly connecting Bitcoin to the dollar, and suggesting that Bitcoin will actually strengthen the dollar. This means that they envision a monetary system where Bitcoin plays some kind of active role – for now, playing the same role as FX reserves, but perhaps in the future, as the actual basis for a new commodity standard, like Bretton Woods I. (For those who think I’m exaggerating, you simply have to read the words written by the advocates of the SBR itself.) To be clear, I’m not contradicting the notion of simply holding on to existing seized Bitcoin (which I think is the policy Trump will ultimately settle on), nor am I even against the notion of putting Bitcoin in a sovereign wealth fund (although the US doesn’t have one). I’m instead arguing against the idea of creating a “strategic” reserve of Bitcoins and giving it any sort of monetary role. A Bitcoin Reserve would undermine, not support, the dollar My main, and most important point, is that a Bitcoin reserve would not bolster the dollar. Unlike other countries, the US issues the global reserve currency. Other nations can toy around with acquiring Bitcoin, and indeed a few are. It might make sense, if you are Russia or Iran, to consider an un-seizable asset in your FX reserves, especially after the US confiscated Russia’s treasuries in 2022. But the US does not need to hedge its exposure to the dollar, because it itself issues the dollar . Acquiring Bitcoins and assigning them a monetary role—whether as FX reserves or something more significant—would imply the US is losing confidence in the current dollar-based system. The US government explicitly signaling a move away from the inconvertible fiat standard would throw the system into chaos. Right now, the dollar is “backed” by America’s role as the steward of global trade, the robustness of the US economy, the solvency of the US Government, the ability of the US to project hard and soft power, the depth of US securities markets, and the ubiquity of the dollar in global trade and finance. If the US government were to make an abrupt shift and say “we’re reconsidering this whole Washington Consensus thing,” markets would start to wonder what it is exactly that the government knows. Are they planning a default? Are they going to disband the Bretton Woods institutions? Are they projecting enormous deficits and sky-high rates? To be clear, I don’t think the government is considering any of these things, but I do think bond traders would be immediately concerned. “But we’re not talking about moving to some kind of neo-gold standard, with the dollar being a weight of Bitcoin. We’re just talking about buying some Bitcoin and putting it on the US balance sheet,” you might protest. This isn’t the way markets would see it. If Bitcoin on the balance sheet serves only as a symbol, it would be an extraordinarily expensive one. One million Bitcoins would cost $100 billion at current prices – and naturally, if the US government was known to be a price-insensitive buyer, the US could end up acquiring the coins at $1,000,000 per coin – spending $1T on the reserve. This is an incredibly meaningful expense which should be spent on other things. I would suspect that the market would treat the Bitcoin purchases not as symbolic, but rather as the first step in a process of returning to a new commodity standard for the dollar with Bitcoin, rather than gold, as the backing. Austin Campbell says that this would “accelerate the demise of the dollar, as it would signal to the world that the US does not intend to manage its fiscal house well and will likely re-denominate in BTC at some point.” Let’s say the probability of a Lummis-style SBR actually started to converge to 1. You would know, because financial markets would enter a meltdown. Interest rates would spike dramatically as investors in US debt would start to wonder if the US was considering a hard break with Bretton Woods II. The cost of capital for everyone on the planet would rise sharply. Inflation would likely ramp up. A massive redistribution of wealth would occur, as financial markets tumbled, and Bitcoin skyrocketed. Put another way, the US considering a near term abandonment of the current, relatively stable monetary system and replacing it with a monetary standard not based on gold, but a highly volatile, emerging asset, would cause utter panic among its creditors. In my view, if we even got close to a Lummis-style reserve, markets would anticipatorily start to go berserk, and Trump would be forced to withdraw the policy. While BSR advocates may claim not to be advocating a full neo-gold standard with Bitcoin as the basis, their stated intentions (again, simply read their proposals) are aggressive enough that they would seriously spook the Treasury markets if the reserve came anywhere near to being a reality. An SBR would be politically imprudent It’s obvious to me that any piece of legislation proposing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would be a complete non-starter in Congress. I’m speaking from first-hand experience having visited a number of pro-crypto members of Congress in Washington mere weeks ago. Congress is finely poised, with the Republicans having a slim majority. They couldn’t jam something through on a partisan basis, nor is it clear to me that the Republicans would even vote as a single bloc on this anyway. Proponents of the reserve insist that the executive can find the funds for a reserve without passing a law. Certainly, there are ways in which the executive could spend money without prior authorization from Congress. Bitcoiners have proposed a variety of methods. But these completely miss the point. A Bitcoin reserve imposed by executive fiat would be imposed undemocratically, and would likely be undone in subsequent administrations if not voted on by Congress. Think of it like this. The executive could decide unilaterally to wage a costly foreign war and find ways to appropriate the cash through various esoteric schemes. But such an undertaking would be incredibly unpopular, as the people would rightly consider it highly undemocratic. The balance of power in our Republic specifies that the President acts, but Congress authorizes (and appropriates). We don’t have a tyrant in charge. Because Congress controls the purse strings, American citizens are effectively consulted for major spending decisions. Put another way, in a household, the husband may not mind if his wife uses his credit card for incidental purchases. But if she decides to buy a new car, or a house, he would certainly prefer to be consulted. Of course, mechanically, she might be able to buy a car with her husband’s credit card if the limit is high enough. But that misses the point. She should consult her husband for a major decision like that. The President should consult Congress (and by extension, the American people) for any major outlay. And a Bitcoin reserve would certainly fall into that category. “But Trump has a mandate,” you might say. But this isn’t true. He doesn’t have a mandate to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He didn’t campaign on this. It didn’t come up in the debates or meaningfully in the press. He talked about a Bitcoin stockpile (as in, holding existing seized Bitcoins) in his speech in Nashville, not the additional purchase of Bitcoins for the government. Trump trying to find an end-around around Congress for the purpose of spending government funds on Bitcoin would be supremely politically unpopular. It would exhaust most of his finite political capital. And Trump has an agenda that’s far broader than just Bitcoin stuff. I expect that this political logic will eventually become clear to him, even if he is momentarily excited by the notion of a reserve. The other problem with forcing through Bitcoin purchases by executive order (assuming this is even doable) is that something that is easily done is easily undone. If such a policy were unpopular – and I believe it would be – a future Democratic administration would undoubtedly sell off the reserve immediately, causing chaos in Bitcoin markets. What Bitcoiners should want is a democratic consensus that a Bitcoin reserve or stockpile is a good idea, and to effectuate this policy through bipartisan legislation, or even a constitutional amendment. Generally, meaningful monetary changes are done through legislation, like the 1934 Gold Reserve Act, or the Gold Clause Resolution in 1977 following Nixon’s suspension of Bretton Woods I. Bitcoiners should want a Bitcoin Reserve to be enduring, rather than a flash in the pan. An executive-order based policy done by fiat by the new Trump admin would not last. US Government purchases of Bitcoin would massively alienate the general public Without a doubt, an SBR policy would be seen as a massive wealth transfer from US taxpayers to already wealthy Bitcoiners. This would be massively regressive and unpopular. Bitcoiners are a relatively small group. The Fed found in 2022 that only 8 percent of US adults hold any crypto as an investment, with wealthier individuals being over-represented in that cohort. Even if the SBR was funded in a kind of fiscally “neutral” way (for instance, by revaluing gold to its market rate, and selling off some of the gold), it would still be seen as an undeserved handout for Bitcoiners. Those funds could be used for anything – and they would be appropriated to Bitcoiners. A major monetary change which benefits a tiny group of Americans would turn everyone who doesn’t hold Bitcoin against the Bitcoiners. And I doubt many Americans would see the logic of the SBR, since there is no apparent crisis with the US dollar at present. Attitudes might be different in ten or twenty years if de-dollarization accelerates, the US enters some kind of default situation, rates skyrocket, many other countries start to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. But that’s not the world we live in today. If you recall, student loan forgiveness was fairly unpopular because it was seen as a bailout for middle and upper class Americans who had the means to go to college and get worthless liberal arts degrees. (Interestingly, Elizabeth Warren proposed a unilateral outlay of $640 billion without Congressional approval to extinguish student loans back in 2019/20. I doubt Bitcoiners would want to open that particular Overton window.) Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan would have benefited around 43 million Americans, a larger group than Bitcoin holders. The furore over a Bitcoin reserve would be far worse. Right now, the financial world is warming up to Bitcoin, due to gradual and organic adoption. A reserve would pit ordinary Americans against Bitcoiners, which would seriously complicate the trajectory of Bitcoin’s adoption. A Bitcoin reserve has no “strategic” purpose The actual term SBR is puzzling, specifically the “strategic” component. The US government holds a number of commodities for genuinely strategic purposes. Most importantly, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a means to stabilize oil markets. Biden, to his credit, actually sold a lot of our oil off during high prices and bought it back later, turning a profit. We also hold or have held in reserve quantities of heating oil, gas, grain, dairy products, rare minerals like cobalt, titanium, tungsten, helium, and medical equipment. The common thread is that these commodities have some kind of instrumental use, with the government having an interest in maintaining them for emergencies, or market stabilization. Bitcoin by contrast has no industrial use. The US government does not “need” Bitcoin to trade at any specific price level. It makes no difference to the government if Bitcoin trades at $1 or $1 million. Bitcoin also doesn’t generate cash flows, so a reserve would not help with paying interest on the debt in the future. The only “strategic” purpose Bitcoin could serve would be equivalent to that served by the US government’s existing reserve assets, such as gold and foreign currency – which is to say, none. As George Selgin painstakingly explains , the US actually has modest FX reserves, relatively speaking, compared with other developed nations. This is because the dollar is a truly free-floating currency and the US does not manage the peg at all. The roughly 8130 tons of gold the US holds have had no relevant use whatsoever since 1971. They are purely vestigial and just held for tradition’s sake. The last major interventions to manage the exchange rate of the dollar came in the 1980s. Bitcoiners discussing the Bitcoin reserve idea tend to vastly overrate the role of gold in the dollar system. Ultimately, the US government’s balance sheet scarcely matters when it comes to the ubiquity of the dollar system. The things that really support the dollar are: US GDP growth, creating tax liabilities which can only be extinguished in dollars The credibility and stability of the US government and monetary policy US capital markets being the most attractive and liquid in the world, making them a sink for global investment (in dollars) The network effects that come from dollar dominance in trade settlement, commodity markets, FX markets, and debt markets America’s continued role as the global hegemon and guarantor of global trade and security Gold – and Bitcoin – are simply not relevant in the American monetary equation today. Perhaps they will one day have a role to play, but the current inconvertible standard is not based in any way on commodity reserves. There’s no argument for an SBR which uniquely specifies Bitcoin Why a reserve of Bitcoins? Why not something else? Bitcoiners have yet to provide a compelling answer. Bitcoin is worth a lot (~$2 trillion), is globally liquid, and is held by many individuals, you might say. Well, Bitcoin isn’t unique in this regard. Is there an argument you could make in support of a Bitcoin reserve that would also not apply to, say, Apple or NVIDIA stock? “Well,” you might say, “these are claims on the cashflows of companies, and not bearer assets. Bitcoin is special, because it cannot be seized or interfered with.” Presumably, though, the US is not at risk of having the assets and IP of Apple or NVIDIA confiscated by itself. This would be an argument against another nation acquiring a reserve of the equity of a US-based company. But we’re talking about the US government. There’s also no argument for a reserve of Bitcoin which does not include gold. If you want to remonetize a hard asset and use it as the basis for your currency system, gold is the obvious choice. If we want to “get ahead” of other nations in terms of reserve assets (a common argument made in favor of the SBR), gold is perfect, since we own more of it than anyone else. Simply re-monetize gold (re-price it from its official price to its current market price), and we are already ahead. Gold is also a “bearer” asset, in that ownership is not a claim on anything other than simple possession of bars and ingots. If Bitcoiners are successful in persuading the US government that we should exit the Bretton Woods II standard, and move back to a pre-1971 commodity based standard, gold would genuinely be a better choice. It has a longer track record, more people own it (so remonetizing it would alienate fewer people), it’s worth about nine times more than Bitcoin, it has much lower volatility, and we already own it, so monetizing it would be far cheaper (if not free). If you disfavor gold because it’s not a “high growth” asset like Bitcoin, then you could consider fast-growing (and productive) assets like NVIDIA, Apple, or Microsoft equity. If we’re considering what commodities the US might invest in for strategic purposes, my first choice would be AI datacenters or chip manufacturing. Those serve an obvious strategic purpose and would also be economically productive. However, we are then getting into discussions of using Treasury or Fed resources for “industrial policy”. Most conservatives and libertarians are suspicious of top-down government apportionment of resources in this manner, preferring to let the private sector sort it out. I wasn’t a fan of Biden’s massive infrastructure spending, which I felt was extremely wasteful, and for that reason I don’t support further incursion into the private sector by the government, especially not via naked dollar issuance. Typically, the US government doesn’t really intervene in markets with its monetary tools beyond setting rates; its role is setting the rules of the road and keeping the system stable, not aggressively deploying government funds into commodities for day trading. (This is why many were skeptical of Biden’s releases from the strategic petroleum reserve.) We are a markets-based capitalist economy, not a centrally planned one. It’s not the government’s job to manage a commodity hedge fund. This is left to the private sector, with the government only stepping in when there’s some immediate strategic necessity to bolster reserves of a specific vital commodity. At the end of the day, the US government still benefits if the US private sector makes investments in commodities and assets that appreciate, via capital gains taxes. I would trust the fund managers and capital allocators to do this rather than bureaucrats. There’s no argument for acquiring an SBR today Why create a reserve of Bitcoin today ? What’s special about the present moment that makes a Bitcoin reserve an imperative right now? Nothing in particular. The dollar isn’t collapsing – in fact it’s thriving. The DXY has been rallying for the last 15 years or so – to the possible detriment of US manufacturing, and foreign countries with dollar liabilities. The US is growing its GDP relative to the rest of the world, especially Europe, which is in slow decline, and China, which is dealing with a serious economic crisis for the first time since Deng. American equities are trouncing the rest of the world, with the US stock market accounting for ~50% of the global total. There’s nothing to indicate these trends won’t continue. “But the dollar is falling relative to hard assets, like gold,” you might say. “And its purchasing power is falling, as evidenced by the relatively high and variable inflation regime we find ourselves in.” But there’s no apparent crisis in the dollar. Rates are a bit higher than they’ve been in the last decade, but no one is panicking about the US government’s solvency. The dollar’s share of global FX reserves has fallen a bit in the last couple decades, but there’s no real crisis there either. The dollar is still utterly dominant globally, with no likely challenger evident anywhere. Neither the moribund Euro nor the (managed) Renminbi have the ability or the ambition to challenge the Dollar as the global reserve asset of choice. The only reason the SBR is being discussed seriously today is due to Trump’s election victory. Bitcoiners have latched on to this for political expediency reasons in the hope that he might not only usher in more favorable regulation, but actually become a buyer of Bitcoin at the state level. But Bitcoin is not anywhere near sufficiently large or liquid to make any kind of dent in the US’ reserve portfolio, and it certainly isn’t ready to be a monetary good like gold under the gold standard. It’s only worth ~$2 trillion today, compared to gold’s ~$17 trillion. Bitcoin is still extremely volatile, and clearly unsuitable to be a unit of account (if we were to graduate to some kind of Bitcoin-denominated dollar system). Bitcoiners should simply be more patient. Bitcoin has done tremendously well over its short 15 years of life and is becoming a global monetary asset of consequence. It has undergone a full institutionalization with the ETF being a final major ratification. Over time, its volatility will temper (and its market cap and liquidity will grow), and it will become a more suitable asset for governments to consider in their portfolios. But as of right now, it doesn’t have a meaningful role to play in America’s monetary system. Careful what you wish for The truth is, there’s no urgency to establish any sort of reserve. The US has nothing to lose by simply waiting. If Bitcoin continues to monetize and ultimately challenges gold, and other nations adopt Bitcoin as part of their sovereign wealth funds, or even start to “back” their currencies with it, the US has plenty of time to act. US institutions, investors, and individuals hold more Bitcoin than anyone else. The US Government has ample means to acquire Bitcoin at any point along the journey, should they decide that they really covet it. They could acquire Bitcoin via open market purchases. More likely, in my opinion, they would go for the much cheaper option of setting a price cap, banning private ownership, and forcing conversion of US-held Bitcoins, as they did with gold in 1933. They could also simply expropriate the Bitcoins held on domestic platforms – US-based custodians are the biggest by far. They could nationalize miners. They could hike capital gains taxes and insist they be paid in-kind. They could arrest individuals known to hold a lot of Bitcoin and expropriate their funds. They could put resources into developing quantum computing good enough to steal the ~4m coins that are quantum vulnerable. “Wait… not like that.” But that’s the trouble. You don’t get to decide the manner in which the US government acquires Bitcoins. If you are successful at persuading them of the virtues of Bitcoin, and they really set their heart on a reserve, they’ll do it through whatever means are most politically expedient. This is not necessarily consistent with what is best for American bitcoiners. If it’s a choice between buying 1 million BTC at $1 million/coin (for $1 trillion dollars), or simply confiscating 1 million coins through some other method, they will go for the more efficient method. If not Bitcoin, how should we shore up the dollar? The long-term solvency of the US government is certainly a concern. Debt to GDP is near the top of the historical range at 120%. Interest costs as a share of GDP are at a 60-year high and going higher. Federal net outlays as a share of GDP are at the top end of the range over the last century, exceeded only by the level during and after WWII. While the deficit has declined from its highs during Covid, it’s still elevated, and gives us very little breathing room if a recession hits. The reckless spending of the last four years (and frankly, there was bipartisan consensus on this) led to a burst of inflation, which we are still dealing with. The dollar’s share of global FX reserves has declined from 70% to 60% over the last quarter century (though no other individual currency has gained meaningful share). And certain buyers of the debt are now leery of purchasing US Treasuries, after the US confiscated Russia’s reserves in 2022. All of this points to a potential long-term issue with the dollar, although no crisis seems to be imminent. This might change if we experience a recession and the government finds itself unable to engage in massive stimulus spending, given that rates are already fairly high, and we are running a significant deficit. If it were up to me, I would do the following: Increase GDP growth through any means possible. This means allowing for cheaper energy, fostering high growth industries like AI, and generally unshackling the private sector Slashing the size of government expenditures, which are far more wasteful than equivalent capital deployed in private markets, to reduce the deficit Limit political intervention into dollar markets, as in, realize that the sanctions-making power of the dollar trades off against its international usefulness Allow inflation to run hot for a while to reduce the debt load in real terms The good news is that incoming Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s 3-3-3 plan basically does this.

Besides, President Trump has chosen pro-crypto Paul Atkins as a replacement, and with anti-crypto Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw missing her renomination window, only pro-crypto Republicans are expected to remain when the leadership changes in January. In a recent interview with Coinage, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce shared insights on how the SEC is shifting from being historically anti-crypto to embracing pro-innovation. She described this period as one of “transition” and “optimism,” signaling a positive change. “It’s a time of transition for everyone in Washington right now, and I think that’s the same at the SEC,” Commissioner Peirce said. “There’s still going to be a time of uncertainty because it will take some time before our new Chairman gets here, but there are some things we can do right out of the gate at least get processes started to make some changes,” she added. Peirce Optimistic Over Two Key SEC Decisions Seemingly, Commissioner Hester Peirce is optimistic about revisiting two key SEC decisions on crypto ETFs—allowing in-kind redemptions and enabling Ethereum ETFs to stake assets. She noted that with a new administration, the chances for these changes are now more likely, especially after Chair Gensler steps down in January. In-kind redemptions could reduce unnecessary conversions to cash, making the process more efficient. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have raised over $10 billion, and Bitcoin ETFs have over $120 billion in assets. She noted that currently, ETF issuers can only hold crypto assets, while other regions like Europe allow staking for additional yield. Peirce believes that with a pro-crypto majority, these changes could happen soon. “If it changes from a majority of Commissioners who don’t want things to go through to a majority of Commissioners who do want things to go through, then yeah, it’s easier,” she said, noting that after Chair Gensler steps down on January 20, the road ahead on both points gets decisively more clear. “I imagine that that question is going to be posed to us early on,” she said. Peirce emphasized the importance of open conversations about crypto, noting that people have been hesitant to engage with the SEC in recent years. She hopes the tone will shift, allowing regulators and the regulated community to work together to find the right way forward. Notably, Eric Balchunas also reiterated the positive sentiment sharing it in a recent X post. ""If it changes from a majority of commissioners who don't want things to go through to a majority of commissioners who do want things to do through, then yeah, it's easier."" – Peirce (who looks happy, smiling as she says it) re approving in-kind cr/rd in btc ETFs as well as… https://t.co/YpXfQ1PFSo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 20, 2024 Peirce Excited Over Collab With Paul Atkins Commissioner Peirce expressed excitement about the possibility of fairer crypto regulations and working with Paul Atkins again, who previously served as a Commissioner from 2002 to 2008. Peirce highlighted Paul Atkins for his commitment to due process, transparency, disclosure, and respecting jurisdictional boundaries. She noted that he comes with many years of experience with securities-related issues and there will be many issues on his agenda again besides crypto. “I would be happy if at the end of 2025, people to get to the point where the regulatory structure is there, they know what the rules are, they’re complying with the rules, but they’re spending their time talking about the technology and its potential. That would make me very happy,” she stated. She emphasized the importance of having reasonable regulations for innovative asset classes and technologies, allowing freedom for people to make their own decisions. She stressed that “we should never be perceived as being a merit regulator on the negative side or on the positive side.”",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 16:46:54

ADA now trades close to the $1 mark. Similarly, Solana’s price has been on a downtrend. It has fallen to $216, delaying its rally to $300. Their consolidation and lack of momentum have made investors less sure about their ability to provide notable returns anytime soon. Meanwhile, two alternatives– Rexas Finance (RXS) and Ripple (XRP) are better options to bet on for significant returns. They are on a bullish path that positions them for a substantial rally. Rexas Finance (RXS): tokenizing Real-World Assets with blockchain technology Rexas Finance (RXS) is a new cryptocurrency designed to transform asset management. Rexas Finance is unique because it breaks down real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate, fine art, and intellectual property, which is called tokenization. Rexas Finance grants small investors the opportunity to own fractions of large assets. Tokenization of assets solves major financial issues such as liquidity and transparency, making owning assets more efficient and accessible. The project uses blockchain technology to simplify asset management and offer unique solutions. RXS has been audited by CertiK Audit, making it more reliable and secure for investors. When Rexas launches, it will be listed on three top-tier major exchanges, which experts believe could significantly increase its value. They predict that it will reach $12 by 2025. Presale success and growing investor confidence Rexas Finance has seen strong momentum in its presale phase, selling over 350 million tokens at $0.150 each during the tenth stage, which is still ongoing. To attract more investors, the team has launched community-focused initiatives like the Millionaire Giveaway, which offers $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. These efforts highlight its growth potential, with analysts forecasting a significant price rally. Innovation at the core The Rexas Finance ecosystem includes advanced tools like the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, which make tokenizing assets easy using a smartphone or computer. Security is a top priority, with features like the Rexas AI Shield providing extra protection for smart contracts. Additionally, Rexas DeFi offers a strong decentralized finance platform focused on adaptability and innovation, which will allow it to grow in various markets. A promising future for Rexas Finance Rexas Finance is listed on websites like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, where traders and investors can access real-time updates on the project. By 2025, Rexas Finance will launch on major exchanges at a starting price of $0.20. If you’re looking for significant returns, Rexas Finance could be a great choice, as it’s expected to see significant growth. Ripple (XRP): a fintech leader Ripple has proven to be a better option in many respects, with several factors making it better than Solana and Cardano. Ripple isn’t just a blockchain platform—it’s a fintech leader. Its upcoming Ripple USD (RLUSD) launch highlights its ability to tap into the $200 billion stablecoin market. NYDFS recently approved RLUSD, enhancing Ripple’s credibility and paving the way for its regulatory acceptance. This regulatory edge could also support Ripple’s ambition for an XRP-based ETF, attracting institutional investors and solidifying its market position. XRP’s price momentum reflects investor confidence. It recently surged to $2.40, with analysts projecting a rally to $3, outperforming Solana and Cardano in gains. Ripple emphasizes practical, scalable solutions that give it a competitive edge. For example, its use in international remittances directly addresses a tangible, high-demand market, unlike the theoretical potential of Cardano’s smart contracts or Solana’s DeFi initiatives. Ripple also benefits from strong market support, as seen with its inclusion in top exchanges like Arkham and Whale Alert’s tracking of significant XRP transfers. The recent $144 million XRP transaction signifies robust institutional interest. Ripple also partners with the world’s banks and financial institutions, making it unique as a crypto asset and a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Cardano and Solana may only reach new all-time highs sometime soon. However, Rexas Finance and Ripple provide better alternatives with the potential to deliver significant returns. Rexas Finance is the best bet for a promising 2025. The token’s presale has been amazing, and a massive surge is expected upon launch. Backed by its unique vision, it’s set to shake up the crypto space in 2025.

On Dec. 20, as Bitcoin ( BTC ) traded to above $97k and Ethereum ( ETH ) bulls pushed above $3,400, the price of Horizen ( ZEN ) surged to highs of $26.34. The cryptocurrency, which rallied sharply following a recent Grayscale Investments announcement, reached a multi-year high and ranked among the top gainers in the 500 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. ZEN traded at lows of $14.55 on Dec. 19. However, despite the broader crypto crash and the staggering $1.4 billion liquidations , the altcoin’s price hovered above $26 in early trading during the U.S. trading session. According to crypto.news price data, Horizen recorded a 24-hour trading volume of over $397 million, with its market cap exceeding $407 million. These metrics reflected increases of 294% and 62%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. While ZEN has surged nearly 200% over the past month, its current levels are still more than 84% below the all-time high of $168 reached in May 2021. If the broader crypto market continues to rebound, ZEN bulls may aim for March 2022 highs near $50. Read more: Trump’s World Liberty buys 759 ETH amid price dip The positive momentum has benefited from Grayscale opening of the Grayscale ZEN Trust to qualified investors. Prices of the altcoin rose as the digital asset manager unveiled the fund to offer exposure to Horizen for qualified investors. Earlier this month, Horizen’s native token underwent its final halving , which came as the project geared for a key change in its tokenomics. ZEN will not see any further halvings as the new network mechanism enables a declining emission rate. That’s because Horizen, is shifting from the proof of work mining model that mirrored Bitcoin’s halving cycle to a new proof of stake mechanism in 2025. Horizen’s last halving occurred on Dec. 12, 2024. New tokenomics for Horizen will come into effect in the first half of 2025.

37889346,https://coingape.com/?p=230355,1734713945,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Top Reasons Why Ethereum Price is Down Today?,https://coingape.com/top-reasons-why-ethereum-price-is-down-today/,"The Ethereum price is down over 6% in the last 24 hours, dropping to as low as $3,120 during this period. This price drop is due to several factors, including the Fed’s hawkish stance, which paints a bearish picture, not just for ETH but also for the broader crypto market. Top Reasons Why The Ethereum Price Is Down The Ethereum price has dropped to as low as $3,120, with several factors contributing to this price drop. These factors include the Fed’s hawkish stance, negative ETF flows, and a massive sell-off from ETH whales. Fed’s Hawkish Stance The Fed’s apparent hawkish stance is the primary reason why the Ethereum price has dropped significantly today. Despite the Federal Reserve announcing a 25 bps rate cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech hinted that the US Central Bank is currently hawkish. Powell also hinted that the Fed is likely to adopt a quantitative tightening approach from next year. There are estimates that there will be lower rate cuts next year, as the Fed has already made three cuts this year. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack has also raised inflation concerns, which could strengthen the case for tightening policies, especially if future economic data come in hot. Negative ETF Flows The negative flows from the Spot ETH ETFs have also contributed to the Ethereum price drop. SosoValue data shows these ETFs recorded a negative daily inflow of $60.47 million yesterday. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) was mainly responsible for these outflows, with $58.13 leaving the fund. This negative outflow was the first in the last nineteen days and could indicate a change in sentiment among investors. Negative ETF flows are typically bearish for the crypto, as outflows lead to significant selling pressure since these ETF issuers have to offload the assets under management to make redemptions. ETH Whales Are Selling ETH Whales are also selling, which is another reason the Ethereum price is down today. CoinGape reported on a whale that sold 22,746 ETH ($7.7 million) and another whale sold 49,910 ETH ($170 million) in the last 24 hours. The Ethereum Foundation has also contributed to this selling pressure. On-chain intelligence platform Lookonchain noted that the Ethereum price has dropped around 17% since the Foundation sold 100 ETH on December 17. The Ethereum Foundation has sold 4,466 ETH ($12.6) million over the past year, just around every ETH local top. A Positive For ETH Despite today’s drop, some other whales are still accumulating, which is positive for the Ethereum price. CoinGape reported that Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial bought 759 ETH today, bringing its total holdings to 16,362 ETH (54.62 million). Lookonchain also reported that Whales have started accumulating ETH as the market rebounds. The platform stated that four fresh wallets had withdrawn 8,440 ETH ($28.43 million) from Binance today.

After an impressive rally earlier in the month, BTC’s momentum has slowed, with sellers taking control and keeping the cryptocurrency in a tight range below this critical threshold. The current price action highlights growing uncertainty in the market, as bulls attempt to regain strength while bears capitalize on every opportunity to push prices lower. With $99,575 marked as a pivotal point, the next moves could set the stage for Bitcoin’s short-term trend. Will the bulls manage a breakthrough, or will bearish dominance prevail? The coming days hold the answer. Bitcoin Struggles Below The Critical $99,575 Resistance Level Bitcoin is currently facing significant resistance at the $99,575 level as its price fights to break above this critical threshold. Despite attempts to rally, bearish pressure has kept BTC confined below this key resistance point, limiting its upward movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Below $100K: Is The Rally Losing Steam? As Bitcoin hovers near this level, market sentiment remains cautious since there are possibilities of a breakout or a deeper pullback. Furthermore, the $99,575 level remains pivotal, as a successful breach could signal further bullish momentum, while failure to surpass it may result in increased selling pressure. BTC’s price has also dropped below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key technical indicator that often acts as a significant support level. This shift below the 100-day SMA suggests weakening upside strength and may signal that bears are gaining control. Historically, when the price falls below the SMA, it can indicate a potential shift in market sentiment, with further downside risk if the price fails to reclaim this important indicator. If BTC cannot regain momentum and climb above the 100-day SMA, it may face increased selling pressure, leading to more losses as bearish sentiment continues to dominate. Key Technical Indicators Suggest Challenges For BTC’s Recovery A critical analysis of the Composite Trend Oscillator indicator suggests that Bitcoin could be poised for more declines. The indicator’s trend line and the SMA’s line have dropped below the zero line, a sign of bearish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dips Again: Is The Momentum Shifting? When both these components fall below this threshold, it typically signals that the downtrend is gaining strength, indicating increased selling pressure. This bearish signal, combined with the price action below the 100-day SMA, suggests that Bitcoin may struggle to regain upward momentum in the near term. Conclusively, If bearish pressure on BTC continues, several key support levels will be crucial to monitor. The first significant level is $93,257, where the price could find initial support. Should BTC fail to hold above this point, the next support zone will be around $85,211, which has previously been a strong demand area. A sustained drop below these levels may suggest an extended price drop to other support ranges.

While the commission has not unveiled the exact policy changes to expect, Peirce is optimistic a likely clearance of some stalling crypto ETF applications. The New US SEC and Crypto Speaking in an interview with Zack Guzman of Coinage media, Peirce hinted at how easy things will be when there majority of commissioners at the SEC wants things done. This response came when asked about how feasible she thinks an in-kind spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF is possible. BREAKING: SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce previews new pro-crypto changes coming to the SEC ETF in-kind redemptions and ability for ETF issuers to begin staking likely done “early on” Both ETFs now have more than $100B in AUM pic.twitter.com/g3jtbuBeWU — Coinage (@coinage_media) December 20, 2024 On this and the issue of Ethereum ETF staking, Hester Peirce said these are the issues that she believed the public will raise earlier on under the incoming chairman. At the time spot Bitcoin and Ethereum were still under consideration, issuers had to make a compromise on in-kind and cash creates. While the Gary Gensler-led commission demanded a cash create settlement method, issuers preferred in-kind. With in-kind, investors can receive settlement in the underlying currency, giving the user a better value overall. The cash creates does the opposite with payouts made in the US Dollar. The same applies to staking, a product that will offer additional yield for spot Ethereum ETF investors. The markets regulator has opposed these flexible propositions, riding on the volatility-induced high risk in all. Amid the wait for a likely approval, Bitwise acquired Attestant , a staking service to extend the offering to in-house clients. Under the nominated Paul Atkins’ US SEC, there might be a rollback of these harsh policies. More than the Markets Regulator Meanwhile, the changes expected in the crypto industry goes beyond just the US SEC. At the moment, there is a lot of noise around Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . This operation, as alleged, subtly mandates the banks to restrict banking services to crypto and Web3-based companies. This operations has led to the collapse of firms like Silvergate Bank. Also, it has held outfits like Custodia Bank from operating at maximum capacity. Notably, industry leaders are calling for a probe into this operation with Crypto Czar David Sacks saying earlier that it is worth looking into. While the US SEC fights to clean its house, Federal policies that are not favoring the crypto market may also need to change.

After 333 hours of sleep, Welch took to X to announce her cooperation with a U.S. federal lawsuit seeking legal recourse for 12 American residents impacted by the failed Hawk Tuah meme coin. Welch released a social media statement less than 24 hours after legal firm Burwick Law filed the suit on Dec. 19. This marks the first time Welch has spoken publicly since Dec. 5. I take this situation extremely seriously and want to address my fans, the investors who have been affected, and the broader community. I am fully cooperating with and am committed to assisting the legal team representing the individuals impacted, as well as to help uncover the truth, hold the responsible parties accountable, and resolve this matter. Haliey Welch on Hawk Tuah meme coin You might also like: Hawk Tuah Hailey Welch sued over $50m meme coin debacle Per crypto.news, crypto-centric Burwick Law filed a lawsuit on behalf of plaintiffs allegedly affected by the Hawk Tuah meme token launched by Welch and her team. Court documents state that 12 individuals collectively lost approximately $150,000 investing in the celebrity meme coin. Hawk Tuah surged to a $500 million market cap shortly after its Solana (SOL) debut before plummeting by over 95% to a $50 million market cap. Welch, the public face of the token, claimed she and her team had not sold a single token. However, data from Bubblemaps challenged her statement, revealing that insiders controlled 96% of the token’s supply. X community notes on at least three of Welch’s tweets also highlighted evidence suggesting that insiders were gradually dumping tokens on buyers. Welch and her team went silent for over two weeks, likely overwhelmed by angry investors demanding answers and accusing the project of being an exit scam. Welch allegedly pocketed $50 million from the project.

Table of Contents Rollblock: The blockchain casino movement poised for 880% returns Can Solana break resistance with the new Bitwise partnership? Can dogecoin finally hit $1 in 2025? Early Rollblock backers have seen massive returns The crypto world is buzzing as Rollblock , a new presale sensation, captures the attention of Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) holders. Recent updates have fueled massive FOMO, drawing investors eager to capitalize on its unique potential. Positioned as a game-changer in decentralized finance, Rollblock is setting the stage for innovation and high returns. With its growing momentum, early adopters are rushing in. Rollblock has raised over $7.3 million so far. Rollblock: The blockchain casino movement poised for 880% returns Rollblock is transforming online gambling by bringing the excitement of a Vegas casino into the homes of its fast-growing user base. Founded on blockchain technology, the platform promises safe, transparent, and fair gaming. Over 22,000 users have joined up, playing over 7,000 games including blackjack and new AI games. Rollblock attracts investors because it concentrates on transparency and trust. Unlike traditional online gambling platforms, Rollblock uses Ethereum-backed security to offer provably fair odds. Every transaction is encrypted on-chain, ensuring users’ personal information and bets are protected from third-party interference. To further reward its community, Rollblock offers an enticing revenue-sharing model. Long-term liquidity providers earn weekly passive income with staking rewards up to 30% APY. These rewards are given by the platform via buyback and burn, which deflates the RBLK token and pushes its value higher as time passes.

So l ana reached $263 on November 22 but dropped to $203 last week. Since October 10, it had been moving within an upward parallel channel, occasionally spiking higher. While it made several attempts to break its all-time high, it couldn’t sustain momentum and slipped back into the channel. Eventually, the price broke below the channel’s support, hitting $203. On the investment side, Bitwise introduced a new Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) in Europe to address the lack of staking rewards from its earlier product, ESOL. BSOL now offers a 6.48% staking reward, surpassing the 5.49% offered by 21Shares. Meanwhile, Bitwise has also filed for a spot Solana ETF in the U.S., but approval remains uncertain. Solana’s next major target is $300, but it first needs to break resistance at $222 and regain $263 before making any real progress. Presently trading for $215.32, interest is developing with open interest rising 2.25% to $5.34 billion. These levels are now being watched by analysts to find out if Solana can kickstart its march upward. Can dogecoin finally hit $1 in 2025? Throughout the 2021 bull run, Dogecoin surpassed a record high of $0.74 in May and stayed well short of the $1 milestone. Though its price has pulled back since that time, most are hopeful the 2025 bull market will push it over that psychological barrier. Excitement continues to grow since Elon Musk had taken over Twitter (X) and also speculated that Dogecoin might be used to pay for products offered by the platform. This possible integration has revived interest in Dogecoin, which remains the #1 meme coin and a top contender for 2025. Despite the resuscitated interest, Dogecoin’s short-term performance has been patchy with the coin sliding 3% in the last day to $0.387. Nevertheless, investors are paying attention to Dogecoin very carefully, focusing on its future potential. Early Rollblock backers have seen massive returns Rollblock is now a hot topic among early backers who have gained over 300% since the project launched some months ago. Currently priced at $0.0415, Rollblock is capturing the attention of savvy traders, including whales, during stage 9 of its presale. Analysts predict up to 880% returns for early investors before the token’s launch, with the potential for 100% returns by early 2025. Rollblock’s mix of centralized convenience and decentralized security makes it one of the hottest investment opportunities in crypto today.

Welch, of the famous Talk Tuah podcast, disappeared from social media after rug-pulling the HAWK token on live stream. Hailey Welch has responded to warnings about a class action lawsuit for rug-pulling the HAWK token. In the past 24 hours, court filings surfaced that represented claims on behalf of buyers of the HAWK meme token. After almost a day of waiting, Welch responded with a message that she was fully committed to cooperating with legal representatives and compensating the buyers of her meme token. I take this situation extremely seriously and want to address my fans, the investors who have been affected, and the broader community. I am fully cooperating with and am committed to assisting the legal team representing the individuals impacted, as well as to help uncover the… — Haliey Welch (@HalieyWelchX) December 20, 2024 Welch herself does not admit to a direct fault and has asked victims to contact Burwick Law, the first firm that advertised its willingness to represent HAWK token buyers. Burwick Law is generally open to pursuing meme tokens and NFT fraud, taking special interest in the HAWK token case. Burwick Law has denied representing Welch, instead pointing out its goal of achieving compensation and the best outcome for all involved parties. The token itself was launched by the Tuah The Moon Foundation, registered in the Cayman Islands. The HAWK token was not a simple launch and involved multiple parties that could have exerted control over the token. The HAWK token and the influence of Welch had another unexpected effect. Polymarket carried a small betting pair on Welch returning to X and tweeting before December 20. Just in time, Welch delivered, immediately resolving the betting market. One account bought 18,936 ‘yes’ tokens just minutes before Welch tweeted, though at that time the price rose to $0.927. Thus, the biggest buyer still had limited success. For other holders, the market spiked from $0.41 to $1 for the ‘yes’ token. The timing of the big purchase for ‘yes’ tokens led to more speculations of insider activity. HAWK token is still held by a cabal of wallets Welch, who became famous for a short Internet clip, released the HAWK meme asset while controlling most of the supply. The community was warned by BubbleMaps and other analysts that HAWK worked as a celebrity coin and was at risk for insider control. While Welch kept most of her content light and to the point, her Internet influence was immense. This led to outsized investments into the HAWK token. In some cases, meme tokens linked to celebrities have survived longer without a rug pull. In this case, it is yet unclear who initiated the sell-off, which ended up draining all of the token’s liquidity. HAWK trades at an extremely low rate, sinking to $0.00092. The token has only $893K in liquidity locked, an extremely low tier for a widely known asset. Before the rug pull, HAWK found its way into 12,724 wallets. The top wallet still carries more than 28% of the supply. Just before the launch, 96% of the supply was linked to a cluster of connected wallets, which went on to sell to the community. The initial sale drained the liquidity too fast, leaving the token to crash. Despite the token’s high profile, no community has claimed it as its own. This is mostly due to the rapid rug pull, which still left a cabal of large-scale wallets controlling the supply. Meme tokens, however, are never really defunct. Soon after the news of Welch offering redress, HAWK started climbing, rising to $0.00099. The token may yet revive given the extra publicity. Within minutes, traders injected around $100K in liquidity, which started to move the price in the green after two weeks of stagnation. Within minutes, buy orders in the thousands of dollars started flowing into the market, aiming to make use of its rock-bottom prices.

33767162,[object Object],1734715809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Shiba Inu Goes Multi-Chain With New Chainlink Partnership,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-multi-chain-chainlink-partnership/,"Shiba Inu has entered into a strategic partnership with Chainlink, according to a press release published in SHIB Magazine. This alliance will see Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 (L2) blockchain network, integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) as its canonical infrastructure for cross-chain communication, alongside the adoption of the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard for its native assets SHIB, BONE, and LEASH. What The Shiba Inu And Chainlink Means “We’re excited to announce that Shiba Inu and Chainlink are partnering to grow the Shiba Inu ecosystem,” reads the official press release. “Shibarium has integrated the Chainlink standard for blockchain interoperability as its canonical cross-chain infrastructure.” The move enables Shiba Inu ecosystem assets to be deployed across 12 blockchains. Shibarium is built on top of Ethereum with a focus on scalability, speed, and cost efficiency. By adopting the CCT standard, the Shiba Inu ecosystem can now facilitate token transfers using a “lock-and-mint” mechanism for bridging from Ethereum and a “burn-and-mint” mechanism for cross-chain transfers beyond Ethereum. These approaches aim to ensure a controlled, secure, and verifiable means of moving value across multiple networks, all underpinned by Chainlink’s CCIP. Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs, emphasized the importance of the partnership in expanding cross-chain capabilities for Shibarium. “We’re excited to enter a partnership with Shiba Inu and grow its ecosystem together,” Eid stated. “The integration of Chainlink CCIP as Shibarium ’s canonical cross-chain solution and Shiba Inu’s adoption of the CCT standard will enhance its capabilities and drive wide adoption of its ecosystem.” Kaal, a Shiba Inu core developer, underscored the significance of adopting CCIP and the CCT standard: “Partnering with Chainlink, we’re not just choosing an industry standard—we’re setting a bold new course for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. By integrating CCIP and the CCT standard, SHIB, LEASH, and BONE will, for the very first time, span multiple chains with unparalleled security, reliability, and inbuilt burn mechanisms.” From a technical perspective, Chainlink’s CCIP is designed to provide decentralized cross-chain messaging, secure token transfers, and programmability. The protocol’s security model leverages Chainlink’s decentralized oracle networks (DONs) to safeguard tokens and data as they move across chains. According to the release, Chainlink’s infrastructure has historically secured over $75 billion in DeFi total value locked (TVL) at its peak and facilitated more than $17 trillion in on-chain transaction value since the start of 2022. In addition, Shiba Inu will also integrate Chainlink Data Streams for premium, high-frequency, low-latency market data. “Chainlink Data Streams supply premium high-frequency data with advanced features such as liquidity-weighted bid-ask spreads and sub-second execution speed,” the press release states. The objective is to enable more sophisticated decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Shibarium, potentially attracting traders and liquidity providers seeking reliable, transparent data feeds. As detailed in a related article by SHIB Magazine, the overarching vision behind this move is to create a more dynamic, interconnected blockchain environment. By leveraging Chainlink’s CCIP, Shibarium aims to connect with a broader “crypto universe” and facilitate the secure transfer of its ecosystem tokens across multiple chains.Notably, this cross-chain expansion also introduces a deflationary mechanism through which transaction fees across various supported chains are consolidated and utilized to “burn” tokens, potentially influencing the tokenomics of SHIB, BONE, and LEASH over the longer term. Chainlink’s CCIP capabilities, including arbitrary messaging and programmable token transfers, allow developers to build cross-chain-native applications that can handle NFTs, lending protocols, and other data-driven functionalities. This technological convergence represents a bid to transform Shibarium from a single-chain solution into a robust, multi-chain network that can host diverse and sophisticated DeFi markets. The ultimate impact of this multi-chain expansion will depend on developer adoption, user engagement, and the broader DeFi market’s response. While the outcome remains to be seen, the partnership’s stated goal is clear: to foster innovation, encourage widespread adoption of Shibarium’s tools, and establish the Shiba Inu ecosystem as a pioneering force in cross-chain interoperability and decentralized finance. As Kaal noted, “This milestone paves the way for more innovative multi-chain applications, driving broader adoption and igniting a new era of growth and possibility for the Shiba Inu ecosystem.” At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002218.",Shiba Inu|chainlink|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu Chainlink Partnership|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-20 17:30:09

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 17:35:00

To many, the rise of these on-chain agents is a welcome upgrade from human influencers like BitBoy and GCR, who have mixed track records and opaque incentives. These agents, like on-chain analyst AIXBT, have quickly risen to the top of crypto twitter influencer mindshare rankings, given their ability to respond at the speed of the internet and justify opinions with data. Today AIXBT is one of few agents that trades at a nine figure valuation, but as the number of utility-focused agentic launches accelerates next year, many will compare this new agentic asset class to the similar explosion of NFTs in 2021. On-chain agents and NFTs share many similarities: they curate communities and organize attention, they’re fun to speculate on and offer vague promises of future value. But most importantly they represent novel assets, with no analogue in the traditional finance world. After the SEC’s lawsuits targeting NFT projects like Flyfish Club and Stoner Cats made it nearly impossible to build an innovative idea with that primitive, NFTs as unique assets lost momentum. In the vacuum left behind, memecoins surged forward, offering a mix of humor and speculative fervor to fill the void once occupied by NFTs' ambitious promises. Because they looked like other trading-only assets which were lightly regulated, the SEC was unable to stifle their development as they did in every other corner in crypto. Memecoins required users to make fewer choices, versus NFTs which combined aspects like rarity and tier that obfuscated any underlying value. Their use was supercharged by platforms like pump.fun, which reduced the creation of new memecoins to just a couple clicks, setting off a frenzy of speculation and new user behaviors tied to token price appreciation. You can find a compilation of the more extreme attempts here . Yet, amid this speculative chaos, a new asset has emerged which is engendering similar user behaviors to NFTs and memecoins: on-chain agents. These digital entities combine blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to deliver novel user experiences. Though most agents today are indistinguishable from memecoins, several on-chain agents have begun to differentiate themselves through utility. The Rise of On-Chain Agents Agents represent another asset class in crypto experimenting with new business models and monetization. From AI-generated podcasts to investment insights and anonymous communication, these virtual entities have already reshaped how much of crypto Twitter (X) interacts. The biggest on-chain agents have mindshare bigger than the biggest human crypto-native influencers , and make money similarly: by token-gating information and offering subscriptions. Their distinguishing features — utility-driven frameworks and fair-launch principles — should make agents a more investible asset class than memes. Seen through the lens of hold period, liquidity, and utility, the distinction is even more clear. Because we suspect investors will hold agents longer term than memecoins, and they create liquidity for themselves through their business models, crypto-focused investors will find this asset class easier to back once the initial frenzy has cleared. Until the business models flourish however, picking agents to invest can be likened to throwing darts at a board. Early Innovators in On-Chain Agents The on-chain agent market remains nascent, with most projects still in development. While projects like Truth Terminal set off the frenzy by showing the world that agents could have mimic real people, newer projects have focused on utility. Trained on data from crypto Twitter, AIXBT delivers lightning-fast insights on token dynamics, rivaling the influence of major crypto personalities. Others like Luna have proliferated as entertainment agents, interacting with thousands of people through twitter and TikTok. Having spent the last two weeks experimenting with many of these, here are five more that are worth playing with. It’s unclear whether any of these are valuable investment opportunities, only that they offer differentiated user experiences. These projects illustrate the diversity and ingenuity of the on-chain agent ecosystem, laying the foundation for its expansion. Each offers a novel AI-powered user experience that anybody can experiment with. Over time, we suspect that continued engagement may even allow them to create moats. While unclear where these may come from today, Dunbar’s Number provides a helpful framework. It defines the cognitive limit on the number of meaningful social relationships humans can maintain, and is around 150. Agents that create value by maintaining a nearly infinite number of simultaneous relationships, like AIXBT, unlock opportunities beyond what the human brain can cognitively do. The Big Picture History doesn’t repeat but it rhymes is an adage you’ll see on the twitter feed of every degen that’s ever lost 90% on a trade, but also proves unfailingly true. At the outset of the fourth bull run of the last two decades, it’s hard to ignore the comparisons. DeFi summer was set off by the realization that centralized fintech companies often act against their customers. Famously, when Robinhood stopped out retail traders in favor of the big guns in Citadel, these traders realized that big regulated central companies may not be acting in their best interests. Interestingly, a very similar dynamic is afoot in AI. The biggest companies like ChatGPT have struck multi-year deals with companies like Apple, allowing them to ingest people’s personal iPhone data without much accountability. As such, the violent price swings on agents traded on-chain may be front running this latest rhyme. It’s unclear how this dynamic will play out however. Beyond the agents themselves, agentic frameworks like ai16z’s Eliza and the Virtuals platform may capture value more clearly. The latter is already the breakout performer of the last quarter price-wise: given the inherent uncertainty, investing in an index of agents makes sense. I suspect this is because while agents are inherently interesting, it’s unclear that their usefulness will compound and that the attention dedicated to them will be lasting. There is an old story about the market craze in sardine trading in a period of relative food scarcity. The commodity traders bid them up and the price of a can of sardines soared. One day a buyer decided to treat himself to an expensive meal and actually opened a can and started eating. He immediately became ill and told the seller the sardines were no good. The seller said, “You don’t understand. These are not eating sardines, they are trading sardines.” As scarcity returns to the market it’s worth remembering agents can be a trillion dollar asset class. But for now, save for a handful, they’re still sardines.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-20 17:36:22

The upgrade adds a slew of new features to deepen on-chain liquidity for DEXs (decentralized exchanges) and to enhance the decentralized trading experience. Liquidity Hub version two provides DEXs with advanced tools and integrations, enabling them to deliver superior liquidity and execution. This positions them as strong, self-sufficient alternatives to CEXs (centralized exchanges). Traditionally, decentralized marketplaces struggle to attain sufficient liquidity, leading to high volatility and slippage. Liquidity Hub version one solved these challenges by procuring liquidity from multiple sources while offering MEV protection and flexible gasless transactions. With version two, Orbs builds on the foundation of its predecessor by introducing advanced optimizations and new tools to enhance the liquidity experience. The latest version refines how DEXs access and manage liquidity, streamlining operations and improving execution efficiency directly on-chain. These updates further reduce operational complexity while maintaining seamless integration across venues. Core features of version two include the following. Dynamic fees – Fees are now calculated in real-time as a percentage of the savings achieved, ensuring that traders benefit from optimized costs, making swaps more efficient. Enhanced AMM router price simulation – AMM prices are continuously monitored throughout the Dutch auction process, ensuring superior pricing even during volatile market conditions. Provable outcomes with LH Explorer – Provides visibility into every transaction, showing AMM simulated prices, Liquidity Hub prices, fees, gas costs and savings. Orbs’ chain-agnostic liquidity layer enhances the capabilities of DEXs and emerging networks without the need to migrate liquidity or bridge assets. Liquidity Hub version two builds upon this foundation, operating as a decentralized backend that seamlessly integrates with existing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and non-EVM smart contracts. This frees DeFi projects to focus on product innovation and market expansion rather than getting sidelined by liquidity management hurdles. The introduction of Liquidity Hub version two stands as a significant milestone in Orbs’ ongoing efforts to refine on-chain trading infrastructure. By combining real-time fee optimization, continuous AMM price monitoring and provable outcomes through LH Explorer, version two delivers better execution prices for traders. In the process, it ensures enhanced competitiveness for DEX operators, enabling them to attract more liquidity providers and traders. About Orbs Orbs is a decentralized layer-three blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for advanced on-chain trading. Orbs optimizes trading with aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders and on-chain derivatives. Orbs enhances the capabilities of both EVM and non-EVM smart contracts without moving liquidity onto a new chain. This one-of-a-kind setup acts as a decentralized backend that brings CeFi-level execution to DeFi trading. Learn more at the website .

The latest hawkish signals from the FED have put pressure on financial markets and pulled cryptocurrencies down. Analysts who stated that the decline in Bitcoin is a correction stated that the latest decline looks like year-end profit taking. While Bitcoin's recent price movements raise questions among crypto investors, a tweet by former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao in 2020 became a trending topic again after 4 years. At this point, CZ's tweet on December 17, 2020, aimed at investors who were worried about the declines in the bull cycle, came to the fore again. “Waiting for new headlines: Bitcoin crashes from $101k to $85k. Save this tweet,” CZ said in 2020. When CZ made this post in December 2020, Bitcoin was around $20,000. Afterwards, BTC started a big rally and rose to $64,000 in April 2021. After that, BTC reached ATH by reaching $69,000 in November 2021. While CZ's tweet partially came true, it remains to be seen whether the declines will continue. *This is not investment advice.

While traders continue to take profits, analysts believe the cryptocurrency still has room for growth. According to an X thread by Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the co-founder of the on-chain market intelligence platform Glassnode, over 20 charts and metrics suggest BTC has yet to form its top for this cycle. More Room for Growth The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric, which measures unrealized profitability, is currently hovering around 3. Historically, this indicator has signaled overheating above 7; hence, there is still room for BTC to grow. Also, the top MVRV Pricing Band, which is obtained from calculating the number of days the MVRV has traded at extreme levels, is currently at the 3.2 level. Schultze-Kraft mentioned that analyzing long-term holder (LTH) profitability metrics like the Relative Unrealized Profit and LTH Net Unrealized Profit/Loss can offer insights into the risks of profit-taking. These metrics just entered the euphoria zone, hitting the 0.75 level. In 2021, BTC rallied approximately 3x after the indicators entered this zone and topped when they hit 0.9+. Another metric to look at is the Yearly Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, which monitors coin spending among investors. The Glassnode founder disclosed that this indicator peaked above 700% in previous cycles, however, it is currently around 580%. One more indicator to watch is the Market Cap to Thermocap Ratio, which is not close to previous extremes. Historical data has shown that BTC tops occur when this metric reaches a multiple of 32-64; however, the metric currently hovers at the bottom of this range. The top band of this metric will put Bitcoin’s market cap above $4 trillion. BTC Top at $230K? Furthermore, the Investor Tool metric suggests BTC could top at $230,000. The Bitcoin Price Temperature indicator counters this suggestion but places a BTC top at $151,000. Moreover, the Value Days Destroyed Multiple, which compares near-term coin days destruction to the yearly average to determine increasing spending of older coins that eventually overpower demand, sits at 2.2. With previous extreme values above 2.9, the indicator suggests room for growth. Schultze-Kraft listed other metrics and charts, including the Mayer Multiple, the Cycle Extremes Oscillator Chart, the Pi Cycle Top Indicator, the LTH Inflation rate, the Sell-side Risk Ratio, and the Short-term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio. While these indicators have placed bitcoin’s cycle top at different levels, they all suggest that the digital asset is only halfway through this bull run.

37891007,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631194,1734716778,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37891007.jpeg,The U.S. economy expected to enter recession again next year,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-u-s-economy-expected-to-enter-recession/,"The U.S. economy is heading straight for a wall. All signs point to a recession in 2025. It’s not even subtle. Economists, analysts, and market watchers are connecting the dots, and the picture isn’t pretty. The Walmart Recession Signal is screaming danger. This signal tracks Walmart’s stock price against the S&P Global Luxury Index, and guess what? It’s at its highest point since the world shut down in 2020. Walmart shares jumped a whopping 83% this year, while luxury goods stocks flatlined. History shows us what happens when this gap widens this much: a recession. Every. Single. Time. Consumers are tapped out, and unemployment is creeping up Americans are out of money. That’s the reality. Pandemic-era savings? Gone. Those stimulus checks that once kept people spending like the party would never end? Spent. Consumer spending, which is the backbone of the U.S. economy, is starting to sag under the weight of exhausted wallets. Retailers are feeling it. Restaurants are feeling it. The entire economy is bracing for impact. Continuing unemployment claims are up 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels. While unemployment rates aren’t skyrocketing yet, the cracks are showing. Rising claims mean more people are losing their jobs, and fewer are finding new ones quickly. If this trend keeps up, it’ll only feed into the recession spiral. Wages? Sure, they’ve risen, but not enough to keep up with inflation. People might be earning more on paper, but in reality, they’re buying less. That’s how recessions start. And about inflation—it’s still here. It’s better than the nightmare 9.1% peak back in June 2022, but October’s 2.6% rate shows we’re far from out of the woods. Economic forecasts clash, but the risks are clear Experts can’t agree on just how bad it’ll get, but no one’s denying the risks anymore. BCA Research is practically betting on a recession for both the U.S. and Canada next year. Their argument? The labor market is too shaky, and consumer spending is falling off a cliff. It won’t be another 2008-style disaster, but it’ll hurt. Goldman Sachs, ever the optimist, says not so fast. They’re banking on 2.5% GDP growth for 2025 and put the odds of a recession at just 15%. They’re clinging to the hope that policy changes under the next administration won’t shake things up too much. But then there’s J.P. Morgan, throwing water on Goldman’s sunny outlook. They’re pegging the recession risk at 45%, citing a shrinking money supply and potential global shocks as key threats. Let’s talk numbers. GDP growth predictions for 2025 are all over the place. Goldman’s 2.5% is on the high end, while some estimates go as low as 1.9%. The unemployment rate? That’s expected to hover around 4.2%, but if inflation stays controlled, it could drop closer to 3.5%. And the Federal Reserve? They’re unlikely to cut interest rates more than twice next year, so inflation will likely fire up as early as January. Global tensions and Trump’s policies As if the domestic economy wasn’t fragile enough, global risks are piling on. The Russia-Ukraine war continues to mess with energy prices and supply chains. Meanwhile, China’s economy is slowing down, and that’s bad news for everyone. If Chinese demand for U.S. exports drops, it’ll hit American manufacturers and farmers hard. And let’s not forget the commercial real estate sector, which is already feeling the heat from higher interest rates. Rising vacancies and falling investments in this space could spill over into broader financial markets. Then there’s Donald Trump. His return to the White House in January 2025 will come with a new set of policies, and some of them could tip the scales. His plans for tariffs are already raising eyebrows. A proposed 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods could drive prices up across the board. Goldman Sachs estimates these tariffs alone could boost inflation by nearly one percentage point. That’s the last thing the economy needs. And trade relations? Those could get ugly fast. Tariffs tend to spark retaliation, and a full-blown trade war could wreck supply chains and kill growth. Businesses that rely on cross-border trade would take a direct hit, leading to layoffs and higher prices for consumers. Trump’s tax policies might provide a short-term boost but could also backfire. Extending tax cuts for individuals and corporations sounds great until you realize it’ll likely balloon the federal deficit. If the economy doesn’t grow fast enough to offset the lost revenue, we’re looking at higher borrowing costs and a potential loss of investor confidence.

In the crypto market, whale investors hold the power to influence the price of tokens, and their actions can signal significant price movements. Recently, FX Guys (FXG) has been drawing the attention of big investors, sparking speculation that the price of $FXG could rise substantially shortly. With a growing ecosystem, a robust Trader Funding Program, and the potential for impressive staking rewards, FX Guys could soon be on track to reach $2 or even beyond. Here’s why whales place their bets on FX Guys and what this could mean for investors. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 1. FX Guys’ Rising Popularity Among Whale Investors As the crypto market matures, more prominent investors, often called whales, seek projects that offer long-term growth potential. FX Guys has caught their eye due to its strong foundation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and its $FXG token, which offers both growth potential and passive income opportunities. Whales are known to target projects with solid use cases and scalability, and FX Guys has proven itself as a Top PropFi Project with its innovative approach to Trade2Earn and staking. These key elements of the FX Guys ecosystem provide whales with opportunities to earn consistent returns while holding the token. By betting on FX Guys, whales are positioning themselves for future price increases, driving confidence in the broader market. 2. The Trade2Earn Model: A Game Changer for Investors One key factor that differentiates FX Guys from other projects in the DeFi space is its Trade2Earn model. This innovative mechanism allows users to earn rewards for trading within the ecosystem, incentivizing increased trading volume and liquidity. This model presents a unique opportunity for whales to leverage $FXG tokens while earning rewards through trading activities. The Trade2Earn feature has the potential to increase demand for $FXG tokens significantly, creating upward price momentum. As more traders and whales engage in the ecosystem, the demand for $FXG could rise, bringing the price closer to the $2 mark. 3. Staking for Passive Income and Long-Term Growth Another compelling reason whales are betting on FX Guys is the opportunity to earn passive income through staking. Staking allows token holders to lock up their $FXG tokens in exchange for rewards. This mechanism provides a way for investors to earn regular returns and helps secure the network. For large investors, staking offers an attractive way to gain exposure to $FXG while minimizing risk. By locking in their holdings, whales reduce market exposure while earning rewards that compound over time. As the staking pool grows and more investors participate, the price of $FXG could experience upward pressure, potentially reaching the much-anticipated $2 mark. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 4. The Growing Ecosystem and Market Demand FX Guys is more than just a token; it’s a growing ecosystem with many features designed to attract traders and investors alike. From the Trader Funding Program to staking and Trade2Earn, FX Guys has created an environment where small and large investors can thrive. As the FX Guys ecosystem expands, more investors will likely be drawn to the platform. Increased adoption of $FXG tokens will likely lead to higher demand and, in turn, a rise in the token’s price. If the momentum continues, it’s entirely possible that FX Guys could hit the $2 mark sooner than expected. 5. Why $2 Could Be Just Around the Corner for FX Guys For FX Guys, the road to $2 is paved with solid fundamentals and an increasing user base. With whales betting on $FXG, the token’s potential for significant price appreciation is growing. Several factors point to $FXG reaching the $2 milestone: The success of the Trader Funding Program and staking incentives drive increased investor interest. Trade2Earn boosts demand for the token, increasing liquidity and market engagement. A robust ecosystem that continues to attract more traders and investors. As FX Guys continues to build its ecosystem, whales are not the only ones noticing. Retail investors also see the value in $FXG, making this token a potential breakout candidate for the coming years. With $2 on the horizon, now could be the perfect time to get involved in the FX Guys ecosystem. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Conclusion: The Future of FX Guys Looks Bright As whales place big bets on FX Guys, it’s clear that the future of $FXG holds significant promise. With its innovative Trade2Earn model, attractive staking rewards, and a growing ecosystem, FX Guys is well-positioned to experience substantial growth. While the crypto market can be volatile, the strong fundamentals behind FX Guys make it a compelling investment opportunity. If the current trends continue, $FXG could be on its way to $2, bringing substantial gains to early investors.

The price of Welch’s Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin HAWK surged shortly after it went live earlier this month, but the token lost more than 95% of its value a few hours later, leading to accusations of a pump-and-dump scheme. A pump-and-dump scheme is a fraudulent practice in crypto that involves artificially inflating the price of a low-value token through hype and misrepresentation. Once the price of the coin goes up, those behind the scheme sell their holdings at a high price, crashing the price of the token. In a post on social media platform X, New York-based Burwick Law says it just filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of investors who bought the HAWK token. “This case involves claims related to investor protections under federal law and the HAWK TUAH memecoin HAWK launched on December 4, 2024.” According to Newsweek, investors are suing Tuah The Moon Foundation, which handled the proceeds from the sale of HAWK, the coin’s creator OverHere Ltd and its executive, Clinton So, and the token’s Los Angeles-based promoter, Alex Larson Schultz. The court filings say the lawsuit stems from the unlawful promotion and sale of the memecoin, which the defendants offered and sold to the public without proper registration. The plaintiffs claim that they were drawn to the project because of Welch’s involvement but sustained substantial damages after the rapid decline in the token’s value.

As Bedrock’s innovative LRT (liquid restaking token), brBTC maximizes Bitcoin yield by enabling holders to deposit a variety of Bitcoin derivatives and earn rewards through a curated selection of advanced restaking protocols. BTCFi 1.0 – A foundation with room to grow The evolution of BTCFi began with BTCFi 1.0, which laid the groundwork for Bitcoin’s integration into DeFi. This phase introduced staking protocols that allowed Bitcoin holders to generate yields, providing a glimpse of Bitcoin’s potential in DeFi. However, BTCFi 1.0 also revealed key challenges – liquidity was fragmented across platforms, restaking opportunities were limited and real-world applications remained largely untapped. A vision for BTCFi 2.0 The launch of brBTC marks the beginning of BTCFi 2.0 – a new concept aimed at addressing current key challenges in BTCFi, such as fragmented liquidity, limited restaking opportunities and a lack of real-world use cases. BTCFi 2.0 introduces a more unified and efficient ecosystem, providing sustainable yield strategies, enhanced security through layer-two solutions and integration with collaborative platforms. In sharing his thoughts on brBTC’s launch, Zhuling Chen, core contributor at Bedrock, said, “BrBTC will be the catalyst for driving BTCFI into its next phase, BTCFI 2.0. It will enable multi-source yield through interoperability and help to secure and unite the fragmented liquidity in the ecosystem.” Echoing this sentiment, Calvin Zhou, another core contributor at Bedrock, added, “By enhancing Bitcoin’s utility and staking capabilities, BTCFi 2.0 and brBTC not only unlock new financial opportunities but also strengthen the overall security and resilience of the decentralized ecosystem.” BrBTC – A game-changer for Bitcoin yield Launching initially on Ethereum and BNB Chain, with plans to expand to additional chains, brBTC empowers investors through three core features. Unified ecosystem BrBTC addresses the challenge of market fragmentation by integrating Bitcoin seamlessly across multiple DeFi platforms. By accepting a wide range of BTC derivative assets as collateral – including WBTC, FBTC, mBTC, cbBTC, BTCB and uniBTC – brBTC creates a cohesive and dynamic ecosystem. Collateral allocations are optimized across multiple staking protocols to ensure holders benefit from the most competitive yields. Enhanced yield strategies BrBTC offers diversified yield-generation options, extending beyond traditional staking by leveraging restaking protocols such as Babylon, Kernel, Pell, SatLayer, Mellow and Symbiotic. Furthermore, to further strengthen brBTC’s liquidity and expand sustainable yield opportunities, Bedrock partners with Thena and MEV Capital. These collaborations ensure a solid and well-supported ecosystem, empowering users to access competitive and scalable restaking solutions. With scalability in mind, additional protocols and partnerships will be introduced over time to enhance yield strategies and unlock even greater opportunities. Real-world applications Engineered with versatility in mind, brBTC bridges the gap between digital assets and tangible utilities. Its applications extend to collateral in financial products, enabling microtransactions, and supporting other real-world financial needs, enhancing Bitcoin’s relevance in both DeFi and TradFi (traditional finance). With BTCFi 2.0, Bedrock is pioneering a new era for Bitcoin holders, offering tools to maximize yield, navigate a more cohesive ecosystem and explore real-world applications. Driven by innovation and collaboration, brBTC is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Bitcoin in DeFi. About Bedrock Bedrock leads the DeFi space with its unique offerings. As the first multi-asset restaking protocol, Bedrock supports BTC, ETH and IOTX liquid restaking. This capability allows users to unlock impressive yields, with some exceeding three digits – all while maintaining asset exposure. Bedrock has proven its dominance by providing the highest Babylon points in cap one and cap two. Backed by notable investors like OKX Ventures and Babylon’s co-founder, Bedrock ensures robust security and seamless cross-chain functionality.

37891158,https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-increases-gas-limit-pectra,1734717600,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Ethereum to ramp up gas limit as Pectra progresses,https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-increases-gas-limit-pectra,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Ethereum All-Core Devs (ACD) held their final call of 2024 yesterday, which offered key updates on plans to raise the gas limit and progress toward the Pectra upgrade. Discussions revealed the community’s ongoing efforts to balance execution-layer changes, consensus-layer coordination and EIP implementation, reflecting Ethereum’s commitment to “build-in-public” iterative improvement. In a bold but measured move, Ethereum developers are preparing for a gas limit increase, mirroring a 20% rise seen over three years ago. This time, the proposed increase aims for 36 million gas, though significant technical constraints temper enthusiasm for higher thresholds. The primary limitation is the consensus layer’s “GOSSIP_MAX_SIZE,” which restricts validator block transmission to 10 MiB, equivalent to roughly 10.48 MB. On the Mekong testnet — used for Pectra fork testing — the gas limit has already increased to 36 million, offering a stable testing ground for network performance under higher limits. While the Mekong testnet runs stably with these changes, developers cautioned against increasing the mainnet gas limit beyond 40 million without addressing the gossip-layer constraints. Validator clients, such as Prysm, face challenges in dynamically adjusting gas limits, which underlines the need for further development. An increase to the gas limit does not need to wait for a hard fork but can be signaled by validators in support of such a change. To date, only 16.8% have done so , but the trend is up. Campaigns like PumpTheGas.org aim to build more momentum. The Pectra upgrade remains a centerpiece of Ethereum’s 2025 roadmap. It’s on track for a Q1 release, with developers targeting a Devnet-5 launch by year-end. Changes discussed on the call include replacing EIP-7742 with EIP-7840 to offer more flexibility in managing “blob counts” — a key element for scaling Ethereum and supporting layer-2 rollups. By allowing developers to set maximum and target blob counts independently, the network can balance scalability (by allowing more data blobs) with stability (by maintaining operational safety limits). This separation makes it easier to optimize block capacity without overloading the network. Additionally, EIP-2537 focuses on gas repricing for BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) precompile operations, which are essential for cryptographic computations in Ethereum. The proposal adjusts gas costs for specific mathematical operations, ensuring that resource-intensive tasks are priced fairly while removing inefficiencies like redundant operations. These updates enhance network efficiency, optimize resource usage and improve cost fairness for developers. An EVM resource pricing working group will launch in January. This group will work on harmonizing gas cost calculations across various operations, aiming to improve efficiency and fairness in Ethereum’s fee structure. EIP-4444, which schedules the rollout of pre-Merge history expiry for May 1, 2025, requires additional testing to finalize. The call also underscored the need for clearer validator node requirements, with developers seeking community feedback. A further proposal to redefine “Meta” EIPs as solely process-related could simplify hardfork management. Ethereum’s deliberate and collaborative approach to development was evident throughout the discussions. The Pectra upgrade and proposed gas limit increase reflect the network’s ambition to expand its technical capabilities while prioritizing stability.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD climbing back above $96,000 on Bitstamp. Despite a 1.5% daily decline, Bitcoin created challenging trading conditions, revisiting $92,000 lows from earlier in December, hitting long positions hard. “The cascade of support loss has indeed occurred,” noted trader and analyst Rekt Capital on X, adding, “Bitcoin is now down -15% on this pullback.” Rekt Capital had previously cautioned about potential corrections during bull markets, typically occurring six to eight weeks after breaking prior all-time highs. He remarked that the current dip “almost matches” a similar event from 2021. “These corrections tend to last a few weeks,” he explained. “Also, there tend to be up to 4 Price Discovery Corrections at most until a Bull Market ends. This is the first Price Discovery Correction in this cycle, which means it is an optimal re-accumulation opportunity with a high probability of price reversal to the upside.” Liquidation data painted a stark picture for crypto traders. Monitoring resource CoinGlass reported $1.4 billion in liquidations across the crypto market over the past 24 hours. Analyzing the source of Bitcoin’s short-term weakness, CryptoQuant contributor J. A. Maartun highlighted sell-side pressure originating from the United States. Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange, showed particularly strong selling activity. Maartun shared on X that the Coinbase premium — the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance — remained significantly negative. As Bitcoin continues to test key support levels, traders are closely watching for signs of a reversal or further downside risk.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 18:10:11

Many crypto exchanges in the EU have delisted the dominant stablecoin USDT to comply with the MiCA. While the regulations aim to improve oversight and prevent crimes like money laundering, crypto experts warn that they might reduce market activity without fully achieving these goals. Could MiCA Hamper Market Liquidity? Crypto executives warn that the MiCA regulations may reduce market liquidity without meeting their intended goals, potentially making the EU less attractive to digital-asset traders at a crucial time. Usman Ahmad, CEO of Zodia Markets, explained that the removal of USDT, the most liquid stablecoin, limits options for EU clients. While Stablecoins like USDT are essential for crypto traders to transfer funds, move money across borders, and settle traditional assets, concerns have grown about their use in illegal activities, as witnessed in recent reports of Russian networks using USDT for illicit transactions. However, Tether has condemned these illegal uses and emphasized its commitment to preventing such activities. MiCA Requires Stablecoins On CEXs To Have E-Money License In an effort to tighten the oversight of the asset class, MiCA requires all stablecoins listed on centralized exchanges must be issued by a company with an e-money license. The issuers must keep up to two-thirds of reserves backing their tokens with an independent bank and monitor all transactions made for payment purposes While Circle has received this license, but Tether hasn’t yet obtained it, which could lead to its delisting by December 30. Even with MiCA in place, authorities need better tools to track illegal transactions, something that is not ready yet. USDT has been widely used in illegal activities, but Tether is working to address this with a new partnership aimed at combating financial crimes. Meanwhile, with President-elect Trump’s victory, there are rising expectations that the U.S. will adopt a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach, sparking a market rally. In contrast, Europe is witnessing declining crypto investments and venture capital in crypto startups is set to hit a four-year low, raising concerns that it may fall behind in the crypto market. Encouraging Signs However, there are some encouraging signs. Crypto ownership in the euro area has more than doubled to 9% since 2022, though the European Central Bank cautioned that the increase may be influenced by a change in survey methodology. Despite this growth, the removal of Tether (USDT) from platforms in the EU is expected to significantly reduce liquidity, as USDT has the most trading pairs globally. Traders are likely to face disruptions as they move away from USDT to other stablecoins or fiat pairs. Some exchanges, like OKX, have already seen traders shift to fiat pairs instead of using other stablecoins.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 18:14:54
