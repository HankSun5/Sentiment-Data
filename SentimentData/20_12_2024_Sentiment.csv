Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 22:38:00

Table of Contents The all-sports meme token with potential Dogecoin Shiba Inu Conclusion As cryptocurrencies reach new peaks and the bull run accelerates, traders are looking beyond Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for fresh opportunities. A rising star is capturing attention, promising potential that established meme coins might no longer offer. Introducing XYZVerse, an all-sport meme coin looking to unite fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports within a dynamic ecosystem with the potential to outperform previous successes. The all-sports meme token with potential Think of XYZ as an exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. It’s the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where savvy investors can cash in on the growing synergy between meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. Imagine the energy of Polymarket’s $1 billion trading volume during the U.S. presidential election with the viral appeal of meme coins and the excitement of sports fandom. With millions of fans gearing up to participate, the XYZVerse ecosystem is primed for explosive growth. Meme coins are dominating the crypto space in 2024 and XYZ could lead the pack.

You might also like: XYZ and DOGE prices to soar if BTC touches $150k: 2025 could be massive Dogecoin Dogecoin has seen significant changes, with its price increasing by 207.62% in the past six months. However, in the past week, its price dipped by 16.81%, indicating short-term volatility. The current price ranges between $0.35 and $0.42, hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.38 and $0.40. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.39, suggesting the coin is not overbought and may have the potential to rise. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.004012, but close to zero, which could point to a possible upward shift soon. If Dogecoin moves past the nearest resistance level at $0.51, it might reach the second resistance at $0.62, which would be an increase of around 34%. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $0.31, it could drop to the next support at $0.21, a decrease of about 41%. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge where the price might head next. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by about 20%. Looking at the last six months, SHIB’s price surged by nearly 42%, highlighting its strong growth over a longer period. The recent weekly dip might suggest a short-term correction. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 34.51, which is approaching oversold territory. This could signal a potential rebound in price soon. The Stochastic value is 23.71, also indicating possible undervaluation. SHIB is currently trading between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00003614. If the price breaks this level, it could see gains of around 13%. The nearest support level is at $0.00002006. Falling below this could lead to a decline of approximately 16%.

This surprise move lit a fire under selling across all altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) being hit hardest and crashing -26%, breaking its 40-day trendline too. Conversely, Altura ($ALU) displayed outstanding strength, remaining locked into a bullish falling wedge pattern, a technical pattern that often leads to a reversal upward. Render ($RENDER) Faces Dramatic Decline After Bitcoin’s Tumble Render’s large crash is due to Bitcoin overnight tanking. That penetration below the psychological level of $100,000 triggered panic and heavy selling pressure. For Render, it meant losing an important support level that had supported its recent uptrend. Render's price action is an indicator of investor indecision and reflects an oversold condition. However, any chance of a recovery ultimately prevents the token from regaining ground and retaking its trendline support. Altura ($ALU) Remains In Bullish Formation Even with the market volatility, Altura has stayed in an attractive technical setup. The falling wedge pattern in the token's position indicates a bullish breakout. This pattern develops when the price of an asset declines within an increasingly tighter range, often resulting in an eventual upward breakout. Source: Tradingview Altura ($ALU): What You Need to Know - Altura has been resilient against potential downturns, holding near its key support zones.- A falling wedge pattern provides a positive outlook with Altura well on track for a bounce.- If Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura could significantly benefit from bullish sentiment. How Altura ($ALU) Keeps Giving Reasons to Pay Attention Altura has weathered volatility with unflappability that speaks to its unique appeal and strong fundamentals. Here are some of the underlying factors that led to its bullish sentiment: Bullish Technical Pattern: The falling wedge setup strengthens confidence in a potential breakout. Unique Use Case: The common ranging of blockchain-based gaming solutions with tokenized in-game assets makes Altura a good potential long-term investment. Supportive User Base: A robust community strengthens the token’s ecosystem and ensures ongoing interest. Future Price Prediction for Render ($RENDER) and Altura ($ALU) Render ($RENDER): Keep an eye out for price stabilization. If the token manages to regain its 40-day trendline while neutralizing its oversold status, we could expect a rebound. Altura ($ALU): The line at the top of the falling wedge is the one traders should pay attention to. A breakout from this pattern would trigger a big upward momentum, confirming Altura's bullish trend. Conclusion: The recent market crash has taken a toll on altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) suffering significant losses. However, Altura ($ALU) stands out with its bullish pattern and strong fundamentals, making it a compelling asset to watch. As Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura's breakout potential positions it as a frontrunner in the event of a market rally. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Following the 2021 cycle pattern, where Bitcoin rose 40% above its moving averages, the peak price would reach around $339,000, according to the report.

Australian computer scientist Craig Wright has been handed a one-year sentence, suspended for two years, for filing a $1.2 trillion lawsuit against the payments firm Block. The judge says Wright violated a previous court order designed to keep him from filing further legal actions. The suspended sentence essentially means Wright would avoid jail if he meets certain conditions and does not commit another offense, although the judge noted Wright is living abroad in Asia and is likely not within jurisdiction of the court. Earlier this year, a UK judge ruled that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Wright is neither Satoshi nor the author of the Bitcoin white paper after he was sued by the nonprofit crypto advocacy group Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) for filing frivolous lawsuits against Bitcoin developers. In November, COPA went on to claim that Wright violated an injunction by filing a lawsuit against Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s payments firm. According to the report, the injunction was set in place to prevent Wright from filing BTC-related lawsuits on the grounds that he is Satoshi and Judge James Mellor found Wright to be in contempt of court following a hearing Wednesday.

Two days ago on the social media platform X, the top US-based crypto exchange platform said it had added Parcl ( PARCL ), a decentralized exchange (DEX) that lets users trade and invest in real estate using synthetic assets without the need to physically own any property. Synthetic assets are tokenized, blockchain-based representations of real-world assets, such as securities and real property that can easily be swapped. News of the addition caused the token to dip in price as it went from a peak of $0.586 on December 17th to a low of $0.408 just two days later. PARCL is trading for $0.418 a time of writing, a 9% decrease during the last 24 hours. On December 15th, Coinbase added PARCL to its listing roadmap, signaling at the time that it was going to add support soon. At that time, the crypto exchange’s announcement triggered a 50% rally of the altcoin as it was moving for just $0.33 on December 10th. PARCL aims to provide traders with global city indexes – including major cities such as New York, Miami Beach, San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dubai – and allow them to acquire tokens that represent a stake in a specific index.

The latest $1.53 billion investment brings MARA’s total holdings to 44,394 BTC. At the current spot price of $100,151 per Bitcoin, the company’s holdings are valued at approximately $4.45 billion. The firm currently ranks second on the list of publicly traded companies with the largest BTC holdings globally. MARA has said the purchase was enabled by the $1.925 billion in proceeds from two offerings of 0% convertible senior notes, announced in late November and early December. This calculated move is similar to a strategy employed and popularized by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor involving large-scale BTC accumulation. According to Saylor, it’s a matter of time before MARA Holdings enters the Nasdaq 100 index. MARA seizes opportunity to buy Bitcoin after Federal Reserve Chair’s remarks MARA’s timing is interesting. They announced this purchase just a day after Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, stated that the central bank couldn’t own Bitcoin. Furthermore, the purchase coincided with a fall in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin plunged by 5.6% during Wednesday’s session, testing levels below the $100,000 mark. This marked the largest single-day drop since August 5. The fall was preceded by a wider sell-off sparked by the Fed’s hawkish comments about the interest rate trajectory and how it may possibly drop in 2025. For a brief period, Bitcoin seemed poised to surpass the $100k milestone. However, two factors contributed to its pullback: Powell’s remarks served as a major catalyst, and lingering skepticism about Bitcoin’s viability as a reserve asset added to the downward pressure. Bitcoin Miners boost reserves by purchasing on the open market Bitcoin miners are beginning to purchase Bitcoin on the open market. Hut 8 (HUT) is one of the latest Bitcoin miners to do so. Other dominant miners include MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings. The Miami-based Hut 8 announced on Thursday that it had purchased 990 BTC at an average price of $101,710 each. The acquisition increased its Bitcoin reserves to 10,096 BTC, with a total value of around $1 billion. The firm, after the latest acquisition, appears among the top ten largest corporate Bitcoin holders. The current rush for Bitcoin by miner firms is an indication of progress. Soon, these firms will control large percentages of cryptocurrency, thus, raising their market influence and overall valuation.

According to a Reuters report, geothermal energy startups are on the increase as big tech firms are looking at feeding their power-intensive data centers. Despite this surge, long-term investments in the sector remain uncertain as oil majors double down on gas. Simply put, geothermal energy is heat energy from the earth. Geothermal energy startups increased in the last two years According to Bryant Jones, the executive director for the industry association Geothermal Rising, the environment has been improving lately, in terms of ease of doing business which has seen more than 60 startups spring to life in the last two years. “Texas is becoming the ‘place to be’ for geothermal exploration and development across the board,” said Matt Welch at the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance (TxGEA). “Much of this is due to an abundance of identified geothermal resources, 1-stop shopping permitting process, and our regulatory certainty.” Welch. According to an industry report published last year, at least 10 of the geothermal startups launched between 2016 and 2022 in the US were headquartered in Texas. Now, the obtaining lower commodity prices might encourage more shale companies to diversify their revenue streams and tap into geothermal power. The Enhanced Geothermal Shot analysis in 2022 confirmed the potential for more geothermal electricity generating capacity – 90 gigawatts by 2050. These developments also come as AI data centers have emerged as high-energy consumers, forcing big techs to look elsewhere for alternative energy sources to keep their data centers running with sufficient and sustainable power. “We believe geothermal, along with abundant natural gas, can be part of the all-of-the-above energy mix we need to meet the demand,” said Trey Lowe, chief technology officer at U.S. shale gas producer Devon Energy (DVN.N), an investor in geothermal startup Fervo Energy. Big techs back the geothermal energy startups According to a Reuters report, social media giant, Meta and search engine giant Google rank among the tech firms that are partnering with these startup companies offering to produce geothermal electricity, to power their data centers. The report further highlights that geothermal energy has been promoted as a faster way to generate carbon-free power compared to nuclear and without the intermittency of wind and solar. However, the new startups do not have it easy as they face high upfront costs, especially for drilling coupled with long project approval times. These high costs have dampened the initial zeal, with limited investment so far, analysts estimate just over $700 million in financing as been contributed to overall geothermal power projects since 2020. But the sector is also receiving bipartisan interest with the CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passing the House and now awaiting Senate approval. If these become law, this will, according to Reuters, make it easier to set up geothermal projects across the US. The sector is receiving increased bipartisan interest as well. The CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passed the House and are awaiting Senate approval. If they become law, it would make it easier to set up geothermal projects in the country. Now, top shale oil producers Chevron, Diamondback Energy, and Exxon Mobil have started advocating for gas as the mainstay fuel for electric power, offering to work with utilities to add to their power plants with carbon sequestration that generates greenhouse emissions. “In general, (there is) a lot more interest from smaller oil and gas producers as well as service companies … we’ve talked to Chevron and Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab but the supermajors seem to be taking more of a wait-and-watch view,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, which is developing energy storage and geothermal baseload technologies deep in the earth. According to Reuters, Sage recently completed a $30 million fundraising which was led by Expand Energy – a US shale gas producer. The company plans to launch the Series B round in January. Colorado-based Gradient Geothermal -which generates geothermal energy using existing oil and gas infrastructure – announced it was providing Chord Energy services to help generate power at one of its oil and gas in North Dakota. Johanna Ostrum, Gradient CEO said most mid-size and smaller independent energy firms were interested in geothermal energy for their own needs, not to create electricity for resale.

We must take a comprehensive, clear stance on taxes, regulations, and cybersecurity before the Trump administration takes office.” Japanese Minister of Digital Affairs Takuya Hirai Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to reporters on the death of Tsuneo Watanabe, editor-in-chief of The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, describing him as a “great Journalist.” https://t.co/4FTHqGOZMo — The Japan News (@The_Japan_News) December 19, 2024 Experts think Tokyo wants to cement any new changes in Japan’s cryptocurrency policy by the time Trump takes office. These changes could include tax reform, in addition to new regulations and cybersecurity laws. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society forms policy recommendations for the government’s consideration. However, Ishiba’s office is under no obligation to accept or incorporate these recommendations. Indeed, in recent weeks, the Prime Minister refused to commit to tax reform or the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs in Japan. Ishiba has appointed lawmakers known to be in favor of crypto reform to ministerial positions . He also mentioned blockchain technology in his election manifesto. However, voices outside the LDP have also called for “urgent” reform. Opposition leaders have also warned repeatedly that capital is flowing out of the country as a result of an “unfair” taxation system for crypto investors. Japan's central bank kept its monetary policy settings steady, signaling it sees little urgency to raise interest rates for now https://t.co/xYQANqP0nF — Bloomberg (@business) December 19, 2024 While many other nations charge traders flat capital gains taxes at rates of about 20%, Japan’s tax rules instead oblige crypto traders to declare their crypto profits on their annual income tax declarations. They must file crypto trading profits under “other income.” And that means that the nation’s highest earners can end up paying up to 55% on their crypto trading revenues. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society said its proposal was of “urgent” importance. On X, Hirai wrote that the LDP had been working on crypto legislation “faster” than any party “in the world.” The post Japan’s Ruling Party Still Pushing for Crypto Tax Reform Despite PM’s Caution appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-19 23:30:00

Here’s the nearest on-chain level that the asset would end up retesting if the drawdown elongates. 1 Week To 1 Month Bitcoin Holders Have Their Realized Price At $97,900 As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old BTC investors is the closest support for the asset right now. Related Reading: Secret Bitcoin Driver: Exchanges Receiving $40 Million USDT Fuel Per Day The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition price of the average holder on the Bitcoin network. When the metric’s value is lower than the spot price of the cryptocurrency, it means the investors as a whole can be considered to be holding a net amount of profit. On the other hand, it being under the BTC value suggests the dominance of loss in the market. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a particular segment of the sector is of interest: the 1-week to 1-month-old holders. This cohort includes the addresses that have been holding their coins for at least one week and, at most, one month. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the Realized Price of this Bitcoin group has changed over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old Bitcoin investors has been climbing up alongside the price rally. This is naturally due to the fact that the cohort’s cost basis has been getting repriced to higher levels as new investors have been purchasing at the rally highs. Currently, the indicator’s value sits at $97,900, so these investors would be in profit at the current price. Earlier in the past day, however, the asset came dangerously close to retesting the level as its price saw a brief dip below $99,000. The 1 week to 1 month old investors make up a section of a larger cohort known as the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs are broadly defined as the holders who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell. So, the STHs, and especially the 1-week to 1-month-old segment, would contain the holders with the least amount of resolve in the sector, owing to their low holding time. Because of how fickle they are, the STHs generally show some kind of reaction whenever their average cost basis gets retested by the Bitcoin price. This reaction may come in the form of buying when the retest occurs from above, as these holders could believe the decline to be just a ‘dip.’ As such, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old STHs, which is below the current price, could be looked at as a support level for the cryptocurrency. The level has also already helped the asset out once this month.

With the market constantly evolving, some coins are capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike with groundbreaking innovations and extraordinary potential. VeChain and Fantom are making waves with their recent developments. However, a unique contender, Qubetics ($TICS), is leading the charge with its remarkable presale performance and advanced Web3 solutions. While VeChain has just secured an innovative patent, and Fantom is gearing up for a transformative upgrade, Qubetics is stealing the spotlight. Packed with massive potential for returns, its presale generates significant buzz in the crypto community. This article will cover all three coins’ latest updates and developments—Qubetics, VeChain, and Fantom. Qubetics: Transforming Privacy with Its Decentralised VPN Service What if the internet could be accessed without the risks of surveillance or censorship? As part of its comprehensive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that’s set to redefine online privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPN providers that can log and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN leverages a peer-to-peer network powered by blockchain technology. This ensures user traffic remains entirely decentralised and free from centralised control. The dVPN offers more than just anonymity—it brings transparency and resistance to censorship. Its multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption protect user identities while providing secure, unrestricted internet access. Moreover, the innovative tokenised incentive structure rewards users who contribute bandwidth with $TICS tokens, making the network self-sustaining and encouraging active participation. Adding to the excitement, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to engage with its growing community, answering critical questions and showcasing the platform’s potential. With its cutting-edge features and interactive approach, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to join today . VeChain’s Breakthrough: Secure Data Handling with a New Patent VeChain continues to solidify its position as a leader in enterprise-focused blockchain solutions. The company recently secured a U.S. patent, approved on 17 December 2024, for a groundbreaking system to enhance data security. This patent leverages a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and securely split transaction keys, significantly improving secure data handling capabilities. The innovative key management system (KMS) outlined in the patent enables businesses to safeguard sensitive information effectively. With these advancements, VeChain is reinforcing its role as a pioneer in enterprise blockchain technology, setting new standards in security and reliability. Fantom’s Sonic Mainnet: A Game-Changer in Performance and Scalability Fantom (FTM) is on the rise, surging 16% on 15 December in anticipation of its rebranding and the rollout of the Sonic mainnet. This major upgrade boosts network efficiency, making Fantom faster and more cost-effective. As part of the update, FTM tokens will transition to Sonic (S) through a 1:1 swap, which has sparked considerable excitement among investors. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicate increased demand and positive inflows, supporting Fantom’s bullish trajectory. With support levels firmly established at $1.2, analysts are eyeing resistance points at $1.6 and potentially $2.38, making Fantom a compelling choice for growth-focused investors. Presale Spotlight: Why Qubetics Is the Talk of the Crypto World Investors seeking high returns focus on the Qubetics presale, currently in Phase 13. Each phase witnesses a 10% price increase, with the final stage set to jump by 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.034, and the project has already raised over $7.2 million. Analysts predict that once the mainnet launches, $TICS could soar to between $10 and $15 per token. Imagine investing today and reaping an ROI of over 29,000% if the price hits $10, or an astonishing 43,000% if it climbs to $15. These numbers are no mere speculation—Qubetics has already demonstrated immense traction, proving why it’s one of the best cryptos to join today. The structured price hikes add urgency for investors to act swiftly, securing their position in this promising project before the next phase increases token costs. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads the Pack in Crypto Innovation The crypto market is brimming with potential, and coins like VeChain and Fantom are making commendable strides with their latest updates. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a game-changer, combining innovative Web3 solutions with an electrifying presale that promises exceptional returns. Analysts’ predictions of staggering ROIs and the platform’s robust community engagement make it one of the best cryptos to join today. Don’t miss the chance to be part of Qubetics’ transformative journey. With the presale progressing rapidly, now is the time to act and secure your stake in what could be the next big thing in crypto.

After briefly retesting $99,000, Bitcoin’s price momentum has slowed, raising questions about whether this signals the start of a larger sell-off or a temporary pause in its uptrend. Analysts Highlight BTC Price Key Levels Crypto trader Ali Charts has put a lot of emphasis on the $96,000 level. He explained that if Bitcoin price moves below this level, the following significant points will be $90,000 and $85,000. This view is consistent with the historical Fibonacci levels of retrace commonly employed by traders to understand market reversals. “Keeping it simple, based on the Fib, if Bitcoin loses $96,000, the next focus becomes $90,000 and $85,000,” Ali tweeted. To this, Robert Kiyosaki , a supporter of Bitcoin, said that it is never too late to join the market. He pointed to Bitcoin’s stability and capability to generate riches, saying, “Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich, including those who come in late. Just don’t get greedy.” Long-Term Holders Take Profits as Short-Term Investors Step In Using data from Glassnode, some changes have been observed in the activity of long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs). In the two months period, the total supply held by LTHs has been decreasing from $14.23 billion to $13.31 billion. This comes as BTC price soared from $58,000 to over $100,000 suggesting that institutional investors are booking profits at local highs. However, these sales by the long-term holders have been taken by the short-term holders (STHs) to ensure that the prices are maintained. Glassnode analysts pointed out that “the share of wealth owned by new investors has not yet reached the levels that were seen during the previous cycle peaks” which may mean that there is still some room for growth. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Remains Intact However, based on the correction, some analysts continue to hold the view that the price of Bitcoin is still bullish. The AVIV Ratio, which looks at unrealized profits, is at 1.81, far from the levels that are considered extremely high and which usually signify a reversal in market trends. This means that although some traders may have taken their profits, the market has not become overly aggressive. Meanwhile, the Titan of Crypto still has the positive outlook about Bitcoin’s future. He stressed that Bitcoin has been making higher highs and higher lows which is a positive indication that the trend remains bullish. ”BTC bullish momentum remains strong, with the next target at the 100% Fibonacci extension of $113,000,” he stated. Institutional Demand Could Propel Bitcoin Further The adoption of Bitcoin has remained strong, with Bitcoin ETFs hitting a top of $37 billion in assets by December 19th. This represents a sharp rise from the $24.23 billion at the beginning of November as highlighted by Farside Investors. At the same time, statistics show that at the peak of Bitcoin at $108,000, 62.17% of traders had short positions, expecting the price to fall. However, as Bitcoin dropped to $96,000, the sentiment changed as 55.44% of the traders are now bullish because they anticipate a rally in the price of the cryptocurrency. Supporting this price trend, analysts at Bitfinex believe that the price correction of Bitcoin will be relatively mild owing to the rising demand from institutional investors. They expect it to be at $145,000 by mid-2025, with a possibility of rising to $200,000 in a better environment. Furthermore, in light of the growing talk about the potential of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset at the national level, experts estimate that such a decision could take Bitcoin’s price to $1 million.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 23:57:00

Crypto All-Stars has wrapped up a stellar presale with a $22.64 million haul, solidifying its position as a meme coin powerhouse. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the show with its presale, which has already surpassed $4.2 million in Stage 12. On the flip side, Mog Coin (MOG), once hailed as a meme coin with promise, is struggling to hold its ground amid bearish market conditions. Meme coins have grown beyond being internet jokes. They now represent a unique blend of community power, creative use cases, and, of course, the potential for exponential profits. BTFD Coin is leading this new wave of meme coin evolution with its P2E game, lucrative referral program, staking rewards, and a vibrant community. Let’s dive into why BTFD, Crypto All-Stars, and Mog Coin are the most talked-about meme coins right now and which of them stands out as the best for exponential returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Rising Star in Meme Coins BTFD Coin has taken the meme coin world by storm, and it’s easy to see why. Starting at an initial price of $0.000004, the coin has climbed to $0.00013 in Stage 12 of its presale. With over 57 billion coins sold and $4.2 million raised so far, the numbers speak for themselves. With just four stages left, the presale momentum is building rapidly, and the coin’s listing price of $0.0006 promises substantial short-term returns. BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its presale. Its P2E game offers an engaging way for users to earn rewards, while the referral program incentivises community growth by rewarding users for bringing in new investors. Add in the 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got a project that caters to both gamers and crypto enthusiasts looking for passive income. Here’s an investment scenario to paint the picture. If you invest $30,000 in Stage 12 at $0.00013 per coin, you’d acquire approximately 230.7 million BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would grow to $138,420. That’s the kind of growth that has investors flocking to the project. Why is BTFD one of the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its explosive crypto presale , innovative features, and strong community backing make it a top choice for investors looking to capitalise on the meme coin trend. With the price increasing at every stage, now’s the time to jump in. Crypto All-Stars (STARS): The MemeVault Revolution Crypto All-Stars has already proven itself as a meme coin heavyweight. Its presale, which concluded with $22.64 million raised, set the stage for the launch of its groundbreaking MemeVault—a platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins, including PEPE, Dogecoin, and Floki, under one roof. This innovation has brought a sense of unity to the meme coin community, making $STARS a must-have token for enthusiasts. The $STARS token, priced at $0.0016782 during the presale, comes with lucrative staking rewards of up to 1429% APY. This high return has attracted both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. By reducing the circulating supply through staking incentives, Crypto All-Stars creates scarcity, which often leads to price surges once the token is listed. With the $STARS token set to launch on Uniswap next week, anticipation is building. Early adopters are expected to see substantial gains as more meme coin holders flock to the platform. The MemeVault itself is a game-changer, offering a streamlined way to manage and stake meme coins while earning rewards. Why does $STARS rank among the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its successful presale, innovative staking platform, and upcoming launch make it a strong contender for both short-term and long-term gains. For those who missed the presale, the token launch presents a second chance to get in on the action. Mog Coin (MOG): A Meme Coin Facing Challenges Mog Coin (MOG) entered the scene with a lot of promise, leveraging its quirky branding and strong community backing. However, recent market conditions have posed significant challenges. Once a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts, MOG is now battling bearish pressure that has left its performance lagging behind competitors like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars. MOG’s initial appeal lay in its community-driven initiatives and its potential to carve out a niche in the meme coin space. However, the lack of new developments and a clear roadmap has made it difficult for the project to sustain its early momentum. While the coin still has a loyal following, its price movements have been lacklustre, leaving investors cautious. For MOG to regain its footing, it needs a fresh narrative or a major update to its ecosystem. Without these, it risks falling further behind in a market that thrives on innovation and community engagement. While some investors are holding on in the hope of a turnaround, others are shifting their focus to projects like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars, which offer clearer paths to exponential profits. Why does MOG make this list? Its initial success and strong community give it a place among notable meme coins, but its current struggles highlight the importance of staying ahead in a competitive market. For now, MOG is a speculative play rather than a reliable choice for significant returns. The Concluding Remarks: What Are the Best Meme Coins for Exponential Growth Next Year? Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market offers a wealth of opportunities for investors seeking exponential profits. BTFD Coin is the best meme coin for exponential profits, thanks to its stellar presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support. A $30,000 investment in Stage 12 could grow to $138,420 by the end of the presale, showcasing its immense potential. Crypto All-Stars is another standout, with its MemeVault innovation and successful presale setting the stage for substantial gains. While Mog Coin has its merits, its current challenges make it a riskier option compared to its competitors. If you’re ready to capitalise on these opportunities, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin meme coin presale today and position yourself for exponential profits in the ever-evolving meme coin market. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing in crypto.

The video included a disclaimer suggesting there’s no guarantee the cap won’t be altered. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is a cornerstone of its value as a store of wealth, and any change could fundamentally impact its perception among investors. In the video, BlackRock highlighted Bitcoin’s 21 million cap, noting it as a “hard-coded rule” that controls supply, purchasing power, and prevents excessive currency creation. However, the disclaimer stated: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor reposted the video, sparking criticism. Joel Valenzuela, Dashpay’s marketing director, commented, “When the supply cap increase happens, it will have ‘always been part of the plan.’ And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say Bitcoin wasn’t hijacked.” Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis added, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Is Bitcoin’s Supply Cap Changeable? Bitcoin developer Super Testnet, known for BitVM, explained that altering Bitcoin’s supply cap would depend on how one defines “Bitcoin.” In theory, the cap could change if a majority of the community—node operators, developers, miners, and investors—reached consensus on a hard fork. Such a change would involve a proposal to gauge consensus, followed by implementing changes in Bitcoin Core. If most node operators and miners adopted the new fork, it would create a “new” Bitcoin network with an uncapped supply. However, Super Testnet argued that this new chain wouldn’t truly be Bitcoin. “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” they said. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” In essence, an uncapped version wouldn’t be Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FORKS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 00:36:00

The SEC is reviewing these products to ensure whether they follow regulations and protect investors. This move helps bring digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem by preventing from frauds. Nasdaq and Cboe BZX Exchange crypto index ETF Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange changed their rules for listing and trading with exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to spot bitcoin and ether ETF. Nasdaq intends to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, while the Cboe BZX Exchange aims to introduce the Franklin Crypto Index ETF. These ETPs will directly hold spot bitcoin and ether and cash equivalents. The goal of listing these assets on the exchanges is to increase their accessibility. SEC’s Role in Regulating The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is reviewing these listings according to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which sets rules for trading securities on exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe BZX, for ensuring fairness and transparency. The Securities Act of 1933 regulates how securities are issued and required proper disclosures to protect investors on Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange. The Investment Company Act of 1940 governs investment products like ETFs to ensure they follow rules that protect investors. In addition to this, The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) regulates financial products linked to bitcoin and ether as commodities. The proposed Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act could shape future cryptocurrency regulations to ensure safe investment practices. The SEC believes that the proposed rule changes meet these requirements, especially those to prevent fraud and market manipulation. Additionally, the Commission emphasizes the necessity of surveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges to detect fraudulent activities and maintain market integrity. To minimize the risk of market manipulation, the SEC investigates how the spot markets for assets like bitcoin and ether that are correlated with their futures markets. In previous approvals for Bitcoin and Ether-based ETPs, the SEC confirmed that price movements in spot markets which closely reflected in futures markets. This correlation indicates that if manipulation or fraud occurs in the spot market, it is more like an evident in the futures market, which is easier to monitor. The CME’s bitcoin and ether futures markets have exhibited strong correlations with their spot markets, giving the SEC confidence that these new ETFs can be effectively supervised. The SEC has decided that the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and the Franklin Crypto Index ETF follow all necessary rules. These products are in line with past approvals of similar bitcoin and ether-based investment products. By introducing these new ETPs, investors will have access to spot bitcoin and ether in a regulated environment, which enhances security and transparency in their cryptocurrency investments. This approval is an important step in bringing digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem, with the help of SEC.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.58 million YouTube subscribers that ETH will likely break through its all-time high and enter an explosive phase this cycle. “Barring any black swan events spoiling our party, we should be able to take for granted that ETH will break through its previous all-time high of around $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Where it goes from there, though, is the real question. Because ETH has spent so much time sliding against BTC and wallowing in price purgatory, it can be difficult to imagine a parabolic repricing. However, once the all-time high is broken, there will be no historical levels of supply or resistance above. Price discovery will ensue, and ETH is likely to teleport moonwards.” Crypto traders and analysts refer to price discovery as a situation where a coin trades at levels never seen before or not having been seen in a long time. Next, the analyst uses Fibonacci extension levels to suggest that ETH may surge to $7,300 as a “base case,” which is the 1.618 Fibonacci level on the chart he shares. Traders use Fibonacci extensions in technical analysis to estimate profit targets and price pullbacks. They are based on Fibonacci ratios. Source: Guy Turner/YouTube However, he says if Bitcoin nearly doubles its current price next year and hits $200,000, ETH could surge even higher, to $14,600. “ETH has only just made it to the 0.786 [Fibonacci] level. So rather than doubling this price, we think doubling ETH price at the 1.618 level will give us a better upper limit of what could happen in 2025. This 1.618 level is about $7,300 which, again, we think is a pretty good base case target. Doubling this would give us $14,600. For an asset that has underperformed BTC so severely, this sounds like a tall order indeed, and it’s therefore the most extreme bullish case for 2025 that we can take seriously. If BTC touches $200,000 in 2025 orthodoxy suggests that profits will rotate into ETH. With BTC at such a high level, this could be enough capital to bring ETH up above $14,000.” Ethereum is trading for $3,686 at time of writing, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $101,143 at time of writing, down 4.6% on the day.

Following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply below $99,000. However, the leading crypto quickly rebounded, climbing back to $104,000 earlier today before settling at $100,573 at the time of writing. This represents a 3.4% decrease over the past day and a roughly $67 billion reduction in its market cap valuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Momentum Shifts As Spot Market Outpaces Futures – Here’s What It Means Exchange Transactions Hit Record Lows Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst known as Woominkyu provided insights into Bitcoin’s market activity, highlighting declining exchange transaction volumes. According to Woominkyu, historical data suggests a correlation between transaction volume spikes and significant price movements. For example, peaks in exchange transactions coincided with Bitcoin’s dramatic price surges in 2017 and 2021. However, recent data shows a marked decline in transaction volumes on both spot and derivative exchanges, reflecting reduced trading activity compared to previous years. This decrease, according to the CryptoQuant analyst may indicate “waning market participation,” suggesting a “period of consolidation or reduced volatility” in the near term. Bitcoin Key Support Levels and Technical Insights Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shed light on an important support zone forming just below the $100,000 mark. The data shared by the platform reveals that over 1.45 million BTC were accumulated at an average price of $97,500. This accumulation has established a significant demand zone, potentially serving as a “buffer” against further price declines. The importance of this level lies in its ability to provide a foundation for price stability, particularly as Bitcoin navigates its current phase of market correction. It is suggested that a breach below this zone could trigger further downward pressure, while holding above it might boost recovery efforts. Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, insights shared by market analyst Satoshi Wolf highlight the critical nature of Bitcoin’s current price levels. The cryptocurrency recently tested the $100,000 support, aligning with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Related Reading: Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? Top Exec Discusses The Market Crash This level is pivotal as it combines technical indicators with psychological significance. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows bearish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nears oversold territory, signalling the potential for a price reversal. Wolf suggests that traders monitor for a confirmed breakout above $104,000 or a breakdown below $100,000, with volume confirmation being key to validating either. 📊 $BTC Analysis: The chart shows a recent pullback after a strong uptrend, suggesting potential profit-taking. Price is testing the 100,000 support, aligning with the 100 EMA, a crucial level to watch. If it holds, a bounce back towards 104,000 resistance is possible.

Render is currently experiencing strong market momentum, indicated by its recent price increases and expanding partnerships that signal potential for future growth in its GPU-powered decentralized network. Stacks has achieved a significant milestone with the launch of the ‘Nakamoto’ upgrade, enhancing both speed and security, and it has set ambitious price targets following an increase in user engagement and smart contract activity. Web3Bay is introducing a transformative e-commerce ecosystem built on blockchain technology, aiming to revolutionize online shopping with enhanced security, community-driven governance, and versatile transaction options. As each project develops, Web3Bay is particularly notable for its innovative approach to merging decentralized shopping experiences within a community-oriented platform. Render Sees Growing Momentum Render has been capitalizing on bullish market trends, supported by its decentralized GPU rendering network that connects creators with GPU resources. This platform provides an economical and efficient solution for rendering tasks, gaining popularity among artists, developers, and creatives who require high-performance graphics at lower costs. With a significant 21.39% price increase over the past week, Render is garnering increasing market attention, especially as it nears critical price thresholds. Render’s growth is bolstered by strategic partnerships, including a recent collaboration with Apple, enhancing its credibility and market reach. Analysts are optimistic about RNDR’s potential, with projections of substantial price increases in the near future. Render’s dedication to delivering cost-effective, high-quality rendering services positions it as a preferred provider in the sector. Stacks Enhances Capabilities with Nakamoto Upgrade Stacks is strengthening its foundation for Bitcoin-based smart contracts with the Nakamoto upgrade, marking a significant advancement in transaction speed and security, which benefits developers of decentralized applications. This upgrade has contributed to a price surge of over 30% in the past month, driven by unprecedented levels of smart contract deployment and growing interest in its ecosystem. Stacks is increasingly recognized for its ability to extend Bitcoin’s functionality, attracting more users to decentralized finance and applications. With rising adoption and an increase in total value locked, there is a strong sentiment about STX’s potential for further gains. The project’s emphasis on enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities positions it as an exciting option for long-term decentralized solutions. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-commerce Web3Bay is redefining the online shopping experience with its blockchain-based e-commerce platform. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay offers a decentralized marketplace that empowers users to fully control their data and transactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay enhances security, transparency, and user experience, bridging the gap between conventional e-commerce and Web3. It supports transactions using both cryptocurrencies and mainstream payment methods like PayPal, broadening its accessibility. The 3BAY token, integral to Web3Bay’s operations, has shown impressive returns for early investors. During its presale stages, the price of 3BAY has consistently risen, achieving a remarkable 6430% return on investment for those who participated early. The strong demand and growth potential are evident as Web3Bay gears up for its full launch. Web3Bay’s unique model fosters significant network growth by rewarding active user engagement, making community interaction a key driver of its development. This community-centric approach, coupled with decentralized governance, ensures the platform remains responsive to user needs, promoting continued growth and adding value to the 3BAY token.

With a progressive approach to e-commerce and a robust token economy, Web3Bay is positioning the 3BAY token as an attractive investment for those looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized, community-driven online commerce. In Conclusion While each project—Web3Bay, Render, and Stacks—brings unique strengths, Web3Bay’s comprehensive e-commerce ecosystem sets it apart as a standout choice. Render’s ongoing bullish momentum in the graphics field and Stacks’ ambitious targets with its Bitcoin-focused smart contracts are notable, but Web3Bay’s integration of blockchain technology with online shopping, creating a community-based marketplace, presents a compelling case. With high ROI potential and the prospect of becoming a next 100x asset, Web3Bay’s decentralized, user-centric model makes it an appealing choice for those exploring the innovative frontiers of e-commerce on the blockchain.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 01:28:00

This marks a major step toward integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum into traditional financial markets through regulated investment products. Dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to Be Listed on Nasdaq and Cboe BZX The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and Franklin Templeton Crypto Index ETF received the green light from the SEC to trade in the public market. These ETFs will be available for trading on the Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX exchanges, allowing investors to directly trade in Bitcoin and Ethereum spot. All the two funds will own Bitcoin, Ethereum, cash, and cash equivalents as part of their structure. By permitting these ETFs, the SEC guarantees that crypto investments meet some of the most important laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. SEC has *approved* both the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF & Franklin Crypto Index ETF… Will initially hold both btc & eth. pic.twitter.com/5GUhhhXL7y — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 19, 2024 The approval process also contained measures for market surveillance in order to prevent fraud and manipulation. The decision will help digital assets to have a better standing and acceptance in the financial system. Market Turbulence Surrounds SEC Decision The US SEC’s decision is made at the time of high volatility of cryptocurrency markets. However, Bitcoin price declined significantly and was trading at slightly above $96,000, having previously traded at above $108,000 earlier in the week. Ethereum also went down by 15% and was trading at $3,440. As per the data from CoinGlass, more than $1 billion worth of crypto was liquidated within the last 24 hours. However, experts believe that the launch of these ETFs will help to stabilize the crypto market and, therefore, attract more institutional investors. “This move created a clear, legally compliant way for investors to get involved with digital assets,” said a market analyst. ETFs Bring Enhanced Oversight and Transparency The ETFs are intended to mimic market capitalization-weighted indexes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, thus providing investors with an opportunity to invest in both of them without owning the coins directly. The Hashdex ETF will track the Nasdaq Crypto Index and Franklin Templeton’s fund will be linked to the CF Institutional Digital Asset Index. In a bid to counter allegations of market manipulation, the US SEC noted that the price movements in the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot markets are in tandem with their respective futures markets. This correlation makes it easy to have supervision through sharing of surveillance data. To assess the price integrity, the SEC has used information from the CME’s Bitcoin and Ethereum futures markets. To avoid diversifying their strategies into staking or generating income from airdrops, both funds do not allow such operations in their investment approach based on spot prices. These measures are part of the regulatory systems to safeguard the investors’ interest as well as to enhance transparency of ETFs. Future Prospects for Crypto ETFs This approval could pave the way for additional cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States. Bloomberg analysts predict Litecoin ETFs could be next, given its classification as a commodity and its close relationship with Bitcoin. However, other digital assets, such as Solana and XRP, face greater regulatory scrutiny. The US SEC’s approval of these ETFs reflects a cautious but constructive approach to cryptocurrency regulation. By aligning these products with existing financial laws, the SEC is enabling safer participation in the digital asset market. This decision could encourage more institutional and retail investors to explore cryptocurrency as part of a diversified portfolio.

The funding is part of the orgainzation’s most recent round of Bitcoin Development Fund grants. During the last round of the Bitcoin Development Fund Grant in 2022, the HRF granted $325,000 to various projects worldwide. This year, the organization has gone bigger and better, granting 7 BTC, approximately $706,000, to twenty projects worldwide according to the press release it sent to the Bitcoin Magazine. The HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund is focused on supporting projects that enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem. It especially has interests in regions where people live under unfavorable conditions. The program funds projects that promote decentralization, privacy, and education, and its goal is to empower individuals and communities facing oppressive regimes. HRF reaches a hand out The guarantees for the HRF’s Bitcoin development fund are projects in Latin America, Asia, and Africa that focus on technical education in regions with authoritarian governments. The organization did not disclose how much each of this round’s recipients will receive. However, it revealed that the 20 awarded projects will share a grand total of 7 BTC. The winning projects from this round include Stratum V2 Reference Implementation (SRI), an open-source software and Public Pool, an open-source mining pool. Both projects are centered around making Bitcoin more accessible and decentralized. Other projects include UI/UX Design for Bitcoin Core, No BS Bitcoin, Tando, YakiHonne, and many more. Each of these projects contributes to the accessibility and decentralization of Bitcoin in their various regions. HRF rewards odds-defying individuals Among the guarantees of the $706,000 grant are Naiyoma and Daniella Brozzoni. Naiyoma is the first female Bitcoin core developer from Africa. Kenya, where Naiyoma hails from, has experienced instances of electoral authoritarianism. Financial freedom and human rights are also under threat. Considering this, Naiyoma is dedicated to creating an open financial system rooted in transparency, freedom, and fairness. Her work focuses on reviewing pull requests, fixing bugs through new PRs, and improving Bitcoin Core’s code base. The HRF fund allocation is expected to support her work in advancing Bitcoin Core. Daniella Brozzoni is also a developer. She previously contributed to the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK), a software library that supports building cross-platform Bitcoin wallets. Like Naiyoma, Daniella now also focuses on Bitcoin Core, where her job includes reviewing key pull requests, contributing to new features, and improving test coverage. The work of these dedicated developers will contribute to the decentralization of Bitcoin making it more accessible, secure and resilient.

With so many options on the market, keeping an eye on promising developments is crucial. While many investors are focused on mainstream coins, emerging projects often hold the potential for exponential returns. Filecoin has been making headlines with its ambitious price predictions, and Stacks continues to garner attention for its innovative approach to blockchain utility. However, the spotlight is firmly on Qubetics ($TICS), a revolutionary blockchain platform that’s capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. Its presale momentum and groundbreaking technology are turning heads in the crypto space. This article will cover the latest updates and developments around Qubetics, Filecoin, and Stacks—three of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Qubetics: Cross-Border Payments Redefined What if financial institutions could execute cross-border payments instantly, securely, and at a fraction of the current costs? Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a solution that makes this possible, empowering banks and financial institutions to streamline international transactions. By leveraging the $TICS token, Qubetics addresses long-standing inefficiencies in global payment systems. Traditional cross-border payments often come with delays, high fees, and a lack of transparency. Qubetics flips this narrative, enabling swift, transparent transactions that cater to the needs of both corporate entities and individuals. For businesses, this means quicker settlements, improved cash flow, and the ability to stay competitive in global markets. It simplifies remittances and international transfers for individuals, ensuring money reaches its destination without undue complications. Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to enhance community engagement, addressing queries from its rapidly growing audience. Such transparency and involvement only make it one of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Filecoin: The Backbone of Decentralised Storage Filecoin is gaining traction as a decentralised storage network that aims to preserve the world’s most critical data securely.

For XRP, the support at $2.20 plays an important role. Since the beginning of December 2024, the altcoin has reached this level more than four times, and each time it has experienced an upside rally. However, this time, sentiment appears to be similar, as the price has started moving upward. Long-Term Holders Rising Interest in XRP The current market sentiment appears negative, as the market has witnessed a significant $1.18 billion in crypto liquidations . This substantial liquidation has created fear among traders and investors, discouraging them from staying and participating in the asset. $220 Million of XRP outflow Despite the fear, traders and long-term holders seem optimistic about XRP, as they have purchased millions worth of tokens during this price decline, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from XRP spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a continuous and significant outflow of $220 million worth of XRP. Source: Coinglasss This outflow indicates a bullish outlook for XRP despite the ongoing price decline, as long-term holders continue to believe in the token. This explains why exchanges are experiencing substantial token outflows. In the cryptocurrency context, “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to long-term holders’ wallets, signaling a potential upside rally and an ideal buying opportunity. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, XRP appears bullish as the price is showing signs of a reversal from the crucial support level of $2.20. Based on the recent price action, the altcoin is near the buying zone, where it has typically experienced an upside rally. Source: Trading View If XRP holds the $2.20 support level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 13% to reach the next resistance level of $2.50 in the near future. On the other hand, if XRP falls below the support level and closes a daily candle below the $2.20 level, we could see XRP dropping to $2 or even lower in the future. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.30 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.70% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 7%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors.",News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 02:24:32

The surge in these metrics has resulted from the significant price drop for Dogecoin, which is down over 5% in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin Trading Volume And Liquidations Witness Significant Spike CoinMarketCap data shows that Dogecoins’s trading volume is up over 57% in the last 24 hours, with over $6 billion traded during this period. Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin’s liquidations have crossed $31 million, with $25 million and $5.8 in long and short positions liquidated, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Run To $11 ATH? Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer Long positions took the most hit as the Dogecoin price crashed below the $0.4 range. This development came following Jerome Powell’s speech, which painted a bearish picture for the foremost meme coin. As crypto analyst Kevin Capital revealed, Dogecoin’s technical indicators were already bearish, and the macroeconomic fundamentals only did more damage. Powell suggested that the US Federal Reserve will likely pause on the rate cuts next year, which immediately sparked a bearish sentiment among traders and led to a wave of sell-offs. This contributed to the spike in trading volume, as investors looked to offload their coins, considering how the Fed being hawkish is bearish for risk assets like Dogecoin. However, Kevin Capital believes that traders are overreacting to Jerome Powell’s speech. The crypto analyst believes that Dogecoin will recover this price correction, stating that the dip will be bought. However, it is worth mentioning Dogecoin’s correlation with Bitcoin, as Kevin Capital had previously pointed out that DOGE’s next move will depend on BTC. The Bitcoin price has dropped below the $100,000 psychological price level and looks bearish at the moment. As such, the Dogecoin price recovery is unlikely to happen until Bitcoin witnesses a bullish reversal. Increased Volatility Is Not Unusual Crypto analyst Master Kenobi also commented on the Dogecoin price drop, stating that increased volatility at this stage of the bull market is not unusual. However, the analyst suggested that traders should avoid being shaken out and instead hold on to their positions. This came as he claimed that market makers who will inject money into the market would prefer for market participants to walk away with a 90% loss rather than a 10x gain. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Recovery Toward $2 As Million-Dollar Whale Transactions Explode On The Network Bitcoinist recently reported that Dogecoin’s sentiment has turned negative once again, indicating that DOGE holders may be looking to sell their coins even at a loss. Kevin Capital had before now stated that the Dogecoin bull run is far from over, suggesting that there was no need to be bearish at the moment despite the price correction. He advised long-term holders just to sit back and wait for higher prices. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.36, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

For now, only a few select users can access the card, and a date for the full release to the public has yet to be announced. The project shared the news via an announcement on its X account. Part of the post read, “Today we’re kicking off a limited pilot program in the United States where some of you will get your hands on MetaMask Card and try it out before it goes to a wider release.” Metamast tests the US markets The soft launch in the US is a precursor to a full-scale launch. Currently, the MetaMask card is only available to select areas in the US, with users in New York and Vermont not making the list. The MetaMask team went on to urge users who were not accepted into the pilot program to apply to join the waitlist. Users of MetaMask and other self-custodial wallets face the challenge of using their crypto funds to make payments for common goods and services directly without having to move these funds to centralized wallets or banks. The MetaMask card could be a game-changer in allowing crypto holders to easily complete transactions in real-time without first converting or transferring their crypto funds. According to Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the parent company behind MetaMask, “MetaMask Card represents a major step to removing the friction that has existed between the blockchain and traditional payments. This is a paradigm shift that offers the best of both worlds.” He also added that the card pilot program gives people the freedom to spend crypto. The MetaMask card allows direct spending from self-custodial wallets To get the card, users have to first check their eligibility on their MetaMask portfolios before registering for the digital card. Once they go through these steps, they can then set it up as a payment method on their mobile devices as it can be integrated into Apple Pay and Google Pay. Funds that users can spend directly from the card include cryptos such as USDC, USDT, and WETH on the Linea network. They can also set spending limits for their card. The card launched in August of this year, and it allows users to spend the crypto they hold on MetaMask anywhere. This means that a MetaMask cardholder can use their card to make payments in fiat currency anywhere a Mastercard is accepted, thanks to their partnership with Mastercard and Baanx. At the time of its initial launch , the card was available in Europe and the UK, with the promise to roll it out in other locations. So far, the card is now operational in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Columbia. According to the partners, the card joins the Web2 world to Web3, by leveraging Mastercard’s merchant network, MetaMask’s security, the efficiency of the Linea network, and the depth of experience Baanx brings in building financial technologies and cards in the Web3 space.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $95,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Further Bitcoin price failed to start another increase and extended losses below the $102,000 zone. BTC gained bearish momentum below the $100,000 and $98,000 levels. The price even spiked below $96,500. A low was formed at $95,586 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

A clear move above the $100,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $102,000. A close above the $102,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $103,400 resistance level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $108,295 swing high to the $95,586 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $105,000 level. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $98,500 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $96,200 level. The first major support is near the $95,500 level. The next support is now near the $93,200 zone.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

Today, let’s dive into two meme coins that could leave you with serious FOMO if you don’t act fast: Neiro, the heartfelt underdog carrying Doge’s legacy, and BTFD Coin , the meme coin disrupting presales with a bang. Neiro might already be flying high, but if you missed its meteoric rise, don’t fret—BTFD Coin’s presale is still open and packing more potential than your favourite meme thread. Neiro: The Little Sister You Didn’t Know You Needed Neiro’s story reads like a Hollywood script: abandoned, rescued, and now a star in her own right. Once a stray dog in a shelter, Neiro was adopted by the same woman who owned Kabosu—the Shiba Inu behind the legendary Doge meme. Her journey from obscurity to fame mirrors the rise of her namesake meme coin, which burst onto the scene with a purpose: to combine internet culture with real-world impact. When Neiro launched on Ethereum during the New Moon on August 4th, 2024, the crypto community took notice. Even Vitalik Buterin himself gave the project his nod of approval, marking only the second time he has publicly supported a meme coin (the first being SHIB). His $500,000 donation to an animal welfare fund not only solidified Neiro’s credibility but also showcased its commitment to making a difference. With the original developer long gone, the community stepped up to take the reins, making Neiro a 100% community-owned project. This transparency and collective spirit have turned it into a meme coin with a heart, backed by donations to shelters and other charitable initiatives. But here’s the kicker: if you missed out on Neiro’s launch, you’ve likely missed its biggest gains. Early adopters are already reaping rewards, and unless you’re comfortable buying in at higher prices, the train may have left the station. BTFD Coin: Don’t Miss This One Too If Neiro has you feeling that sinking “missed ICO” feeling, don’t despair. There’s another meme coin making waves right now: BTFD Coin (short for “Buy the Dip”). It’s bold, it’s brash, and it’s built for those who love turning market chaos into opportunities. Currently in its 12th presale stage, BTFD Coin is proving that it’s not just a cheeky name—it’s a serious contender in the meme coin world. Here’s the latest scoop: Current Price: $0.00013 Funds Raised: Over $4.2 million, including $1M in under 10 days and $2.5M within 14 days of its presale launch. Community Strength: Over 6,000 holders have already joined the Bulls Squad. Coins Sold: More than 57 billion BTFD Coins have been snapped up by eager investors. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. The project combines 90% APY staking rewards, an exciting Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , and a dedicated community of Bulls driving its momentum. And unlike some meme coins, BTFD Coin is built with longevity in mind, featuring locked liquidity and a vested token distribution to ensure stability. Investment Example: Don’t Let This One Slip By Let’s break down the numbers to see what’s on the table if you act now. At the current presale price of $0.00013, a $900 investment would secure you 6,923,077 BTFD Coins. Now imagine this: if the coin reaches its predicted post-launch value of $0.0006—a realistic target given the buzz surrounding it—your $900 investment could grow to a whopping $4,153.85. That’s a potential 360% return on your money. The presale is moving fast, so the clock is ticking. Don’t let this be another missed opportunity. Lessons from Neiro: Don’t Wait for the Moon to Strike Twice If there’s one thing Neiro’s rise has taught us, it’s that timing is everything in crypto. Those who got in early are now sitting pretty, while the rest of us are left wondering, What if? Neiro’s story isn’t just inspiring—it’s a reminder of what the meme coin space is all about: community, culture, and a little bit of chaos. And while it’s still a strong contender, the best time to invest in Neiro was yesterday. The second-best time? Well, maybe not today if you’re looking for explosive growth. This is where BTFD Coin steps in. With its presale still underway, it offers something Neiro can’t anymore: a chance to get in early and ride the wave from the ground floor. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let FOMO Win Again The crypto world is full of “what ifs” and “if onlys.” If you missed Neiro’s launch and its early gains, it’s easy to feel like you’ve missed your shot. But here’s the thing: the next big opportunity is always just around the corner. BTFD Coin’s presale is that opportunity. With its unique combination of staking rewards, a P2E game, and a strong community, it’s positioned to be the next big wave in the meme coin world. But presales don’t last forever, and neither do low prices. Don’t let BTFD Coin be another Neiro—a coin you regret not jumping on while you had the chance. Act now, join the Bulls Squad, and ride this wave to the moon.

ETH is down over 7% and is showing bearish signs below the $3,550 level. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,680 zone. The price is trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it fails to stay above the $3,650 support zone. Ethereum Price Drops Below $3,650 Ethereum price struggled to start a fresh increase above the $3,680 level and extended losses like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $3,650 level and dived below $3,600. It even dived below $3,550 and spiked below the $3,420 level. A low was formed at $3,324 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,510 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,105 swing high to the $3,324 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,650 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $3,715 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,105 swing high to the $3,324 low. A clear move above the $3,715 resistance might send the price toward the $3,800 resistance. An upside break above the $3,800 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,880 resistance zone or even $4,000. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,320 zone. A clear move below the $3,320 support might push the price toward the $3,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050.

Last week, Bitcoin spot ETF inflows skyrocketed to $2.17 billion in just five days, highlighting growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, XRP’s market holds potential bullish moves as its price hovers near critical levels, attracting attention. Among these trends, the spotlight rests firmly on one standout project: BlockDAG (BDAG) . This Layer-1 blockchain contender has become a favorite among enthusiasts and developers, thanks to its groundbreaking Whitepaper V3 . The paper introduces key innovations addressing scalability and security issues. With daily inflows exceeding $5 million and presale figures crossing $169 million, BlockDAG has set the bar high. Its GHOSTDAG protocol is a game-changer, offering unmatched transaction speed and security. This solidifies its position as a must-watch crypto for those focused on long-term potential. Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflows Soar to $2.17 Billion According to data shared by @WuBlockchain, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $2.17 billion over five consecutive trading days. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was the leading contributor, with $1.51 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which brought in $598 million. These ETFs now account for 5.71% of Bitcoin’s total market cap, signaling their growing importance. However, there are mixed signals. Grayscale’s GBTC witnessed $221 million in outflows, reflecting a shift in preferences. Experts also warn that Bitcoin spot ETFs could amplify market volatility, creating challenges for smaller players. Despite these concerns, institutional interest remains strong, underscoring Bitcoin’s prominence in the crypto ecosystem. XRP’s Road to $2.70: Hope with Hurdles XRP continues to consolidate near $0.50, with bulls targeting a breakout to $2.70. The optimism stems from growing legal clarity and increased institutional attention. XRP’s unique utility in cross-border transactions keeps it on traders’ watchlists as a promising opportunity. That said, resistance at $0.55 has slowed momentum, and analysts caution against possible dips if this barrier isn’t broken. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties, while improving, still hover over XRP’s broader adoption prospects. Despite these hurdles, the market remains optimistic, positioning XRP as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. BlockDAG Presale Rockets to $169M Milestone! BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3 is reshaping the Layer-1 blockchain space with features designed to solve industry-wide challenges. Its GHOSTDAG protocol enables simultaneous block creation, ensuring faster transactions and greater scalability while mitigating risks like double-spending and 51% attacks. The whitepaper’s vision includes EVM compatibility, which simplifies deploying Ethereum-based dApps on BlockDAG’s network. Future updates, such as cross-chain bridging, are also in the pipeline, unlocking interoperability that could drive significant ecosystem growth. This innovation has captivated developers, traders, and miners alike. The presale momentum is proof of its rising popularity. BlockDAG’s daily inflows exceed $5 million, and total sales have surpassed $169 million. More than 17.3 billion coins have already been sold, with prices surging from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0234 in the current batch 26. Early supporters have seen an impressive 2240% surge. Meanwhile, over $5.9 million in miner sales have been recorded, with nearly 15,000 miners sold. As more batches sell out quickly, the presale is moving closer to its $600 million goal. With ongoing market interest and developer adoption, BlockDAG is positioned for exponential growth. For those exploring promising blockchain solutions, this could be a pivotal moment to engage with one of the most talked-about projects in crypto. Closing Thoughts: BlockDAG Leads the Way While Bitcoin spot ETFs captured $2.17 billion in inflows and XRP traders eye a potential rise to $2.70, BlockDAG continues to dominate headlines. Its Whitepaper V3 has solidified its position as a leader in addressing blockchain’s pressing issues. With daily inflows surpassing $5 million and a record-breaking $169 million presale, BlockDAG is creating ripples across the industry. As its presale approaches new milestones, BlockDAG remains a top contender for those seeking transformative blockchain projects.

These aren’t your typical crypto investments. They combine spot Bitcoin and Ethereum into one package, making it easier—and maybe even safer—for people to invest in the two biggest digital currencies at once. SEC has *approved* both the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF & Franklin Crypto Index ETF… Will initially hold both btc & eth. pic.twitter.com/5GUhhhXL7y — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 19, 2024 Bitcoin Meets Ethereum in a Balanced Package There are so many crypto ETFs running already, so what is so special about these two? Instead of focusing on just Bitcoin or Ethereum, they mix both. The allocation depends on the market value of each, so investors get a well-balanced exposure. Why does this matter? It’s simple: putting everything into just one cryptocurrency can feel risky. By holding both, these ETFs spread out the risk and let you benefit from the strengths of each. For anyone who finds the idea of buying Bitcoin or Ethereum directly too overwhelming, these ETFs could be the answer. They simplify the process, making crypto investments more accessible to regular people. A Big Step for Crypto Investing The SEC’s decision to approve these ETFs shows that regulators are starting to take the crypto market seriously. This is a major milestone not just for the crypto space but for SEC as well. So why did these ETFs get approved? A key reason is the strong connection between Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and their spot prices. This link helps keep things stable and reduces the chances of manipulation, which is a big win for investors. These ETFs also follow strict guidelines to protect investors. They’re tied to agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to monitor trading activity and keep everything above board. The SEC isn’t just handing out approvals—they’ve made sure these ETFs meet high standards for security and transparency. What’s Next ? This approval could open the door for even more creative investment options in the future. By combining Bitcoin and Ethereum, these ETFs simplify the process of getting into crypto. They remove the hassle of managing multiple wallets or worrying about buying and storing digital assets directly. And this could just be the start. Other cryptocurrencies might join similar ETFs down the road. For now, though, these Bitcoin-Ethereum combos are a big step forward. If you’ve been waiting for a way to explore crypto without all the complications, this could be exactly what you’ve been looking for.",News|Bitcoin ETF|Ethereum ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 03:27:36
37866539,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52650,1734665328,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,What Will Replace Betting Sponsorships As The Most Common Football Sponsorship?,https://timestabloid.com/what-will-replace-betting-sponsorships-as-the-most-common-football-sponsorship/,"For those who don’t know, starting from the 2026/27 Premier League season, betting sponsors will no longer be allowed as the front sport on a kit. This has been a long-form debate among football fans as the promotion of betting, as heavy as it is in football, has been perceived as a negative. This is obviously based on the negative connotations of betting as a whole and with football and the Premier League being the biggest sport in the world, having a constant betting reminder on kits in front of young fans, people of religion and people who have a negative relationship with betting, isn’t the best sign and isn’t as marketable as the Premier League wants to be. As we move forward, the betting sponsorships will be (slightly) removed from the game we love. We say slightly because the kits themselves cannot have betting sponsorships on the front, but, the betting sponsors on the sleeves and with the kits themselves will still be allowed. So overall, the change is fairly small. In the wake of these sponsorships being banned, we turn to the question: instead of Premier League betting sites or betting sites as a whole being the sponsorships, who will take over as the most used sponsor for these Premier League clubs? Cryptocurrency I think when we look at the similarities between crypto and betting, there is a huge overlap between the two. Crypto is a long-term financial investment whereas betting is a short-term and more risky version of the same thing. The reason why betting sponsors are so common is because the sports betting industry is so lucrative for the companies and the teams they sponsor. Crypto is daily similar, the money in crypto is huge and cryptocurrencies will be looking at premier league clubs as a form of marketing to get their name out there. If more people are investing in crypto, there is more money to be made and that is the goal behind every sponsorship. As well as this, there are already links between crypto and football, with certain crypto sites looking to the football industry and its fans with football-themed coins, as well as teams like Manchester City, having delved into the crypto sponsorship market already. Technology Sponsors We understand that this point is incredibly vague, but the technology is one of the biggest powerhouses in the entire world. Not only is the industry growing and changing every single day, but it also is financially the biggest industry in the world. Because technology is forever changing and billions of dollars are being invested each year, the finances are perfect for Premier League clubs. Being a sponsor on one of the biggest teams in the world’s shirts is enough marketing and exposure for years to come and with these sponsorships usually being locked deals for years and years, these companies will be licking their lips. Car Sponsors We have already seen car sponsorships throughout the years in the Premier League, if you have a good memory, you will remember Manchester United’s Chevrolet sponsorship all those years ago and this is a good sign for the car companies as they know clubs will be interested in their sponsorship offers. The car industry is, again, financially huge and compared to the crypto industry, the car industry is a lot safer and less risky to push into fans’ faces.

Currently trading at $2.21, the XRP price has recorded a nearly 5% gain in the past 24 hours, finding strong support just below its current price. This positions the token favorably for continued upward momentum, particularly since it began an upward trend on November 5, bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump’s re-election. $10.82 Target For The XRP Price Following Historical Patterns Interestingly, analysts are increasingly optimistic about the XRP price, especially considering a key technical indicator: the Bollinger Bands. This volatility indicator, which consists of a moving average and upper and lower bands, is currently tightening on the 12-hour chart. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts Analyst Steph has noted that the last time the Bollinger Bands exhibited such a pattern, the XRP price experienced a staggering 490% price explosion. If history repeats itself, this could propel XRP to a new all-time high of $10.82, significantly surpassing its previous record of $3.40 set in January 2018, according to the analyst. Adding to the bullish sentiment, another analyst known as Javon on X (formerly Twitter) has pointed out that XRP’s last full bull cycle saw an increase of over 600%. The analyst suggests that if the XRP price performs similarly, it could rise dramatically, potentially exceeding 6,800% to reach approximately $168. This projection hinges on the price moving above the 2.414 Fibonacci Extension level, which was valued at $3,06 during the previous cycle. However, some analysts are adopting a more conservative outlook. Key Levels At $2.42 And $2.92 In Focus DarkDefender has noted a clear break on the daily chart, predicting that the XRP price could retest the $2.42 level before breaking through $2.92. Should it surpass this threshold, targets of $3.43 and $5.85 could be in sight. DarkDefender had recently targeted $2.72, which the XRP price had successfully bounced back from, reaffirming the validity of his analysis. Related Reading: 400 Billion Shiba Inu Moved: Is A SHIB Price Crash Coming? Despite differing views on the potential extent of the surge, consensus among analysts is that the XRP price is likely to reach a new all-time high in the coming months. This optimism is further strengthened by the possibility of regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. The President-elect has promised a new regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States, which could pave the way for resolving the prolonged legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which previously stifled the XRP price, leading to a lengthy period of consolidation.

Although the SEC’s operations may be affected, the agency will prioritize its main mission of overseeing market activities and protecting investors, especially during uncertain times.

Truly, Jeremy pic.twitter.com/FDcSK2ejag — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) December 19, 2024 What Happens Next if The SEC is Shutdown? If the government shuts down, the SEC will have limited activities because federal agencies can’t operate without funding, except for a few things like protecting property. Companies trying to raise money or handle securities transactions should know that the SEC’s Corporation Finance staff won’t be available to approve registration statements, offering statements, or process those filings. The SEC won’t process filings that need review, like registration statements or tender offers. Companies won’t get feedback on their filings, and delays will happen once the shutdown ends. The SEC won’t answer questions or handle requests for exemptions or no-action letters. Gary Gensler previously announced he would retire from the SEC on January 20.

Cochran, a longstanding critic of Ripple, has reevaluated his stance, calling RLUSD Ripple’s most significant move in years. His analysis, shared through a video accompanying his tweet, outlines the unique RLUSD potential to revolutionize DeFi, Forex markets, and institutional banking. Why $RLUSD is @Ripple 's Trojan Horse for DeFi and Banking: I've been hard on XRP over the years, and almost missed why their new stablecoin would be useful, but after a deeper dive, I changed my mind and think it's probably their strongest move in years. pic.twitter.com/KW6TKqtcoD — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) December 17, 2024 RLUSD: Not Just Another Stablecoin Unlike conventional stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, RLUSD is fully regulated, bank-backed, and custodied by U.S. financial institutions. It adheres to strict compliance measures, including oversight from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple has also secured critical regulatory approvals, such as the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license, and aims to ensure RLUSD’s compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. This level of compliance distinguishes RLUSD from many existing stablecoins, aligning it with institutional needs and making it a robust tool for enterprises, banks, and financial entities. Additionally, RLUSD will be issued on Ripple’s native blockchain and Ethereum, bridging traditional financial institutions with decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Unlocking the Ripple Ecosystem Ripple has faced challenges in expanding the utility of its XRP Ledger (XRPL). While it introduced features such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and token issuance formats, adoption has been limited. RLUSD addresses a key gap: the inability to price assets in U.S. dollars within Ripple’s ecosystem. With RLUSD, institutional participants can now price Real-World Assets (RWAs), Forex trades, and other financial instruments directly in USD, enhancing the appeal of Ripple’s native AMM functionalities. Moreover, RLUSD opens pathways for Ripple to incentivize XRP liquidity through USD-XRP trading pairs. By bringing liquidity on-chain, Ripple can capture yield opportunities currently benefiting centralized exchanges. This strategic shift could bolster XRP’s ecosystem by redistributing value to the network and its participants. A Trojan Horse for Institutional Markets Cochran emphasizes that RLUSD’s greatest potential lies in its appeal to institutional markets, particularly Forex settlement and debt issuance. The Forex market handles trillions of dollars in daily transactions, often through outdated and fragmented banking systems. Ripple’s ability to offer a compliant, yield-bearing, USD-backed stablecoin could streamline these processes and position Ripple as a leading alternative settlement network. RLUSD’s integration with programmability upgrades—such as Hooks and a forthcoming Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain—further solidifies its utility. These enhancements will enable DeFi applications, creating opportunities for more sophisticated financial products on Ripple’s blockchain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Stablecoin Market Opportunity Cochran also highlights the growing stablecoin market, currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). With over $140 billion in circulation, stablecoins generate substantial yields for their issuers. RLUSD’s entry into this market, particularly in the EU where Tether lacks regulatory approval, could position Ripple as a major player. If Ripple captures a significant share of this market, it stands to generate billions in annual yield revenue, which could be reinvested into its ecosystem. A Path Forward for Ripple RLUSD represents a pivotal step in Ripple’s long-term vision of bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. By addressing regulatory concerns, enhancing ecosystem programmability, and tapping into institutional markets, Ripple strategically positions itself to capture value across multiple financial sectors. Cochran concludes that while Ripple’s early ambitions of competing with SWIFT remain challenging, RLUSD’s potential to unlock trillions in value from Forex settlement, debt instruments, and RWAs could make previously speculative price predictions for XRP more realistic.

This latest purchase has pushed the company’s total reserves to over 10,096 BTC, valued at more than $1 billion at current market prices. Hut 8 Bitcoin Reserves Top $1 Billion The Miami-headquartered cryptocurrency mining firm continues to increase its Bitcoin reserves, undeterred by BTC’s recent price surges. In its latest announcement, Hut 8 revealed the purchase of approximately 990 BTC for $100 million, at an average price of $101,710 per Bitcoin. Related Reading: Metaplanet To Expand Bitcoin Holdings With $11.3 Million Bond Sale This acquisition has propelled Hut 8’s total BTC holdings to over $1 billion, with the coins acquired at an average cost of $24,485 per Bitcoin. The move reflects the company’s strategy of combining low-cost BTC production with what it views as strategic market buys to maximize returns and strengthen its reserve assets. Notably, Hut 8’s recent purchase positions it among the top 10 largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. MicroStrategy remains the leader on this list, holding more than 250,000 BTC on its balance sheet. Commenting, Asher Genoot, CEO, Hut 8, said: We believe deeply in our operating business and that building a strategic Bitcoin reserve will fortify our financial position as we pursue large-scale growth initiatives across power and digital infrastructure. Additionally, as we scale operations and extend our cost advantage in Bitcoin production, we anticipate that the flywheel effect will enable us to grow our holdings organically at a significant discount to market prices, strengthening the yield of our reserve strategy. Echoing these sentiments, Hut 8 CFO, Sean Glennan explained that making BTC a reserve asset was a key component of the company’s strategy to deliver “superior returns” to shareholders through strategic treasury management. He added that the company is open to deploying its BTC reserve to support business objectives, such as upgrading its mining fleet. Earlier this month, Hut 8 unveiled a massive $750 million initiative aimed at general corporate objectives, debt repayment, and bolstering its Bitcoin reserve. On a year-to-date basis, Hut 8’s stock has surged by over 102%, trading at $27.11 at the time of writing. 4 Mining Firms Among Top 10 Corporate BTC Holders While companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block, and Coinbase are well-known among the top corporate Bitcoin holders, four Bitcoin mining firms also feature on this prestigious list, namely, Marathon Digital Holdings, Hut 8, Riot Blockchain, and CleanSpark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Grows As Rumble Unveils $20 Million BTC Treasury Strategy Last year, Riot Blockchain reported a significant increase in its BTC holdings. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin mining firm holds a total of 8,490 BTC. Similarly, earlier this month, Marathon Digital Holdings purchased another 703 BTC to increase its total reserves to 34,794 BTC. This move aligns with Marathon CEO’s previous statement that institutions are “waiting to buy up” Bitcoin. In October, CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford predicted that BTC may peak around $200,000 in the next 18 months. At press time, BTC trades at $100,543, down 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

This statement shocked many, given the stark price differences between XRP ($2.51) and BTC ($104,085). How could XRP be better than BTC? According to Vitalik, XRP’s technological advantages, such as faster transaction speeds and lower fees, make it better than BTC. He claims these features make XRP better suited for real-world applications than BTC. Amid this heated discussion on Vitalik Buterin’s comments, a Ripple rival, RCO Finance (RCOF), is making waves with its innovative features and real-world utility. Analysts project this cutting-edge project could surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025, making it a top pick for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Why Vitalik Buterin Says XRP Is Better Than Bitcoin Vitalik Buterin’s avid endorsement of Ripple’s native token, XRP, highlights its undervalued utility, making it a more innovative altcoin than Bitcoin. Here are some of the advantages XRP has over BTC. Ripple’s XRP offers faster transaction speed at lower fees. While Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) model is secure, it is notoriously slow and expensive. However, Ripple’s XRP offers near-instant transactions at low fees, making it more efficient, especially for everyday use. This utility has led to XRP’s integration into global financial networks, especially for cross-border payments. According to Vitalik Buterin, this has made it a key player in traditional institutions’ growing adoption of blockchain technology. This extends its value past speculative trading, offering more tangible value in the financial sector. Bitcoin’s energy-intensive PoW mining process is a cause of concern because of its environmental impact. This greatly limits its scalability, causing investors and developers alike to look for more energy-efficient options like XRP, which aligns with Vitalik Buterin’s outlook that the former is better than BTC. RCO Finance: The Ripple Rival Ready for a 12,050% Surge Similar to XRP, RCO Finance’s unique value proposition makes it a better investment. Backed by its innovative AI technology and real-world utility, RCOF is steadily making a name for itself and showing why it’s poised to surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025. At its core, RCO Finance leverages advanced AI tools to empower users with data-driven insights and personalized investment strategies.

This versatility streamlines the investing process, making it easier for users to level up and diversify their portfolios. RCOF’s blockchain infrastructure is designed to be compatible with multiple chains, enhancing flexibility and accessibility. This interoperability positions it as a versatile asset in the evolving crypto landscape.

This shows that RCOF adheres to industry standards, reassuring users that their assets and data are safe. Secure Your Place Before RCOF Takes Off Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement of utility-driven projects like XRP highlights the market’s shift toward practical applications and innovation.

XRP has been trading within a range of approximately $2.20 to $2.70 over the past few days, showing limited movement on the larger time frames. The altcoin has recently experienced a slight pullback, which has led to the invalidation of a previous bullish breakout pattern. While the price has not changed significantly, it remains within a potential bull market structure. The strong resistance level is around $2.90 to $3, where selling pressure has consistently been observed. On the lower end, there is support near $2, which has been tested multiple times and serves as the lower boundary of XRP’s current trading range. If the price breaks below $2, it may hint further downside. Understanding The Support and Resistance Levels The breakout had been confirmed at around $2.35, but the price closed below this level, invalidating the pattern and suggesting that further upside momentum is unlikely in the near term. The immediate support level in the short term is around $2.30 to $2.31, which is currently holding, but if it breaks, the next support lies around $2.23, with further downside possible towards the $2 level. It will also most likely drop to $1.90. After reaching $1.90, the key question is whether XRP can hold that level. If it breaks $1.90, the market will enter a bear phase, and the bullish trend will be over. However, that hasn’t happened yet, so it’s too early to make any conclusions. However, if XRP holds $2.30, it could rise to $2.60. If it breaks above $2.60, we can consider $3 as the next target.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 04:07:45
