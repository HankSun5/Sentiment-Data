Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 22:38:00

Table of Contents The all-sports meme token with potential Dogecoin Shiba Inu Conclusion As cryptocurrencies reach new peaks and the bull run accelerates, traders are looking beyond Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for fresh opportunities. A rising star is capturing attention, promising potential that established meme coins might no longer offer. Introducing XYZVerse, an all-sport meme coin looking to unite fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports within a dynamic ecosystem with the potential to outperform previous successes. The all-sports meme token with potential Think of XYZ as an exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. It’s the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where savvy investors can cash in on the growing synergy between meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. Imagine the energy of Polymarket’s $1 billion trading volume during the U.S. presidential election with the viral appeal of meme coins and the excitement of sports fandom. With millions of fans gearing up to participate, the XYZVerse ecosystem is primed for explosive growth. Meme coins are dominating the crypto space in 2024 and XYZ could lead the pack.

You might also like: XYZ and DOGE prices to soar if BTC touches $150k: 2025 could be massive Dogecoin Dogecoin has seen significant changes, with its price increasing by 207.62% in the past six months. However, in the past week, its price dipped by 16.81%, indicating short-term volatility. The current price ranges between $0.35 and $0.42, hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.38 and $0.40. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.39, suggesting the coin is not overbought and may have the potential to rise. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.004012, but close to zero, which could point to a possible upward shift soon. If Dogecoin moves past the nearest resistance level at $0.51, it might reach the second resistance at $0.62, which would be an increase of around 34%. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $0.31, it could drop to the next support at $0.21, a decrease of about 41%. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge where the price might head next. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by about 20%. Looking at the last six months, SHIB’s price surged by nearly 42%, highlighting its strong growth over a longer period. The recent weekly dip might suggest a short-term correction. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 34.51, which is approaching oversold territory. This could signal a potential rebound in price soon. The Stochastic value is 23.71, also indicating possible undervaluation. SHIB is currently trading between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00003614. If the price breaks this level, it could see gains of around 13%. The nearest support level is at $0.00002006. Falling below this could lead to a decline of approximately 16%. Conclusion While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are notable, XYZVerse stands out with its sports focus and massive growth potential in the 2024 bull run.

This surprise move lit a fire under selling across all altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) being hit hardest and crashing -26%, breaking its 40-day trendline too. Conversely, Altura ($ALU) displayed outstanding strength, remaining locked into a bullish falling wedge pattern, a technical pattern that often leads to a reversal upward. Render ($RENDER) Faces Dramatic Decline After Bitcoin’s Tumble Render’s large crash is due to Bitcoin overnight tanking. That penetration below the psychological level of $100,000 triggered panic and heavy selling pressure. For Render, it meant losing an important support level that had supported its recent uptrend. Render's price action is an indicator of investor indecision and reflects an oversold condition. However, any chance of a recovery ultimately prevents the token from regaining ground and retaking its trendline support. Altura ($ALU) Remains In Bullish Formation Even with the market volatility, Altura has stayed in an attractive technical setup. The falling wedge pattern in the token's position indicates a bullish breakout. This pattern develops when the price of an asset declines within an increasingly tighter range, often resulting in an eventual upward breakout. Source: Tradingview Altura ($ALU): What You Need to Know - Altura has been resilient against potential downturns, holding near its key support zones.- A falling wedge pattern provides a positive outlook with Altura well on track for a bounce.- If Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura could significantly benefit from bullish sentiment. How Altura ($ALU) Keeps Giving Reasons to Pay Attention Altura has weathered volatility with unflappability that speaks to its unique appeal and strong fundamentals. Here are some of the underlying factors that led to its bullish sentiment: Bullish Technical Pattern: The falling wedge setup strengthens confidence in a potential breakout. Unique Use Case: The common ranging of blockchain-based gaming solutions with tokenized in-game assets makes Altura a good potential long-term investment. Supportive User Base: A robust community strengthens the token’s ecosystem and ensures ongoing interest. Future Price Prediction for Render ($RENDER) and Altura ($ALU) Render ($RENDER): Keep an eye out for price stabilization. If the token manages to regain its 40-day trendline while neutralizing its oversold status, we could expect a rebound. Altura ($ALU): The line at the top of the falling wedge is the one traders should pay attention to. A breakout from this pattern would trigger a big upward momentum, confirming Altura's bullish trend. Conclusion: The recent market crash has taken a toll on altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) suffering significant losses. However, Altura ($ALU) stands out with its bullish pattern and strong fundamentals, making it a compelling asset to watch. As Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura's breakout potential positions it as a frontrunner in the event of a market rally. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Following the 2021 cycle pattern, where Bitcoin rose 40% above its moving averages, the peak price would reach around $339,000, according to the report.

Australian computer scientist Craig Wright has been handed a one-year sentence, suspended for two years, for filing a $1.2 trillion lawsuit against the payments firm Block. The judge says Wright violated a previous court order designed to keep him from filing further legal actions. The suspended sentence essentially means Wright would avoid jail if he meets certain conditions and does not commit another offense, although the judge noted Wright is living abroad in Asia and is likely not within jurisdiction of the court. Earlier this year, a UK judge ruled that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Wright is neither Satoshi nor the author of the Bitcoin white paper after he was sued by the nonprofit crypto advocacy group Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) for filing frivolous lawsuits against Bitcoin developers. In November, COPA went on to claim that Wright violated an injunction by filing a lawsuit against Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s payments firm. According to the report, the injunction was set in place to prevent Wright from filing BTC-related lawsuits on the grounds that he is Satoshi and Judge James Mellor found Wright to be in contempt of court following a hearing Wednesday.

Two days ago on the social media platform X, the top US-based crypto exchange platform said it had added Parcl ( PARCL ), a decentralized exchange (DEX) that lets users trade and invest in real estate using synthetic assets without the need to physically own any property. Synthetic assets are tokenized, blockchain-based representations of real-world assets, such as securities and real property that can easily be swapped. News of the addition caused the token to dip in price as it went from a peak of $0.586 on December 17th to a low of $0.408 just two days later. PARCL is trading for $0.418 a time of writing, a 9% decrease during the last 24 hours. On December 15th, Coinbase added PARCL to its listing roadmap, signaling at the time that it was going to add support soon. At that time, the crypto exchange’s announcement triggered a 50% rally of the altcoin as it was moving for just $0.33 on December 10th. PARCL aims to provide traders with global city indexes – including major cities such as New York, Miami Beach, San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dubai – and allow them to acquire tokens that represent a stake in a specific index.

The latest $1.53 billion investment brings MARA’s total holdings to 44,394 BTC. At the current spot price of $100,151 per Bitcoin, the company’s holdings are valued at approximately $4.45 billion. The firm currently ranks second on the list of publicly traded companies with the largest BTC holdings globally. MARA has said the purchase was enabled by the $1.925 billion in proceeds from two offerings of 0% convertible senior notes, announced in late November and early December. This calculated move is similar to a strategy employed and popularized by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor involving large-scale BTC accumulation. According to Saylor, it’s a matter of time before MARA Holdings enters the Nasdaq 100 index. MARA seizes opportunity to buy Bitcoin after Federal Reserve Chair’s remarks MARA’s timing is interesting. They announced this purchase just a day after Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, stated that the central bank couldn’t own Bitcoin. Furthermore, the purchase coincided with a fall in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin plunged by 5.6% during Wednesday’s session, testing levels below the $100,000 mark. This marked the largest single-day drop since August 5. The fall was preceded by a wider sell-off sparked by the Fed’s hawkish comments about the interest rate trajectory and how it may possibly drop in 2025. For a brief period, Bitcoin seemed poised to surpass the $100k milestone. However, two factors contributed to its pullback: Powell’s remarks served as a major catalyst, and lingering skepticism about Bitcoin’s viability as a reserve asset added to the downward pressure. Bitcoin Miners boost reserves by purchasing on the open market Bitcoin miners are beginning to purchase Bitcoin on the open market. Hut 8 (HUT) is one of the latest Bitcoin miners to do so. Other dominant miners include MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings. The Miami-based Hut 8 announced on Thursday that it had purchased 990 BTC at an average price of $101,710 each. The acquisition increased its Bitcoin reserves to 10,096 BTC, with a total value of around $1 billion. The firm, after the latest acquisition, appears among the top ten largest corporate Bitcoin holders. The current rush for Bitcoin by miner firms is an indication of progress. Soon, these firms will control large percentages of cryptocurrency, thus, raising their market influence and overall valuation.

According to a Reuters report, geothermal energy startups are on the increase as big tech firms are looking at feeding their power-intensive data centers. Despite this surge, long-term investments in the sector remain uncertain as oil majors double down on gas. Simply put, geothermal energy is heat energy from the earth. Geothermal energy startups increased in the last two years According to Bryant Jones, the executive director for the industry association Geothermal Rising, the environment has been improving lately, in terms of ease of doing business which has seen more than 60 startups spring to life in the last two years. “Texas is becoming the ‘place to be’ for geothermal exploration and development across the board,” said Matt Welch at the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance (TxGEA). “Much of this is due to an abundance of identified geothermal resources, 1-stop shopping permitting process, and our regulatory certainty.” Welch. According to an industry report published last year, at least 10 of the geothermal startups launched between 2016 and 2022 in the US were headquartered in Texas. Now, the obtaining lower commodity prices might encourage more shale companies to diversify their revenue streams and tap into geothermal power. The Enhanced Geothermal Shot analysis in 2022 confirmed the potential for more geothermal electricity generating capacity – 90 gigawatts by 2050. These developments also come as AI data centers have emerged as high-energy consumers, forcing big techs to look elsewhere for alternative energy sources to keep their data centers running with sufficient and sustainable power. “We believe geothermal, along with abundant natural gas, can be part of the all-of-the-above energy mix we need to meet the demand,” said Trey Lowe, chief technology officer at U.S. shale gas producer Devon Energy (DVN.N), an investor in geothermal startup Fervo Energy. Big techs back the geothermal energy startups According to a Reuters report, social media giant, Meta and search engine giant Google rank among the tech firms that are partnering with these startup companies offering to produce geothermal electricity, to power their data centers. The report further highlights that geothermal energy has been promoted as a faster way to generate carbon-free power compared to nuclear and without the intermittency of wind and solar. However, the new startups do not have it easy as they face high upfront costs, especially for drilling coupled with long project approval times. These high costs have dampened the initial zeal, with limited investment so far, analysts estimate just over $700 million in financing as been contributed to overall geothermal power projects since 2020. But the sector is also receiving bipartisan interest with the CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passing the House and now awaiting Senate approval. If these become law, this will, according to Reuters, make it easier to set up geothermal projects across the US. The sector is receiving increased bipartisan interest as well. The CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passed the House and are awaiting Senate approval. If they become law, it would make it easier to set up geothermal projects in the country. Now, top shale oil producers Chevron, Diamondback Energy, and Exxon Mobil have started advocating for gas as the mainstay fuel for electric power, offering to work with utilities to add to their power plants with carbon sequestration that generates greenhouse emissions. “In general, (there is) a lot more interest from smaller oil and gas producers as well as service companies … we’ve talked to Chevron and Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab but the supermajors seem to be taking more of a wait-and-watch view,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, which is developing energy storage and geothermal baseload technologies deep in the earth. According to Reuters, Sage recently completed a $30 million fundraising which was led by Expand Energy – a US shale gas producer. The company plans to launch the Series B round in January. Colorado-based Gradient Geothermal -which generates geothermal energy using existing oil and gas infrastructure – announced it was providing Chord Energy services to help generate power at one of its oil and gas in North Dakota. Johanna Ostrum, Gradient CEO said most mid-size and smaller independent energy firms were interested in geothermal energy for their own needs, not to create electricity for resale.

We must take a comprehensive, clear stance on taxes, regulations, and cybersecurity before the Trump administration takes office.” Japanese Minister of Digital Affairs Takuya Hirai Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to reporters on the death of Tsuneo Watanabe, editor-in-chief of The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, describing him as a “great Journalist.” https://t.co/4FTHqGOZMo — The Japan News (@The_Japan_News) December 19, 2024 Experts think Tokyo wants to cement any new changes in Japan’s cryptocurrency policy by the time Trump takes office. These changes could include tax reform, in addition to new regulations and cybersecurity laws. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society forms policy recommendations for the government’s consideration. However, Ishiba’s office is under no obligation to accept or incorporate these recommendations. Indeed, in recent weeks, the Prime Minister refused to commit to tax reform or the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs in Japan. Ishiba has appointed lawmakers known to be in favor of crypto reform to ministerial positions . He also mentioned blockchain technology in his election manifesto. However, voices outside the LDP have also called for “urgent” reform. Opposition leaders have also warned repeatedly that capital is flowing out of the country as a result of an “unfair” taxation system for crypto investors. Japan's central bank kept its monetary policy settings steady, signaling it sees little urgency to raise interest rates for now https://t.co/xYQANqP0nF — Bloomberg (@business) December 19, 2024 While many other nations charge traders flat capital gains taxes at rates of about 20%, Japan’s tax rules instead oblige crypto traders to declare their crypto profits on their annual income tax declarations. They must file crypto trading profits under “other income.” And that means that the nation’s highest earners can end up paying up to 55% on their crypto trading revenues. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society said its proposal was of “urgent” importance. On X, Hirai wrote that the LDP had been working on crypto legislation “faster” than any party “in the world.” The post Japan’s Ruling Party Still Pushing for Crypto Tax Reform Despite PM’s Caution appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-19 23:30:00

Here’s the nearest on-chain level that the asset would end up retesting if the drawdown elongates. 1 Week To 1 Month Bitcoin Holders Have Their Realized Price At $97,900 As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old BTC investors is the closest support for the asset right now. Related Reading: Secret Bitcoin Driver: Exchanges Receiving $40 Million USDT Fuel Per Day The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition price of the average holder on the Bitcoin network. When the metric’s value is lower than the spot price of the cryptocurrency, it means the investors as a whole can be considered to be holding a net amount of profit. On the other hand, it being under the BTC value suggests the dominance of loss in the market. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a particular segment of the sector is of interest: the 1-week to 1-month-old holders. This cohort includes the addresses that have been holding their coins for at least one week and, at most, one month. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the Realized Price of this Bitcoin group has changed over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old Bitcoin investors has been climbing up alongside the price rally. This is naturally due to the fact that the cohort’s cost basis has been getting repriced to higher levels as new investors have been purchasing at the rally highs. Currently, the indicator’s value sits at $97,900, so these investors would be in profit at the current price. Earlier in the past day, however, the asset came dangerously close to retesting the level as its price saw a brief dip below $99,000. The 1 week to 1 month old investors make up a section of a larger cohort known as the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs are broadly defined as the holders who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell. So, the STHs, and especially the 1-week to 1-month-old segment, would contain the holders with the least amount of resolve in the sector, owing to their low holding time. Because of how fickle they are, the STHs generally show some kind of reaction whenever their average cost basis gets retested by the Bitcoin price. This reaction may come in the form of buying when the retest occurs from above, as these holders could believe the decline to be just a ‘dip.’ As such, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old STHs, which is below the current price, could be looked at as a support level for the cryptocurrency. The level has also already helped the asset out once this month.

With the market constantly evolving, some coins are capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike with groundbreaking innovations and extraordinary potential. VeChain and Fantom are making waves with their recent developments. However, a unique contender, Qubetics ($TICS), is leading the charge with its remarkable presale performance and advanced Web3 solutions. While VeChain has just secured an innovative patent, and Fantom is gearing up for a transformative upgrade, Qubetics is stealing the spotlight. Packed with massive potential for returns, its presale generates significant buzz in the crypto community. This article will cover all three coins’ latest updates and developments—Qubetics, VeChain, and Fantom. Qubetics: Transforming Privacy with Its Decentralised VPN Service What if the internet could be accessed without the risks of surveillance or censorship? As part of its comprehensive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that’s set to redefine online privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPN providers that can log and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN leverages a peer-to-peer network powered by blockchain technology. This ensures user traffic remains entirely decentralised and free from centralised control. The dVPN offers more than just anonymity—it brings transparency and resistance to censorship. Its multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption protect user identities while providing secure, unrestricted internet access. Moreover, the innovative tokenised incentive structure rewards users who contribute bandwidth with $TICS tokens, making the network self-sustaining and encouraging active participation. Adding to the excitement, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to engage with its growing community, answering critical questions and showcasing the platform’s potential. With its cutting-edge features and interactive approach, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to join today . VeChain’s Breakthrough: Secure Data Handling with a New Patent VeChain continues to solidify its position as a leader in enterprise-focused blockchain solutions. The company recently secured a U.S. patent, approved on 17 December 2024, for a groundbreaking system to enhance data security. This patent leverages a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and securely split transaction keys, significantly improving secure data handling capabilities. The innovative key management system (KMS) outlined in the patent enables businesses to safeguard sensitive information effectively. With these advancements, VeChain is reinforcing its role as a pioneer in enterprise blockchain technology, setting new standards in security and reliability. Fantom’s Sonic Mainnet: A Game-Changer in Performance and Scalability Fantom (FTM) is on the rise, surging 16% on 15 December in anticipation of its rebranding and the rollout of the Sonic mainnet. This major upgrade boosts network efficiency, making Fantom faster and more cost-effective. As part of the update, FTM tokens will transition to Sonic (S) through a 1:1 swap, which has sparked considerable excitement among investors. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicate increased demand and positive inflows, supporting Fantom’s bullish trajectory. With support levels firmly established at $1.2, analysts are eyeing resistance points at $1.6 and potentially $2.38, making Fantom a compelling choice for growth-focused investors. Presale Spotlight: Why Qubetics Is the Talk of the Crypto World Investors seeking high returns focus on the Qubetics presale, currently in Phase 13. Each phase witnesses a 10% price increase, with the final stage set to jump by 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.034, and the project has already raised over $7.2 million. Analysts predict that once the mainnet launches, $TICS could soar to between $10 and $15 per token. Imagine investing today and reaping an ROI of over 29,000% if the price hits $10, or an astonishing 43,000% if it climbs to $15. These numbers are no mere speculation—Qubetics has already demonstrated immense traction, proving why it’s one of the best cryptos to join today. The structured price hikes add urgency for investors to act swiftly, securing their position in this promising project before the next phase increases token costs. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads the Pack in Crypto Innovation The crypto market is brimming with potential, and coins like VeChain and Fantom are making commendable strides with their latest updates. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a game-changer, combining innovative Web3 solutions with an electrifying presale that promises exceptional returns. Analysts’ predictions of staggering ROIs and the platform’s robust community engagement make it one of the best cryptos to join today. Don’t miss the chance to be part of Qubetics’ transformative journey. With the presale progressing rapidly, now is the time to act and secure your stake in what could be the next big thing in crypto.

After briefly retesting $99,000, Bitcoin’s price momentum has slowed, raising questions about whether this signals the start of a larger sell-off or a temporary pause in its uptrend. Analysts Highlight BTC Price Key Levels Crypto trader Ali Charts has put a lot of emphasis on the $96,000 level. He explained that if Bitcoin price moves below this level, the following significant points will be $90,000 and $85,000. This view is consistent with the historical Fibonacci levels of retrace commonly employed by traders to understand market reversals. “Keeping it simple, based on the Fib, if Bitcoin loses $96,000, the next focus becomes $90,000 and $85,000,” Ali tweeted. To this, Robert Kiyosaki , a supporter of Bitcoin, said that it is never too late to join the market. He pointed to Bitcoin’s stability and capability to generate riches, saying, “Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich, including those who come in late. Just don’t get greedy.” Long-Term Holders Take Profits as Short-Term Investors Step In Using data from Glassnode, some changes have been observed in the activity of long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs). In the two months period, the total supply held by LTHs has been decreasing from $14.23 billion to $13.31 billion. This comes as BTC price soared from $58,000 to over $100,000 suggesting that institutional investors are booking profits at local highs. However, these sales by the long-term holders have been taken by the short-term holders (STHs) to ensure that the prices are maintained. Glassnode analysts pointed out that “the share of wealth owned by new investors has not yet reached the levels that were seen during the previous cycle peaks” which may mean that there is still some room for growth. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Remains Intact However, based on the correction, some analysts continue to hold the view that the price of Bitcoin is still bullish. The AVIV Ratio, which looks at unrealized profits, is at 1.81, far from the levels that are considered extremely high and which usually signify a reversal in market trends. This means that although some traders may have taken their profits, the market has not become overly aggressive. Meanwhile, the Titan of Crypto still has the positive outlook about Bitcoin’s future. He stressed that Bitcoin has been making higher highs and higher lows which is a positive indication that the trend remains bullish. ”BTC bullish momentum remains strong, with the next target at the 100% Fibonacci extension of $113,000,” he stated. Institutional Demand Could Propel Bitcoin Further The adoption of Bitcoin has remained strong, with Bitcoin ETFs hitting a top of $37 billion in assets by December 19th. This represents a sharp rise from the $24.23 billion at the beginning of November as highlighted by Farside Investors. At the same time, statistics show that at the peak of Bitcoin at $108,000, 62.17% of traders had short positions, expecting the price to fall. However, as Bitcoin dropped to $96,000, the sentiment changed as 55.44% of the traders are now bullish because they anticipate a rally in the price of the cryptocurrency. Supporting this price trend, analysts at Bitfinex believe that the price correction of Bitcoin will be relatively mild owing to the rising demand from institutional investors. They expect it to be at $145,000 by mid-2025, with a possibility of rising to $200,000 in a better environment. Furthermore, in light of the growing talk about the potential of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset at the national level, experts estimate that such a decision could take Bitcoin’s price to $1 million.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 23:57:00

Crypto All-Stars has wrapped up a stellar presale with a $22.64 million haul, solidifying its position as a meme coin powerhouse. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the show with its presale, which has already surpassed $4.2 million in Stage 12. On the flip side, Mog Coin (MOG), once hailed as a meme coin with promise, is struggling to hold its ground amid bearish market conditions. Meme coins have grown beyond being internet jokes. They now represent a unique blend of community power, creative use cases, and, of course, the potential for exponential profits. BTFD Coin is leading this new wave of meme coin evolution with its P2E game, lucrative referral program, staking rewards, and a vibrant community. Let’s dive into why BTFD, Crypto All-Stars, and Mog Coin are the most talked-about meme coins right now and which of them stands out as the best for exponential returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Rising Star in Meme Coins BTFD Coin has taken the meme coin world by storm, and it’s easy to see why. Starting at an initial price of $0.000004, the coin has climbed to $0.00013 in Stage 12 of its presale. With over 57 billion coins sold and $4.2 million raised so far, the numbers speak for themselves. With just four stages left, the presale momentum is building rapidly, and the coin’s listing price of $0.0006 promises substantial short-term returns. BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its presale. Its P2E game offers an engaging way for users to earn rewards, while the referral program incentivises community growth by rewarding users for bringing in new investors. Add in the 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got a project that caters to both gamers and crypto enthusiasts looking for passive income. Here’s an investment scenario to paint the picture. If you invest $30,000 in Stage 12 at $0.00013 per coin, you’d acquire approximately 230.7 million BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would grow to $138,420. That’s the kind of growth that has investors flocking to the project. Why is BTFD one of the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its explosive crypto presale , innovative features, and strong community backing make it a top choice for investors looking to capitalise on the meme coin trend. With the price increasing at every stage, now’s the time to jump in. Crypto All-Stars (STARS): The MemeVault Revolution Crypto All-Stars has already proven itself as a meme coin heavyweight. Its presale, which concluded with $22.64 million raised, set the stage for the launch of its groundbreaking MemeVault—a platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins, including PEPE, Dogecoin, and Floki, under one roof. This innovation has brought a sense of unity to the meme coin community, making $STARS a must-have token for enthusiasts. The $STARS token, priced at $0.0016782 during the presale, comes with lucrative staking rewards of up to 1429% APY. This high return has attracted both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. By reducing the circulating supply through staking incentives, Crypto All-Stars creates scarcity, which often leads to price surges once the token is listed. With the $STARS token set to launch on Uniswap next week, anticipation is building. Early adopters are expected to see substantial gains as more meme coin holders flock to the platform. The MemeVault itself is a game-changer, offering a streamlined way to manage and stake meme coins while earning rewards. Why does $STARS rank among the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its successful presale, innovative staking platform, and upcoming launch make it a strong contender for both short-term and long-term gains. For those who missed the presale, the token launch presents a second chance to get in on the action. Mog Coin (MOG): A Meme Coin Facing Challenges Mog Coin (MOG) entered the scene with a lot of promise, leveraging its quirky branding and strong community backing. However, recent market conditions have posed significant challenges. Once a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts, MOG is now battling bearish pressure that has left its performance lagging behind competitors like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars. MOG’s initial appeal lay in its community-driven initiatives and its potential to carve out a niche in the meme coin space. However, the lack of new developments and a clear roadmap has made it difficult for the project to sustain its early momentum. While the coin still has a loyal following, its price movements have been lacklustre, leaving investors cautious. For MOG to regain its footing, it needs a fresh narrative or a major update to its ecosystem. Without these, it risks falling further behind in a market that thrives on innovation and community engagement. While some investors are holding on in the hope of a turnaround, others are shifting their focus to projects like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars, which offer clearer paths to exponential profits. Why does MOG make this list? Its initial success and strong community give it a place among notable meme coins, but its current struggles highlight the importance of staying ahead in a competitive market. For now, MOG is a speculative play rather than a reliable choice for significant returns. The Concluding Remarks: What Are the Best Meme Coins for Exponential Growth Next Year? Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market offers a wealth of opportunities for investors seeking exponential profits. BTFD Coin is the best meme coin for exponential profits, thanks to its stellar presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support. A $30,000 investment in Stage 12 could grow to $138,420 by the end of the presale, showcasing its immense potential. Crypto All-Stars is another standout, with its MemeVault innovation and successful presale setting the stage for substantial gains. While Mog Coin has its merits, its current challenges make it a riskier option compared to its competitors. If you’re ready to capitalise on these opportunities, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin meme coin presale today and position yourself for exponential profits in the ever-evolving meme coin market. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing in crypto.

The video included a disclaimer suggesting there’s no guarantee the cap won’t be altered. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is a cornerstone of its value as a store of wealth, and any change could fundamentally impact its perception among investors. In the video, BlackRock highlighted Bitcoin’s 21 million cap, noting it as a “hard-coded rule” that controls supply, purchasing power, and prevents excessive currency creation. However, the disclaimer stated: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor reposted the video, sparking criticism. Joel Valenzuela, Dashpay’s marketing director, commented, “When the supply cap increase happens, it will have ‘always been part of the plan.’ And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say Bitcoin wasn’t hijacked.” Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis added, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Is Bitcoin’s Supply Cap Changeable? Bitcoin developer Super Testnet, known for BitVM, explained that altering Bitcoin’s supply cap would depend on how one defines “Bitcoin.” In theory, the cap could change if a majority of the community—node operators, developers, miners, and investors—reached consensus on a hard fork. Such a change would involve a proposal to gauge consensus, followed by implementing changes in Bitcoin Core. If most node operators and miners adopted the new fork, it would create a “new” Bitcoin network with an uncapped supply. However, Super Testnet argued that this new chain wouldn’t truly be Bitcoin. “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” they said. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” In essence, an uncapped version wouldn’t be Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FORKS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 00:36:00

The SEC is reviewing these products to ensure whether they follow regulations and protect investors. This move helps bring digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem by preventing from frauds. Nasdaq and Cboe BZX Exchange crypto index ETF Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange changed their rules for listing and trading with exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to spot bitcoin and ether ETF. Nasdaq intends to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, while the Cboe BZX Exchange aims to introduce the Franklin Crypto Index ETF. These ETPs will directly hold spot bitcoin and ether and cash equivalents. The goal of listing these assets on the exchanges is to increase their accessibility. SEC’s Role in Regulating The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is reviewing these listings according to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which sets rules for trading securities on exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe BZX, for ensuring fairness and transparency. The Securities Act of 1933 regulates how securities are issued and required proper disclosures to protect investors on Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange. The Investment Company Act of 1940 governs investment products like ETFs to ensure they follow rules that protect investors. In addition to this, The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) regulates financial products linked to bitcoin and ether as commodities. The proposed Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act could shape future cryptocurrency regulations to ensure safe investment practices. The SEC believes that the proposed rule changes meet these requirements, especially those to prevent fraud and market manipulation. Additionally, the Commission emphasizes the necessity of surveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges to detect fraudulent activities and maintain market integrity. To minimize the risk of market manipulation, the SEC investigates how the spot markets for assets like bitcoin and ether that are correlated with their futures markets. In previous approvals for Bitcoin and Ether-based ETPs, the SEC confirmed that price movements in spot markets which closely reflected in futures markets. This correlation indicates that if manipulation or fraud occurs in the spot market, it is more like an evident in the futures market, which is easier to monitor. The CME’s bitcoin and ether futures markets have exhibited strong correlations with their spot markets, giving the SEC confidence that these new ETFs can be effectively supervised. The SEC has decided that the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and the Franklin Crypto Index ETF follow all necessary rules. These products are in line with past approvals of similar bitcoin and ether-based investment products. By introducing these new ETPs, investors will have access to spot bitcoin and ether in a regulated environment, which enhances security and transparency in their cryptocurrency investments. This approval is an important step in bringing digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem, with the help of SEC.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.58 million YouTube subscribers that ETH will likely break through its all-time high and enter an explosive phase this cycle. “Barring any black swan events spoiling our party, we should be able to take for granted that ETH will break through its previous all-time high of around $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Where it goes from there, though, is the real question. Because ETH has spent so much time sliding against BTC and wallowing in price purgatory, it can be difficult to imagine a parabolic repricing. However, once the all-time high is broken, there will be no historical levels of supply or resistance above. Price discovery will ensue, and ETH is likely to teleport moonwards.” Crypto traders and analysts refer to price discovery as a situation where a coin trades at levels never seen before or not having been seen in a long time. Next, the analyst uses Fibonacci extension levels to suggest that ETH may surge to $7,300 as a “base case,” which is the 1.618 Fibonacci level on the chart he shares. Traders use Fibonacci extensions in technical analysis to estimate profit targets and price pullbacks. They are based on Fibonacci ratios. Source: Guy Turner/YouTube However, he says if Bitcoin nearly doubles its current price next year and hits $200,000, ETH could surge even higher, to $14,600. “ETH has only just made it to the 0.786 [Fibonacci] level. So rather than doubling this price, we think doubling ETH price at the 1.618 level will give us a better upper limit of what could happen in 2025. This 1.618 level is about $7,300 which, again, we think is a pretty good base case target. Doubling this would give us $14,600. For an asset that has underperformed BTC so severely, this sounds like a tall order indeed, and it’s therefore the most extreme bullish case for 2025 that we can take seriously. If BTC touches $200,000 in 2025 orthodoxy suggests that profits will rotate into ETH. With BTC at such a high level, this could be enough capital to bring ETH up above $14,000.” Ethereum is trading for $3,686 at time of writing, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $101,143 at time of writing, down 4.6% on the day.

Following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply below $99,000. However, the leading crypto quickly rebounded, climbing back to $104,000 earlier today before settling at $100,573 at the time of writing. This represents a 3.4% decrease over the past day and a roughly $67 billion reduction in its market cap valuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Momentum Shifts As Spot Market Outpaces Futures – Here’s What It Means Exchange Transactions Hit Record Lows Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst known as Woominkyu provided insights into Bitcoin’s market activity, highlighting declining exchange transaction volumes. According to Woominkyu, historical data suggests a correlation between transaction volume spikes and significant price movements. For example, peaks in exchange transactions coincided with Bitcoin’s dramatic price surges in 2017 and 2021. However, recent data shows a marked decline in transaction volumes on both spot and derivative exchanges, reflecting reduced trading activity compared to previous years. This decrease, according to the CryptoQuant analyst may indicate “waning market participation,” suggesting a “period of consolidation or reduced volatility” in the near term. Bitcoin Key Support Levels and Technical Insights Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shed light on an important support zone forming just below the $100,000 mark. The data shared by the platform reveals that over 1.45 million BTC were accumulated at an average price of $97,500. This accumulation has established a significant demand zone, potentially serving as a “buffer” against further price declines. The importance of this level lies in its ability to provide a foundation for price stability, particularly as Bitcoin navigates its current phase of market correction. It is suggested that a breach below this zone could trigger further downward pressure, while holding above it might boost recovery efforts. Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, insights shared by market analyst Satoshi Wolf highlight the critical nature of Bitcoin’s current price levels. The cryptocurrency recently tested the $100,000 support, aligning with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Related Reading: Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? Top Exec Discusses The Market Crash This level is pivotal as it combines technical indicators with psychological significance. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows bearish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nears oversold territory, signalling the potential for a price reversal. Wolf suggests that traders monitor for a confirmed breakout above $104,000 or a breakdown below $100,000, with volume confirmation being key to validating either. 📊 $BTC Analysis: The chart shows a recent pullback after a strong uptrend, suggesting potential profit-taking. Price is testing the 100,000 support, aligning with the 100 EMA, a crucial level to watch. If it holds, a bounce back towards 104,000 resistance is possible.

Render is currently experiencing strong market momentum, indicated by its recent price increases and expanding partnerships that signal potential for future growth in its GPU-powered decentralized network. Stacks has achieved a significant milestone with the launch of the ‘Nakamoto’ upgrade, enhancing both speed and security, and it has set ambitious price targets following an increase in user engagement and smart contract activity. Web3Bay is introducing a transformative e-commerce ecosystem built on blockchain technology, aiming to revolutionize online shopping with enhanced security, community-driven governance, and versatile transaction options. As each project develops, Web3Bay is particularly notable for its innovative approach to merging decentralized shopping experiences within a community-oriented platform. Render Sees Growing Momentum Render has been capitalizing on bullish market trends, supported by its decentralized GPU rendering network that connects creators with GPU resources. This platform provides an economical and efficient solution for rendering tasks, gaining popularity among artists, developers, and creatives who require high-performance graphics at lower costs. With a significant 21.39% price increase over the past week, Render is garnering increasing market attention, especially as it nears critical price thresholds. Render’s growth is bolstered by strategic partnerships, including a recent collaboration with Apple, enhancing its credibility and market reach. Analysts are optimistic about RNDR’s potential, with projections of substantial price increases in the near future. Render’s dedication to delivering cost-effective, high-quality rendering services positions it as a preferred provider in the sector. Stacks Enhances Capabilities with Nakamoto Upgrade Stacks is strengthening its foundation for Bitcoin-based smart contracts with the Nakamoto upgrade, marking a significant advancement in transaction speed and security, which benefits developers of decentralized applications. This upgrade has contributed to a price surge of over 30% in the past month, driven by unprecedented levels of smart contract deployment and growing interest in its ecosystem. Stacks is increasingly recognized for its ability to extend Bitcoin’s functionality, attracting more users to decentralized finance and applications. With rising adoption and an increase in total value locked, there is a strong sentiment about STX’s potential for further gains. The project’s emphasis on enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities positions it as an exciting option for long-term decentralized solutions. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-commerce Web3Bay is redefining the online shopping experience with its blockchain-based e-commerce platform. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay offers a decentralized marketplace that empowers users to fully control their data and transactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay enhances security, transparency, and user experience, bridging the gap between conventional e-commerce and Web3. It supports transactions using both cryptocurrencies and mainstream payment methods like PayPal, broadening its accessibility. The 3BAY token, integral to Web3Bay’s operations, has shown impressive returns for early investors. During its presale stages, the price of 3BAY has consistently risen, achieving a remarkable 6430% return on investment for those who participated early. The strong demand and growth potential are evident as Web3Bay gears up for its full launch. Web3Bay’s unique model fosters significant network growth by rewarding active user engagement, making community interaction a key driver of its development. This community-centric approach, coupled with decentralized governance, ensures the platform remains responsive to user needs, promoting continued growth and adding value to the 3BAY token.

With a progressive approach to e-commerce and a robust token economy, Web3Bay is positioning the 3BAY token as an attractive investment for those looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized, community-driven online commerce. In Conclusion While each project—Web3Bay, Render, and Stacks—brings unique strengths, Web3Bay’s comprehensive e-commerce ecosystem sets it apart as a standout choice. Render’s ongoing bullish momentum in the graphics field and Stacks’ ambitious targets with its Bitcoin-focused smart contracts are notable, but Web3Bay’s integration of blockchain technology with online shopping, creating a community-based marketplace, presents a compelling case. With high ROI potential and the prospect of becoming a next 100x asset, Web3Bay’s decentralized, user-centric model makes it an appealing choice for those exploring the innovative frontiers of e-commerce on the blockchain.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 01:28:00

This marks a major step toward integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum into traditional financial markets through regulated investment products. Dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to Be Listed on Nasdaq and Cboe BZX The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and Franklin Templeton Crypto Index ETF received the green light from the SEC to trade in the public market. These ETFs will be available for trading on the Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX exchanges, allowing investors to directly trade in Bitcoin and Ethereum spot. All the two funds will own Bitcoin, Ethereum, cash, and cash equivalents as part of their structure. By permitting these ETFs, the SEC guarantees that crypto investments meet some of the most important laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. SEC has *approved* both the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF & Franklin Crypto Index ETF… Will initially hold both btc & eth. pic.twitter.com/5GUhhhXL7y — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 19, 2024 The approval process also contained measures for market surveillance in order to prevent fraud and manipulation. The decision will help digital assets to have a better standing and acceptance in the financial system. Market Turbulence Surrounds SEC Decision The US SEC’s decision is made at the time of high volatility of cryptocurrency markets. However, Bitcoin price declined significantly and was trading at slightly above $96,000, having previously traded at above $108,000 earlier in the week. Ethereum also went down by 15% and was trading at $3,440. As per the data from CoinGlass, more than $1 billion worth of crypto was liquidated within the last 24 hours. However, experts believe that the launch of these ETFs will help to stabilize the crypto market and, therefore, attract more institutional investors. “This move created a clear, legally compliant way for investors to get involved with digital assets,” said a market analyst. ETFs Bring Enhanced Oversight and Transparency The ETFs are intended to mimic market capitalization-weighted indexes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, thus providing investors with an opportunity to invest in both of them without owning the coins directly. The Hashdex ETF will track the Nasdaq Crypto Index and Franklin Templeton’s fund will be linked to the CF Institutional Digital Asset Index. In a bid to counter allegations of market manipulation, the US SEC noted that the price movements in the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot markets are in tandem with their respective futures markets. This correlation makes it easy to have supervision through sharing of surveillance data. To assess the price integrity, the SEC has used information from the CME’s Bitcoin and Ethereum futures markets. To avoid diversifying their strategies into staking or generating income from airdrops, both funds do not allow such operations in their investment approach based on spot prices. These measures are part of the regulatory systems to safeguard the investors’ interest as well as to enhance transparency of ETFs. Future Prospects for Crypto ETFs This approval could pave the way for additional cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States. Bloomberg analysts predict Litecoin ETFs could be next, given its classification as a commodity and its close relationship with Bitcoin. However, other digital assets, such as Solana and XRP, face greater regulatory scrutiny. The US SEC’s approval of these ETFs reflects a cautious but constructive approach to cryptocurrency regulation. By aligning these products with existing financial laws, the SEC is enabling safer participation in the digital asset market. This decision could encourage more institutional and retail investors to explore cryptocurrency as part of a diversified portfolio.

The funding is part of the orgainzation’s most recent round of Bitcoin Development Fund grants. During the last round of the Bitcoin Development Fund Grant in 2022, the HRF granted $325,000 to various projects worldwide. This year, the organization has gone bigger and better, granting 7 BTC, approximately $706,000, to twenty projects worldwide according to the press release it sent to the Bitcoin Magazine. The HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund is focused on supporting projects that enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem. It especially has interests in regions where people live under unfavorable conditions. The program funds projects that promote decentralization, privacy, and education, and its goal is to empower individuals and communities facing oppressive regimes. HRF reaches a hand out The guarantees for the HRF’s Bitcoin development fund are projects in Latin America, Asia, and Africa that focus on technical education in regions with authoritarian governments. The organization did not disclose how much each of this round’s recipients will receive. However, it revealed that the 20 awarded projects will share a grand total of 7 BTC. The winning projects from this round include Stratum V2 Reference Implementation (SRI), an open-source software and Public Pool, an open-source mining pool. Both projects are centered around making Bitcoin more accessible and decentralized. Other projects include UI/UX Design for Bitcoin Core, No BS Bitcoin, Tando, YakiHonne, and many more. Each of these projects contributes to the accessibility and decentralization of Bitcoin in their various regions. HRF rewards odds-defying individuals Among the guarantees of the $706,000 grant are Naiyoma and Daniella Brozzoni. Naiyoma is the first female Bitcoin core developer from Africa. Kenya, where Naiyoma hails from, has experienced instances of electoral authoritarianism. Financial freedom and human rights are also under threat. Considering this, Naiyoma is dedicated to creating an open financial system rooted in transparency, freedom, and fairness. Her work focuses on reviewing pull requests, fixing bugs through new PRs, and improving Bitcoin Core’s code base. The HRF fund allocation is expected to support her work in advancing Bitcoin Core. Daniella Brozzoni is also a developer. She previously contributed to the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK), a software library that supports building cross-platform Bitcoin wallets. Like Naiyoma, Daniella now also focuses on Bitcoin Core, where her job includes reviewing key pull requests, contributing to new features, and improving test coverage. The work of these dedicated developers will contribute to the decentralization of Bitcoin making it more accessible, secure and resilient.

With so many options on the market, keeping an eye on promising developments is crucial. While many investors are focused on mainstream coins, emerging projects often hold the potential for exponential returns. Filecoin has been making headlines with its ambitious price predictions, and Stacks continues to garner attention for its innovative approach to blockchain utility. However, the spotlight is firmly on Qubetics ($TICS), a revolutionary blockchain platform that’s capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. Its presale momentum and groundbreaking technology are turning heads in the crypto space. This article will cover the latest updates and developments around Qubetics, Filecoin, and Stacks—three of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Qubetics: Cross-Border Payments Redefined What if financial institutions could execute cross-border payments instantly, securely, and at a fraction of the current costs? Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a solution that makes this possible, empowering banks and financial institutions to streamline international transactions. By leveraging the $TICS token, Qubetics addresses long-standing inefficiencies in global payment systems. Traditional cross-border payments often come with delays, high fees, and a lack of transparency. Qubetics flips this narrative, enabling swift, transparent transactions that cater to the needs of both corporate entities and individuals. For businesses, this means quicker settlements, improved cash flow, and the ability to stay competitive in global markets. It simplifies remittances and international transfers for individuals, ensuring money reaches its destination without undue complications. Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to enhance community engagement, addressing queries from its rapidly growing audience. Such transparency and involvement only make it one of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Filecoin: The Backbone of Decentralised Storage Filecoin is gaining traction as a decentralised storage network that aims to preserve the world’s most critical data securely.

For XRP, the support at $2.20 plays an important role. Since the beginning of December 2024, the altcoin has reached this level more than four times, and each time it has experienced an upside rally. However, this time, sentiment appears to be similar, as the price has started moving upward. Long-Term Holders Rising Interest in XRP The current market sentiment appears negative, as the market has witnessed a significant $1.18 billion in crypto liquidations . This substantial liquidation has created fear among traders and investors, discouraging them from staying and participating in the asset. $220 Million of XRP outflow Despite the fear, traders and long-term holders seem optimistic about XRP, as they have purchased millions worth of tokens during this price decline, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from XRP spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a continuous and significant outflow of $220 million worth of XRP. Source: Coinglasss This outflow indicates a bullish outlook for XRP despite the ongoing price decline, as long-term holders continue to believe in the token. This explains why exchanges are experiencing substantial token outflows. In the cryptocurrency context, “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to long-term holders’ wallets, signaling a potential upside rally and an ideal buying opportunity. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, XRP appears bullish as the price is showing signs of a reversal from the crucial support level of $2.20. Based on the recent price action, the altcoin is near the buying zone, where it has typically experienced an upside rally. Source: Trading View If XRP holds the $2.20 support level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 13% to reach the next resistance level of $2.50 in the near future. On the other hand, if XRP falls below the support level and closes a daily candle below the $2.20 level, we could see XRP dropping to $2 or even lower in the future. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.30 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.70% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 7%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors.",News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 02:24:32

The surge in these metrics has resulted from the significant price drop for Dogecoin, which is down over 5% in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin Trading Volume And Liquidations Witness Significant Spike CoinMarketCap data shows that Dogecoins’s trading volume is up over 57% in the last 24 hours, with over $6 billion traded during this period. Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin’s liquidations have crossed $31 million, with $25 million and $5.8 in long and short positions liquidated, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Run To $11 ATH? Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer Long positions took the most hit as the Dogecoin price crashed below the $0.4 range. This development came following Jerome Powell’s speech, which painted a bearish picture for the foremost meme coin. As crypto analyst Kevin Capital revealed, Dogecoin’s technical indicators were already bearish, and the macroeconomic fundamentals only did more damage. Powell suggested that the US Federal Reserve will likely pause on the rate cuts next year, which immediately sparked a bearish sentiment among traders and led to a wave of sell-offs. This contributed to the spike in trading volume, as investors looked to offload their coins, considering how the Fed being hawkish is bearish for risk assets like Dogecoin. However, Kevin Capital believes that traders are overreacting to Jerome Powell’s speech. The crypto analyst believes that Dogecoin will recover this price correction, stating that the dip will be bought. However, it is worth mentioning Dogecoin’s correlation with Bitcoin, as Kevin Capital had previously pointed out that DOGE’s next move will depend on BTC. The Bitcoin price has dropped below the $100,000 psychological price level and looks bearish at the moment. As such, the Dogecoin price recovery is unlikely to happen until Bitcoin witnesses a bullish reversal. Increased Volatility Is Not Unusual Crypto analyst Master Kenobi also commented on the Dogecoin price drop, stating that increased volatility at this stage of the bull market is not unusual. However, the analyst suggested that traders should avoid being shaken out and instead hold on to their positions. This came as he claimed that market makers who will inject money into the market would prefer for market participants to walk away with a 90% loss rather than a 10x gain. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Recovery Toward $2 As Million-Dollar Whale Transactions Explode On The Network Bitcoinist recently reported that Dogecoin’s sentiment has turned negative once again, indicating that DOGE holders may be looking to sell their coins even at a loss. Kevin Capital had before now stated that the Dogecoin bull run is far from over, suggesting that there was no need to be bearish at the moment despite the price correction. He advised long-term holders just to sit back and wait for higher prices. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.36, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

For now, only a few select users can access the card, and a date for the full release to the public has yet to be announced. The project shared the news via an announcement on its X account. Part of the post read, “Today we’re kicking off a limited pilot program in the United States where some of you will get your hands on MetaMask Card and try it out before it goes to a wider release.” Metamast tests the US markets The soft launch in the US is a precursor to a full-scale launch. Currently, the MetaMask card is only available to select areas in the US, with users in New York and Vermont not making the list. The MetaMask team went on to urge users who were not accepted into the pilot program to apply to join the waitlist. Users of MetaMask and other self-custodial wallets face the challenge of using their crypto funds to make payments for common goods and services directly without having to move these funds to centralized wallets or banks. The MetaMask card could be a game-changer in allowing crypto holders to easily complete transactions in real-time without first converting or transferring their crypto funds. According to Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the parent company behind MetaMask, “MetaMask Card represents a major step to removing the friction that has existed between the blockchain and traditional payments. This is a paradigm shift that offers the best of both worlds.” He also added that the card pilot program gives people the freedom to spend crypto. The MetaMask card allows direct spending from self-custodial wallets To get the card, users have to first check their eligibility on their MetaMask portfolios before registering for the digital card. Once they go through these steps, they can then set it up as a payment method on their mobile devices as it can be integrated into Apple Pay and Google Pay. Funds that users can spend directly from the card include cryptos such as USDC, USDT, and WETH on the Linea network. They can also set spending limits for their card. The card launched in August of this year, and it allows users to spend the crypto they hold on MetaMask anywhere. This means that a MetaMask cardholder can use their card to make payments in fiat currency anywhere a Mastercard is accepted, thanks to their partnership with Mastercard and Baanx. At the time of its initial launch , the card was available in Europe and the UK, with the promise to roll it out in other locations. So far, the card is now operational in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Columbia. According to the partners, the card joins the Web2 world to Web3, by leveraging Mastercard’s merchant network, MetaMask’s security, the efficiency of the Linea network, and the depth of experience Baanx brings in building financial technologies and cards in the Web3 space.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $95,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Further Bitcoin price failed to start another increase and extended losses below the $102,000 zone. BTC gained bearish momentum below the $100,000 and $98,000 levels. The price even spiked below $96,500. A low was formed at $95,586 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

A clear move above the $100,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $102,000. A close above the $102,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $103,400 resistance level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $108,295 swing high to the $95,586 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $105,000 level. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $98,500 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $96,200 level. The first major support is near the $95,500 level. The next support is now near the $93,200 zone.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

Today, let’s dive into two meme coins that could leave you with serious FOMO if you don’t act fast: Neiro, the heartfelt underdog carrying Doge’s legacy, and BTFD Coin , the meme coin disrupting presales with a bang. Neiro might already be flying high, but if you missed its meteoric rise, don’t fret—BTFD Coin’s presale is still open and packing more potential than your favourite meme thread. Neiro: The Little Sister You Didn’t Know You Needed Neiro’s story reads like a Hollywood script: abandoned, rescued, and now a star in her own right. Once a stray dog in a shelter, Neiro was adopted by the same woman who owned Kabosu—the Shiba Inu behind the legendary Doge meme. Her journey from obscurity to fame mirrors the rise of her namesake meme coin, which burst onto the scene with a purpose: to combine internet culture with real-world impact. When Neiro launched on Ethereum during the New Moon on August 4th, 2024, the crypto community took notice. Even Vitalik Buterin himself gave the project his nod of approval, marking only the second time he has publicly supported a meme coin (the first being SHIB). His $500,000 donation to an animal welfare fund not only solidified Neiro’s credibility but also showcased its commitment to making a difference. With the original developer long gone, the community stepped up to take the reins, making Neiro a 100% community-owned project. This transparency and collective spirit have turned it into a meme coin with a heart, backed by donations to shelters and other charitable initiatives. But here’s the kicker: if you missed out on Neiro’s launch, you’ve likely missed its biggest gains. Early adopters are already reaping rewards, and unless you’re comfortable buying in at higher prices, the train may have left the station. BTFD Coin: Don’t Miss This One Too If Neiro has you feeling that sinking “missed ICO” feeling, don’t despair. There’s another meme coin making waves right now: BTFD Coin (short for “Buy the Dip”). It’s bold, it’s brash, and it’s built for those who love turning market chaos into opportunities. Currently in its 12th presale stage, BTFD Coin is proving that it’s not just a cheeky name—it’s a serious contender in the meme coin world. Here’s the latest scoop: Current Price: $0.00013 Funds Raised: Over $4.2 million, including $1M in under 10 days and $2.5M within 14 days of its presale launch. Community Strength: Over 6,000 holders have already joined the Bulls Squad. Coins Sold: More than 57 billion BTFD Coins have been snapped up by eager investors. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. The project combines 90% APY staking rewards, an exciting Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , and a dedicated community of Bulls driving its momentum. And unlike some meme coins, BTFD Coin is built with longevity in mind, featuring locked liquidity and a vested token distribution to ensure stability. Investment Example: Don’t Let This One Slip By Let’s break down the numbers to see what’s on the table if you act now. At the current presale price of $0.00013, a $900 investment would secure you 6,923,077 BTFD Coins. Now imagine this: if the coin reaches its predicted post-launch value of $0.0006—a realistic target given the buzz surrounding it—your $900 investment could grow to a whopping $4,153.85. That’s a potential 360% return on your money. The presale is moving fast, so the clock is ticking. Don’t let this be another missed opportunity. Lessons from Neiro: Don’t Wait for the Moon to Strike Twice If there’s one thing Neiro’s rise has taught us, it’s that timing is everything in crypto. Those who got in early are now sitting pretty, while the rest of us are left wondering, What if? Neiro’s story isn’t just inspiring—it’s a reminder of what the meme coin space is all about: community, culture, and a little bit of chaos. And while it’s still a strong contender, the best time to invest in Neiro was yesterday. The second-best time? Well, maybe not today if you’re looking for explosive growth. This is where BTFD Coin steps in. With its presale still underway, it offers something Neiro can’t anymore: a chance to get in early and ride the wave from the ground floor. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let FOMO Win Again The crypto world is full of “what ifs” and “if onlys.” If you missed Neiro’s launch and its early gains, it’s easy to feel like you’ve missed your shot. But here’s the thing: the next big opportunity is always just around the corner. BTFD Coin’s presale is that opportunity. With its unique combination of staking rewards, a P2E game, and a strong community, it’s positioned to be the next big wave in the meme coin world. But presales don’t last forever, and neither do low prices. Don’t let BTFD Coin be another Neiro—a coin you regret not jumping on while you had the chance. Act now, join the Bulls Squad, and ride this wave to the moon.

ETH is down over 7% and is showing bearish signs below the $3,550 level. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,680 zone. The price is trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it fails to stay above the $3,650 support zone. Ethereum Price Drops Below $3,650 Ethereum price struggled to start a fresh increase above the $3,680 level and extended losses like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $3,650 level and dived below $3,600. It even dived below $3,550 and spiked below the $3,420 level. A low was formed at $3,324 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,510 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,105 swing high to the $3,324 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,650 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $3,715 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,105 swing high to the $3,324 low. A clear move above the $3,715 resistance might send the price toward the $3,800 resistance. An upside break above the $3,800 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,880 resistance zone or even $4,000. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,320 zone. A clear move below the $3,320 support might push the price toward the $3,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050.

Last week, Bitcoin spot ETF inflows skyrocketed to $2.17 billion in just five days, highlighting growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, XRP’s market holds potential bullish moves as its price hovers near critical levels, attracting attention. Among these trends, the spotlight rests firmly on one standout project: BlockDAG (BDAG) . This Layer-1 blockchain contender has become a favorite among enthusiasts and developers, thanks to its groundbreaking Whitepaper V3 . The paper introduces key innovations addressing scalability and security issues. With daily inflows exceeding $5 million and presale figures crossing $169 million, BlockDAG has set the bar high. Its GHOSTDAG protocol is a game-changer, offering unmatched transaction speed and security. This solidifies its position as a must-watch crypto for those focused on long-term potential. Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflows Soar to $2.17 Billion According to data shared by @WuBlockchain, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $2.17 billion over five consecutive trading days. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was the leading contributor, with $1.51 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which brought in $598 million. These ETFs now account for 5.71% of Bitcoin’s total market cap, signaling their growing importance. However, there are mixed signals. Grayscale’s GBTC witnessed $221 million in outflows, reflecting a shift in preferences. Experts also warn that Bitcoin spot ETFs could amplify market volatility, creating challenges for smaller players. Despite these concerns, institutional interest remains strong, underscoring Bitcoin’s prominence in the crypto ecosystem. XRP’s Road to $2.70: Hope with Hurdles XRP continues to consolidate near $0.50, with bulls targeting a breakout to $2.70. The optimism stems from growing legal clarity and increased institutional attention. XRP’s unique utility in cross-border transactions keeps it on traders’ watchlists as a promising opportunity. That said, resistance at $0.55 has slowed momentum, and analysts caution against possible dips if this barrier isn’t broken. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties, while improving, still hover over XRP’s broader adoption prospects. Despite these hurdles, the market remains optimistic, positioning XRP as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. BlockDAG Presale Rockets to $169M Milestone! BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3 is reshaping the Layer-1 blockchain space with features designed to solve industry-wide challenges. Its GHOSTDAG protocol enables simultaneous block creation, ensuring faster transactions and greater scalability while mitigating risks like double-spending and 51% attacks. The whitepaper’s vision includes EVM compatibility, which simplifies deploying Ethereum-based dApps on BlockDAG’s network. Future updates, such as cross-chain bridging, are also in the pipeline, unlocking interoperability that could drive significant ecosystem growth. This innovation has captivated developers, traders, and miners alike. The presale momentum is proof of its rising popularity. BlockDAG’s daily inflows exceed $5 million, and total sales have surpassed $169 million. More than 17.3 billion coins have already been sold, with prices surging from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0234 in the current batch 26. Early supporters have seen an impressive 2240% surge. Meanwhile, over $5.9 million in miner sales have been recorded, with nearly 15,000 miners sold. As more batches sell out quickly, the presale is moving closer to its $600 million goal. With ongoing market interest and developer adoption, BlockDAG is positioned for exponential growth. For those exploring promising blockchain solutions, this could be a pivotal moment to engage with one of the most talked-about projects in crypto. Closing Thoughts: BlockDAG Leads the Way While Bitcoin spot ETFs captured $2.17 billion in inflows and XRP traders eye a potential rise to $2.70, BlockDAG continues to dominate headlines. Its Whitepaper V3 has solidified its position as a leader in addressing blockchain’s pressing issues. With daily inflows surpassing $5 million and a record-breaking $169 million presale, BlockDAG is creating ripples across the industry. As its presale approaches new milestones, BlockDAG remains a top contender for those seeking transformative blockchain projects.

These aren’t your typical crypto investments. They combine spot Bitcoin and Ethereum into one package, making it easier—and maybe even safer—for people to invest in the two biggest digital currencies at once. SEC has *approved* both the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF & Franklin Crypto Index ETF… Will initially hold both btc & eth. pic.twitter.com/5GUhhhXL7y — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 19, 2024 Bitcoin Meets Ethereum in a Balanced Package There are so many crypto ETFs running already, so what is so special about these two? Instead of focusing on just Bitcoin or Ethereum, they mix both. The allocation depends on the market value of each, so investors get a well-balanced exposure. Why does this matter? It’s simple: putting everything into just one cryptocurrency can feel risky. By holding both, these ETFs spread out the risk and let you benefit from the strengths of each. For anyone who finds the idea of buying Bitcoin or Ethereum directly too overwhelming, these ETFs could be the answer. They simplify the process, making crypto investments more accessible to regular people. A Big Step for Crypto Investing The SEC’s decision to approve these ETFs shows that regulators are starting to take the crypto market seriously. This is a major milestone not just for the crypto space but for SEC as well. So why did these ETFs get approved? A key reason is the strong connection between Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and their spot prices. This link helps keep things stable and reduces the chances of manipulation, which is a big win for investors. These ETFs also follow strict guidelines to protect investors. They’re tied to agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to monitor trading activity and keep everything above board. The SEC isn’t just handing out approvals—they’ve made sure these ETFs meet high standards for security and transparency. What’s Next ? This approval could open the door for even more creative investment options in the future. By combining Bitcoin and Ethereum, these ETFs simplify the process of getting into crypto. They remove the hassle of managing multiple wallets or worrying about buying and storing digital assets directly. And this could just be the start. Other cryptocurrencies might join similar ETFs down the road. For now, though, these Bitcoin-Ethereum combos are a big step forward. If you’ve been waiting for a way to explore crypto without all the complications, this could be exactly what you’ve been looking for.",News|Bitcoin ETF|Ethereum ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 03:27:36
37866539,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52650,1734665328,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,What Will Replace Betting Sponsorships As The Most Common Football Sponsorship?,https://timestabloid.com/what-will-replace-betting-sponsorships-as-the-most-common-football-sponsorship/,"For those who don’t know, starting from the 2026/27 Premier League season, betting sponsors will no longer be allowed as the front sport on a kit. This has been a long-form debate among football fans as the promotion of betting, as heavy as it is in football, has been perceived as a negative. This is obviously based on the negative connotations of betting as a whole and with football and the Premier League being the biggest sport in the world, having a constant betting reminder on kits in front of young fans, people of religion and people who have a negative relationship with betting, isn’t the best sign and isn’t as marketable as the Premier League wants to be. As we move forward, the betting sponsorships will be (slightly) removed from the game we love. We say slightly because the kits themselves cannot have betting sponsorships on the front, but, the betting sponsors on the sleeves and with the kits themselves will still be allowed. So overall, the change is fairly small. In the wake of these sponsorships being banned, we turn to the question: instead of Premier League betting sites or betting sites as a whole being the sponsorships, who will take over as the most used sponsor for these Premier League clubs? Cryptocurrency I think when we look at the similarities between crypto and betting, there is a huge overlap between the two. Crypto is a long-term financial investment whereas betting is a short-term and more risky version of the same thing. The reason why betting sponsors are so common is because the sports betting industry is so lucrative for the companies and the teams they sponsor. Crypto is daily similar, the money in crypto is huge and cryptocurrencies will be looking at premier league clubs as a form of marketing to get their name out there. If more people are investing in crypto, there is more money to be made and that is the goal behind every sponsorship. As well as this, there are already links between crypto and football, with certain crypto sites looking to the football industry and its fans with football-themed coins, as well as teams like Manchester City, having delved into the crypto sponsorship market already. Technology Sponsors We understand that this point is incredibly vague, but the technology is one of the biggest powerhouses in the entire world. Not only is the industry growing and changing every single day, but it also is financially the biggest industry in the world. Because technology is forever changing and billions of dollars are being invested each year, the finances are perfect for Premier League clubs. Being a sponsor on one of the biggest teams in the world’s shirts is enough marketing and exposure for years to come and with these sponsorships usually being locked deals for years and years, these companies will be licking their lips. Car Sponsors We have already seen car sponsorships throughout the years in the Premier League, if you have a good memory, you will remember Manchester United’s Chevrolet sponsorship all those years ago and this is a good sign for the car companies as they know clubs will be interested in their sponsorship offers. The car industry is, again, financially huge and compared to the crypto industry, the car industry is a lot safer and less risky to push into fans’ faces.

Currently trading at $2.21, the XRP price has recorded a nearly 5% gain in the past 24 hours, finding strong support just below its current price. This positions the token favorably for continued upward momentum, particularly since it began an upward trend on November 5, bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump’s re-election. $10.82 Target For The XRP Price Following Historical Patterns Interestingly, analysts are increasingly optimistic about the XRP price, especially considering a key technical indicator: the Bollinger Bands. This volatility indicator, which consists of a moving average and upper and lower bands, is currently tightening on the 12-hour chart. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts Analyst Steph has noted that the last time the Bollinger Bands exhibited such a pattern, the XRP price experienced a staggering 490% price explosion. If history repeats itself, this could propel XRP to a new all-time high of $10.82, significantly surpassing its previous record of $3.40 set in January 2018, according to the analyst. Adding to the bullish sentiment, another analyst known as Javon on X (formerly Twitter) has pointed out that XRP’s last full bull cycle saw an increase of over 600%. The analyst suggests that if the XRP price performs similarly, it could rise dramatically, potentially exceeding 6,800% to reach approximately $168. This projection hinges on the price moving above the 2.414 Fibonacci Extension level, which was valued at $3,06 during the previous cycle. However, some analysts are adopting a more conservative outlook. Key Levels At $2.42 And $2.92 In Focus DarkDefender has noted a clear break on the daily chart, predicting that the XRP price could retest the $2.42 level before breaking through $2.92. Should it surpass this threshold, targets of $3.43 and $5.85 could be in sight. DarkDefender had recently targeted $2.72, which the XRP price had successfully bounced back from, reaffirming the validity of his analysis. Related Reading: 400 Billion Shiba Inu Moved: Is A SHIB Price Crash Coming? Despite differing views on the potential extent of the surge, consensus among analysts is that the XRP price is likely to reach a new all-time high in the coming months. This optimism is further strengthened by the possibility of regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. The President-elect has promised a new regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States, which could pave the way for resolving the prolonged legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which previously stifled the XRP price, leading to a lengthy period of consolidation.

Although the SEC’s operations may be affected, the agency will prioritize its main mission of overseeing market activities and protecting investors, especially during uncertain times.

Truly, Jeremy pic.twitter.com/FDcSK2ejag — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) December 19, 2024 What Happens Next if The SEC is Shutdown? If the government shuts down, the SEC will have limited activities because federal agencies can’t operate without funding, except for a few things like protecting property. Companies trying to raise money or handle securities transactions should know that the SEC’s Corporation Finance staff won’t be available to approve registration statements, offering statements, or process those filings. The SEC won’t process filings that need review, like registration statements or tender offers. Companies won’t get feedback on their filings, and delays will happen once the shutdown ends. The SEC won’t answer questions or handle requests for exemptions or no-action letters. Gary Gensler previously announced he would retire from the SEC on January 20.

Cochran, a longstanding critic of Ripple, has reevaluated his stance, calling RLUSD Ripple’s most significant move in years. His analysis, shared through a video accompanying his tweet, outlines the unique RLUSD potential to revolutionize DeFi, Forex markets, and institutional banking. Why $RLUSD is @Ripple 's Trojan Horse for DeFi and Banking: I've been hard on XRP over the years, and almost missed why their new stablecoin would be useful, but after a deeper dive, I changed my mind and think it's probably their strongest move in years. pic.twitter.com/KW6TKqtcoD — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) December 17, 2024 RLUSD: Not Just Another Stablecoin Unlike conventional stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, RLUSD is fully regulated, bank-backed, and custodied by U.S. financial institutions. It adheres to strict compliance measures, including oversight from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple has also secured critical regulatory approvals, such as the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license, and aims to ensure RLUSD’s compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. This level of compliance distinguishes RLUSD from many existing stablecoins, aligning it with institutional needs and making it a robust tool for enterprises, banks, and financial entities. Additionally, RLUSD will be issued on Ripple’s native blockchain and Ethereum, bridging traditional financial institutions with decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Unlocking the Ripple Ecosystem Ripple has faced challenges in expanding the utility of its XRP Ledger (XRPL). While it introduced features such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and token issuance formats, adoption has been limited. RLUSD addresses a key gap: the inability to price assets in U.S. dollars within Ripple’s ecosystem. With RLUSD, institutional participants can now price Real-World Assets (RWAs), Forex trades, and other financial instruments directly in USD, enhancing the appeal of Ripple’s native AMM functionalities. Moreover, RLUSD opens pathways for Ripple to incentivize XRP liquidity through USD-XRP trading pairs. By bringing liquidity on-chain, Ripple can capture yield opportunities currently benefiting centralized exchanges. This strategic shift could bolster XRP’s ecosystem by redistributing value to the network and its participants. A Trojan Horse for Institutional Markets Cochran emphasizes that RLUSD’s greatest potential lies in its appeal to institutional markets, particularly Forex settlement and debt issuance. The Forex market handles trillions of dollars in daily transactions, often through outdated and fragmented banking systems. Ripple’s ability to offer a compliant, yield-bearing, USD-backed stablecoin could streamline these processes and position Ripple as a leading alternative settlement network. RLUSD’s integration with programmability upgrades—such as Hooks and a forthcoming Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain—further solidifies its utility. These enhancements will enable DeFi applications, creating opportunities for more sophisticated financial products on Ripple’s blockchain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Stablecoin Market Opportunity Cochran also highlights the growing stablecoin market, currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). With over $140 billion in circulation, stablecoins generate substantial yields for their issuers. RLUSD’s entry into this market, particularly in the EU where Tether lacks regulatory approval, could position Ripple as a major player. If Ripple captures a significant share of this market, it stands to generate billions in annual yield revenue, which could be reinvested into its ecosystem. A Path Forward for Ripple RLUSD represents a pivotal step in Ripple’s long-term vision of bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. By addressing regulatory concerns, enhancing ecosystem programmability, and tapping into institutional markets, Ripple strategically positions itself to capture value across multiple financial sectors. Cochran concludes that while Ripple’s early ambitions of competing with SWIFT remain challenging, RLUSD’s potential to unlock trillions in value from Forex settlement, debt instruments, and RWAs could make previously speculative price predictions for XRP more realistic.

This latest purchase has pushed the company’s total reserves to over 10,096 BTC, valued at more than $1 billion at current market prices. Hut 8 Bitcoin Reserves Top $1 Billion The Miami-headquartered cryptocurrency mining firm continues to increase its Bitcoin reserves, undeterred by BTC’s recent price surges. In its latest announcement, Hut 8 revealed the purchase of approximately 990 BTC for $100 million, at an average price of $101,710 per Bitcoin. Related Reading: Metaplanet To Expand Bitcoin Holdings With $11.3 Million Bond Sale This acquisition has propelled Hut 8’s total BTC holdings to over $1 billion, with the coins acquired at an average cost of $24,485 per Bitcoin. The move reflects the company’s strategy of combining low-cost BTC production with what it views as strategic market buys to maximize returns and strengthen its reserve assets. Notably, Hut 8’s recent purchase positions it among the top 10 largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. MicroStrategy remains the leader on this list, holding more than 250,000 BTC on its balance sheet. Commenting, Asher Genoot, CEO, Hut 8, said: We believe deeply in our operating business and that building a strategic Bitcoin reserve will fortify our financial position as we pursue large-scale growth initiatives across power and digital infrastructure. Additionally, as we scale operations and extend our cost advantage in Bitcoin production, we anticipate that the flywheel effect will enable us to grow our holdings organically at a significant discount to market prices, strengthening the yield of our reserve strategy. Echoing these sentiments, Hut 8 CFO, Sean Glennan explained that making BTC a reserve asset was a key component of the company’s strategy to deliver “superior returns” to shareholders through strategic treasury management. He added that the company is open to deploying its BTC reserve to support business objectives, such as upgrading its mining fleet. Earlier this month, Hut 8 unveiled a massive $750 million initiative aimed at general corporate objectives, debt repayment, and bolstering its Bitcoin reserve. On a year-to-date basis, Hut 8’s stock has surged by over 102%, trading at $27.11 at the time of writing. 4 Mining Firms Among Top 10 Corporate BTC Holders While companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block, and Coinbase are well-known among the top corporate Bitcoin holders, four Bitcoin mining firms also feature on this prestigious list, namely, Marathon Digital Holdings, Hut 8, Riot Blockchain, and CleanSpark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Grows As Rumble Unveils $20 Million BTC Treasury Strategy Last year, Riot Blockchain reported a significant increase in its BTC holdings. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin mining firm holds a total of 8,490 BTC. Similarly, earlier this month, Marathon Digital Holdings purchased another 703 BTC to increase its total reserves to 34,794 BTC. This move aligns with Marathon CEO’s previous statement that institutions are “waiting to buy up” Bitcoin. In October, CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford predicted that BTC may peak around $200,000 in the next 18 months. At press time, BTC trades at $100,543, down 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

This statement shocked many, given the stark price differences between XRP ($2.51) and BTC ($104,085). How could XRP be better than BTC? According to Vitalik, XRP’s technological advantages, such as faster transaction speeds and lower fees, make it better than BTC. He claims these features make XRP better suited for real-world applications than BTC. Amid this heated discussion on Vitalik Buterin’s comments, a Ripple rival, RCO Finance (RCOF), is making waves with its innovative features and real-world utility. Analysts project this cutting-edge project could surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025, making it a top pick for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Why Vitalik Buterin Says XRP Is Better Than Bitcoin Vitalik Buterin’s avid endorsement of Ripple’s native token, XRP, highlights its undervalued utility, making it a more innovative altcoin than Bitcoin. Here are some of the advantages XRP has over BTC. Ripple’s XRP offers faster transaction speed at lower fees. While Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) model is secure, it is notoriously slow and expensive. However, Ripple’s XRP offers near-instant transactions at low fees, making it more efficient, especially for everyday use. This utility has led to XRP’s integration into global financial networks, especially for cross-border payments. According to Vitalik Buterin, this has made it a key player in traditional institutions’ growing adoption of blockchain technology. This extends its value past speculative trading, offering more tangible value in the financial sector. Bitcoin’s energy-intensive PoW mining process is a cause of concern because of its environmental impact. This greatly limits its scalability, causing investors and developers alike to look for more energy-efficient options like XRP, which aligns with Vitalik Buterin’s outlook that the former is better than BTC. RCO Finance: The Ripple Rival Ready for a 12,050% Surge Similar to XRP, RCO Finance’s unique value proposition makes it a better investment. Backed by its innovative AI technology and real-world utility, RCOF is steadily making a name for itself and showing why it’s poised to surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025. At its core, RCO Finance leverages advanced AI tools to empower users with data-driven insights and personalized investment strategies.

This versatility streamlines the investing process, making it easier for users to level up and diversify their portfolios. RCOF’s blockchain infrastructure is designed to be compatible with multiple chains, enhancing flexibility and accessibility. This interoperability positions it as a versatile asset in the evolving crypto landscape.

This shows that RCOF adheres to industry standards, reassuring users that their assets and data are safe. Secure Your Place Before RCOF Takes Off Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement of utility-driven projects like XRP highlights the market’s shift toward practical applications and innovation.

XRP has been trading within a range of approximately $2.20 to $2.70 over the past few days, showing limited movement on the larger time frames. The altcoin has recently experienced a slight pullback, which has led to the invalidation of a previous bullish breakout pattern. While the price has not changed significantly, it remains within a potential bull market structure. The strong resistance level is around $2.90 to $3, where selling pressure has consistently been observed. On the lower end, there is support near $2, which has been tested multiple times and serves as the lower boundary of XRP’s current trading range. If the price breaks below $2, it may hint further downside. Understanding The Support and Resistance Levels The breakout had been confirmed at around $2.35, but the price closed below this level, invalidating the pattern and suggesting that further upside momentum is unlikely in the near term. The immediate support level in the short term is around $2.30 to $2.31, which is currently holding, but if it breaks, the next support lies around $2.23, with further downside possible towards the $2 level. It will also most likely drop to $1.90. After reaching $1.90, the key question is whether XRP can hold that level. If it breaks $1.90, the market will enter a bear phase, and the bullish trend will be over. However, that hasn’t happened yet, so it’s too early to make any conclusions. However, if XRP holds $2.30, it could rise to $2.60. If it breaks above $2.60, we can consider $3 as the next target.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 04:07:45

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 04:24:00

Network fees for DOGE spiked 330% year-over-year in November but have declined for nearly five weeks, indicating reduced usage. Daily active addresses hit over 1 million in mid-November but have since returned to normal levels, showing a drop in activity. Despite declines in fees and active addresses, DOGE's price remains near recent highs, suggesting a disconnect between usage and price. In the two months since I last covered Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) for Seeking Alpha, crypto's oldest 'memecoin' has enjoyed quite the rocket ship ride. Data by YCharts After ripping higher by over 240% in a matter of just a few weeks, I suspect the gains have been had in DOGE. In this update, we'll revisit some of the metrics and indicators I shared in my previous article, look at the technical setup for DOGE, and assess the broader 'memecoin' segment of the market. Revisiting Network Metrics When I wrote This Dog Wants To Run in late-October, there were several very specific on-chain metrics that I felt offered a favorable short-term setup to DOGE bulls. There is no question that we've seen network fees take off for DOGE in the last two months: Dogecoin (Token Terminal) Fees surpassed $552k in November. Which was about a 330% year-over-year gain over November 2023. To be clear, while this is a significant surge for Dogecoin, it's far less than what larger chains like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) typically do for monthly fees. More importantly, following the initial spike in fees in November, the trend in daily fees has been down for close to five weeks. This is indicative of declining usage. Recall what my leading indicator was for the expected rally in DOGE back in October: What I find interesting about this chart is over the last 5 years we've generally seen starts and peaks in active addresses lead price. In early 2021 active address growth lead coin price between March and May. It happened again between November 2023 and March 2024. The same appears to be happening again with Dogecoin active addresses grinding higher by about 20% starting at the beginning of September. To say that daily active addresses exploded following that article would be an understatement: Dogecoin (CoinMetrics) In mid-November, there was a five-day period when the chain had over 1 million DAAs each day. That has never happened on Dogecoin before. The problem is, activity has since fallen right back to normal levels, and yet price remains elevated. The big difference between this active address spike and the one that preceded it in the Spring is DAAs didn't lead price, price led usage. My general view is that it's more indicative of fundamental weakness than strength. But to recap, we now have declines in fees, declines in active addresses, and prices still holding closer to recent highs despite the drops in chain usage. I suspect the price will follow everything else lower. Technicals In October, I shared my technical thoughts on the DOGE price and shared what, I felt, was a clear breakout in a downward diagonal resistance trend line. I see a different signal in the chart now: DOGE (TrendSpider) This is a very different setup following what has been a magnificent rally since the end of October. But traders/investors should not overlook some of the warning signs on this chart. First, DOGE has now re-entered what is essentially a massive air-pocket between 20 cents and 36 cents. There was very little actual price discovery on the way up, and I suspect the same will be true on the way down. But that's admittedly just a guess. The bigger issues are the massive bearish divergences between November 13th and December 9th. The 200-day moving average - currently sitting at 17 cents, shows substantial downside risk if the coin were simply to revisit previous levels. Finally, DOGE isn't even technically oversold yet at a 14-day RSI of 32. This could grind much lower before any 'dead cat' bounce. DOGE/BTC Weekly (TrendSpider) It wasn't just the DOGE/USD chart where we had breakouts back in October. The DOGE/BTC chart also looked quite bullish for Dogecoin when I wrote my last DOGE piece. That too looks exhausted after the sizable move higher. In October, I felt 253 sats per DOGE was a fitting price target. DOGE smashed through that level and went all the way to 492 sats before falling back below 400. At minimum, I believe the market will take DOGE back to 250 sats though I certainly wouldn't rule out another 'overshoot' of that target to the downside since we had one to the upside. Memes and DOGE For me, one of the biggest reasons why DOGE has very limited upside from here (if any) is because there is now too much competition for liquidity in the memecoin segment. With the proliferation of memecoins in the cryptocurrency market, eight of the top hundred cryptocurrencies by market cap are memecoins - and five of those eight memecoins are dog-related. Memecoins (CoinMarketCap) Memecoins actually account for $91.5 billion of the $3.3 trillion total cryptocurrency market cap. Memecoins have been so popular, in part, due to platforms like pump.fun, that Artemis tracks memecoins as an industry segment in its benchmark index: YTD Crypto Benchmark Index (Artemis) At one point in December, the memecoin segment was up almost 400% year to date. Now at just 200% year to date, memecoins have given back almost half their 2024 gains in just a couple of weeks, and yet they're still leading the industry as a category in terms of year to date gains. There is a significant amount of 'extrinsic value' that is potentially going to get unwound in this market, and DOGE will not be immune from that. Closing Thoughts As has occasionally been the case through the existence of the coin, DOGE was a terrific trade back in October. However, the setup is very different now. The fundamental story has deteriorated, with fees and active addresses in clear decline since the November pops. The technical story looks rough in my estimation, judging by the bearish divergences on the DOGE/USD daily chart and the potential weakness against BTC that can be expected on the DOGE/BTC weekly chart. But the bottom line in my view is the harder they come, the harder they fall. Memecoins have owned the year as a segment, judging by percentage appreciation. I suspect 2025 is going to be very different than 2024. If you made bank on this DOGE run, I'd take the win.",DOGE-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-20 04:26:00

The agreement, which needs the approval of the IMF Executive Board, aims to support El Salvador’s reform agenda, boost fiscal and external sustainability, and create conditions for stronger, inclusive growth. IMF Loan Agreement with El Salvador According to the official press release , the program is expected to catalyze additional financial support from the World Bank and regional development banks, bringing the total financing package to over $3.5 billion during the program period. As part of El Salvador’s $1.4 billion deal with the IMF, the government has agreed to scale back its ambitious Bitcoin policies to address financial stability concerns. Legal reforms will make Bitcoin usage optional for private businesses, removing the mandate that had been in place since the cryptocurrency was adopted as legal tender in 2021. Meanwhile, for the public sector, Bitcoin-related activities will be strictly limited, with the government no longer accepting BTC for tax payments. Additionally, the state-run Chivo wallet, which facilitated Bitcoin transactions for citizens, will see its government involvement gradually phased out. These measures are intended to mitigate risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility and safeguard financial integrity, as per IMF’s statement. The program also includes improved transparency, regulation, and oversight of digital assets to protect consumers and investors while maintaining financial stability. By taking a step back from its cryptocurrency experiment, the Salvadoran government aims to rebuild confidence in its broader fiscal policies and align with IMF recommendations, a move expected to attract further international financial support and stabilize the economy. “IMF staff thank the Salvadorean authorities for the excellent collaboration and candid dialogue over the past months in the development of their economic reform program aimed at continuing to improve the prosperity of El Salvador and all of its people.” Criticisms President Nayib Bukele has staunchly advocated for Bitcoin as a key part of his administration’s economic strategy, investing heavily in the cryptocurrency to promote financial autonomy. Despite Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000, yielding a whopping 123.67% return on the government’s $269.7 million investment, the IMF’s conditions have compelled El Salvador to alter its BTC strategy. Critics argued that Bukele has now surrendered to the demands of global financial powers. As one financial analyst noted , Bukele’s decision to take a $3.5 billion loan from the IMF has led to accusations of selling out, calling it an ironic shift for someone who once criticized fiat currency.

Meme coins are having a subpar performance and their upside has likely reached a peak after strong November gains. Both Dogecoin and Dogwifhat are down on a weekly and daily basis at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the Rollblock (RBLK) presale continues to gather momentum, with $7.3 million raised so far. The pioneering GambleFi protocol aspires to disrupt a $450 billion industry with a decentralized solution to return profits to players and investors instead of centralized insiders. Whales Fear Missing Out On Rollblock One reason large investors are moving away from meme tokens to presales like Rollblock is the market use case. Rollblock has a clear market proposition tackling centralized gambling, which retains all of the profits. It offers over 7,000 gaming opportunities for players and recently added a lucrative sports betting feature. All of this is supported by Rollblock’s revenue share model. Every week, Rollblock will use 30% of revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the market. 60% of the purchased tokens are burned to promote price appreciation. The remaining 40% are used in the form of staking rewards. Token holders can earn up to 30% APY via staking alone. The redistribution of earnings is a huge incentive to players, who will also benefit from instant crypto deposits. Rollblock is 100% licensed and verified and uses blockchain technology to make transactions irrefutable. The presale offers a limited-time 20% token bonus and the coin already retails at a discount. Currently priced at $0.0415, the RBLK token will appreciate to $0.047 in the next round. In total, analysts predict a 720% increase from the start to the end of the presale, with early investors already seeing huge returns. Dogecoin Disappoints Token Holders News about Elon Musk’s appointment as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initially helped to increase the price of Dogecoin. Selling for $0.10 in early November, Dogecoin shot to $0.42 in mid-December, a 4x increase. But it is unlikely to rise much further and is down 3% over the past week. Such a large November rally will be hard to sustain without a retracement, and Dogecoin currently trades at $0.39, about 60% of its ATH. Moving forward, DOGE’s upside potential remains limited compared to other coins. Nonetheless, there are some positive indicators. Meme coins are known to lag a little when it comes to Bitcoin-led rallies. Moreover, 5.8 million Dogecoin have been recently reactivated, which could have a positive price impact. Dogwifhat Drops 14% In 7 Days Down 14% last week and 8% in 24 hours, Dogwifhat is faring even more poorly than Dogecoin. Dogwifhat does not have Elon Musk’s support or the first-mover effect of Dogecoin. This Dogwifhat price decline occurred despite positive news for the ecosystem, including WIF/USDT trading on the Binance US exchange on December 11th. In other bearish news for Dowwifhat, a whale offloaded $3.4 million worth of tokens to Coinbase last week. Acquired nearly a year before, the whale recorded an impressive 9x profit, purchasing the tokens for only $390,000. With the current retracement in the altcoin market, it seems to have been a timely move. Rollblock Going Viral As Top Altcoin Alternative With volatility in the crypto markets, whales are choosing to migrate to presales that offer both early bird pricing and better price potential. Analysts predict Rollblock to 100x or more after the presale completes in early 2025 and neither Dogwifhat nor Dogecoin can offer comparable returns.

Offering ROIs much above its rivals, the revolutionary decentralized exchange Lunex Network (LNEX) is generating great investment interest thanks to its unmatched security, privacy, and cross-chain capabilities. Could this under-the-radar token outperform top crypto coins like BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL) as analysts estimate exponential increases for LNEX in this bull cycle? Read on to find out why experts think Lunex Network might be the most rewarding investment choice this cycle. Lunex Network (LNEX) Offers Secure and Anonymous Trading Providing a rare mix of security, anonymity, and cross-chain efficiency, Lunex Network distinguishes itself in the competitive decentralized exchange (DEX) sector. Lunex Network guarantees top-tier security by means of a comprehensive audit by SOLIDProof , therefore ensuring that its smart contracts are free from major flaws. Maintaining some of the lowest transaction fees in the industry, Lunex Network lets users immediately trade over 50,000 coins across more than 40 blockchains. Lunex Network also gives Web3 developers access to 65+ RPC nodes, therefore providing a flexible toolkit for growth inside the ecosystem. Lunex Network provides a safe, anonymous platform that safeguards user data while enabling flawless crypto transactions for privacy-conscious traders wishing to evade invasive KYC processes. For investors, Lunex Network offers a promising prospect given that LNEX is priced at just $0.0046 in the presale. Meanwhile, those who bought LNEX at $0.0012 have already achieved a 283% ROI and analysts project an additional 300% surge before the presale ends. BNB (BNB) Displays Strong Bullish Momentum Over the past week, the BNB price has barely increased by 2% . The BNB price is currently ranging between $738 and $696. Driven by BNB’s (BNB) outstanding performance over the previous month, the community is overwhelmingly optimistic. The altcoin soared by more than 15% during this period, according to the BNB price chart, and on December 4 it reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $793. Although BNB (BNB) has already dropped by 10% from this height, experts see this as a reasonable pullback with hopes for a rally to reach $800 before the year ends. Strong technical indicators like the MACD, Awesome Oscillator, and Moving Averages—all of which point to ongoing purchasing pressure on the BNB price chart—help to support the positive outlook for the altcoin. Additionally, analysts are forecasting BNB (BNB) to reach the much-expected $1,000 milestone in this cycle. Solana (SOL) Bulls Set Eyes on a $300 Breakout Since it declined over 5% in the past week and more than 10% over the past month, the Solana price has lately shown negative days. The Solana price has been fluctuating between $235 and $210 among these falls. Holders are worried about this bearish behavior, but some hope was rebuilt following the bullish rejection on the Solana price chart at the $205 support level. Meanwhile, several analysts expect a retest of Solana’s all-time high (ATH) before the year ends. Strong technical signals support the argument for a possible comeback. The MACD and Moving Averages both provide a purchasing signal on the Solana price chart, suggesting that the altcoin may soon rally once more. The prospect of a breakout to the $300 level before the year ends excites investors especially as Solana (SOL) starts to show indications of rebuilding bullish momentum. One of the bullish patterns observed is how Solana (SOL) has seen multiple rejections around the $220 to $204 support zone. Lunex Network Set To Outshine BNB and Solana While Solana (SOL) eyes a $300 breakthrough and BNB (BNB) aims for new highs, Lunex Network (LNEX) is quietly transforming decentralized trading—and early investors are benefiting. Lunex Network is redefining the DeFi space with its unsurpassed security, anonymity, and cross-chain adaptability. Unlike BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL), LNEX promises early exponential gains as analysts estimate a startling 1,800% increase in the next few months when the token launches on several Tier-1 exchanges.

37868137,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630828,1734670231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37868137.jpeg,Blockstream’s Adam Back defends BlackRock ad that questioned Bitcoin’s 21M cap,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/adam-back-defends-blackrock-ad/,"Blockstream CEO and Hashcash inventor Adam Back has come to the defense of BlackRock after the company’s recent Bitcoin ad triggered an outrage across the crypto community. It featured a small but explosive disclaimer: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” For Bitcoiners, the Bitcoin ad was a shot at the heart of what the asset stands for. Back, though, has downplayed the controversy. He explained that the disclaimer was a legal protection inserted by BlackRock’s lawyers, not a statement of intent. “Obviously, their lawyers made them write that as they sell investment products and don’t have control,” Back said. But for a community allergic to corporate meddling, his words did little to extinguish the fire. Bitcoiners can’t trust BlackRock There have already been concerns of forceful centralization by what is largely believed to be the most powerful company on the planet. X users speculated that BlackRock might be preparing to influence the Bitcoin protocol. One even called the ad “very spooky.” The ad’s timing only added to the suspicion. BlackRock manages over 524,000 Bitcoin worth $53 billion through its exchange-traded fund (ETF), making it the largest institutional player in the market. For Bitcoin’s true believers, such concentrated influence is unnerving. Critics outside the Bitcoin bubble joined in. Longtime Bitcoin antagonist Peter Schiff wasted no time tearing into the ad, calling it packed with falsehoods and labeling Wall Street’s embrace of Bitcoin as disingenuous. And though his words may not carry weight with Bitcoiners, they amplified the outrage surrounding the ad. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is the bedrock of its value proposition. It’s what sets it apart from inflation-prone fiat currencies. The cap is hard-coded into Bitcoin’s design, making it impossible to change without consensus. Even so, the mere suggestion of altering it has always been a taboo topic. Old battles with new players The ad is dragging people back to the Blocksize War, that hostile beef in the Bitcoin community from 2015 to 2017. The whole argument was about whether Bitcoin’s block size should be increased to make transactions faster and cheaper. On one side were the “big blockers,” who pushed for larger block sizes to scale Bitcoin as a payment system. On the other were the “small blockers,” who argued that increasing the block size would centralize the network by making it harder for individuals to run nodes. The conflict reached a boiling point with the New York Agreement in 2017 proposal, which wanted to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) while also doubling the block size. Some folks saw it as an attempt by corporations to hijack Bitcoin, and a grassroots movement known as the User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) forced SegWit activation without miner approval. The fallout though led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork that adopted larger block sizes. Its effects are still felt to this day.

It also added that the collaboration aims to improve the efficiency of governmental transactions while promoting fiscal responsibility. This alliance represents an important step toward leveraging the potential of digital currencies to foster sustainable economic growth, stability, and financial inclusion, noted Ramaswamy.

Bitcoin shot up strongly after Donald Trump’s election victory, leading to a price above $100,000. According to the report by Financial Times, the data from Hedge Fund Research shows that hedge funds that used crypto strategies shared a gain of 46% in November, bringing total yearly gains for the niche to 76%. Compared to the rest of the hedge fund industry, these returns were very strong in what would otherwise be a 10% average win. Crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital was among the big winners The rally accelerated since Trump’s election win in November and boosted the value of the largest digital asset, Bitcoin. Brevan Howard and Galaxy Digital were among the big winners. The surge also pushed up the value of smaller digital tokens. This year, bitcoin has surged 130% to around $100,000, driving the total market value for major cryptocurrencies to rise by $1.8 trillion to $3.5 trillion. But this week, the market declined slightly as the Federal Reserve signaled it would boost interest rates less than anticipated next year, which pummels high-risk assets.

He suggests that this anticipated surge could make XRP holders some of the wealthiest investors in the market. In recent months, XRP has gained significant attention due to its impressive price movements. Notably, the cryptocurrency rose from $0.51 at the start of November to $2.90 by December 3, representing a staggering 464% increase within a single month. While XRP faced a pullback after this peak, consolidating between $2 and $2.60 for two weeks, Steph maintains that an even larger rally may be on the horizon. Bollinger Bands Indicate Potential Breakout Steph’s analysis emphasizes the importance of key technical indicators, including the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour chart. These bands, which measure market volatility, are currently widening—a signal often associated with significant price movements. He noted that in November, a similar expansion of the Bollinger Bands preceded a 132% surge in XRP’s price. Additionally, past instances of this pattern have led to rallies of 53% and 120%. Based on the current expansion, Steph believes that XRP is primed for another breakout, which could further validate its bullish trajectory. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE THE RICHEST PEOPLE YOU KNOW – HERE’S WHY! pic.twitter.com/k0tc6tCAq0 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2024 Bull Flag Breakout Fuels Optimism Another bullish indicator highlighted by Steph is XRP’s breakout from a bull flag pattern on the daily chart. Such breakouts are typically seen as a continuation of upward price trends after a consolidation phase. The breakout has been confirmed by multiple daily closes above a critical long-term resistance level. As of now, XRP has maintained a position above the crucial support level of $2.33, as it currently trades at $2.35. Steph cautioned that failing to hold above this level could challenge the bullish narrative. However, if XRP sustains its position, the market outlook remains favorable. The analyst also identified $2.60 as a significant resistance level. A daily close above this threshold would further solidify the bullish case for XRP. He has set a short-to-medium-term target of $4.90 to $5 , supported by the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) ribbons on the daily chart. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Declining Bitcoin Dominance Boosts Altcoin Market Steph also addressed the role of Bitcoin dominance, a metric that tracks Bitcoin’s market share relative to other cryptocurrencies. He observed that Bitcoin dominance has been declining after breaking below a rising wedge pattern, currently testing the breakdown level near 57%. This trend is considered favorable for altcoins like XRP. Should Bitcoin dominance continue to decline, potentially reaching the 47–50% range, it could signal the start of an altcoin season. Historically, this range has acted as strong support during July 2021 and October 2021. Such conditions could create an environment conducive to XRP achieving its $5 price target. Steph advised investors to monitor Bitcoin dominance as it approaches the 47–50% zone. A reversal from this level could mark a turning point in the market, prompting investors to consider taking profits. Nevertheless, he emphasized that XRP and other altcoins currently exhibit strong potential for growth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A recent Chainalysis report revealed a dramatic rise in crypto thefts tied to North Korean hackers, who doubled their stolen assets in 2024 to over $1.3 billion. In parallel, Chainalysis has announced its acquisition of Hexagate, a Web3 security firm, signaling a proactive shift toward preventing such exploits. North Korean Hackers Double Crypto Theft in 2024, Chainalysis Reports In a chilling revelation, analytics firm Chainalysis has disclosed that hackers tied to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) have doubled their crypto theft in 2024 compared to the previous year. The report, released on Dec. 19, outlines how North Korean cybercriminals stole over $1.3 billion worth of digital assets across 47 incidents in 2024, accounting for a staggering 61% of all crypto thefts reported globally. The findings indicate a significant escalation in the scale and frequency of DPRK-linked cyberattacks. This marks a stark contrast to 2023, during which hackers tied to the isolated nation stole approximately $660 million in cryptocurrency. Chainalysis highlighted a worrying trend: not only are DPRK's crypto attacks becoming more frequent, but the hackers are also successfully pulling off larger exploits. The report noted that in 2024, attacks involving sums between $50 million and $100 million—and even those exceeding $100 million—occurred more often than in the prior year. This pattern diverges sharply from the two preceding years, when most of the DPRK’s exploits yielded profits below $50 million. “It appears that the DPRK’s crypto attacks are becoming more frequent,” Chainalysis reported. “Notably, attacks between $50 and $100 million, and those above $100 million occurred far more frequently in 2024 than they did in 2023, suggesting that the DPRK is getting better and faster at massive exploits.” Despite North Korea’s increasing activity, the overall global crypto theft landscape showed mixed signals. Chainalysis reported that hackers globally had stolen approximately $2.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2024, marking a 21% increase compared to 2023. However, this figure is still far below the record-setting $3.7 billion in crypto stolen in 2022. The first quarter of 2024 saw decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms as the primary target for hackers. However, the second and third quarters revealed a shift, with centralized services bearing the brunt of cyberattacks. Some of the most notable incidents in 2024 include: WazirX Hack (July): Hackers compromised one of the India-based exchange’s Safe multisig wallets on Ethereum, resulting in losses of $235 million—the largest single hack of the year. BingX Hack (September): Cybercriminals targeted this crypto exchange and made away with roughly $44 million worth of tokens. North Korea’s Political Ties and Reduced Activity in H2 2024 The Chainalysis report also touched on an intriguing observation: a marked decline in DPRK-linked hacking activity in the second half of 2024. According to the analytics firm, the drop in stolen funds after July 1 was “conspicuous,” coinciding with deepening political and military ties between North Korea and Russia. However, Chainalysis cautioned against drawing direct links to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Pyongyang earlier in the year. “The decline in funds stolen by the DPRK after July 1, 2024 is clear and the timing is conspicuous,” the report stated. “But it is nevertheless important to note that this decline is not necessarily associated with Putin’s visit to Pyongyang.” Chainalysis also noted that the year-end holidays could potentially see a resurgence of attacks, as hackers often exploit the season’s operational vulnerabilities. North Korean hackers have become notorious for orchestrating some of the most significant breaches in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Their activities have not only led to massive financial losses but also drawn heightened scrutiny from US authorities. The latter frequently impose sanctions on entities linked to DPRK’s money laundering efforts, which often involve laundering stolen crypto through complex networks of mixers and intermediaries. In recent years, these cyber exploits have served as a vital financial lifeline for North Korea, funding its nuclear weapons program and bypassing stringent international sanctions. The uptick in large-scale attacks in 2024 shines the spotlight on the evolving threat posed by DPRK hackers, even as the global crypto ecosystem attempts to bolster its defenses. While North Korea’s hackers had a “very active year,” Chainalysis reported that global hacking activity in the third and fourth quarters of 2024 declined compared to the same period in 2023. This trend offers a glimmer of hope, suggesting that improved security measures and international cooperation may be starting to curb some forms of cybercrime. Nevertheless, the ongoing evolution of North Korea’s cyber capabilities is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in the digital asset space. As hackers grow more adept at breaching even the most secure platforms, the industry faces an urgent need for continuous innovation in cybersecurity. The alarming scale of North Korea’s crypto exploits in 2024 serves as a wake-up call for the cryptocurrency industry, governments, and cybersecurity firms. With 2022 still holding the dubious distinction of being the worst year for crypto hacks, the path forward must involve collaboration across all stakeholders to minimize risks and protect the burgeoning digital economy. The report’s findings also raise questions about the geopolitical dimensions of crypto crime, particularly as nation-states leverage cybercrime as a strategic tool. As 2025 approaches, the global crypto community will undoubtedly keep a close eye on the DPRK’s next moves—and the broader implications for digital asset security. Chainalysis Acquires Web3 Security Firm Hexagate to Strengthen Blockchain Security In a related development, Chainalysis has announced its acquisition of Hexagate, a Web3 security firm specializing in threat detection and mitigation. The acquisition, revealed on Dec. 19, marks a significant step forward for Chainalysis as it pivots from its traditional focus on investigations into proactive prevention within the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Founded in 2022 and headquartered in Israel, Hexagate has quickly gained recognition for its advanced Web3 security solutions. The company’s offerings include real-time threat detection and tools to safeguard digital assets, which have reportedly prevented over $1 billion in potential losses for its clients. These clients include prominent names such as Coinbase and Consensys. Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin announced the acquisition on X, signaling a bold new chapter for the company. Levin stated: “We have spent 10 years following the money. Now it’s time to prevent the money from being stolen. Welcome to the era of secure smart contracts with proper monitoring and real-time threat detection. Announcing our acquisition of Hexagate.” In a blog post accompanying the announcement, Levin emphasized Chainalysis’s evolving mission to transition from being a leader in blockchain investigations to a trailblazer in preventative security measures. He noted that expanding into Web3 security is a natural progression for the company as it seeks to protect the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem from increasingly sophisticated threats. While the announcement shows the strategic importance of Hexagate to Chainalysis’s future endeavors, many details remain undisclosed. The purchase price for Hexagate has not been revealed, and it remains unclear whether the acquisition will lead to significant changes in Hexagate’s leadership or operational structure. Chainalysis’s Shift to Prevention The acquisition of Hexagate signals a broader strategic shift for Chainalysis. Since its founding, the company has been renowned for its blockchain analytics capabilities, assisting law enforcement and regulatory agencies in tracing illicit crypto transactions. Now, it aims to tackle issues at the root by preventing theft and fraud before they occur. Levin’s leadership appears to be a driving force behind this pivot. Having taken over as CEO in October 2024 following the departure of Michael Gronager, Levin has been vocal about the company’s aspirations to expand its services and respond to the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology. Hexagate’s expertise in protecting smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms is expected to complement Chainalysis’s existing suite of blockchain analytics tools. By integrating Hexagate’s real-time monitoring and threat detection capabilities, Chainalysis aims to offer a more comprehensive solution to its clients, bridging the gap between investigation and prevention. Levin’s vision for Chainalysis’s future extends beyond technological advancements. The CEO has also speculated about potential regulatory changes under the incoming US administration. He suggested that greater clarity surrounding digital assets, including the repeal of rules like the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), could pave the way for a more secure and transparent blockchain industry.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-20 05:30:00

Experts Double Down on Rollblock",https://timestabloid.com/stellar-rallies-big-suis-turn-next-experts-double-down-on-rollblock/,"There is a great crypto rally going on, with Bitcoin peeking above $108k before retracting again, but the $110k Bitcoin is inevitable. This highly positive Bitcoin price is great for all cryptos, with the Stellar price living up to its name with a stellar 80% increase on a 30-day candle. Sui is not doing too badly either, and it calls for a deeper look. However, the star of this crypto rally seems to be Rollblock , a new online gambling platform that is raking in presale investment dollars . Rollblock (RBLK): Gambling investment now available to retail investors Globally, online gambling is huge, worth over $500 billion annually. But it’s not been an investment available to the moguls and millionaires of Monaco and Macau. Engaging with the profits made in gambling was not available to Joe Everyman – until now! Rollblock is a new Ethereum-based online casino currently holding a presale to enlarge its liquidity pool. The kicker: it is an income-bearing asset. Every week, Rollblock pays out a dividend to all its token holders. Everyone who has RBLK token gets a share of the takings. The best news is that this is not something in the future, ‘when we get there’. Rollblock ’s online casino dApp is alive and running, sporting thousands of games, both digital and live, across all genres. There’s something for everyone in Rollblock , and it’s no surprise the presale has recently exceeded $7.3 million . Stellar (XLM): Stellar price rides coattails of XRP on crypto rally Depending on how one looks at it, Stellar i s either a complementary product to XRP or a competitor. XRP is racing up the charts, the feel-good story of the year, but the Stellar price is not too far behind. A cynical look will say that Stellar is riding XRP’s coattails, as both tokens facilitate cross-border payments, and Stellar shares much of its coding with XRP. A kinder reading states that Stellar is gaining thanks to its intrinsic value proposition. But no matter how one slices it, the truth is plain to see: the Stellar price is up 350% on a 90-day candle and has overtaken Polkadot to occupy the #16 spot on the market cap rankings. Sui (SUI): Breakthrough blockchain to break out? Sui is still relatively new, only listed in May 2023, but it has made some fantastic climbs since August of this year. Sui went up four dollars from $0.60 to $4.60 in a mere three and a half months, delivering a 666% increase. Is Sui done, or is it just getting started? There’s more than enough room for Sui on the blockchain market. With Ethereum’s gas fees becoming a major challenge and Solana’s reliability problems constantly hobbling it, Sui is perfectly positioned to make a play for the dApp development platform of choice. There may be a ton of growth left in Sui . Conclusion The crypto rally has delivered a “ Stellar” price , and Sui is reaching for the stars. Crypto is changing the way the world works, and we’re in the early days. There has never been a better time to invest. Stellar, Sui, and Rollblock will all make great additions to a well-balanced crypto portfolio. Sui and Stellar are available on all good exchanges, but Rollblock is only available directly from their website at $0.0415. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

World Liberty Financial Links With Justin Sun In Major Token Swap According to blockchain data analytics firm Nansen, a digital wallet linked to President-elect’s World Liberty Financial swapped its entire holding of 103 cbBTC tokens for WBTC on a Wednesday operation. Wrapped Bitcoin serves as a bridge for Bitcoin (BTC) holders to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, enabling broader participation in the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts Major Altcoin Season As Market Cap Eyes Record Levels Although World Liberty has been marketed as a decentralized finance lending platform, it has yet to become operational as it is still in early stages of development and presales of its WLF token. Sun, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur known for his high-profile investments and attention-grabbing antics—including purchasing a banana duct-taped to a wall for $6.2 million—invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial in November, becoming an adviser to the project. His involvement appears to have pushed World Liberty past a financial threshold that could allow Trump to profit from the enterprise, potentially securing at least $15 million for the Trump family based on terms outlined in World Liberty’s “gold paper.” Trump’s Crypto Initiative Struggles The recent token swap follows World Liberty’s earlier cryptocurrency acquisitions, including significant investments in Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK). Additionally, Nansen’s data indicates that the project’s wallets received around $250,000 in ONDO, a token from Ondo Finance, which specializes in tokenization. The backdrop of these transactions is marked by controversy, particularly following a backlash triggered by a strategic partnership between Sun’s BiT Global and crypto custody firm BitGo, the operator of Wrapped Bitcoin. This partnership prompted US-based crypto exchange Coinbase to seek a delisting of WBTC from its exchange due to concerns over Sun’s potential influence and control. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surge To $200,000 By Mid-2025 Amid ‘Mild’ Price Pullbacks: Report Earlier this month, BiT Global filed a lawsuit against Coinbase in response to the delisting, but a federal judge in California ruled in favor of Coinbase, denying BiT Global’s request for a temporary restraining order. Despite the promotional efforts by Trump and his sons, World Liberty Financial has faced challenges in the market, with sales reportedly falling 93% short of projections. This lack of traction raises questions about the project’s viability and its ability to fulfill its ambitious promises of transforming the financial landscape. At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has fallen to the $3.3 trillion mark, after hitting an all-time high of $3.73 trillion on Tuesday, which also pushed the price of Bitcoin to a new record above $108,000.

On Wednesday, the Fed cut the benchmark borrowing cost as expected but penciled in only two rate cuts for 2025, down from four projected in September. The central bank stressed that it's not interested in participating in a potential government plan to build a strategic BTC reserve. Since then, BTC has dropped over 8%, hitting lows near $96,000 at one point. As of writing, the cryptocurrency changed hands near $97,500, down nearly 10% from the record high of $108,266 reached early this week, CoinDesk data show. The losses have caused the 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) to dip below the 200-hour SMA, confirming a bearish crossover. The pattern suggests that the ongoing pullback could evolve into a deeper one, although it has failed to live up to its reputation during the recent bull run. Bitcoin has experienced a few pullbacks during its post-U.S. election rally from $70,000 to over $100,000, and each of these dips has ended with a bearish crossover of the 50- and 200-hour SMAs. The latest crossover, therefore, offers hope to bulls expecting a renewed move into six figures above $100,000. A potential bounce could face resistance near $10,600, a level identified by the descending trendline, representing the recent price drop. A violation there would open doors for record highs. It's important to remember that patterns don't always play out as expected, and the contrary indicator discussed above may fail, potentially leading to a deeper drop. The first sign of trouble will be if prices move below the overnight low of $96,000, which could expose the swing low of around $91,000 recorded on Dec. 5.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-20 05:36:57

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 05:53:00

According to a Bloomberg report, Gov. Eli Remolona said on Friday that the Philippine Central Bank was closely watching the peso drop and intervening in currency markets. Indonesia promised to defend the rupiah (IDR) to stabilize markets, while Brazil said it spent $14 billion last week to strengthen the real (BRL). Developing economies are facing mounting pressure. India’s rupee and Brazil’s real reached all-time lows, and South Korea’s won tumbled to a 15-year low. A weakening currency can worsen inflation and raise the cost of servicing debt for those nations that depend on foreign borrowing. Currency strategist Christopher Wong said fighting a strong dollar trend is tough, and “intervention in such an environment can only slow the pace of currency depreciation. Despite that, central banks may still have to use a mix of verbal and actual intervention tools”. Emerging-market FX has faced a sharp quarterly decline Source: Bloomberg Since late September, the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index has dropped 3.3%, its sharpest quarterly decline in two years. It has compounded the challenges with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stance matching a more cautious approach. This will lead to fewer interest-rate cuts next year and increased concerns about inflation. With a strong dollar, emerging market central banks are willing to take bold action to save their currencies from falling too far and stave off even wider economic damage. On Friday, South Korea said it will increase the limit banks can hold in forward contracts by 50% of its foreign currency reserves. The move is an effort to attract more money to enter the country to balance the currency market supply and demand. At the same time, China’s central bank intervened to prop up the yuan, setting its daily reference rate much higher than the market had been projecting.

GalaChain is the first hyperledger fabric chain to release this update and this strategic migration represents a critical step towards creating a more secure and decentralized blockchain environment. The transition is currently underway in the test environment, with plans to implement the changes on the mainnet in the near future. When completed, GalaChain will distinguish itself as one of the pioneering public Hyperledger Fabric blockchains to successfully implement this sophisticated consensus mechanism. Migrating From Raft to BFT Consensus At the heart of this upgrade is a drastic improvement in network resilience. Raft, a Crash Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm, falls short in scenarios involving malicious activity. It operates under the assumption that network nodes will behave predictably and without malicious intent. It can effectively manage non-malicious failures like system crashes or temporary downtime. However, this approach leaves significant vulnerabilities in a landscape increasingly threatened by sophisticated cyber attacks. For instance, a compromised leader node or a network partition could disrupt operations and lead to incorrect decisions. This highlights the need for a more superior and secured upgrade. The BFT Advantage Over Raft By contrast, BFT algorithm introduces a more sophisticated approach to network consensus. It is designed for hostile environments where some nodes may behave maliciously. BFT algorithms can withstand and neutralize potential malicious activities by requiring consensus from a substantial majority. Even if up to one-third of nodes act maliciously, it demands consensus from two-thirds of honest network nodes before finalizing any transaction. This means that even if some nodes attempt to send false messages or manipulate the consensus process, the network remains stable and secure. This critical feature significantly reduces the risk of single point of failure, fortifying the network against targeted attacks and improving fault tolerance. Building Trust and Reliability The implications of this upgrade extend beyond mere technical optimization. For users and developers in the Gala Games ecosystem, the BFT migration promises enhanced trust, improved transaction reliability, and a more robust blockchain infrastructure that can effectively resist potential security threats. As blockchain transitions with features that reduce risks and improves security, Gala Games’ proactive approach to network security demonstrates a commitment to the future of the ecosystem by creating trustworthy digital platforms.",Crypto News|Press Release|GalaChain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|GALA,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-12-20 05:56:35

However, it remains bullish but is still finding a key level to initiate a fresh buy. The price is currently under retracement. The late November drops continued to bring a notable setback for Sol’s bulls on a daily scale, though the $200 level has suppressed selling since the market witnessed a sudden meltdown over the past week. Following a short recovery, the $240 level posed a threat to the bulls and the price fell, though the volatility currently looks insignificant due to low supply. A big loss should be expected if the supply level increases. Looking at the choppy price actions over the past week, Sol appeared to be gathering liquidity for another major sell-off capable of retracing the price lower to the $190 and $180 area, where the buyers are patiently waiting to initiate an entry in the next few days. While the ongoing retracement phase provides a discount for a long-term reaccumulation, we can expect a huge rebound once the price tests the white ascending trendline, acting as diagonal support since September. A breakdown of this line could result in an end of the bullish move. But from a technical perspective, more growth is expected in the future. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As Sol advances retracement near a weekly support level of $210, the price must break below $200 before testing $194 and $183.4, where the trendline lies. From there, we can expect a bounce back. But if the price recovers from the current trading level, the immediate resistance level to watch on the way up is $247, followed by $264.4. A break up there could rocket the price to $280 and $300 in no time.

It appeared bearish daily and now sits above September’s high. The past month has been tough for Floki as it failed to advance bullishly above the $0.0003 level. An attempt to break above this key level earlier this month proved abortive and the crypto formed a double-top pattern. This bearish pattern led to a serious breakdown this week and the price plunged below the key $0.0002 level yesterday. Volatility increased today and it slipped to a low of $0.000177 for the first in three months. Rejecting this low, the price bounced back and now trades at $0.000188. A further bounce could bring a fast retest at the broken key level before deciding on where next to head. For now, the bears are gaining control. However, it is important to note that the latest breakdown is considered a retracement of last month’s impulsive movement. We can expect the bulls to step back in action if the current daily low holds as support. Otherwise, Floki may enter the $0.00015 range before bouncing back. Looking back, it has seen over $25% losses in the past month of trading. Floki’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview A drop below the holding $0.000177 support level could slide the price to a low of $0.0001483 this week. The lower price level to watch for support is $0.000125 – where it initiated a surge in volatility last month. The $0.00021 level is considered the closest resistance for a test. If Floki climbs above it, the $0.000283 resistance is the next level to watch for a break up to the $0.00035 resistance – printed in June. Key Resistance Levels: $0.00021, $0.000283, $0.00035 Key Support Levels: $0.000177, $0.0001483, $0.000125 Spot Price: $0.000188 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.
