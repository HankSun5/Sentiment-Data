Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 22:38:00

Table of Contents The all-sports meme token with potential Dogecoin Shiba Inu Conclusion As cryptocurrencies reach new peaks and the bull run accelerates, traders are looking beyond Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for fresh opportunities. A rising star is capturing attention, promising potential that established meme coins might no longer offer. Introducing XYZVerse, an all-sport meme coin looking to unite fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports within a dynamic ecosystem with the potential to outperform previous successes. The all-sports meme token with potential Think of XYZ as an exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. It’s the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where savvy investors can cash in on the growing synergy between meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. Imagine the energy of Polymarket’s $1 billion trading volume during the U.S. presidential election with the viral appeal of meme coins and the excitement of sports fandom. With millions of fans gearing up to participate, the XYZVerse ecosystem is primed for explosive growth. Meme coins are dominating the crypto space in 2024 and XYZ could lead the pack.

You might also like: XYZ and DOGE prices to soar if BTC touches $150k: 2025 could be massive Dogecoin Dogecoin has seen significant changes, with its price increasing by 207.62% in the past six months. However, in the past week, its price dipped by 16.81%, indicating short-term volatility. The current price ranges between $0.35 and $0.42, hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.38 and $0.40. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.39, suggesting the coin is not overbought and may have the potential to rise. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.004012, but close to zero, which could point to a possible upward shift soon. If Dogecoin moves past the nearest resistance level at $0.51, it might reach the second resistance at $0.62, which would be an increase of around 34%. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $0.31, it could drop to the next support at $0.21, a decrease of about 41%. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge where the price might head next. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by about 20%. Looking at the last six months, SHIB’s price surged by nearly 42%, highlighting its strong growth over a longer period. The recent weekly dip might suggest a short-term correction. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 34.51, which is approaching oversold territory. This could signal a potential rebound in price soon. The Stochastic value is 23.71, also indicating possible undervaluation. SHIB is currently trading between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00003614. If the price breaks this level, it could see gains of around 13%. The nearest support level is at $0.00002006. Falling below this could lead to a decline of approximately 16%. Conclusion While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are notable, XYZVerse stands out with its sports focus and massive growth potential in the 2024 bull run.

This surprise move lit a fire under selling across all altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) being hit hardest and crashing -26%, breaking its 40-day trendline too. Conversely, Altura ($ALU) displayed outstanding strength, remaining locked into a bullish falling wedge pattern, a technical pattern that often leads to a reversal upward. Render ($RENDER) Faces Dramatic Decline After Bitcoin’s Tumble Render’s large crash is due to Bitcoin overnight tanking. That penetration below the psychological level of $100,000 triggered panic and heavy selling pressure. For Render, it meant losing an important support level that had supported its recent uptrend. Render's price action is an indicator of investor indecision and reflects an oversold condition. However, any chance of a recovery ultimately prevents the token from regaining ground and retaking its trendline support. Altura ($ALU) Remains In Bullish Formation Even with the market volatility, Altura has stayed in an attractive technical setup. The falling wedge pattern in the token's position indicates a bullish breakout. This pattern develops when the price of an asset declines within an increasingly tighter range, often resulting in an eventual upward breakout. Source: Tradingview Altura ($ALU): What You Need to Know - Altura has been resilient against potential downturns, holding near its key support zones.- A falling wedge pattern provides a positive outlook with Altura well on track for a bounce.- If Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura could significantly benefit from bullish sentiment. How Altura ($ALU) Keeps Giving Reasons to Pay Attention Altura has weathered volatility with unflappability that speaks to its unique appeal and strong fundamentals. Here are some of the underlying factors that led to its bullish sentiment: Bullish Technical Pattern: The falling wedge setup strengthens confidence in a potential breakout. Unique Use Case: The common ranging of blockchain-based gaming solutions with tokenized in-game assets makes Altura a good potential long-term investment. Supportive User Base: A robust community strengthens the token’s ecosystem and ensures ongoing interest. Future Price Prediction for Render ($RENDER) and Altura ($ALU) Render ($RENDER): Keep an eye out for price stabilization. If the token manages to regain its 40-day trendline while neutralizing its oversold status, we could expect a rebound. Altura ($ALU): The line at the top of the falling wedge is the one traders should pay attention to. A breakout from this pattern would trigger a big upward momentum, confirming Altura's bullish trend. Conclusion: The recent market crash has taken a toll on altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) suffering significant losses. However, Altura ($ALU) stands out with its bullish pattern and strong fundamentals, making it a compelling asset to watch. As Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura's breakout potential positions it as a frontrunner in the event of a market rally. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Following the 2021 cycle pattern, where Bitcoin rose 40% above its moving averages, the peak price would reach around $339,000, according to the report.

Australian computer scientist Craig Wright has been handed a one-year sentence, suspended for two years, for filing a $1.2 trillion lawsuit against the payments firm Block. The judge says Wright violated a previous court order designed to keep him from filing further legal actions. The suspended sentence essentially means Wright would avoid jail if he meets certain conditions and does not commit another offense, although the judge noted Wright is living abroad in Asia and is likely not within jurisdiction of the court. Earlier this year, a UK judge ruled that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Wright is neither Satoshi nor the author of the Bitcoin white paper after he was sued by the nonprofit crypto advocacy group Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) for filing frivolous lawsuits against Bitcoin developers. In November, COPA went on to claim that Wright violated an injunction by filing a lawsuit against Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s payments firm. According to the report, the injunction was set in place to prevent Wright from filing BTC-related lawsuits on the grounds that he is Satoshi and Judge James Mellor found Wright to be in contempt of court following a hearing Wednesday.

Two days ago on the social media platform X, the top US-based crypto exchange platform said it had added Parcl ( PARCL ), a decentralized exchange (DEX) that lets users trade and invest in real estate using synthetic assets without the need to physically own any property. Synthetic assets are tokenized, blockchain-based representations of real-world assets, such as securities and real property that can easily be swapped. News of the addition caused the token to dip in price as it went from a peak of $0.586 on December 17th to a low of $0.408 just two days later. PARCL is trading for $0.418 a time of writing, a 9% decrease during the last 24 hours. On December 15th, Coinbase added PARCL to its listing roadmap, signaling at the time that it was going to add support soon. At that time, the crypto exchange’s announcement triggered a 50% rally of the altcoin as it was moving for just $0.33 on December 10th. PARCL aims to provide traders with global city indexes – including major cities such as New York, Miami Beach, San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dubai – and allow them to acquire tokens that represent a stake in a specific index.

The latest $1.53 billion investment brings MARA’s total holdings to 44,394 BTC. At the current spot price of $100,151 per Bitcoin, the company’s holdings are valued at approximately $4.45 billion. The firm currently ranks second on the list of publicly traded companies with the largest BTC holdings globally. MARA has said the purchase was enabled by the $1.925 billion in proceeds from two offerings of 0% convertible senior notes, announced in late November and early December. This calculated move is similar to a strategy employed and popularized by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor involving large-scale BTC accumulation. According to Saylor, it’s a matter of time before MARA Holdings enters the Nasdaq 100 index. MARA seizes opportunity to buy Bitcoin after Federal Reserve Chair’s remarks MARA’s timing is interesting. They announced this purchase just a day after Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, stated that the central bank couldn’t own Bitcoin. Furthermore, the purchase coincided with a fall in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin plunged by 5.6% during Wednesday’s session, testing levels below the $100,000 mark. This marked the largest single-day drop since August 5. The fall was preceded by a wider sell-off sparked by the Fed’s hawkish comments about the interest rate trajectory and how it may possibly drop in 2025. For a brief period, Bitcoin seemed poised to surpass the $100k milestone. However, two factors contributed to its pullback: Powell’s remarks served as a major catalyst, and lingering skepticism about Bitcoin’s viability as a reserve asset added to the downward pressure. Bitcoin Miners boost reserves by purchasing on the open market Bitcoin miners are beginning to purchase Bitcoin on the open market. Hut 8 (HUT) is one of the latest Bitcoin miners to do so. Other dominant miners include MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings. The Miami-based Hut 8 announced on Thursday that it had purchased 990 BTC at an average price of $101,710 each. The acquisition increased its Bitcoin reserves to 10,096 BTC, with a total value of around $1 billion. The firm, after the latest acquisition, appears among the top ten largest corporate Bitcoin holders. The current rush for Bitcoin by miner firms is an indication of progress. Soon, these firms will control large percentages of cryptocurrency, thus, raising their market influence and overall valuation.

According to a Reuters report, geothermal energy startups are on the increase as big tech firms are looking at feeding their power-intensive data centers. Despite this surge, long-term investments in the sector remain uncertain as oil majors double down on gas. Simply put, geothermal energy is heat energy from the earth. Geothermal energy startups increased in the last two years According to Bryant Jones, the executive director for the industry association Geothermal Rising, the environment has been improving lately, in terms of ease of doing business which has seen more than 60 startups spring to life in the last two years. “Texas is becoming the ‘place to be’ for geothermal exploration and development across the board,” said Matt Welch at the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance (TxGEA). “Much of this is due to an abundance of identified geothermal resources, 1-stop shopping permitting process, and our regulatory certainty.” Welch. According to an industry report published last year, at least 10 of the geothermal startups launched between 2016 and 2022 in the US were headquartered in Texas. Now, the obtaining lower commodity prices might encourage more shale companies to diversify their revenue streams and tap into geothermal power. The Enhanced Geothermal Shot analysis in 2022 confirmed the potential for more geothermal electricity generating capacity – 90 gigawatts by 2050. These developments also come as AI data centers have emerged as high-energy consumers, forcing big techs to look elsewhere for alternative energy sources to keep their data centers running with sufficient and sustainable power. “We believe geothermal, along with abundant natural gas, can be part of the all-of-the-above energy mix we need to meet the demand,” said Trey Lowe, chief technology officer at U.S. shale gas producer Devon Energy (DVN.N), an investor in geothermal startup Fervo Energy. Big techs back the geothermal energy startups According to a Reuters report, social media giant, Meta and search engine giant Google rank among the tech firms that are partnering with these startup companies offering to produce geothermal electricity, to power their data centers. The report further highlights that geothermal energy has been promoted as a faster way to generate carbon-free power compared to nuclear and without the intermittency of wind and solar. However, the new startups do not have it easy as they face high upfront costs, especially for drilling coupled with long project approval times. These high costs have dampened the initial zeal, with limited investment so far, analysts estimate just over $700 million in financing as been contributed to overall geothermal power projects since 2020. But the sector is also receiving bipartisan interest with the CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passing the House and now awaiting Senate approval. If these become law, this will, according to Reuters, make it easier to set up geothermal projects across the US. The sector is receiving increased bipartisan interest as well. The CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passed the House and are awaiting Senate approval. If they become law, it would make it easier to set up geothermal projects in the country. Now, top shale oil producers Chevron, Diamondback Energy, and Exxon Mobil have started advocating for gas as the mainstay fuel for electric power, offering to work with utilities to add to their power plants with carbon sequestration that generates greenhouse emissions. “In general, (there is) a lot more interest from smaller oil and gas producers as well as service companies … we’ve talked to Chevron and Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab but the supermajors seem to be taking more of a wait-and-watch view,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, which is developing energy storage and geothermal baseload technologies deep in the earth. According to Reuters, Sage recently completed a $30 million fundraising which was led by Expand Energy – a US shale gas producer. The company plans to launch the Series B round in January. Colorado-based Gradient Geothermal -which generates geothermal energy using existing oil and gas infrastructure – announced it was providing Chord Energy services to help generate power at one of its oil and gas in North Dakota. Johanna Ostrum, Gradient CEO said most mid-size and smaller independent energy firms were interested in geothermal energy for their own needs, not to create electricity for resale.

We must take a comprehensive, clear stance on taxes, regulations, and cybersecurity before the Trump administration takes office.” Japanese Minister of Digital Affairs Takuya Hirai Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to reporters on the death of Tsuneo Watanabe, editor-in-chief of The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, describing him as a “great Journalist.” https://t.co/4FTHqGOZMo — The Japan News (@The_Japan_News) December 19, 2024 Experts think Tokyo wants to cement any new changes in Japan’s cryptocurrency policy by the time Trump takes office. These changes could include tax reform, in addition to new regulations and cybersecurity laws. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society forms policy recommendations for the government’s consideration. However, Ishiba’s office is under no obligation to accept or incorporate these recommendations. Indeed, in recent weeks, the Prime Minister refused to commit to tax reform or the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs in Japan. Ishiba has appointed lawmakers known to be in favor of crypto reform to ministerial positions . He also mentioned blockchain technology in his election manifesto. However, voices outside the LDP have also called for “urgent” reform. Opposition leaders have also warned repeatedly that capital is flowing out of the country as a result of an “unfair” taxation system for crypto investors. Japan's central bank kept its monetary policy settings steady, signaling it sees little urgency to raise interest rates for now https://t.co/xYQANqP0nF — Bloomberg (@business) December 19, 2024 While many other nations charge traders flat capital gains taxes at rates of about 20%, Japan’s tax rules instead oblige crypto traders to declare their crypto profits on their annual income tax declarations. They must file crypto trading profits under “other income.” And that means that the nation’s highest earners can end up paying up to 55% on their crypto trading revenues. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society said its proposal was of “urgent” importance. On X, Hirai wrote that the LDP had been working on crypto legislation “faster” than any party “in the world.” The post Japan’s Ruling Party Still Pushing for Crypto Tax Reform Despite PM’s Caution appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-19 23:30:00

Here’s the nearest on-chain level that the asset would end up retesting if the drawdown elongates. 1 Week To 1 Month Bitcoin Holders Have Their Realized Price At $97,900 As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old BTC investors is the closest support for the asset right now. Related Reading: Secret Bitcoin Driver: Exchanges Receiving $40 Million USDT Fuel Per Day The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition price of the average holder on the Bitcoin network. When the metric’s value is lower than the spot price of the cryptocurrency, it means the investors as a whole can be considered to be holding a net amount of profit. On the other hand, it being under the BTC value suggests the dominance of loss in the market. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a particular segment of the sector is of interest: the 1-week to 1-month-old holders. This cohort includes the addresses that have been holding their coins for at least one week and, at most, one month. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the Realized Price of this Bitcoin group has changed over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old Bitcoin investors has been climbing up alongside the price rally. This is naturally due to the fact that the cohort’s cost basis has been getting repriced to higher levels as new investors have been purchasing at the rally highs. Currently, the indicator’s value sits at $97,900, so these investors would be in profit at the current price. Earlier in the past day, however, the asset came dangerously close to retesting the level as its price saw a brief dip below $99,000. The 1 week to 1 month old investors make up a section of a larger cohort known as the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs are broadly defined as the holders who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell. So, the STHs, and especially the 1-week to 1-month-old segment, would contain the holders with the least amount of resolve in the sector, owing to their low holding time. Because of how fickle they are, the STHs generally show some kind of reaction whenever their average cost basis gets retested by the Bitcoin price. This reaction may come in the form of buying when the retest occurs from above, as these holders could believe the decline to be just a ‘dip.’ As such, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old STHs, which is below the current price, could be looked at as a support level for the cryptocurrency. The level has also already helped the asset out once this month.

With the market constantly evolving, some coins are capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike with groundbreaking innovations and extraordinary potential. VeChain and Fantom are making waves with their recent developments. However, a unique contender, Qubetics ($TICS), is leading the charge with its remarkable presale performance and advanced Web3 solutions. While VeChain has just secured an innovative patent, and Fantom is gearing up for a transformative upgrade, Qubetics is stealing the spotlight. Packed with massive potential for returns, its presale generates significant buzz in the crypto community. This article will cover all three coins’ latest updates and developments—Qubetics, VeChain, and Fantom. Qubetics: Transforming Privacy with Its Decentralised VPN Service What if the internet could be accessed without the risks of surveillance or censorship? As part of its comprehensive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that’s set to redefine online privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPN providers that can log and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN leverages a peer-to-peer network powered by blockchain technology. This ensures user traffic remains entirely decentralised and free from centralised control. The dVPN offers more than just anonymity—it brings transparency and resistance to censorship. Its multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption protect user identities while providing secure, unrestricted internet access. Moreover, the innovative tokenised incentive structure rewards users who contribute bandwidth with $TICS tokens, making the network self-sustaining and encouraging active participation. Adding to the excitement, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to engage with its growing community, answering critical questions and showcasing the platform’s potential. With its cutting-edge features and interactive approach, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to join today . VeChain’s Breakthrough: Secure Data Handling with a New Patent VeChain continues to solidify its position as a leader in enterprise-focused blockchain solutions. The company recently secured a U.S. patent, approved on 17 December 2024, for a groundbreaking system to enhance data security. This patent leverages a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and securely split transaction keys, significantly improving secure data handling capabilities. The innovative key management system (KMS) outlined in the patent enables businesses to safeguard sensitive information effectively. With these advancements, VeChain is reinforcing its role as a pioneer in enterprise blockchain technology, setting new standards in security and reliability. Fantom’s Sonic Mainnet: A Game-Changer in Performance and Scalability Fantom (FTM) is on the rise, surging 16% on 15 December in anticipation of its rebranding and the rollout of the Sonic mainnet. This major upgrade boosts network efficiency, making Fantom faster and more cost-effective. As part of the update, FTM tokens will transition to Sonic (S) through a 1:1 swap, which has sparked considerable excitement among investors. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicate increased demand and positive inflows, supporting Fantom’s bullish trajectory. With support levels firmly established at $1.2, analysts are eyeing resistance points at $1.6 and potentially $2.38, making Fantom a compelling choice for growth-focused investors. Presale Spotlight: Why Qubetics Is the Talk of the Crypto World Investors seeking high returns focus on the Qubetics presale, currently in Phase 13. Each phase witnesses a 10% price increase, with the final stage set to jump by 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.034, and the project has already raised over $7.2 million. Analysts predict that once the mainnet launches, $TICS could soar to between $10 and $15 per token. Imagine investing today and reaping an ROI of over 29,000% if the price hits $10, or an astonishing 43,000% if it climbs to $15. These numbers are no mere speculation—Qubetics has already demonstrated immense traction, proving why it’s one of the best cryptos to join today. The structured price hikes add urgency for investors to act swiftly, securing their position in this promising project before the next phase increases token costs. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads the Pack in Crypto Innovation The crypto market is brimming with potential, and coins like VeChain and Fantom are making commendable strides with their latest updates. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a game-changer, combining innovative Web3 solutions with an electrifying presale that promises exceptional returns. Analysts’ predictions of staggering ROIs and the platform’s robust community engagement make it one of the best cryptos to join today. Don’t miss the chance to be part of Qubetics’ transformative journey. With the presale progressing rapidly, now is the time to act and secure your stake in what could be the next big thing in crypto.

After briefly retesting $99,000, Bitcoin’s price momentum has slowed, raising questions about whether this signals the start of a larger sell-off or a temporary pause in its uptrend. Analysts Highlight BTC Price Key Levels Crypto trader Ali Charts has put a lot of emphasis on the $96,000 level. He explained that if Bitcoin price moves below this level, the following significant points will be $90,000 and $85,000. This view is consistent with the historical Fibonacci levels of retrace commonly employed by traders to understand market reversals. “Keeping it simple, based on the Fib, if Bitcoin loses $96,000, the next focus becomes $90,000 and $85,000,” Ali tweeted. To this, Robert Kiyosaki , a supporter of Bitcoin, said that it is never too late to join the market. He pointed to Bitcoin’s stability and capability to generate riches, saying, “Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich, including those who come in late. Just don’t get greedy.” Long-Term Holders Take Profits as Short-Term Investors Step In Using data from Glassnode, some changes have been observed in the activity of long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs). In the two months period, the total supply held by LTHs has been decreasing from $14.23 billion to $13.31 billion. This comes as BTC price soared from $58,000 to over $100,000 suggesting that institutional investors are booking profits at local highs. However, these sales by the long-term holders have been taken by the short-term holders (STHs) to ensure that the prices are maintained. Glassnode analysts pointed out that “the share of wealth owned by new investors has not yet reached the levels that were seen during the previous cycle peaks” which may mean that there is still some room for growth. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Remains Intact However, based on the correction, some analysts continue to hold the view that the price of Bitcoin is still bullish. The AVIV Ratio, which looks at unrealized profits, is at 1.81, far from the levels that are considered extremely high and which usually signify a reversal in market trends. This means that although some traders may have taken their profits, the market has not become overly aggressive. Meanwhile, the Titan of Crypto still has the positive outlook about Bitcoin’s future. He stressed that Bitcoin has been making higher highs and higher lows which is a positive indication that the trend remains bullish. ”BTC bullish momentum remains strong, with the next target at the 100% Fibonacci extension of $113,000,” he stated. Institutional Demand Could Propel Bitcoin Further The adoption of Bitcoin has remained strong, with Bitcoin ETFs hitting a top of $37 billion in assets by December 19th. This represents a sharp rise from the $24.23 billion at the beginning of November as highlighted by Farside Investors. At the same time, statistics show that at the peak of Bitcoin at $108,000, 62.17% of traders had short positions, expecting the price to fall. However, as Bitcoin dropped to $96,000, the sentiment changed as 55.44% of the traders are now bullish because they anticipate a rally in the price of the cryptocurrency. Supporting this price trend, analysts at Bitfinex believe that the price correction of Bitcoin will be relatively mild owing to the rising demand from institutional investors. They expect it to be at $145,000 by mid-2025, with a possibility of rising to $200,000 in a better environment. Furthermore, in light of the growing talk about the potential of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset at the national level, experts estimate that such a decision could take Bitcoin’s price to $1 million.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 23:57:00

Crypto All-Stars has wrapped up a stellar presale with a $22.64 million haul, solidifying its position as a meme coin powerhouse. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the show with its presale, which has already surpassed $4.2 million in Stage 12. On the flip side, Mog Coin (MOG), once hailed as a meme coin with promise, is struggling to hold its ground amid bearish market conditions. Meme coins have grown beyond being internet jokes. They now represent a unique blend of community power, creative use cases, and, of course, the potential for exponential profits. BTFD Coin is leading this new wave of meme coin evolution with its P2E game, lucrative referral program, staking rewards, and a vibrant community. Let’s dive into why BTFD, Crypto All-Stars, and Mog Coin are the most talked-about meme coins right now and which of them stands out as the best for exponential returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Rising Star in Meme Coins BTFD Coin has taken the meme coin world by storm, and it’s easy to see why. Starting at an initial price of $0.000004, the coin has climbed to $0.00013 in Stage 12 of its presale. With over 57 billion coins sold and $4.2 million raised so far, the numbers speak for themselves. With just four stages left, the presale momentum is building rapidly, and the coin’s listing price of $0.0006 promises substantial short-term returns. BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its presale. Its P2E game offers an engaging way for users to earn rewards, while the referral program incentivises community growth by rewarding users for bringing in new investors. Add in the 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got a project that caters to both gamers and crypto enthusiasts looking for passive income. Here’s an investment scenario to paint the picture. If you invest $30,000 in Stage 12 at $0.00013 per coin, you’d acquire approximately 230.7 million BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would grow to $138,420. That’s the kind of growth that has investors flocking to the project. Why is BTFD one of the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its explosive crypto presale , innovative features, and strong community backing make it a top choice for investors looking to capitalise on the meme coin trend. With the price increasing at every stage, now’s the time to jump in. Crypto All-Stars (STARS): The MemeVault Revolution Crypto All-Stars has already proven itself as a meme coin heavyweight. Its presale, which concluded with $22.64 million raised, set the stage for the launch of its groundbreaking MemeVault—a platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins, including PEPE, Dogecoin, and Floki, under one roof. This innovation has brought a sense of unity to the meme coin community, making $STARS a must-have token for enthusiasts. The $STARS token, priced at $0.0016782 during the presale, comes with lucrative staking rewards of up to 1429% APY. This high return has attracted both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. By reducing the circulating supply through staking incentives, Crypto All-Stars creates scarcity, which often leads to price surges once the token is listed. With the $STARS token set to launch on Uniswap next week, anticipation is building. Early adopters are expected to see substantial gains as more meme coin holders flock to the platform. The MemeVault itself is a game-changer, offering a streamlined way to manage and stake meme coins while earning rewards. Why does $STARS rank among the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its successful presale, innovative staking platform, and upcoming launch make it a strong contender for both short-term and long-term gains. For those who missed the presale, the token launch presents a second chance to get in on the action. Mog Coin (MOG): A Meme Coin Facing Challenges Mog Coin (MOG) entered the scene with a lot of promise, leveraging its quirky branding and strong community backing. However, recent market conditions have posed significant challenges. Once a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts, MOG is now battling bearish pressure that has left its performance lagging behind competitors like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars. MOG’s initial appeal lay in its community-driven initiatives and its potential to carve out a niche in the meme coin space. However, the lack of new developments and a clear roadmap has made it difficult for the project to sustain its early momentum. While the coin still has a loyal following, its price movements have been lacklustre, leaving investors cautious. For MOG to regain its footing, it needs a fresh narrative or a major update to its ecosystem. Without these, it risks falling further behind in a market that thrives on innovation and community engagement. While some investors are holding on in the hope of a turnaround, others are shifting their focus to projects like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars, which offer clearer paths to exponential profits. Why does MOG make this list? Its initial success and strong community give it a place among notable meme coins, but its current struggles highlight the importance of staying ahead in a competitive market. For now, MOG is a speculative play rather than a reliable choice for significant returns. The Concluding Remarks: What Are the Best Meme Coins for Exponential Growth Next Year? Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market offers a wealth of opportunities for investors seeking exponential profits. BTFD Coin is the best meme coin for exponential profits, thanks to its stellar presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support. A $30,000 investment in Stage 12 could grow to $138,420 by the end of the presale, showcasing its immense potential. Crypto All-Stars is another standout, with its MemeVault innovation and successful presale setting the stage for substantial gains. While Mog Coin has its merits, its current challenges make it a riskier option compared to its competitors. If you’re ready to capitalise on these opportunities, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin meme coin presale today and position yourself for exponential profits in the ever-evolving meme coin market. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing in crypto.

The video included a disclaimer suggesting there’s no guarantee the cap won’t be altered. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is a cornerstone of its value as a store of wealth, and any change could fundamentally impact its perception among investors. In the video, BlackRock highlighted Bitcoin’s 21 million cap, noting it as a “hard-coded rule” that controls supply, purchasing power, and prevents excessive currency creation. However, the disclaimer stated: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor reposted the video, sparking criticism. Joel Valenzuela, Dashpay’s marketing director, commented, “When the supply cap increase happens, it will have ‘always been part of the plan.’ And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say Bitcoin wasn’t hijacked.” Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis added, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Is Bitcoin’s Supply Cap Changeable? Bitcoin developer Super Testnet, known for BitVM, explained that altering Bitcoin’s supply cap would depend on how one defines “Bitcoin.” In theory, the cap could change if a majority of the community—node operators, developers, miners, and investors—reached consensus on a hard fork. Such a change would involve a proposal to gauge consensus, followed by implementing changes in Bitcoin Core. If most node operators and miners adopted the new fork, it would create a “new” Bitcoin network with an uncapped supply. However, Super Testnet argued that this new chain wouldn’t truly be Bitcoin. “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” they said. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” In essence, an uncapped version wouldn’t be Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FORKS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 00:36:00

The SEC is reviewing these products to ensure whether they follow regulations and protect investors. This move helps bring digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem by preventing from frauds. Nasdaq and Cboe BZX Exchange crypto index ETF Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange changed their rules for listing and trading with exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to spot bitcoin and ether ETF. Nasdaq intends to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, while the Cboe BZX Exchange aims to introduce the Franklin Crypto Index ETF. These ETPs will directly hold spot bitcoin and ether and cash equivalents. The goal of listing these assets on the exchanges is to increase their accessibility. SEC’s Role in Regulating The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is reviewing these listings according to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which sets rules for trading securities on exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe BZX, for ensuring fairness and transparency. The Securities Act of 1933 regulates how securities are issued and required proper disclosures to protect investors on Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange. The Investment Company Act of 1940 governs investment products like ETFs to ensure they follow rules that protect investors. In addition to this, The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) regulates financial products linked to bitcoin and ether as commodities. The proposed Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act could shape future cryptocurrency regulations to ensure safe investment practices. The SEC believes that the proposed rule changes meet these requirements, especially those to prevent fraud and market manipulation. Additionally, the Commission emphasizes the necessity of surveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges to detect fraudulent activities and maintain market integrity. To minimize the risk of market manipulation, the SEC investigates how the spot markets for assets like bitcoin and ether that are correlated with their futures markets. In previous approvals for Bitcoin and Ether-based ETPs, the SEC confirmed that price movements in spot markets which closely reflected in futures markets. This correlation indicates that if manipulation or fraud occurs in the spot market, it is more like an evident in the futures market, which is easier to monitor. The CME’s bitcoin and ether futures markets have exhibited strong correlations with their spot markets, giving the SEC confidence that these new ETFs can be effectively supervised. The SEC has decided that the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and the Franklin Crypto Index ETF follow all necessary rules. These products are in line with past approvals of similar bitcoin and ether-based investment products. By introducing these new ETPs, investors will have access to spot bitcoin and ether in a regulated environment, which enhances security and transparency in their cryptocurrency investments. This approval is an important step in bringing digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem, with the help of SEC.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.58 million YouTube subscribers that ETH will likely break through its all-time high and enter an explosive phase this cycle. “Barring any black swan events spoiling our party, we should be able to take for granted that ETH will break through its previous all-time high of around $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Where it goes from there, though, is the real question. Because ETH has spent so much time sliding against BTC and wallowing in price purgatory, it can be difficult to imagine a parabolic repricing. However, once the all-time high is broken, there will be no historical levels of supply or resistance above. Price discovery will ensue, and ETH is likely to teleport moonwards.” Crypto traders and analysts refer to price discovery as a situation where a coin trades at levels never seen before or not having been seen in a long time. Next, the analyst uses Fibonacci extension levels to suggest that ETH may surge to $7,300 as a “base case,” which is the 1.618 Fibonacci level on the chart he shares. Traders use Fibonacci extensions in technical analysis to estimate profit targets and price pullbacks. They are based on Fibonacci ratios. Source: Guy Turner/YouTube However, he says if Bitcoin nearly doubles its current price next year and hits $200,000, ETH could surge even higher, to $14,600. “ETH has only just made it to the 0.786 [Fibonacci] level. So rather than doubling this price, we think doubling ETH price at the 1.618 level will give us a better upper limit of what could happen in 2025. This 1.618 level is about $7,300 which, again, we think is a pretty good base case target. Doubling this would give us $14,600. For an asset that has underperformed BTC so severely, this sounds like a tall order indeed, and it’s therefore the most extreme bullish case for 2025 that we can take seriously. If BTC touches $200,000 in 2025 orthodoxy suggests that profits will rotate into ETH. With BTC at such a high level, this could be enough capital to bring ETH up above $14,000.” Ethereum is trading for $3,686 at time of writing, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $101,143 at time of writing, down 4.6% on the day.

Following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply below $99,000. However, the leading crypto quickly rebounded, climbing back to $104,000 earlier today before settling at $100,573 at the time of writing. This represents a 3.4% decrease over the past day and a roughly $67 billion reduction in its market cap valuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Momentum Shifts As Spot Market Outpaces Futures – Here’s What It Means Exchange Transactions Hit Record Lows Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst known as Woominkyu provided insights into Bitcoin’s market activity, highlighting declining exchange transaction volumes. According to Woominkyu, historical data suggests a correlation between transaction volume spikes and significant price movements. For example, peaks in exchange transactions coincided with Bitcoin’s dramatic price surges in 2017 and 2021. However, recent data shows a marked decline in transaction volumes on both spot and derivative exchanges, reflecting reduced trading activity compared to previous years. This decrease, according to the CryptoQuant analyst may indicate “waning market participation,” suggesting a “period of consolidation or reduced volatility” in the near term. Bitcoin Key Support Levels and Technical Insights Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shed light on an important support zone forming just below the $100,000 mark. The data shared by the platform reveals that over 1.45 million BTC were accumulated at an average price of $97,500. This accumulation has established a significant demand zone, potentially serving as a “buffer” against further price declines. The importance of this level lies in its ability to provide a foundation for price stability, particularly as Bitcoin navigates its current phase of market correction. It is suggested that a breach below this zone could trigger further downward pressure, while holding above it might boost recovery efforts. Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, insights shared by market analyst Satoshi Wolf highlight the critical nature of Bitcoin’s current price levels. The cryptocurrency recently tested the $100,000 support, aligning with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Related Reading: Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? Top Exec Discusses The Market Crash This level is pivotal as it combines technical indicators with psychological significance. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows bearish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nears oversold territory, signalling the potential for a price reversal. Wolf suggests that traders monitor for a confirmed breakout above $104,000 or a breakdown below $100,000, with volume confirmation being key to validating either. 📊 $BTC Analysis: The chart shows a recent pullback after a strong uptrend, suggesting potential profit-taking. Price is testing the 100,000 support, aligning with the 100 EMA, a crucial level to watch. If it holds, a bounce back towards 104,000 resistance is possible.

Render is currently experiencing strong market momentum, indicated by its recent price increases and expanding partnerships that signal potential for future growth in its GPU-powered decentralized network. Stacks has achieved a significant milestone with the launch of the ‘Nakamoto’ upgrade, enhancing both speed and security, and it has set ambitious price targets following an increase in user engagement and smart contract activity. Web3Bay is introducing a transformative e-commerce ecosystem built on blockchain technology, aiming to revolutionize online shopping with enhanced security, community-driven governance, and versatile transaction options. As each project develops, Web3Bay is particularly notable for its innovative approach to merging decentralized shopping experiences within a community-oriented platform. Render Sees Growing Momentum Render has been capitalizing on bullish market trends, supported by its decentralized GPU rendering network that connects creators with GPU resources. This platform provides an economical and efficient solution for rendering tasks, gaining popularity among artists, developers, and creatives who require high-performance graphics at lower costs. With a significant 21.39% price increase over the past week, Render is garnering increasing market attention, especially as it nears critical price thresholds. Render’s growth is bolstered by strategic partnerships, including a recent collaboration with Apple, enhancing its credibility and market reach. Analysts are optimistic about RNDR’s potential, with projections of substantial price increases in the near future. Render’s dedication to delivering cost-effective, high-quality rendering services positions it as a preferred provider in the sector. Stacks Enhances Capabilities with Nakamoto Upgrade Stacks is strengthening its foundation for Bitcoin-based smart contracts with the Nakamoto upgrade, marking a significant advancement in transaction speed and security, which benefits developers of decentralized applications. This upgrade has contributed to a price surge of over 30% in the past month, driven by unprecedented levels of smart contract deployment and growing interest in its ecosystem. Stacks is increasingly recognized for its ability to extend Bitcoin’s functionality, attracting more users to decentralized finance and applications. With rising adoption and an increase in total value locked, there is a strong sentiment about STX’s potential for further gains. The project’s emphasis on enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities positions it as an exciting option for long-term decentralized solutions. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-commerce Web3Bay is redefining the online shopping experience with its blockchain-based e-commerce platform. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay offers a decentralized marketplace that empowers users to fully control their data and transactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay enhances security, transparency, and user experience, bridging the gap between conventional e-commerce and Web3. It supports transactions using both cryptocurrencies and mainstream payment methods like PayPal, broadening its accessibility. The 3BAY token, integral to Web3Bay’s operations, has shown impressive returns for early investors. During its presale stages, the price of 3BAY has consistently risen, achieving a remarkable 6430% return on investment for those who participated early. The strong demand and growth potential are evident as Web3Bay gears up for its full launch. Web3Bay’s unique model fosters significant network growth by rewarding active user engagement, making community interaction a key driver of its development. This community-centric approach, coupled with decentralized governance, ensures the platform remains responsive to user needs, promoting continued growth and adding value to the 3BAY token.

With a progressive approach to e-commerce and a robust token economy, Web3Bay is positioning the 3BAY token as an attractive investment for those looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized, community-driven online commerce. In Conclusion While each project—Web3Bay, Render, and Stacks—brings unique strengths, Web3Bay’s comprehensive e-commerce ecosystem sets it apart as a standout choice. Render’s ongoing bullish momentum in the graphics field and Stacks’ ambitious targets with its Bitcoin-focused smart contracts are notable, but Web3Bay’s integration of blockchain technology with online shopping, creating a community-based marketplace, presents a compelling case. With high ROI potential and the prospect of becoming a next 100x asset, Web3Bay’s decentralized, user-centric model makes it an appealing choice for those exploring the innovative frontiers of e-commerce on the blockchain.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 01:28:00

This marks a major step toward integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum into traditional financial markets through regulated investment products. Dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to Be Listed on Nasdaq and Cboe BZX The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and Franklin Templeton Crypto Index ETF received the green light from the SEC to trade in the public market. These ETFs will be available for trading on the Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX exchanges, allowing investors to directly trade in Bitcoin and Ethereum spot. All the two funds will own Bitcoin, Ethereum, cash, and cash equivalents as part of their structure. By permitting these ETFs, the SEC guarantees that crypto investments meet some of the most important laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. SEC has *approved* both the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF & Franklin Crypto Index ETF… Will initially hold both btc & eth. pic.twitter.com/5GUhhhXL7y — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 19, 2024 The approval process also contained measures for market surveillance in order to prevent fraud and manipulation. The decision will help digital assets to have a better standing and acceptance in the financial system. Market Turbulence Surrounds SEC Decision The US SEC’s decision is made at the time of high volatility of cryptocurrency markets. However, Bitcoin price declined significantly and was trading at slightly above $96,000, having previously traded at above $108,000 earlier in the week. Ethereum also went down by 15% and was trading at $3,440. As per the data from CoinGlass, more than $1 billion worth of crypto was liquidated within the last 24 hours. However, experts believe that the launch of these ETFs will help to stabilize the crypto market and, therefore, attract more institutional investors. “This move created a clear, legally compliant way for investors to get involved with digital assets,” said a market analyst. ETFs Bring Enhanced Oversight and Transparency The ETFs are intended to mimic market capitalization-weighted indexes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, thus providing investors with an opportunity to invest in both of them without owning the coins directly. The Hashdex ETF will track the Nasdaq Crypto Index and Franklin Templeton’s fund will be linked to the CF Institutional Digital Asset Index. In a bid to counter allegations of market manipulation, the US SEC noted that the price movements in the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot markets are in tandem with their respective futures markets. This correlation makes it easy to have supervision through sharing of surveillance data. To assess the price integrity, the SEC has used information from the CME’s Bitcoin and Ethereum futures markets. To avoid diversifying their strategies into staking or generating income from airdrops, both funds do not allow such operations in their investment approach based on spot prices. These measures are part of the regulatory systems to safeguard the investors’ interest as well as to enhance transparency of ETFs. Future Prospects for Crypto ETFs This approval could pave the way for additional cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States. Bloomberg analysts predict Litecoin ETFs could be next, given its classification as a commodity and its close relationship with Bitcoin. However, other digital assets, such as Solana and XRP, face greater regulatory scrutiny. The US SEC’s approval of these ETFs reflects a cautious but constructive approach to cryptocurrency regulation. By aligning these products with existing financial laws, the SEC is enabling safer participation in the digital asset market. This decision could encourage more institutional and retail investors to explore cryptocurrency as part of a diversified portfolio.

The funding is part of the orgainzation’s most recent round of Bitcoin Development Fund grants. During the last round of the Bitcoin Development Fund Grant in 2022, the HRF granted $325,000 to various projects worldwide. This year, the organization has gone bigger and better, granting 7 BTC, approximately $706,000, to twenty projects worldwide according to the press release it sent to the Bitcoin Magazine. The HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund is focused on supporting projects that enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem. It especially has interests in regions where people live under unfavorable conditions. The program funds projects that promote decentralization, privacy, and education, and its goal is to empower individuals and communities facing oppressive regimes. HRF reaches a hand out The guarantees for the HRF’s Bitcoin development fund are projects in Latin America, Asia, and Africa that focus on technical education in regions with authoritarian governments. The organization did not disclose how much each of this round’s recipients will receive. However, it revealed that the 20 awarded projects will share a grand total of 7 BTC. The winning projects from this round include Stratum V2 Reference Implementation (SRI), an open-source software and Public Pool, an open-source mining pool. Both projects are centered around making Bitcoin more accessible and decentralized. Other projects include UI/UX Design for Bitcoin Core, No BS Bitcoin, Tando, YakiHonne, and many more. Each of these projects contributes to the accessibility and decentralization of Bitcoin in their various regions. HRF rewards odds-defying individuals Among the guarantees of the $706,000 grant are Naiyoma and Daniella Brozzoni. Naiyoma is the first female Bitcoin core developer from Africa. Kenya, where Naiyoma hails from, has experienced instances of electoral authoritarianism. Financial freedom and human rights are also under threat. Considering this, Naiyoma is dedicated to creating an open financial system rooted in transparency, freedom, and fairness. Her work focuses on reviewing pull requests, fixing bugs through new PRs, and improving Bitcoin Core’s code base. The HRF fund allocation is expected to support her work in advancing Bitcoin Core. Daniella Brozzoni is also a developer. She previously contributed to the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK), a software library that supports building cross-platform Bitcoin wallets. Like Naiyoma, Daniella now also focuses on Bitcoin Core, where her job includes reviewing key pull requests, contributing to new features, and improving test coverage. The work of these dedicated developers will contribute to the decentralization of Bitcoin making it more accessible, secure and resilient.

With so many options on the market, keeping an eye on promising developments is crucial. While many investors are focused on mainstream coins, emerging projects often hold the potential for exponential returns. Filecoin has been making headlines with its ambitious price predictions, and Stacks continues to garner attention for its innovative approach to blockchain utility. However, the spotlight is firmly on Qubetics ($TICS), a revolutionary blockchain platform that’s capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. Its presale momentum and groundbreaking technology are turning heads in the crypto space. This article will cover the latest updates and developments around Qubetics, Filecoin, and Stacks—three of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Qubetics: Cross-Border Payments Redefined What if financial institutions could execute cross-border payments instantly, securely, and at a fraction of the current costs? Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a solution that makes this possible, empowering banks and financial institutions to streamline international transactions. By leveraging the $TICS token, Qubetics addresses long-standing inefficiencies in global payment systems. Traditional cross-border payments often come with delays, high fees, and a lack of transparency. Qubetics flips this narrative, enabling swift, transparent transactions that cater to the needs of both corporate entities and individuals. For businesses, this means quicker settlements, improved cash flow, and the ability to stay competitive in global markets. It simplifies remittances and international transfers for individuals, ensuring money reaches its destination without undue complications. Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to enhance community engagement, addressing queries from its rapidly growing audience. Such transparency and involvement only make it one of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Filecoin: The Backbone of Decentralised Storage Filecoin is gaining traction as a decentralised storage network that aims to preserve the world’s most critical data securely.

For XRP, the support at $2.20 plays an important role. Since the beginning of December 2024, the altcoin has reached this level more than four times, and each time it has experienced an upside rally. However, this time, sentiment appears to be similar, as the price has started moving upward. Long-Term Holders Rising Interest in XRP The current market sentiment appears negative, as the market has witnessed a significant $1.18 billion in crypto liquidations . This substantial liquidation has created fear among traders and investors, discouraging them from staying and participating in the asset. $220 Million of XRP outflow Despite the fear, traders and long-term holders seem optimistic about XRP, as they have purchased millions worth of tokens during this price decline, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from XRP spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a continuous and significant outflow of $220 million worth of XRP. Source: Coinglasss This outflow indicates a bullish outlook for XRP despite the ongoing price decline, as long-term holders continue to believe in the token. This explains why exchanges are experiencing substantial token outflows. In the cryptocurrency context, “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to long-term holders’ wallets, signaling a potential upside rally and an ideal buying opportunity. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, XRP appears bullish as the price is showing signs of a reversal from the crucial support level of $2.20. Based on the recent price action, the altcoin is near the buying zone, where it has typically experienced an upside rally. Source: Trading View If XRP holds the $2.20 support level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 13% to reach the next resistance level of $2.50 in the near future. On the other hand, if XRP falls below the support level and closes a daily candle below the $2.20 level, we could see XRP dropping to $2 or even lower in the future. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.30 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.70% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 7%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors.",News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 02:24:32

The surge in these metrics has resulted from the significant price drop for Dogecoin, which is down over 5% in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin Trading Volume And Liquidations Witness Significant Spike CoinMarketCap data shows that Dogecoins’s trading volume is up over 57% in the last 24 hours, with over $6 billion traded during this period. Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin’s liquidations have crossed $31 million, with $25 million and $5.8 in long and short positions liquidated, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Run To $11 ATH? Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer Long positions took the most hit as the Dogecoin price crashed below the $0.4 range. This development came following Jerome Powell’s speech, which painted a bearish picture for the foremost meme coin. As crypto analyst Kevin Capital revealed, Dogecoin’s technical indicators were already bearish, and the macroeconomic fundamentals only did more damage. Powell suggested that the US Federal Reserve will likely pause on the rate cuts next year, which immediately sparked a bearish sentiment among traders and led to a wave of sell-offs. This contributed to the spike in trading volume, as investors looked to offload their coins, considering how the Fed being hawkish is bearish for risk assets like Dogecoin. However, Kevin Capital believes that traders are overreacting to Jerome Powell’s speech. The crypto analyst believes that Dogecoin will recover this price correction, stating that the dip will be bought. However, it is worth mentioning Dogecoin’s correlation with Bitcoin, as Kevin Capital had previously pointed out that DOGE’s next move will depend on BTC. The Bitcoin price has dropped below the $100,000 psychological price level and looks bearish at the moment. As such, the Dogecoin price recovery is unlikely to happen until Bitcoin witnesses a bullish reversal. Increased Volatility Is Not Unusual Crypto analyst Master Kenobi also commented on the Dogecoin price drop, stating that increased volatility at this stage of the bull market is not unusual. However, the analyst suggested that traders should avoid being shaken out and instead hold on to their positions. This came as he claimed that market makers who will inject money into the market would prefer for market participants to walk away with a 90% loss rather than a 10x gain. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Recovery Toward $2 As Million-Dollar Whale Transactions Explode On The Network Bitcoinist recently reported that Dogecoin’s sentiment has turned negative once again, indicating that DOGE holders may be looking to sell their coins even at a loss. Kevin Capital had before now stated that the Dogecoin bull run is far from over, suggesting that there was no need to be bearish at the moment despite the price correction. He advised long-term holders just to sit back and wait for higher prices. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.36, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

For now, only a few select users can access the card, and a date for the full release to the public has yet to be announced. The project shared the news via an announcement on its X account. Part of the post read, “Today we’re kicking off a limited pilot program in the United States where some of you will get your hands on MetaMask Card and try it out before it goes to a wider release.” Metamast tests the US markets The soft launch in the US is a precursor to a full-scale launch. Currently, the MetaMask card is only available to select areas in the US, with users in New York and Vermont not making the list. The MetaMask team went on to urge users who were not accepted into the pilot program to apply to join the waitlist. Users of MetaMask and other self-custodial wallets face the challenge of using their crypto funds to make payments for common goods and services directly without having to move these funds to centralized wallets or banks. The MetaMask card could be a game-changer in allowing crypto holders to easily complete transactions in real-time without first converting or transferring their crypto funds. According to Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the parent company behind MetaMask, “MetaMask Card represents a major step to removing the friction that has existed between the blockchain and traditional payments. This is a paradigm shift that offers the best of both worlds.” He also added that the card pilot program gives people the freedom to spend crypto. The MetaMask card allows direct spending from self-custodial wallets To get the card, users have to first check their eligibility on their MetaMask portfolios before registering for the digital card. Once they go through these steps, they can then set it up as a payment method on their mobile devices as it can be integrated into Apple Pay and Google Pay. Funds that users can spend directly from the card include cryptos such as USDC, USDT, and WETH on the Linea network. They can also set spending limits for their card. The card launched in August of this year, and it allows users to spend the crypto they hold on MetaMask anywhere. This means that a MetaMask cardholder can use their card to make payments in fiat currency anywhere a Mastercard is accepted, thanks to their partnership with Mastercard and Baanx. At the time of its initial launch , the card was available in Europe and the UK, with the promise to roll it out in other locations. So far, the card is now operational in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Columbia. According to the partners, the card joins the Web2 world to Web3, by leveraging Mastercard’s merchant network, MetaMask’s security, the efficiency of the Linea network, and the depth of experience Baanx brings in building financial technologies and cards in the Web3 space.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $95,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Further Bitcoin price failed to start another increase and extended losses below the $102,000 zone. BTC gained bearish momentum below the $100,000 and $98,000 levels. The price even spiked below $96,500. A low was formed at $95,586 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

A clear move above the $100,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $102,000. A close above the $102,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $103,400 resistance level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $108,295 swing high to the $95,586 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $105,000 level. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $98,500 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $96,200 level. The first major support is near the $95,500 level. The next support is now near the $93,200 zone.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

Today, let’s dive into two meme coins that could leave you with serious FOMO if you don’t act fast: Neiro, the heartfelt underdog carrying Doge’s legacy, and BTFD Coin , the meme coin disrupting presales with a bang. Neiro might already be flying high, but if you missed its meteoric rise, don’t fret—BTFD Coin’s presale is still open and packing more potential than your favourite meme thread. Neiro: The Little Sister You Didn’t Know You Needed Neiro’s story reads like a Hollywood script: abandoned, rescued, and now a star in her own right. Once a stray dog in a shelter, Neiro was adopted by the same woman who owned Kabosu—the Shiba Inu behind the legendary Doge meme. Her journey from obscurity to fame mirrors the rise of her namesake meme coin, which burst onto the scene with a purpose: to combine internet culture with real-world impact. When Neiro launched on Ethereum during the New Moon on August 4th, 2024, the crypto community took notice. Even Vitalik Buterin himself gave the project his nod of approval, marking only the second time he has publicly supported a meme coin (the first being SHIB). His $500,000 donation to an animal welfare fund not only solidified Neiro’s credibility but also showcased its commitment to making a difference. With the original developer long gone, the community stepped up to take the reins, making Neiro a 100% community-owned project. This transparency and collective spirit have turned it into a meme coin with a heart, backed by donations to shelters and other charitable initiatives. But here’s the kicker: if you missed out on Neiro’s launch, you’ve likely missed its biggest gains. Early adopters are already reaping rewards, and unless you’re comfortable buying in at higher prices, the train may have left the station. BTFD Coin: Don’t Miss This One Too If Neiro has you feeling that sinking “missed ICO” feeling, don’t despair. There’s another meme coin making waves right now: BTFD Coin (short for “Buy the Dip”). It’s bold, it’s brash, and it’s built for those who love turning market chaos into opportunities. Currently in its 12th presale stage, BTFD Coin is proving that it’s not just a cheeky name—it’s a serious contender in the meme coin world. Here’s the latest scoop: Current Price: $0.00013 Funds Raised: Over $4.2 million, including $1M in under 10 days and $2.5M within 14 days of its presale launch. Community Strength: Over 6,000 holders have already joined the Bulls Squad. Coins Sold: More than 57 billion BTFD Coins have been snapped up by eager investors. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. The project combines 90% APY staking rewards, an exciting Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , and a dedicated community of Bulls driving its momentum. And unlike some meme coins, BTFD Coin is built with longevity in mind, featuring locked liquidity and a vested token distribution to ensure stability. Investment Example: Don’t Let This One Slip By Let’s break down the numbers to see what’s on the table if you act now. At the current presale price of $0.00013, a $900 investment would secure you 6,923,077 BTFD Coins. Now imagine this: if the coin reaches its predicted post-launch value of $0.0006—a realistic target given the buzz surrounding it—your $900 investment could grow to a whopping $4,153.85. That’s a potential 360% return on your money. The presale is moving fast, so the clock is ticking. Don’t let this be another missed opportunity. Lessons from Neiro: Don’t Wait for the Moon to Strike Twice If there’s one thing Neiro’s rise has taught us, it’s that timing is everything in crypto. Those who got in early are now sitting pretty, while the rest of us are left wondering, What if? Neiro’s story isn’t just inspiring—it’s a reminder of what the meme coin space is all about: community, culture, and a little bit of chaos. And while it’s still a strong contender, the best time to invest in Neiro was yesterday. The second-best time? Well, maybe not today if you’re looking for explosive growth. This is where BTFD Coin steps in. With its presale still underway, it offers something Neiro can’t anymore: a chance to get in early and ride the wave from the ground floor. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let FOMO Win Again The crypto world is full of “what ifs” and “if onlys.” If you missed Neiro’s launch and its early gains, it’s easy to feel like you’ve missed your shot. But here’s the thing: the next big opportunity is always just around the corner. BTFD Coin’s presale is that opportunity. With its unique combination of staking rewards, a P2E game, and a strong community, it’s positioned to be the next big wave in the meme coin world. But presales don’t last forever, and neither do low prices. Don’t let BTFD Coin be another Neiro—a coin you regret not jumping on while you had the chance. Act now, join the Bulls Squad, and ride this wave to the moon.

ETH is down over 7% and is showing bearish signs below the $3,550 level. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,680 zone. The price is trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it fails to stay above the $3,650 support zone. Ethereum Price Drops Below $3,650 Ethereum price struggled to start a fresh increase above the $3,680 level and extended losses like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $3,650 level and dived below $3,600. It even dived below $3,550 and spiked below the $3,420 level. A low was formed at $3,324 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,510 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,105 swing high to the $3,324 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,650 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $3,715 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,105 swing high to the $3,324 low. A clear move above the $3,715 resistance might send the price toward the $3,800 resistance. An upside break above the $3,800 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,880 resistance zone or even $4,000. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,320 zone. A clear move below the $3,320 support might push the price toward the $3,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050.

Last week, Bitcoin spot ETF inflows skyrocketed to $2.17 billion in just five days, highlighting growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, XRP’s market holds potential bullish moves as its price hovers near critical levels, attracting attention. Among these trends, the spotlight rests firmly on one standout project: BlockDAG (BDAG) . This Layer-1 blockchain contender has become a favorite among enthusiasts and developers, thanks to its groundbreaking Whitepaper V3 . The paper introduces key innovations addressing scalability and security issues. With daily inflows exceeding $5 million and presale figures crossing $169 million, BlockDAG has set the bar high. Its GHOSTDAG protocol is a game-changer, offering unmatched transaction speed and security. This solidifies its position as a must-watch crypto for those focused on long-term potential. Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflows Soar to $2.17 Billion According to data shared by @WuBlockchain, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $2.17 billion over five consecutive trading days. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was the leading contributor, with $1.51 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which brought in $598 million. These ETFs now account for 5.71% of Bitcoin’s total market cap, signaling their growing importance. However, there are mixed signals. Grayscale’s GBTC witnessed $221 million in outflows, reflecting a shift in preferences. Experts also warn that Bitcoin spot ETFs could amplify market volatility, creating challenges for smaller players. Despite these concerns, institutional interest remains strong, underscoring Bitcoin’s prominence in the crypto ecosystem. XRP’s Road to $2.70: Hope with Hurdles XRP continues to consolidate near $0.50, with bulls targeting a breakout to $2.70. The optimism stems from growing legal clarity and increased institutional attention. XRP’s unique utility in cross-border transactions keeps it on traders’ watchlists as a promising opportunity. That said, resistance at $0.55 has slowed momentum, and analysts caution against possible dips if this barrier isn’t broken. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties, while improving, still hover over XRP’s broader adoption prospects. Despite these hurdles, the market remains optimistic, positioning XRP as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. BlockDAG Presale Rockets to $169M Milestone! BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3 is reshaping the Layer-1 blockchain space with features designed to solve industry-wide challenges. Its GHOSTDAG protocol enables simultaneous block creation, ensuring faster transactions and greater scalability while mitigating risks like double-spending and 51% attacks. The whitepaper’s vision includes EVM compatibility, which simplifies deploying Ethereum-based dApps on BlockDAG’s network. Future updates, such as cross-chain bridging, are also in the pipeline, unlocking interoperability that could drive significant ecosystem growth. This innovation has captivated developers, traders, and miners alike. The presale momentum is proof of its rising popularity. BlockDAG’s daily inflows exceed $5 million, and total sales have surpassed $169 million. More than 17.3 billion coins have already been sold, with prices surging from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0234 in the current batch 26. Early supporters have seen an impressive 2240% surge. Meanwhile, over $5.9 million in miner sales have been recorded, with nearly 15,000 miners sold. As more batches sell out quickly, the presale is moving closer to its $600 million goal. With ongoing market interest and developer adoption, BlockDAG is positioned for exponential growth. For those exploring promising blockchain solutions, this could be a pivotal moment to engage with one of the most talked-about projects in crypto. Closing Thoughts: BlockDAG Leads the Way While Bitcoin spot ETFs captured $2.17 billion in inflows and XRP traders eye a potential rise to $2.70, BlockDAG continues to dominate headlines. Its Whitepaper V3 has solidified its position as a leader in addressing blockchain’s pressing issues. With daily inflows surpassing $5 million and a record-breaking $169 million presale, BlockDAG is creating ripples across the industry. As its presale approaches new milestones, BlockDAG remains a top contender for those seeking transformative blockchain projects.

These aren’t your typical crypto investments. They combine spot Bitcoin and Ethereum into one package, making it easier—and maybe even safer—for people to invest in the two biggest digital currencies at once. SEC has *approved* both the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF & Franklin Crypto Index ETF… Will initially hold both btc & eth. pic.twitter.com/5GUhhhXL7y — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 19, 2024 Bitcoin Meets Ethereum in a Balanced Package There are so many crypto ETFs running already, so what is so special about these two? Instead of focusing on just Bitcoin or Ethereum, they mix both. The allocation depends on the market value of each, so investors get a well-balanced exposure. Why does this matter? It’s simple: putting everything into just one cryptocurrency can feel risky. By holding both, these ETFs spread out the risk and let you benefit from the strengths of each. For anyone who finds the idea of buying Bitcoin or Ethereum directly too overwhelming, these ETFs could be the answer. They simplify the process, making crypto investments more accessible to regular people. A Big Step for Crypto Investing The SEC’s decision to approve these ETFs shows that regulators are starting to take the crypto market seriously. This is a major milestone not just for the crypto space but for SEC as well. So why did these ETFs get approved? A key reason is the strong connection between Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and their spot prices. This link helps keep things stable and reduces the chances of manipulation, which is a big win for investors. These ETFs also follow strict guidelines to protect investors. They’re tied to agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to monitor trading activity and keep everything above board. The SEC isn’t just handing out approvals—they’ve made sure these ETFs meet high standards for security and transparency. What’s Next ? This approval could open the door for even more creative investment options in the future. By combining Bitcoin and Ethereum, these ETFs simplify the process of getting into crypto. They remove the hassle of managing multiple wallets or worrying about buying and storing digital assets directly. And this could just be the start. Other cryptocurrencies might join similar ETFs down the road. For now, though, these Bitcoin-Ethereum combos are a big step forward. If you’ve been waiting for a way to explore crypto without all the complications, this could be exactly what you’ve been looking for.",News|Bitcoin ETF|Ethereum ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 03:27:36
37866539,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52650,1734665328,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,What Will Replace Betting Sponsorships As The Most Common Football Sponsorship?,https://timestabloid.com/what-will-replace-betting-sponsorships-as-the-most-common-football-sponsorship/,"For those who don’t know, starting from the 2026/27 Premier League season, betting sponsors will no longer be allowed as the front sport on a kit. This has been a long-form debate among football fans as the promotion of betting, as heavy as it is in football, has been perceived as a negative. This is obviously based on the negative connotations of betting as a whole and with football and the Premier League being the biggest sport in the world, having a constant betting reminder on kits in front of young fans, people of religion and people who have a negative relationship with betting, isn’t the best sign and isn’t as marketable as the Premier League wants to be. As we move forward, the betting sponsorships will be (slightly) removed from the game we love. We say slightly because the kits themselves cannot have betting sponsorships on the front, but, the betting sponsors on the sleeves and with the kits themselves will still be allowed. So overall, the change is fairly small. In the wake of these sponsorships being banned, we turn to the question: instead of Premier League betting sites or betting sites as a whole being the sponsorships, who will take over as the most used sponsor for these Premier League clubs? Cryptocurrency I think when we look at the similarities between crypto and betting, there is a huge overlap between the two. Crypto is a long-term financial investment whereas betting is a short-term and more risky version of the same thing. The reason why betting sponsors are so common is because the sports betting industry is so lucrative for the companies and the teams they sponsor. Crypto is daily similar, the money in crypto is huge and cryptocurrencies will be looking at premier league clubs as a form of marketing to get their name out there. If more people are investing in crypto, there is more money to be made and that is the goal behind every sponsorship. As well as this, there are already links between crypto and football, with certain crypto sites looking to the football industry and its fans with football-themed coins, as well as teams like Manchester City, having delved into the crypto sponsorship market already. Technology Sponsors We understand that this point is incredibly vague, but the technology is one of the biggest powerhouses in the entire world. Not only is the industry growing and changing every single day, but it also is financially the biggest industry in the world. Because technology is forever changing and billions of dollars are being invested each year, the finances are perfect for Premier League clubs. Being a sponsor on one of the biggest teams in the world’s shirts is enough marketing and exposure for years to come and with these sponsorships usually being locked deals for years and years, these companies will be licking their lips. Car Sponsors We have already seen car sponsorships throughout the years in the Premier League, if you have a good memory, you will remember Manchester United’s Chevrolet sponsorship all those years ago and this is a good sign for the car companies as they know clubs will be interested in their sponsorship offers. The car industry is, again, financially huge and compared to the crypto industry, the car industry is a lot safer and less risky to push into fans’ faces.

Currently trading at $2.21, the XRP price has recorded a nearly 5% gain in the past 24 hours, finding strong support just below its current price. This positions the token favorably for continued upward momentum, particularly since it began an upward trend on November 5, bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump’s re-election. $10.82 Target For The XRP Price Following Historical Patterns Interestingly, analysts are increasingly optimistic about the XRP price, especially considering a key technical indicator: the Bollinger Bands. This volatility indicator, which consists of a moving average and upper and lower bands, is currently tightening on the 12-hour chart. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts Analyst Steph has noted that the last time the Bollinger Bands exhibited such a pattern, the XRP price experienced a staggering 490% price explosion. If history repeats itself, this could propel XRP to a new all-time high of $10.82, significantly surpassing its previous record of $3.40 set in January 2018, according to the analyst. Adding to the bullish sentiment, another analyst known as Javon on X (formerly Twitter) has pointed out that XRP’s last full bull cycle saw an increase of over 600%. The analyst suggests that if the XRP price performs similarly, it could rise dramatically, potentially exceeding 6,800% to reach approximately $168. This projection hinges on the price moving above the 2.414 Fibonacci Extension level, which was valued at $3,06 during the previous cycle. However, some analysts are adopting a more conservative outlook. Key Levels At $2.42 And $2.92 In Focus DarkDefender has noted a clear break on the daily chart, predicting that the XRP price could retest the $2.42 level before breaking through $2.92. Should it surpass this threshold, targets of $3.43 and $5.85 could be in sight. DarkDefender had recently targeted $2.72, which the XRP price had successfully bounced back from, reaffirming the validity of his analysis. Related Reading: 400 Billion Shiba Inu Moved: Is A SHIB Price Crash Coming? Despite differing views on the potential extent of the surge, consensus among analysts is that the XRP price is likely to reach a new all-time high in the coming months. This optimism is further strengthened by the possibility of regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. The President-elect has promised a new regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States, which could pave the way for resolving the prolonged legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which previously stifled the XRP price, leading to a lengthy period of consolidation.

Although the SEC’s operations may be affected, the agency will prioritize its main mission of overseeing market activities and protecting investors, especially during uncertain times.

Truly, Jeremy pic.twitter.com/FDcSK2ejag — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) December 19, 2024 What Happens Next if The SEC is Shutdown? If the government shuts down, the SEC will have limited activities because federal agencies can’t operate without funding, except for a few things like protecting property. Companies trying to raise money or handle securities transactions should know that the SEC’s Corporation Finance staff won’t be available to approve registration statements, offering statements, or process those filings. The SEC won’t process filings that need review, like registration statements or tender offers. Companies won’t get feedback on their filings, and delays will happen once the shutdown ends. The SEC won’t answer questions or handle requests for exemptions or no-action letters. Gary Gensler previously announced he would retire from the SEC on January 20.

Cochran, a longstanding critic of Ripple, has reevaluated his stance, calling RLUSD Ripple’s most significant move in years. His analysis, shared through a video accompanying his tweet, outlines the unique RLUSD potential to revolutionize DeFi, Forex markets, and institutional banking. Why $RLUSD is @Ripple 's Trojan Horse for DeFi and Banking: I've been hard on XRP over the years, and almost missed why their new stablecoin would be useful, but after a deeper dive, I changed my mind and think it's probably their strongest move in years. pic.twitter.com/KW6TKqtcoD — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) December 17, 2024 RLUSD: Not Just Another Stablecoin Unlike conventional stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, RLUSD is fully regulated, bank-backed, and custodied by U.S. financial institutions. It adheres to strict compliance measures, including oversight from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple has also secured critical regulatory approvals, such as the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license, and aims to ensure RLUSD’s compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. This level of compliance distinguishes RLUSD from many existing stablecoins, aligning it with institutional needs and making it a robust tool for enterprises, banks, and financial entities. Additionally, RLUSD will be issued on Ripple’s native blockchain and Ethereum, bridging traditional financial institutions with decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Unlocking the Ripple Ecosystem Ripple has faced challenges in expanding the utility of its XRP Ledger (XRPL). While it introduced features such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and token issuance formats, adoption has been limited. RLUSD addresses a key gap: the inability to price assets in U.S. dollars within Ripple’s ecosystem. With RLUSD, institutional participants can now price Real-World Assets (RWAs), Forex trades, and other financial instruments directly in USD, enhancing the appeal of Ripple’s native AMM functionalities. Moreover, RLUSD opens pathways for Ripple to incentivize XRP liquidity through USD-XRP trading pairs. By bringing liquidity on-chain, Ripple can capture yield opportunities currently benefiting centralized exchanges. This strategic shift could bolster XRP’s ecosystem by redistributing value to the network and its participants. A Trojan Horse for Institutional Markets Cochran emphasizes that RLUSD’s greatest potential lies in its appeal to institutional markets, particularly Forex settlement and debt issuance. The Forex market handles trillions of dollars in daily transactions, often through outdated and fragmented banking systems. Ripple’s ability to offer a compliant, yield-bearing, USD-backed stablecoin could streamline these processes and position Ripple as a leading alternative settlement network. RLUSD’s integration with programmability upgrades—such as Hooks and a forthcoming Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain—further solidifies its utility. These enhancements will enable DeFi applications, creating opportunities for more sophisticated financial products on Ripple’s blockchain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Stablecoin Market Opportunity Cochran also highlights the growing stablecoin market, currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). With over $140 billion in circulation, stablecoins generate substantial yields for their issuers. RLUSD’s entry into this market, particularly in the EU where Tether lacks regulatory approval, could position Ripple as a major player. If Ripple captures a significant share of this market, it stands to generate billions in annual yield revenue, which could be reinvested into its ecosystem. A Path Forward for Ripple RLUSD represents a pivotal step in Ripple’s long-term vision of bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. By addressing regulatory concerns, enhancing ecosystem programmability, and tapping into institutional markets, Ripple strategically positions itself to capture value across multiple financial sectors. Cochran concludes that while Ripple’s early ambitions of competing with SWIFT remain challenging, RLUSD’s potential to unlock trillions in value from Forex settlement, debt instruments, and RWAs could make previously speculative price predictions for XRP more realistic.

This latest purchase has pushed the company’s total reserves to over 10,096 BTC, valued at more than $1 billion at current market prices. Hut 8 Bitcoin Reserves Top $1 Billion The Miami-headquartered cryptocurrency mining firm continues to increase its Bitcoin reserves, undeterred by BTC’s recent price surges. In its latest announcement, Hut 8 revealed the purchase of approximately 990 BTC for $100 million, at an average price of $101,710 per Bitcoin. Related Reading: Metaplanet To Expand Bitcoin Holdings With $11.3 Million Bond Sale This acquisition has propelled Hut 8’s total BTC holdings to over $1 billion, with the coins acquired at an average cost of $24,485 per Bitcoin. The move reflects the company’s strategy of combining low-cost BTC production with what it views as strategic market buys to maximize returns and strengthen its reserve assets. Notably, Hut 8’s recent purchase positions it among the top 10 largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. MicroStrategy remains the leader on this list, holding more than 250,000 BTC on its balance sheet. Commenting, Asher Genoot, CEO, Hut 8, said: We believe deeply in our operating business and that building a strategic Bitcoin reserve will fortify our financial position as we pursue large-scale growth initiatives across power and digital infrastructure. Additionally, as we scale operations and extend our cost advantage in Bitcoin production, we anticipate that the flywheel effect will enable us to grow our holdings organically at a significant discount to market prices, strengthening the yield of our reserve strategy. Echoing these sentiments, Hut 8 CFO, Sean Glennan explained that making BTC a reserve asset was a key component of the company’s strategy to deliver “superior returns” to shareholders through strategic treasury management. He added that the company is open to deploying its BTC reserve to support business objectives, such as upgrading its mining fleet. Earlier this month, Hut 8 unveiled a massive $750 million initiative aimed at general corporate objectives, debt repayment, and bolstering its Bitcoin reserve. On a year-to-date basis, Hut 8’s stock has surged by over 102%, trading at $27.11 at the time of writing. 4 Mining Firms Among Top 10 Corporate BTC Holders While companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block, and Coinbase are well-known among the top corporate Bitcoin holders, four Bitcoin mining firms also feature on this prestigious list, namely, Marathon Digital Holdings, Hut 8, Riot Blockchain, and CleanSpark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Grows As Rumble Unveils $20 Million BTC Treasury Strategy Last year, Riot Blockchain reported a significant increase in its BTC holdings. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin mining firm holds a total of 8,490 BTC. Similarly, earlier this month, Marathon Digital Holdings purchased another 703 BTC to increase its total reserves to 34,794 BTC. This move aligns with Marathon CEO’s previous statement that institutions are “waiting to buy up” Bitcoin. In October, CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford predicted that BTC may peak around $200,000 in the next 18 months. At press time, BTC trades at $100,543, down 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

This statement shocked many, given the stark price differences between XRP ($2.51) and BTC ($104,085). How could XRP be better than BTC? According to Vitalik, XRP’s technological advantages, such as faster transaction speeds and lower fees, make it better than BTC. He claims these features make XRP better suited for real-world applications than BTC. Amid this heated discussion on Vitalik Buterin’s comments, a Ripple rival, RCO Finance (RCOF), is making waves with its innovative features and real-world utility. Analysts project this cutting-edge project could surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025, making it a top pick for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Why Vitalik Buterin Says XRP Is Better Than Bitcoin Vitalik Buterin’s avid endorsement of Ripple’s native token, XRP, highlights its undervalued utility, making it a more innovative altcoin than Bitcoin. Here are some of the advantages XRP has over BTC. Ripple’s XRP offers faster transaction speed at lower fees. While Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) model is secure, it is notoriously slow and expensive. However, Ripple’s XRP offers near-instant transactions at low fees, making it more efficient, especially for everyday use. This utility has led to XRP’s integration into global financial networks, especially for cross-border payments. According to Vitalik Buterin, this has made it a key player in traditional institutions’ growing adoption of blockchain technology. This extends its value past speculative trading, offering more tangible value in the financial sector. Bitcoin’s energy-intensive PoW mining process is a cause of concern because of its environmental impact. This greatly limits its scalability, causing investors and developers alike to look for more energy-efficient options like XRP, which aligns with Vitalik Buterin’s outlook that the former is better than BTC. RCO Finance: The Ripple Rival Ready for a 12,050% Surge Similar to XRP, RCO Finance’s unique value proposition makes it a better investment. Backed by its innovative AI technology and real-world utility, RCOF is steadily making a name for itself and showing why it’s poised to surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025. At its core, RCO Finance leverages advanced AI tools to empower users with data-driven insights and personalized investment strategies.

This versatility streamlines the investing process, making it easier for users to level up and diversify their portfolios. RCOF’s blockchain infrastructure is designed to be compatible with multiple chains, enhancing flexibility and accessibility. This interoperability positions it as a versatile asset in the evolving crypto landscape.

This shows that RCOF adheres to industry standards, reassuring users that their assets and data are safe. Secure Your Place Before RCOF Takes Off Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement of utility-driven projects like XRP highlights the market’s shift toward practical applications and innovation.

XRP has been trading within a range of approximately $2.20 to $2.70 over the past few days, showing limited movement on the larger time frames. The altcoin has recently experienced a slight pullback, which has led to the invalidation of a previous bullish breakout pattern. While the price has not changed significantly, it remains within a potential bull market structure. The strong resistance level is around $2.90 to $3, where selling pressure has consistently been observed. On the lower end, there is support near $2, which has been tested multiple times and serves as the lower boundary of XRP’s current trading range. If the price breaks below $2, it may hint further downside. Understanding The Support and Resistance Levels The breakout had been confirmed at around $2.35, but the price closed below this level, invalidating the pattern and suggesting that further upside momentum is unlikely in the near term. The immediate support level in the short term is around $2.30 to $2.31, which is currently holding, but if it breaks, the next support lies around $2.23, with further downside possible towards the $2 level. It will also most likely drop to $1.90. After reaching $1.90, the key question is whether XRP can hold that level. If it breaks $1.90, the market will enter a bear phase, and the bullish trend will be over. However, that hasn’t happened yet, so it’s too early to make any conclusions. However, if XRP holds $2.30, it could rise to $2.60. If it breaks above $2.60, we can consider $3 as the next target.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 04:07:45

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 04:24:00

Network fees for DOGE spiked 330% year-over-year in November but have declined for nearly five weeks, indicating reduced usage. Daily active addresses hit over 1 million in mid-November but have since returned to normal levels, showing a drop in activity. Despite declines in fees and active addresses, DOGE's price remains near recent highs, suggesting a disconnect between usage and price. In the two months since I last covered Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) for Seeking Alpha, crypto's oldest 'memecoin' has enjoyed quite the rocket ship ride. Data by YCharts After ripping higher by over 240% in a matter of just a few weeks, I suspect the gains have been had in DOGE. In this update, we'll revisit some of the metrics and indicators I shared in my previous article, look at the technical setup for DOGE, and assess the broader 'memecoin' segment of the market. Revisiting Network Metrics When I wrote This Dog Wants To Run in late-October, there were several very specific on-chain metrics that I felt offered a favorable short-term setup to DOGE bulls. There is no question that we've seen network fees take off for DOGE in the last two months: Dogecoin (Token Terminal) Fees surpassed $552k in November. Which was about a 330% year-over-year gain over November 2023. To be clear, while this is a significant surge for Dogecoin, it's far less than what larger chains like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) typically do for monthly fees. More importantly, following the initial spike in fees in November, the trend in daily fees has been down for close to five weeks. This is indicative of declining usage. Recall what my leading indicator was for the expected rally in DOGE back in October: What I find interesting about this chart is over the last 5 years we've generally seen starts and peaks in active addresses lead price. In early 2021 active address growth lead coin price between March and May. It happened again between November 2023 and March 2024. The same appears to be happening again with Dogecoin active addresses grinding higher by about 20% starting at the beginning of September. To say that daily active addresses exploded following that article would be an understatement: Dogecoin (CoinMetrics) In mid-November, there was a five-day period when the chain had over 1 million DAAs each day. That has never happened on Dogecoin before. The problem is, activity has since fallen right back to normal levels, and yet price remains elevated. The big difference between this active address spike and the one that preceded it in the Spring is DAAs didn't lead price, price led usage. My general view is that it's more indicative of fundamental weakness than strength. But to recap, we now have declines in fees, declines in active addresses, and prices still holding closer to recent highs despite the drops in chain usage. I suspect the price will follow everything else lower. Technicals In October, I shared my technical thoughts on the DOGE price and shared what, I felt, was a clear breakout in a downward diagonal resistance trend line. I see a different signal in the chart now: DOGE (TrendSpider) This is a very different setup following what has been a magnificent rally since the end of October. But traders/investors should not overlook some of the warning signs on this chart. First, DOGE has now re-entered what is essentially a massive air-pocket between 20 cents and 36 cents. There was very little actual price discovery on the way up, and I suspect the same will be true on the way down. But that's admittedly just a guess. The bigger issues are the massive bearish divergences between November 13th and December 9th. The 200-day moving average - currently sitting at 17 cents, shows substantial downside risk if the coin were simply to revisit previous levels. Finally, DOGE isn't even technically oversold yet at a 14-day RSI of 32. This could grind much lower before any 'dead cat' bounce. DOGE/BTC Weekly (TrendSpider) It wasn't just the DOGE/USD chart where we had breakouts back in October. The DOGE/BTC chart also looked quite bullish for Dogecoin when I wrote my last DOGE piece. That too looks exhausted after the sizable move higher. In October, I felt 253 sats per DOGE was a fitting price target. DOGE smashed through that level and went all the way to 492 sats before falling back below 400. At minimum, I believe the market will take DOGE back to 250 sats though I certainly wouldn't rule out another 'overshoot' of that target to the downside since we had one to the upside. Memes and DOGE For me, one of the biggest reasons why DOGE has very limited upside from here (if any) is because there is now too much competition for liquidity in the memecoin segment. With the proliferation of memecoins in the cryptocurrency market, eight of the top hundred cryptocurrencies by market cap are memecoins - and five of those eight memecoins are dog-related. Memecoins (CoinMarketCap) Memecoins actually account for $91.5 billion of the $3.3 trillion total cryptocurrency market cap. Memecoins have been so popular, in part, due to platforms like pump.fun, that Artemis tracks memecoins as an industry segment in its benchmark index: YTD Crypto Benchmark Index (Artemis) At one point in December, the memecoin segment was up almost 400% year to date. Now at just 200% year to date, memecoins have given back almost half their 2024 gains in just a couple of weeks, and yet they're still leading the industry as a category in terms of year to date gains. There is a significant amount of 'extrinsic value' that is potentially going to get unwound in this market, and DOGE will not be immune from that. Closing Thoughts As has occasionally been the case through the existence of the coin, DOGE was a terrific trade back in October. However, the setup is very different now. The fundamental story has deteriorated, with fees and active addresses in clear decline since the November pops. The technical story looks rough in my estimation, judging by the bearish divergences on the DOGE/USD daily chart and the potential weakness against BTC that can be expected on the DOGE/BTC weekly chart. But the bottom line in my view is the harder they come, the harder they fall. Memecoins have owned the year as a segment, judging by percentage appreciation. I suspect 2025 is going to be very different than 2024. If you made bank on this DOGE run, I'd take the win.",DOGE-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-20 04:26:00

The agreement, which needs the approval of the IMF Executive Board, aims to support El Salvador’s reform agenda, boost fiscal and external sustainability, and create conditions for stronger, inclusive growth. IMF Loan Agreement with El Salvador According to the official press release , the program is expected to catalyze additional financial support from the World Bank and regional development banks, bringing the total financing package to over $3.5 billion during the program period. As part of El Salvador’s $1.4 billion deal with the IMF, the government has agreed to scale back its ambitious Bitcoin policies to address financial stability concerns. Legal reforms will make Bitcoin usage optional for private businesses, removing the mandate that had been in place since the cryptocurrency was adopted as legal tender in 2021. Meanwhile, for the public sector, Bitcoin-related activities will be strictly limited, with the government no longer accepting BTC for tax payments. Additionally, the state-run Chivo wallet, which facilitated Bitcoin transactions for citizens, will see its government involvement gradually phased out. These measures are intended to mitigate risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility and safeguard financial integrity, as per IMF’s statement. The program also includes improved transparency, regulation, and oversight of digital assets to protect consumers and investors while maintaining financial stability. By taking a step back from its cryptocurrency experiment, the Salvadoran government aims to rebuild confidence in its broader fiscal policies and align with IMF recommendations, a move expected to attract further international financial support and stabilize the economy. “IMF staff thank the Salvadorean authorities for the excellent collaboration and candid dialogue over the past months in the development of their economic reform program aimed at continuing to improve the prosperity of El Salvador and all of its people.” Criticisms President Nayib Bukele has staunchly advocated for Bitcoin as a key part of his administration’s economic strategy, investing heavily in the cryptocurrency to promote financial autonomy. Despite Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000, yielding a whopping 123.67% return on the government’s $269.7 million investment, the IMF’s conditions have compelled El Salvador to alter its BTC strategy. Critics argued that Bukele has now surrendered to the demands of global financial powers. As one financial analyst noted , Bukele’s decision to take a $3.5 billion loan from the IMF has led to accusations of selling out, calling it an ironic shift for someone who once criticized fiat currency.

Meme coins are having a subpar performance and their upside has likely reached a peak after strong November gains. Both Dogecoin and Dogwifhat are down on a weekly and daily basis at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the Rollblock (RBLK) presale continues to gather momentum, with $7.3 million raised so far. The pioneering GambleFi protocol aspires to disrupt a $450 billion industry with a decentralized solution to return profits to players and investors instead of centralized insiders. Whales Fear Missing Out On Rollblock One reason large investors are moving away from meme tokens to presales like Rollblock is the market use case. Rollblock has a clear market proposition tackling centralized gambling, which retains all of the profits. It offers over 7,000 gaming opportunities for players and recently added a lucrative sports betting feature. All of this is supported by Rollblock’s revenue share model. Every week, Rollblock will use 30% of revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the market. 60% of the purchased tokens are burned to promote price appreciation. The remaining 40% are used in the form of staking rewards. Token holders can earn up to 30% APY via staking alone. The redistribution of earnings is a huge incentive to players, who will also benefit from instant crypto deposits. Rollblock is 100% licensed and verified and uses blockchain technology to make transactions irrefutable. The presale offers a limited-time 20% token bonus and the coin already retails at a discount. Currently priced at $0.0415, the RBLK token will appreciate to $0.047 in the next round. In total, analysts predict a 720% increase from the start to the end of the presale, with early investors already seeing huge returns. Dogecoin Disappoints Token Holders News about Elon Musk’s appointment as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initially helped to increase the price of Dogecoin. Selling for $0.10 in early November, Dogecoin shot to $0.42 in mid-December, a 4x increase. But it is unlikely to rise much further and is down 3% over the past week. Such a large November rally will be hard to sustain without a retracement, and Dogecoin currently trades at $0.39, about 60% of its ATH. Moving forward, DOGE’s upside potential remains limited compared to other coins. Nonetheless, there are some positive indicators. Meme coins are known to lag a little when it comes to Bitcoin-led rallies. Moreover, 5.8 million Dogecoin have been recently reactivated, which could have a positive price impact. Dogwifhat Drops 14% In 7 Days Down 14% last week and 8% in 24 hours, Dogwifhat is faring even more poorly than Dogecoin. Dogwifhat does not have Elon Musk’s support or the first-mover effect of Dogecoin. This Dogwifhat price decline occurred despite positive news for the ecosystem, including WIF/USDT trading on the Binance US exchange on December 11th. In other bearish news for Dowwifhat, a whale offloaded $3.4 million worth of tokens to Coinbase last week. Acquired nearly a year before, the whale recorded an impressive 9x profit, purchasing the tokens for only $390,000. With the current retracement in the altcoin market, it seems to have been a timely move. Rollblock Going Viral As Top Altcoin Alternative With volatility in the crypto markets, whales are choosing to migrate to presales that offer both early bird pricing and better price potential. Analysts predict Rollblock to 100x or more after the presale completes in early 2025 and neither Dogwifhat nor Dogecoin can offer comparable returns.

Offering ROIs much above its rivals, the revolutionary decentralized exchange Lunex Network (LNEX) is generating great investment interest thanks to its unmatched security, privacy, and cross-chain capabilities. Could this under-the-radar token outperform top crypto coins like BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL) as analysts estimate exponential increases for LNEX in this bull cycle? Read on to find out why experts think Lunex Network might be the most rewarding investment choice this cycle. Lunex Network (LNEX) Offers Secure and Anonymous Trading Providing a rare mix of security, anonymity, and cross-chain efficiency, Lunex Network distinguishes itself in the competitive decentralized exchange (DEX) sector. Lunex Network guarantees top-tier security by means of a comprehensive audit by SOLIDProof , therefore ensuring that its smart contracts are free from major flaws. Maintaining some of the lowest transaction fees in the industry, Lunex Network lets users immediately trade over 50,000 coins across more than 40 blockchains. Lunex Network also gives Web3 developers access to 65+ RPC nodes, therefore providing a flexible toolkit for growth inside the ecosystem. Lunex Network provides a safe, anonymous platform that safeguards user data while enabling flawless crypto transactions for privacy-conscious traders wishing to evade invasive KYC processes. For investors, Lunex Network offers a promising prospect given that LNEX is priced at just $0.0046 in the presale. Meanwhile, those who bought LNEX at $0.0012 have already achieved a 283% ROI and analysts project an additional 300% surge before the presale ends. BNB (BNB) Displays Strong Bullish Momentum Over the past week, the BNB price has barely increased by 2% . The BNB price is currently ranging between $738 and $696. Driven by BNB’s (BNB) outstanding performance over the previous month, the community is overwhelmingly optimistic. The altcoin soared by more than 15% during this period, according to the BNB price chart, and on December 4 it reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $793. Although BNB (BNB) has already dropped by 10% from this height, experts see this as a reasonable pullback with hopes for a rally to reach $800 before the year ends. Strong technical indicators like the MACD, Awesome Oscillator, and Moving Averages—all of which point to ongoing purchasing pressure on the BNB price chart—help to support the positive outlook for the altcoin. Additionally, analysts are forecasting BNB (BNB) to reach the much-expected $1,000 milestone in this cycle. Solana (SOL) Bulls Set Eyes on a $300 Breakout Since it declined over 5% in the past week and more than 10% over the past month, the Solana price has lately shown negative days. The Solana price has been fluctuating between $235 and $210 among these falls. Holders are worried about this bearish behavior, but some hope was rebuilt following the bullish rejection on the Solana price chart at the $205 support level. Meanwhile, several analysts expect a retest of Solana’s all-time high (ATH) before the year ends. Strong technical signals support the argument for a possible comeback. The MACD and Moving Averages both provide a purchasing signal on the Solana price chart, suggesting that the altcoin may soon rally once more. The prospect of a breakout to the $300 level before the year ends excites investors especially as Solana (SOL) starts to show indications of rebuilding bullish momentum. One of the bullish patterns observed is how Solana (SOL) has seen multiple rejections around the $220 to $204 support zone. Lunex Network Set To Outshine BNB and Solana While Solana (SOL) eyes a $300 breakthrough and BNB (BNB) aims for new highs, Lunex Network (LNEX) is quietly transforming decentralized trading—and early investors are benefiting. Lunex Network is redefining the DeFi space with its unsurpassed security, anonymity, and cross-chain adaptability. Unlike BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL), LNEX promises early exponential gains as analysts estimate a startling 1,800% increase in the next few months when the token launches on several Tier-1 exchanges.

37868137,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630828,1734670231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37868137.jpeg,Blockstream’s Adam Back defends BlackRock ad that questioned Bitcoin’s 21M cap,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/adam-back-defends-blackrock-ad/,"Blockstream CEO and Hashcash inventor Adam Back has come to the defense of BlackRock after the company’s recent Bitcoin ad triggered an outrage across the crypto community. It featured a small but explosive disclaimer: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” For Bitcoiners, the Bitcoin ad was a shot at the heart of what the asset stands for. Back, though, has downplayed the controversy. He explained that the disclaimer was a legal protection inserted by BlackRock’s lawyers, not a statement of intent. “Obviously, their lawyers made them write that as they sell investment products and don’t have control,” Back said. But for a community allergic to corporate meddling, his words did little to extinguish the fire. Bitcoiners can’t trust BlackRock There have already been concerns of forceful centralization by what is largely believed to be the most powerful company on the planet. X users speculated that BlackRock might be preparing to influence the Bitcoin protocol. One even called the ad “very spooky.” The ad’s timing only added to the suspicion. BlackRock manages over 524,000 Bitcoin worth $53 billion through its exchange-traded fund (ETF), making it the largest institutional player in the market. For Bitcoin’s true believers, such concentrated influence is unnerving. Critics outside the Bitcoin bubble joined in. Longtime Bitcoin antagonist Peter Schiff wasted no time tearing into the ad, calling it packed with falsehoods and labeling Wall Street’s embrace of Bitcoin as disingenuous. And though his words may not carry weight with Bitcoiners, they amplified the outrage surrounding the ad. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is the bedrock of its value proposition. It’s what sets it apart from inflation-prone fiat currencies. The cap is hard-coded into Bitcoin’s design, making it impossible to change without consensus. Even so, the mere suggestion of altering it has always been a taboo topic. Old battles with new players The ad is dragging people back to the Blocksize War, that hostile beef in the Bitcoin community from 2015 to 2017. The whole argument was about whether Bitcoin’s block size should be increased to make transactions faster and cheaper. On one side were the “big blockers,” who pushed for larger block sizes to scale Bitcoin as a payment system. On the other were the “small blockers,” who argued that increasing the block size would centralize the network by making it harder for individuals to run nodes. The conflict reached a boiling point with the New York Agreement in 2017 proposal, which wanted to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) while also doubling the block size. Some folks saw it as an attempt by corporations to hijack Bitcoin, and a grassroots movement known as the User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) forced SegWit activation without miner approval. The fallout though led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork that adopted larger block sizes. Its effects are still felt to this day.

It also added that the collaboration aims to improve the efficiency of governmental transactions while promoting fiscal responsibility. This alliance represents an important step toward leveraging the potential of digital currencies to foster sustainable economic growth, stability, and financial inclusion, noted Ramaswamy.

Bitcoin shot up strongly after Donald Trump’s election victory, leading to a price above $100,000. According to the report by Financial Times, the data from Hedge Fund Research shows that hedge funds that used crypto strategies shared a gain of 46% in November, bringing total yearly gains for the niche to 76%. Compared to the rest of the hedge fund industry, these returns were very strong in what would otherwise be a 10% average win. Crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital was among the big winners The rally accelerated since Trump’s election win in November and boosted the value of the largest digital asset, Bitcoin. Brevan Howard and Galaxy Digital were among the big winners. The surge also pushed up the value of smaller digital tokens. This year, bitcoin has surged 130% to around $100,000, driving the total market value for major cryptocurrencies to rise by $1.8 trillion to $3.5 trillion. But this week, the market declined slightly as the Federal Reserve signaled it would boost interest rates less than anticipated next year, which pummels high-risk assets.

He suggests that this anticipated surge could make XRP holders some of the wealthiest investors in the market. In recent months, XRP has gained significant attention due to its impressive price movements. Notably, the cryptocurrency rose from $0.51 at the start of November to $2.90 by December 3, representing a staggering 464% increase within a single month. While XRP faced a pullback after this peak, consolidating between $2 and $2.60 for two weeks, Steph maintains that an even larger rally may be on the horizon. Bollinger Bands Indicate Potential Breakout Steph’s analysis emphasizes the importance of key technical indicators, including the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour chart. These bands, which measure market volatility, are currently widening—a signal often associated with significant price movements. He noted that in November, a similar expansion of the Bollinger Bands preceded a 132% surge in XRP’s price. Additionally, past instances of this pattern have led to rallies of 53% and 120%. Based on the current expansion, Steph believes that XRP is primed for another breakout, which could further validate its bullish trajectory. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE THE RICHEST PEOPLE YOU KNOW – HERE’S WHY! pic.twitter.com/k0tc6tCAq0 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2024 Bull Flag Breakout Fuels Optimism Another bullish indicator highlighted by Steph is XRP’s breakout from a bull flag pattern on the daily chart. Such breakouts are typically seen as a continuation of upward price trends after a consolidation phase. The breakout has been confirmed by multiple daily closes above a critical long-term resistance level. As of now, XRP has maintained a position above the crucial support level of $2.33, as it currently trades at $2.35. Steph cautioned that failing to hold above this level could challenge the bullish narrative. However, if XRP sustains its position, the market outlook remains favorable. The analyst also identified $2.60 as a significant resistance level. A daily close above this threshold would further solidify the bullish case for XRP. He has set a short-to-medium-term target of $4.90 to $5 , supported by the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) ribbons on the daily chart. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Declining Bitcoin Dominance Boosts Altcoin Market Steph also addressed the role of Bitcoin dominance, a metric that tracks Bitcoin’s market share relative to other cryptocurrencies. He observed that Bitcoin dominance has been declining after breaking below a rising wedge pattern, currently testing the breakdown level near 57%. This trend is considered favorable for altcoins like XRP. Should Bitcoin dominance continue to decline, potentially reaching the 47–50% range, it could signal the start of an altcoin season. Historically, this range has acted as strong support during July 2021 and October 2021. Such conditions could create an environment conducive to XRP achieving its $5 price target. Steph advised investors to monitor Bitcoin dominance as it approaches the 47–50% zone. A reversal from this level could mark a turning point in the market, prompting investors to consider taking profits. Nevertheless, he emphasized that XRP and other altcoins currently exhibit strong potential for growth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A recent Chainalysis report revealed a dramatic rise in crypto thefts tied to North Korean hackers, who doubled their stolen assets in 2024 to over $1.3 billion. In parallel, Chainalysis has announced its acquisition of Hexagate, a Web3 security firm, signaling a proactive shift toward preventing such exploits. North Korean Hackers Double Crypto Theft in 2024, Chainalysis Reports In a chilling revelation, analytics firm Chainalysis has disclosed that hackers tied to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) have doubled their crypto theft in 2024 compared to the previous year. The report, released on Dec. 19, outlines how North Korean cybercriminals stole over $1.3 billion worth of digital assets across 47 incidents in 2024, accounting for a staggering 61% of all crypto thefts reported globally. The findings indicate a significant escalation in the scale and frequency of DPRK-linked cyberattacks. This marks a stark contrast to 2023, during which hackers tied to the isolated nation stole approximately $660 million in cryptocurrency. Chainalysis highlighted a worrying trend: not only are DPRK's crypto attacks becoming more frequent, but the hackers are also successfully pulling off larger exploits. The report noted that in 2024, attacks involving sums between $50 million and $100 million—and even those exceeding $100 million—occurred more often than in the prior year. This pattern diverges sharply from the two preceding years, when most of the DPRK’s exploits yielded profits below $50 million. “It appears that the DPRK’s crypto attacks are becoming more frequent,” Chainalysis reported. “Notably, attacks between $50 and $100 million, and those above $100 million occurred far more frequently in 2024 than they did in 2023, suggesting that the DPRK is getting better and faster at massive exploits.” Despite North Korea’s increasing activity, the overall global crypto theft landscape showed mixed signals. Chainalysis reported that hackers globally had stolen approximately $2.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2024, marking a 21% increase compared to 2023. However, this figure is still far below the record-setting $3.7 billion in crypto stolen in 2022. The first quarter of 2024 saw decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms as the primary target for hackers. However, the second and third quarters revealed a shift, with centralized services bearing the brunt of cyberattacks. Some of the most notable incidents in 2024 include: WazirX Hack (July): Hackers compromised one of the India-based exchange’s Safe multisig wallets on Ethereum, resulting in losses of $235 million—the largest single hack of the year. BingX Hack (September): Cybercriminals targeted this crypto exchange and made away with roughly $44 million worth of tokens. North Korea’s Political Ties and Reduced Activity in H2 2024 The Chainalysis report also touched on an intriguing observation: a marked decline in DPRK-linked hacking activity in the second half of 2024. According to the analytics firm, the drop in stolen funds after July 1 was “conspicuous,” coinciding with deepening political and military ties between North Korea and Russia. However, Chainalysis cautioned against drawing direct links to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Pyongyang earlier in the year. “The decline in funds stolen by the DPRK after July 1, 2024 is clear and the timing is conspicuous,” the report stated. “But it is nevertheless important to note that this decline is not necessarily associated with Putin’s visit to Pyongyang.” Chainalysis also noted that the year-end holidays could potentially see a resurgence of attacks, as hackers often exploit the season’s operational vulnerabilities. North Korean hackers have become notorious for orchestrating some of the most significant breaches in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Their activities have not only led to massive financial losses but also drawn heightened scrutiny from US authorities. The latter frequently impose sanctions on entities linked to DPRK’s money laundering efforts, which often involve laundering stolen crypto through complex networks of mixers and intermediaries. In recent years, these cyber exploits have served as a vital financial lifeline for North Korea, funding its nuclear weapons program and bypassing stringent international sanctions. The uptick in large-scale attacks in 2024 shines the spotlight on the evolving threat posed by DPRK hackers, even as the global crypto ecosystem attempts to bolster its defenses. While North Korea’s hackers had a “very active year,” Chainalysis reported that global hacking activity in the third and fourth quarters of 2024 declined compared to the same period in 2023. This trend offers a glimmer of hope, suggesting that improved security measures and international cooperation may be starting to curb some forms of cybercrime. Nevertheless, the ongoing evolution of North Korea’s cyber capabilities is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in the digital asset space. As hackers grow more adept at breaching even the most secure platforms, the industry faces an urgent need for continuous innovation in cybersecurity. The alarming scale of North Korea’s crypto exploits in 2024 serves as a wake-up call for the cryptocurrency industry, governments, and cybersecurity firms. With 2022 still holding the dubious distinction of being the worst year for crypto hacks, the path forward must involve collaboration across all stakeholders to minimize risks and protect the burgeoning digital economy. The report’s findings also raise questions about the geopolitical dimensions of crypto crime, particularly as nation-states leverage cybercrime as a strategic tool. As 2025 approaches, the global crypto community will undoubtedly keep a close eye on the DPRK’s next moves—and the broader implications for digital asset security. Chainalysis Acquires Web3 Security Firm Hexagate to Strengthen Blockchain Security In a related development, Chainalysis has announced its acquisition of Hexagate, a Web3 security firm specializing in threat detection and mitigation. The acquisition, revealed on Dec. 19, marks a significant step forward for Chainalysis as it pivots from its traditional focus on investigations into proactive prevention within the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Founded in 2022 and headquartered in Israel, Hexagate has quickly gained recognition for its advanced Web3 security solutions. The company’s offerings include real-time threat detection and tools to safeguard digital assets, which have reportedly prevented over $1 billion in potential losses for its clients. These clients include prominent names such as Coinbase and Consensys. Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin announced the acquisition on X, signaling a bold new chapter for the company. Levin stated: “We have spent 10 years following the money. Now it’s time to prevent the money from being stolen. Welcome to the era of secure smart contracts with proper monitoring and real-time threat detection. Announcing our acquisition of Hexagate.” In a blog post accompanying the announcement, Levin emphasized Chainalysis’s evolving mission to transition from being a leader in blockchain investigations to a trailblazer in preventative security measures. He noted that expanding into Web3 security is a natural progression for the company as it seeks to protect the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem from increasingly sophisticated threats. While the announcement shows the strategic importance of Hexagate to Chainalysis’s future endeavors, many details remain undisclosed. The purchase price for Hexagate has not been revealed, and it remains unclear whether the acquisition will lead to significant changes in Hexagate’s leadership or operational structure. Chainalysis’s Shift to Prevention The acquisition of Hexagate signals a broader strategic shift for Chainalysis. Since its founding, the company has been renowned for its blockchain analytics capabilities, assisting law enforcement and regulatory agencies in tracing illicit crypto transactions. Now, it aims to tackle issues at the root by preventing theft and fraud before they occur. Levin’s leadership appears to be a driving force behind this pivot. Having taken over as CEO in October 2024 following the departure of Michael Gronager, Levin has been vocal about the company’s aspirations to expand its services and respond to the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology. Hexagate’s expertise in protecting smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms is expected to complement Chainalysis’s existing suite of blockchain analytics tools. By integrating Hexagate’s real-time monitoring and threat detection capabilities, Chainalysis aims to offer a more comprehensive solution to its clients, bridging the gap between investigation and prevention. Levin’s vision for Chainalysis’s future extends beyond technological advancements. The CEO has also speculated about potential regulatory changes under the incoming US administration. He suggested that greater clarity surrounding digital assets, including the repeal of rules like the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), could pave the way for a more secure and transparent blockchain industry.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-20 05:30:00

Experts Double Down on Rollblock",https://timestabloid.com/stellar-rallies-big-suis-turn-next-experts-double-down-on-rollblock/,"There is a great crypto rally going on, with Bitcoin peeking above $108k before retracting again, but the $110k Bitcoin is inevitable. This highly positive Bitcoin price is great for all cryptos, with the Stellar price living up to its name with a stellar 80% increase on a 30-day candle. Sui is not doing too badly either, and it calls for a deeper look. However, the star of this crypto rally seems to be Rollblock , a new online gambling platform that is raking in presale investment dollars . Rollblock (RBLK): Gambling investment now available to retail investors Globally, online gambling is huge, worth over $500 billion annually. But it’s not been an investment available to the moguls and millionaires of Monaco and Macau. Engaging with the profits made in gambling was not available to Joe Everyman – until now! Rollblock is a new Ethereum-based online casino currently holding a presale to enlarge its liquidity pool. The kicker: it is an income-bearing asset. Every week, Rollblock pays out a dividend to all its token holders. Everyone who has RBLK token gets a share of the takings. The best news is that this is not something in the future, ‘when we get there’. Rollblock ’s online casino dApp is alive and running, sporting thousands of games, both digital and live, across all genres. There’s something for everyone in Rollblock , and it’s no surprise the presale has recently exceeded $7.3 million . Stellar (XLM): Stellar price rides coattails of XRP on crypto rally Depending on how one looks at it, Stellar i s either a complementary product to XRP or a competitor. XRP is racing up the charts, the feel-good story of the year, but the Stellar price is not too far behind. A cynical look will say that Stellar is riding XRP’s coattails, as both tokens facilitate cross-border payments, and Stellar shares much of its coding with XRP. A kinder reading states that Stellar is gaining thanks to its intrinsic value proposition. But no matter how one slices it, the truth is plain to see: the Stellar price is up 350% on a 90-day candle and has overtaken Polkadot to occupy the #16 spot on the market cap rankings. Sui (SUI): Breakthrough blockchain to break out? Sui is still relatively new, only listed in May 2023, but it has made some fantastic climbs since August of this year. Sui went up four dollars from $0.60 to $4.60 in a mere three and a half months, delivering a 666% increase. Is Sui done, or is it just getting started? There’s more than enough room for Sui on the blockchain market. With Ethereum’s gas fees becoming a major challenge and Solana’s reliability problems constantly hobbling it, Sui is perfectly positioned to make a play for the dApp development platform of choice. There may be a ton of growth left in Sui . Conclusion The crypto rally has delivered a “ Stellar” price , and Sui is reaching for the stars. Crypto is changing the way the world works, and we’re in the early days. There has never been a better time to invest. Stellar, Sui, and Rollblock will all make great additions to a well-balanced crypto portfolio. Sui and Stellar are available on all good exchanges, but Rollblock is only available directly from their website at $0.0415. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

World Liberty Financial Links With Justin Sun In Major Token Swap According to blockchain data analytics firm Nansen, a digital wallet linked to President-elect’s World Liberty Financial swapped its entire holding of 103 cbBTC tokens for WBTC on a Wednesday operation. Wrapped Bitcoin serves as a bridge for Bitcoin (BTC) holders to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, enabling broader participation in the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts Major Altcoin Season As Market Cap Eyes Record Levels Although World Liberty has been marketed as a decentralized finance lending platform, it has yet to become operational as it is still in early stages of development and presales of its WLF token. Sun, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur known for his high-profile investments and attention-grabbing antics—including purchasing a banana duct-taped to a wall for $6.2 million—invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial in November, becoming an adviser to the project. His involvement appears to have pushed World Liberty past a financial threshold that could allow Trump to profit from the enterprise, potentially securing at least $15 million for the Trump family based on terms outlined in World Liberty’s “gold paper.” Trump’s Crypto Initiative Struggles The recent token swap follows World Liberty’s earlier cryptocurrency acquisitions, including significant investments in Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK). Additionally, Nansen’s data indicates that the project’s wallets received around $250,000 in ONDO, a token from Ondo Finance, which specializes in tokenization. The backdrop of these transactions is marked by controversy, particularly following a backlash triggered by a strategic partnership between Sun’s BiT Global and crypto custody firm BitGo, the operator of Wrapped Bitcoin. This partnership prompted US-based crypto exchange Coinbase to seek a delisting of WBTC from its exchange due to concerns over Sun’s potential influence and control. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surge To $200,000 By Mid-2025 Amid ‘Mild’ Price Pullbacks: Report Earlier this month, BiT Global filed a lawsuit against Coinbase in response to the delisting, but a federal judge in California ruled in favor of Coinbase, denying BiT Global’s request for a temporary restraining order. Despite the promotional efforts by Trump and his sons, World Liberty Financial has faced challenges in the market, with sales reportedly falling 93% short of projections. This lack of traction raises questions about the project’s viability and its ability to fulfill its ambitious promises of transforming the financial landscape. At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has fallen to the $3.3 trillion mark, after hitting an all-time high of $3.73 trillion on Tuesday, which also pushed the price of Bitcoin to a new record above $108,000.

On Wednesday, the Fed cut the benchmark borrowing cost as expected but penciled in only two rate cuts for 2025, down from four projected in September. The central bank stressed that it's not interested in participating in a potential government plan to build a strategic BTC reserve. Since then, BTC has dropped over 8%, hitting lows near $96,000 at one point. As of writing, the cryptocurrency changed hands near $97,500, down nearly 10% from the record high of $108,266 reached early this week, CoinDesk data show. The losses have caused the 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) to dip below the 200-hour SMA, confirming a bearish crossover. The pattern suggests that the ongoing pullback could evolve into a deeper one, although it has failed to live up to its reputation during the recent bull run. Bitcoin has experienced a few pullbacks during its post-U.S. election rally from $70,000 to over $100,000, and each of these dips has ended with a bearish crossover of the 50- and 200-hour SMAs. The latest crossover, therefore, offers hope to bulls expecting a renewed move into six figures above $100,000. A potential bounce could face resistance near $10,600, a level identified by the descending trendline, representing the recent price drop. A violation there would open doors for record highs. It's important to remember that patterns don't always play out as expected, and the contrary indicator discussed above may fail, potentially leading to a deeper drop. The first sign of trouble will be if prices move below the overnight low of $96,000, which could expose the swing low of around $91,000 recorded on Dec. 5.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-20 05:36:57

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 05:53:00

According to a Bloomberg report, Gov. Eli Remolona said on Friday that the Philippine Central Bank was closely watching the peso drop and intervening in currency markets. Indonesia promised to defend the rupiah (IDR) to stabilize markets, while Brazil said it spent $14 billion last week to strengthen the real (BRL). Developing economies are facing mounting pressure. India’s rupee and Brazil’s real reached all-time lows, and South Korea’s won tumbled to a 15-year low. A weakening currency can worsen inflation and raise the cost of servicing debt for those nations that depend on foreign borrowing. Currency strategist Christopher Wong said fighting a strong dollar trend is tough, and “intervention in such an environment can only slow the pace of currency depreciation. Despite that, central banks may still have to use a mix of verbal and actual intervention tools”. Emerging-market FX has faced a sharp quarterly decline Source: Bloomberg Since late September, the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index has dropped 3.3%, its sharpest quarterly decline in two years. It has compounded the challenges with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stance matching a more cautious approach. This will lead to fewer interest-rate cuts next year and increased concerns about inflation. With a strong dollar, emerging market central banks are willing to take bold action to save their currencies from falling too far and stave off even wider economic damage. On Friday, South Korea said it will increase the limit banks can hold in forward contracts by 50% of its foreign currency reserves. The move is an effort to attract more money to enter the country to balance the currency market supply and demand. At the same time, China’s central bank intervened to prop up the yuan, setting its daily reference rate much higher than the market had been projecting.

GalaChain is the first hyperledger fabric chain to release this update and this strategic migration represents a critical step towards creating a more secure and decentralized blockchain environment. The transition is currently underway in the test environment, with plans to implement the changes on the mainnet in the near future. When completed, GalaChain will distinguish itself as one of the pioneering public Hyperledger Fabric blockchains to successfully implement this sophisticated consensus mechanism. Migrating From Raft to BFT Consensus At the heart of this upgrade is a drastic improvement in network resilience. Raft, a Crash Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm, falls short in scenarios involving malicious activity. It operates under the assumption that network nodes will behave predictably and without malicious intent. It can effectively manage non-malicious failures like system crashes or temporary downtime. However, this approach leaves significant vulnerabilities in a landscape increasingly threatened by sophisticated cyber attacks. For instance, a compromised leader node or a network partition could disrupt operations and lead to incorrect decisions. This highlights the need for a more superior and secured upgrade. The BFT Advantage Over Raft By contrast, BFT algorithm introduces a more sophisticated approach to network consensus. It is designed for hostile environments where some nodes may behave maliciously. BFT algorithms can withstand and neutralize potential malicious activities by requiring consensus from a substantial majority. Even if up to one-third of nodes act maliciously, it demands consensus from two-thirds of honest network nodes before finalizing any transaction. This means that even if some nodes attempt to send false messages or manipulate the consensus process, the network remains stable and secure. This critical feature significantly reduces the risk of single point of failure, fortifying the network against targeted attacks and improving fault tolerance. Building Trust and Reliability The implications of this upgrade extend beyond mere technical optimization. For users and developers in the Gala Games ecosystem, the BFT migration promises enhanced trust, improved transaction reliability, and a more robust blockchain infrastructure that can effectively resist potential security threats. As blockchain transitions with features that reduce risks and improves security, Gala Games’ proactive approach to network security demonstrates a commitment to the future of the ecosystem by creating trustworthy digital platforms.",Crypto News|Press Release|GalaChain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|GALA,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-12-20 05:56:35

However, it remains bullish but is still finding a key level to initiate a fresh buy. The price is currently under retracement. The late November drops continued to bring a notable setback for Sol’s bulls on a daily scale, though the $200 level has suppressed selling since the market witnessed a sudden meltdown over the past week. Following a short recovery, the $240 level posed a threat to the bulls and the price fell, though the volatility currently looks insignificant due to low supply. A big loss should be expected if the supply level increases. Looking at the choppy price actions over the past week, Sol appeared to be gathering liquidity for another major sell-off capable of retracing the price lower to the $190 and $180 area, where the buyers are patiently waiting to initiate an entry in the next few days. While the ongoing retracement phase provides a discount for a long-term reaccumulation, we can expect a huge rebound once the price tests the white ascending trendline, acting as diagonal support since September. A breakdown of this line could result in an end of the bullish move. But from a technical perspective, more growth is expected in the future. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As Sol advances retracement near a weekly support level of $210, the price must break below $200 before testing $194 and $183.4, where the trendline lies. From there, we can expect a bounce back. But if the price recovers from the current trading level, the immediate resistance level to watch on the way up is $247, followed by $264.4. A break up there could rocket the price to $280 and $300 in no time.

It appeared bearish daily and now sits above September’s high. The past month has been tough for Floki as it failed to advance bullishly above the $0.0003 level. An attempt to break above this key level earlier this month proved abortive and the crypto formed a double-top pattern. This bearish pattern led to a serious breakdown this week and the price plunged below the key $0.0002 level yesterday. Volatility increased today and it slipped to a low of $0.000177 for the first in three months. Rejecting this low, the price bounced back and now trades at $0.000188. A further bounce could bring a fast retest at the broken key level before deciding on where next to head. For now, the bears are gaining control. However, it is important to note that the latest breakdown is considered a retracement of last month’s impulsive movement. We can expect the bulls to step back in action if the current daily low holds as support. Otherwise, Floki may enter the $0.00015 range before bouncing back. Looking back, it has seen over $25% losses in the past month of trading. Floki’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview A drop below the holding $0.000177 support level could slide the price to a low of $0.0001483 this week. The lower price level to watch for support is $0.000125 – where it initiated a surge in volatility last month. The $0.00021 level is considered the closest resistance for a test. If Floki climbs above it, the $0.000283 resistance is the next level to watch for a break up to the $0.00035 resistance – printed in June. Key Resistance Levels: $0.00021, $0.000283, $0.00035 Key Support Levels: $0.000177, $0.0001483, $0.000125 Spot Price: $0.000188 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The legal battle forced Ripple executives to disclose critical information to the public. Ripple’s lawsuit helped create strategic partnerships while accumulating XRP from retail. The legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sparked widespread discussion, with many viewing it as a crucial event for the crypto sector. Some believe the lawsuit aimed to block Ripple’s efforts to challenge established financial systems or compete with Ethereum, while others see it as a calculated move by Ripple to achieve broader objectives. A Different Perspective Vincent Van Code, a blockchain analyst, suggests that Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC may have been part of a carefully planned global strategy. According to him, the lawsuit might have been initiated to accomplish specific objectives, such as slowing Ripple’s rapid expansion and allowing for a detailed examination of its operations. He argues that this approach helped Ripple strengthen its credibility and position within a regulated environment.

On Dec. 18, the SEC greenlighted the crypto index ETF proposal from Franklin Templeton, allowing it to trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The following day, the commission approved Hashdex’s crypto index ETF, which is set to trade on the Nasdaq stock market. Franklin Templeton’s proposal was granted “accelerated approval” after its updated filing met the necessary requirements and was deemed “substantially similar” to previously approved spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products. Crypto index ETFs track the performance of multiple cryptocurrencies, offering investors diversified exposure to the digital asset market through a single investment vehicle. It replicates the performance of an underlying index by holding the same assets in similar proportions. Hashdex’s Crypto Index ETF will track the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, while Franklin Templeton’s product mimics the performance of the Institutional Digital Asset Index, both of which primarily focus on spot Bitcoin and Ether. Franklin Templeton submitted its filing for the Franklin Crypto Index ETF in August, while Hashdex initially filed its S-1 in June and later submitted an amended application on Nov. 25. You might also like: Franklin Templeton crypto index ETF delayed by SEC The SEC had previously requested more time to evaluate both proposals, citing the need for a thorough assessment. Hashdex and Franklin Templeton addressed these concerns by submitting revised filings, which the commission, in its Dec. 19 notice , stated were consistent with regulatory requirements designed to prevent fraud and manipulation, protect investors, and ensure the integrity of the market. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the funds are “likely” to go live in January, with Bitcoin making up about 80% and Ether 20% of the holdings. With the first crypto index funds approved, experts like ETF Store President Nate Geraci believe more issuers will follow suit, anticipating “meaningful demand” for such products as advisors seek diversification. Last month, Bitwise filed a proposal with the SEC to launch a spot Bitcoin and Ether ETP on the NYSE Arca. The fund aims to provide investors with balanced exposure to the two largest crypto assets in an accessible format, according to a Nov. 26 statement from the asset manager. These developments coincide with upcoming leadership changes at the SEC , as Chair Gary Gensler has announced his resignation, effective January 20, 2025, the day President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office.

This upgrade introduces pessimistic proofs to secure cross-chain transactions cryptographically, bolstering the ecosystem. Eternal AI is also leveraging the network’s infrastructure to decentralize AI agents. With developments in NFTs, real-world assets, and AI integration, POL price could be on track to hit $1 soon. Polygon AggLayer Testnet Goes Live with Pessimistic Proofs Polygon announced the launch of its AggLayer v0.2 testnet on December 20, marking a pivotal moment for the platform. This update introduces “pessimistic proofs,” a first-of-its-kind innovation aimed at enhancing blockchain interoperability. These proofs guarantee the safety of cross-chain transactions by tracking balances cryptographically. By reducing risks and enabling seamless communication across EVM chains, pessimistic proofs are poised to set a new standard in secure decentralized ecosystems. Despite slight delays from initial expectations, the testnet launch signals significant progress. Polygon’s roadmap reveals an early 2025 mainnet launch, cementing its position as a leader in blockchain infrastructure. Beyond this, Eternal AI, a decentralized AI agent powered by the network, is expected to revolutionize AI applications, blending secure interoperability with cutting-edge machine-learning capabilities.

The POL price currently trading at $0.48, with a 24-hour range of $0.46 to $0.52, reflecting an 8% price drop. However, it has gained 12% over the past month and 21% in the last quarter, showcasing consistent upward momentum. Market interest in POL has increased significantly, especially as Binance.US announced its support for the MATIC-to-POL migration. The migration, set to begin on January 9 will convert all MATIC balances to POL at a 1:1 ratio, further driving attention toward the ecosystem. Binance.US outlines detailed guidelines for the migration, stating it will disable MATIC trading before the transition. It urges users to unstake MATIC in advance, as staking and unstaking will pause during the process. The migration will take two weeks, after which POL deposits, withdrawals, and trading will resume. This planned migration is likely to bolster POL’s adoption across the crypto market. Polygon’s ongoing innovations in NFTs, real-world asset tokenization, and decentralized AI are fueling speculation about POL’s potential to reach $1. With its expanding use cases and ecosystem growth, analysts remain optimistic that these developments could drive the token’s price upward in the coming months.

X account, hacked to promote a stablecoin",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/vivek-x-account-hacked-to-promote-stablecoin/,"Vivek Ramaswamy’s X account, the co-leader of the US government’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), was reportedly hacked. The breach led to the dissemination of false information about a purported partnership between D.O.G.E. and stablecoin project USUAL, resulting in a temporary surge in the price of the token. Through his official account on X (formerly Twitter), Ramaswamy allegedly announced a strategic collaboration between D.O.G.E and USUAL, an issuer of fiat-backed real world asset (RWA) stablecoins. According to the fraudulent post , the partnership aimed to leverage crypto initiatives to support the Donald Trump administration’s goal of reducing the federal fiscal deficit. It further claimed that the collaboration would enhance governmental transaction efficiency and promote fiscal responsibility. Fake announcement taken down, USUAL experiences price surge The announcement quickly drew attention and caused the price of $USUAL to spike by 31.08% to $1.61. Its market capitalization also surged by 38.73% to $720.2 million, although its 24-hour trading volume fell by 7.76% to $1.6 billion, per CoinMarketCap data . USUAL price spike – Source: CoinMarketCap However, the information was soon debunked as false, with Ramaswamy’s team confirming that his account had been hacked. The post was subsequently removed, and the team initiated swift action to regain control. Source: X James Fishback, founder of Invest Azoria, publicly clarified the situation, labeling the partnership claims as a scam. “I just spoke with Vivek. He has been hacked. He is locked out of his account. This is a scam,” Fishback wrote on X. Vivek’s influence on the government, which involves co-leading D.O.G.E. with billionaire Elon Musk, is likely the reason why hackers targeted his account. He is currently one of the “most watched” personalities, and he is at the center of Trump’s administration critics and supporters. December mauled with fake Social media crypto promotions Social media account hacks promoting fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes have become increasingly prevalent. These incidents often exploit public trust to orchestrate pump-and-dump schemes. Earlier this week, Anthropic ’s X account was similarly compromised, with hackers using the platform to promote a fake token called ‘CLAUDE.’ The fraudulent post about CLAUDE claimed the token would incentivize AI and crypto projects and included a wallet address for “investors.” The tweet remained live for approximately 30 minutes before being removed. On-chain data revealed that the attackers collected around $100,000 from speculative investors. Further analysis showed the hackers purchased 10% of the CLAUDE token’s supply across multiple wallets and quickly dumped their holdings for profit. The scammers had also falsely claimed the token’s focus was on AI agents, capitalizing on the growing interest in AI-related projects. The Anthropic (Claude) Twitter is likely hacked. Don't interact with any links, don't buy the token. — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) December 17, 2024 Celebrity Accounts Targeted for Scams This month, several high-profile figures have also been targeted. Canadian rapper Drake’s X account was compromised on December 15, with attackers promoting a meme coin called Anita. The token, purportedly tied to Drake’s upcoming Anita Max Wynn tour, generated $4.9 million in trading volume within hours, driven by his 39 million followers. Source: X The post claimed the token was developed in collaboration with Stake, a betting platform Drake is known to endorse. The surge in trading volume saw over 7,000 buy orders before blockchain analysts, including Zachxbt, identified the token as a scam. Other celebrities have experienced similar breaches. Cardi B and Doja Cat’s accounts were hacked in December 2024, while TikTok star Halley Welch, known for her viral “Hawk Tuah” video, is facing lawsuits after promoting the HAWK token. The token soared to a market cap of over $400 million before collapsing, leaving investors and Welch’s followers with significant losses. Welch has yet to respond to the rug pull allegations.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

On Dec. 19, the agency approved Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF , allowing it to trade on the Nasdaq stock market. At the same time, it authorized Franklin Templeton’s Franklin Crypto Index ETF for listing on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Both indexes will hold spot Bitcoin and spot Ether directly. The Franklin Crypto Index ETF will track the Institutional Digital Asset Index, designed to reflect the performance of digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ether. Meanwhile, Hashdex’s Crypto Index ETF will follow Bitcoin and Ether as part of the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index. Market-Cap Weighted Bitcoin-Ether ETFs Set for January Debut Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted a January launch for both funds. He said that these ETFs are market-cap weighted, with around 80% allocated to Bitcoin and 20% to Ethereum. The spot bitcoin/ether combo ETFs have been approved by SEC (as predicted). Launch likely in January. They’re mkt cap weight so 80/20 btc/eth approx. Notable that Hashdex & Frankie are first. Good for them. https://t.co/o2ri3XpqZi — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 20, 2024 The approvals came from amended filings where the Trusts’ structure and terms mirrored previously approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs under earlier SEC orders. The SEC also determined that the spot Bitcoin market closely aligns with the CME Bitcoin futures market, while the spot Ether market shows a similar correlation with the CME Ether futures market. Based on this correlation and its analysis, the SEC concluded that the surveillance-sharing agreements between the Exchanges and the CME could effectively detect and prevent fraudulent or manipulative activities tied to these proposals. Additionally, the SEC confirmed that the proposals met the Exchange Act’s standards, including rules to prevent fraud and manipulation, safeguard investors and support public interest. Hashdex Eyes Broader Market Appeal With Multi-Asset ETF Hashdex earlier announced that its multi-asset ETF will initially focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, with plans to potentially add Solana and Cardano in the future. By diversifying the ETF’s holdings across several major digital assets, the firm aims to minimize the volatility often associated with single-asset ETFs. This diversified strategy could attract a broader audience, appealing to both risk-averse investors and those seeking broader exposure to the digital asset market. ETFs have become increasingly popular because they offer a simple and regulated way to invest in a variety of assets. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, said it would be interesting to see if BlackRock or other firms might adopt a similar approach and introduce comparable ETFs. “Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors LOVE diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto,” he said.

The recently launched altcoin has attracted the attention of more crypto traders following the listing on major crypto exchanges led by Binance. According to the latest market data, the Usual token had a volume-to-market cap ratio of about 222 percent, after hitting a fully diluted valuation of about $6.3 billion. The highly liquid altcoin has attracted more than $1.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), through its USDO Stablecoin. Why Usual Protocols Matter a Ton The Usual protocol debuted as a secure and decentralized fiat stablecoin issuer, which redistributes ownership and governance through the USUAL token. The Usual protocol aggregates the growing RWA industry from leading entities led by BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, and Hashnote among others.

With only 12.37 percent of the USUAL token in circulating supply, the altcoin faces higher potential selling pressure as airdropped holders seek to take profits. From a technical analysis standpoint, USUAL price has been forming a rising wedge, as the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers in overbought territory of above 90 percent.

Right now, the category has over 120 L2 projects and holds more than $50 billion in total value locked (TVL). For years, L2s were mainly judged on how close they were to becoming fully decentralized. However, as L2s have grown, the security risks have become more apparent. Many projects lack proof systems and rely on centralized setups and this means that user funds are vulnerable. To address these issues, L2BEAT is rolling out a new framework to separate truly secure L2s from weaker alternatives. According to L2BEAT, these updates are expected to improve user security and transparency. L2BEAT is proposing three big changes According to L2BEAT, three big changes are coming to the ecosystem. The first will be the “Others” category. Projects without proper proof systems or sufficient data availability (DA) guarantees will now be classified under the new “Others” category . This group includes chains like Polygon PoS and certain OP Stack rollups that fail to meet the updated standards. Previously, these projects were considered L2s, but their setups often rely on centralized control or weak DA committees. Chains will also have to set up mandatory proof systems. A secure rollup is nothing without the right proof system, as that will allow permissionless exits and protect user funds even if permissioned actors become unavailable. L2BEAT now requires all rollups (a specific type of L2) to have these proof systems. Without one, they simply won’t be considered a proper rollup anymore. There are projects like StarkNet that already use proof systems to verify every state transition on Ethereum. Alt-DA L2s (like validiums and optimiums) must also meet stricter requirements for data availability guarantees. This includes having decentralized DA committees or proper DA attestation bridges. Many existing projects depend on small, centralized committees or external networks without proper guarantees, creating potential risks for users. L2BEAT said that projects have six months to make the necessary improvements to meet these new standards. So, by the middle of 2025, it expects them to have added proof systems and improved data security or face reclassification. There’s also an offer on grounds where L2BEAT will work with these teams to help them through the process. Community support is key Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, is fully on board with these stricter rules for L2 projects. Starting in 2025, he’ll only publicly support projects that meet the higher security standards (classified as Stage 1 or higher). This is a clear message to developers that security and decentralization need to be top priorities. “The era of rollups being glorified multisigs is coming to an end. The era of cryptographic trust is upon us,” said Buterin. The Ethereum community itself also plays a huge role in all of this. It starts making the space safer for everyone when it begins to only actively support projects that meet the new standards and raises questions about those that don’t. According to L2BEAT, it is not slowing down either. Instead, it will double its efforts to monitor and review proof systems in 2025. This means that it won’t just be looking to see if a project has a proof system but also checking how good and reliable those systems are. Initiatives like the ZK Catalog will help it do this more thoroughly. All of this ties into Ethereum’s bigger vision of a world of decentralized and secure L2s. It all starts by holding projects accountable and raising the bar for security so people can truly trust the technology they use Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|ETH|POL,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MATIC|TECHNOLOGY|OP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-20 07:30:43

Despite the sell-off, Solana’s price action remains resilient as it managed to hold above a critical support level, reinforcing confidence in its ability to weather macroeconomic shifts. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? While the market reacted to the Fed’s cautious tone, Solana’s on-chain metrics tell a more optimistic story. The number of daily transactions on the Solana network has surged, nearing 67 million, reflecting growing adoption and sustained network activity. This robust transaction volume highlights Solana’s position as a leading blockchain platform, with developers and users continuing to rely on its scalability and efficiency. Analysts suggest that holding above its key support level could position SOL for a strong rebound, particularly if broader market conditions stabilize. The increased on-chain activity adds to this bullish outlook, signaling that long-term fundamentals remain intact. Solana Holding Key Demand Solana demonstrates resilience in the face of market turbulence, holding above key demand levels around $210 following yesterday’s sell-off triggered by the Federal Reserve’s policy announcements. This critical support level reinforces bullish sentiment for the asset, with many analysts eyeing a breakout on the horizon. Top analyst Jelle recently provided a compelling technical analysis on X, noting that Solana successfully took out the lows, maintained its position above monthly and weekly support levels, and continued to trade within its falling wedge pattern. According to Jelle, this setup suggests a breakout is imminent, with Solana targeting new all-time highs soon. Supporting this optimistic outlook, on-chain metrics paint a promising picture for Solana’s network activity. Ali Martinez shared data showing the Solana network nearing 67 million daily transactions, underscoring strong adoption and user engagement. This heightened network activity highlights Solana’s utility and strengthens the foundation for sustained price growth. Related Reading: XRP Consolidation Could End Once It Clears $2.60 – Top Analyst Expects $4 Soon If Solana holds above the $210 level in the coming days, it could trigger a significant rally as bullish momentum builds. Traders and investors are closely watching the asset’s price action for signs of a decisive move, with the combination of strong technical and on-chain indicators pointing toward a potential surge to new highs. Price Action: Liquidity Resting Above Solana is trading at $210, a key level it has held for several days despite broader market volatility. This price point demonstrates solid demand, but holding this level alone won’t ignite the next rally. A decisive push above $240 is critical for Solana to regain bullish momentum. This move would signal renewed strength and pave the way for higher price targets. A crucial intermediate step lies at the $225 mark. If Solana can reclaim this level with conviction, it would likely confirm a bullish trend and set the stage for further upward momentum. This could attract additional buying interest as traders and investors interpret the move as a signal of strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? Failing to break above these resistance levels, however, may keep Solana range-bound and limit its ability to capitalize on the recent support it has established. As market conditions continue to evolve, Solana’s ability to push past these key thresholds will determine whether it transitions into a stronger upward trajectory or remains stuck in consolidation.

They are hugely capitalizing on the recent dips in Cardano and BNB prices as the market gains more momentum. While the duo is getting post-pullback accumulation, the real FOMO is circling Rollblock, the new all-rounder and iGaming innovation currently raising dust in its ongoing presale. In mere months, Rollblock has broken highs with over $7.5M raise. What’s driving the FOMO ? Let’s find out. Rollblock wins big in presale: GambleFi ingenuity and $7.5M Rollblock is quickly becoming the crypto market ‘s favorite as the ultimate investment opportunity for the year. Built on Ethereum, the platform combines the reliability of centralized gaming with the transparency of decentralized finance. The allure has attracted notable whale investments in its ninth presale stage. So far, Rollblock has had an exceptional run—the FOMO has reached a fever pitch, and over 22,000 investors have poured in $7.5M already. Even analysts predict an 880% return before the market debut, and RBLK has done 315% already. A key factor behind Rollblock’s growing appeal is its commitment to fairness and security. Rollblock leverages blockchain technology to provide provably fair odds to ensure every transaction is encrypted and secure from manipulation. In addition, Rollblock offers long-term benefits for investors through a revenue-sharing model and staking. This has made Rollblock a compelling opportunity for the whole crypto market . What’s even better? The presale price is an enticingly low $0.0415. Cardano Bitcoin bridge fuel whale accumulation despite SEC lawsuit FUD Rollblock’s rise to the limelight has proven how much FOMO the crypto market is experiencing right now. Another crypto that is getting a great share is the Ouroborus-based PoS network, Cardano . Despite a recent 16% pullback from its 24-month high of $1.25, Cardano is experiencing more intense demand due to its recent ecosystem development. The recent Cardano -Bitcoin bridge announced by Emurgo and BTCOS has incited FOMO . The pivotal step will open Cardano ‘s DeFi to Bitcoin’s $2 trillion ecosystem. Whales have gone on a buying spree despite lingering SEC-related FUD. However, the fundamentals are still perfect. TVL and ecosystem activities have risen to a new ATH. Is BNB the best bet in the next crypto market rally? The crown jewel of the Binance ecosystem is not left out, either. Ethereum is drawing a step closer to the $4k mark again, and BNB ‘s movement is hinting at the reality of a new altcoin season. Earlier this month, BNB posted a powerful surge to a new high. Despite the recent dip, BNB still stands as an outperformer against major alts. Analysts point to the Binance ecosystem’s strength as the driving force. TVL has soared to $5.8B, and daily activities user stats are inching closer to a new high. Beyond this, BNB ‘s resilience makes it a crypto market leader and an excellent bet amid the FOMO . Conclusion Every dip is an opportunity for savvy investors. The bull run FOMO has kept them on their feet, and most of them aren’t holding back after Cardano and BNB ‘s recent pullbacks. Amidst the market recovery, Rollblock continues to steal the crypto market spotlight. With its $7.5 million raised and GambleFi innovation, Rollblock offers a unique blend of gaming ingenuity and investor incentives driving unprecedented demand.

The Fifth Circuit Appeals Court recently ruled that the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash’s smart contracts were unlawful . This ruling could be a game-changer for Storm’s case, which involves serious charges, including money laundering. Moreover, the case went all in favor of Tornado Cash the sanctions helped the native token Torn jump 700% last month. The Court Ruled Out Sanction Clause In its ruling , the appeals court made a bold statement by declaring that Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash’s smart contracts were unlawful. As per the ruling, Tornado Cash’s smart contracts are immutable, meaning they can’t be changed or stopped by anyone, not even the creators. The court also clarified that these contracts are not “property” under U.S. law, so they can’t be blocked or sanctioned by the government. With this key factor, Storm demanded that the court should also drop the severe charges of money laundering, especially the charges that he conspired to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which forced U.S. sanctions. Storm’s Argument: No Control, No Crime In the quest to fight back, Storm is using this ruling to argue that the charges against him are flawed. He insists that Tornado Cash isn’t a financial institution and that it became immutable back in May 2020—long before the alleged money-laundering accusations. Interestingly, he says there was no way he could have conspired to launder money using a protocol that couldn’t be controlled by anyone, including him. So in simple terms, there is no concrete evidence to prove that he did the money laundering using the platform. The case has drawn massive outrage and initially, the lawsuit was filed by the Tornado Cash users, backed by Coinbase , against the U.S. Treasury and its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Although the users initially lost the court case, the ruling was overturned in November 2023, giving Tornado Cash supporters a big win. The case is also a reflection of how the decentralized platforms are treated by US law agencies. The developer’s attempt to challenge the agencies will surely bring some immutable change for future cases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk as House Speaker?

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs logged outflows of $680 million on Thursday, breaking a 15-day streak of inflows that had brought over $6.7 billion into the funds. Fidelity’s FBTC led the decline with $208.55 million exiting the fund, followed by Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, which recorded outflows of $188.6 million and $108.35 million, respectively. Other notable outflows included: Grayscale’s GBTC: $87.86 million Bitwise BITB: $43.61 million Invesco Galaxy’s BTCO: $25.97 million VanEck’s HODL: $10.91 million Valkyrie’s BRRR: $8.19 million Amidst the sell-off, WisdomTree’s BTCW stood as an outlier, attracting a modest $2.05 million in inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT and two other BTC ETFs reported no changes in flows for the day. Despite the outflows, trading activity in Bitcoin ETFs surged, with total trading volume reaching $6.31 billion, a notable increase from the previous day’s $5.86 billion. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) fall below $96,000—down 4.4% at $96,751 at the time of reporting—was largely attributed to the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision. While the Fed implemented a widely anticipated 0.25% rate cut, bringing this year’s cumulative cuts to 1%, officials signaled a cautious approach moving forward. Only two additional rate cuts are planned for 2025, with inflation projected to meet the 2% target by 2026 or 2027. This hawkish tone dampened investor sentiment, leading to a 4.5% drop in the broader cryptocurrency market, which stood at $3.51 trillion.

Grayscale’s ETHE accounted for the majority, with $58.13 million exiting the fund. Bitwise’s ETHW, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, and Invesco’s QETH also saw outflows of $6.78 million, $3.18 million, and $2.36 million, respectively. In contrast, Fidelity’s FETH and VanEck’s ETHV managed to attract inflows of $5.05 million and $4.94 million, partially offsetting the broader trend. Despite the daily outflows, cumulative net inflows for Ethereum ETFs remained positive at $2.4 billion. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price reflected the bearish sentiment, dropping 8.1% over the past day to $3,378 per coin.

The major crypto exchange OKX is bringing Ordinals into the fold by releasing the new Ordinals Launchpad platform for creators who want to launch and inscribe directly on Bitcoin ( BTC ). The platform provides creators with the tools, exposure and technical support needed to make the Bitcoin inscription process as simple as possible. According to the official notice , the Ordinals Launchpad platform can now be accessed through the web or on a mobile device. Users can launch and trade collections directly through the interface. All sales proceeds are wired directly to creator wallets through on-chain settlements. OKX employs “SelfScribe” technology that enables collectors to inscribe instantly on-chain at the time of minting. SelfScribe removes pre-inscription requirements and guarantees creators have self-custody over their collections. The exchange claims that creators are given “complete control” over pricing and distribution of their collections, including the option to customize minting rounds using features like allowlist and public sale options.

The first collection to officially debut on Ordinals Launchpad is “Geminions” from JRNE, a Web3 jewelry brand that introduced NFC-enabled authentication on Bitcoin. OKX also noted that trading volume for Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20 collections on their platform has gone up by 50% since November, indicating an increase in market demand. Recently, Binance confirmed in a post that it has discontinued its Ordinal assets, specifically its Inscription Market. Users can no longer buy or sell inscription assets on the exchange, but they can still view their inscription assets and move them to other wallets.

However, he chose to stay on as a strategic advisor to the company board. In a lengthy post on X , Shaikh said that he is leaving the company “to start a new chapter.” “Over the coming months, I plan to take some much-needed time to reflect on where the world is headed and to think deeply about the ways financial systems can evolve to continue to push Aptos as the most established layer 1 in the space.” For as long as I can remember, I’ve been passionate about building systems that empower people—fairer, more open systems.

Aptos, a layer-1 blockchain, leverages a unique blockchain programming language called Move, which was originally created for Facebook’s ‘Diem’ project. Shaikh also acknowledged the work of Aptos’ partners and investors, including Google, Microsoft, a16z, Coinbase, MasterCard and PayPal. In June, Shaikh joined the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) digital asset subcommittee. He will be helping the CFTC shape regulatory rulemaking regarding cryptocurrencies. Aptos’ APT Token Experience Bearish Trend Aptos blockchain has been performing well recently, with several new partnerships. Last month, the firm partnered with Circle and Stripe to enable seamless transfers across 8 blockchains, boosting DeFi interoperability. Circle’s CCTP and USDC stablecoin will enhance blockchain interoperability, while Stripe will simplify fiat interactions. Aptos also added former Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein and OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil to its advisory board. Following Shaikh’s resignation, its APT token experienced a bearish trend. The token was down by 1.97% and is currently trading at $11.65 at press time.

Altcoins like ETH, SOL, DOGE are seeing even greater selling pressure correcting 8-13%. While Bitcoin pullbacks are part of every market cycle, investors are curious as to how far the BTC correction will continue from here. Can Crypto Market Crash Push BTC Price Even Lower? BTC Preparing for 25% Drop to $80,000 As the panic selloff intensifies further, the crypto market crash continues with Bitcoin price falling deeper from its crucial support of $100K. Crypto market analysts are predicting that a 25% Bitcoin pullback from its all-time high of $108K is very much possible going ahead. Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted: “For those saying that -25% or -30% pullbacks will definitely not occur in this cycle should study this year’s overall March-August -34% correction more closely. Or the multiple -25% pullbacks between March and August”. Source: Rekt Capital Thus, if history repeats then BTC price can correct all the way to $80,000 again. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has warned of a possible correction for Bitcoin, citing the persistence of a Bearish Engulfing Candle on the weekly chart. In a recent post, the analyst highlighted that the critical weekly support level at $101.2K is under pressure and struggling to hold. The analyst further noted that if this key blue support region fails, along with Bitcoin’s 5-week uptrend (marked in orange), the cryptocurrency could likely transition into a broader correction phase.

Analyst Ali Martinez noted that the key support zone for Bitcoin is between $98,830 to $95,830. Within this zone, approximately 1.09 million wallets collectively purchased over 1.16 million BTC, reinforcing its significance as a key price level. Source: Ali Charts The Coinglass data shows that the Bitcoin open interest has dropped 5% while the 24-hour liquidations have surged to $217 million with $166 million being long liquidations. Despite the current fall, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index remains in the “Greed” zone with a score of 74. Market analysts believe that the crypto market correction can continue further amid a surge in the Dollar Index (DXY). Crypto analyst Justin Bennett emphasized the importance of tracking global liquidity trends, stating: “110.00 has been my US dollar target since the 102.60 reclaim, and I’m betting that area marks the crypto bottom in early 2025.” Source: Justin Bennet Altcoins ETH, SOL, and DOGE Face Stronger Corrections ETH Loses the Crucial Support of $3,500 The top altcoins also recorded gloomy trading amid a broader market selloff recently. The ETH price has corrected by a massive 9% in the last 24 hours losing the crucial support of $3,550 and is currently trading at $3,346. It is possible that Ethereum could retest $3,000 again before bouncing back. Besides, the Ethereum whale selloff has also intensified recently. Blockchain analytics platform LookonChain reports that the recent decline in Ethereum’s price has prompted significant activity among large holders as they sell ETH to settle debts. In the last five hours, one whale transferred 22,746 ETH, worth $77.7 million, to Binance and subsequently withdrew stablecoins to repay obligations on Spark and Aave. Another whale deposited 49,910 ETH, valued at $170 million, into Binance, withdrawing $137.8 million in stablecoins within the past eight hours. However, market analysts continue to be hopeful moving ahead. Popular analyst Ted Pillows wrote: “$4K seems like the new $1.4K for Ethereum. In the 2020-21 cycle, ETH got rejected from $1,400 several times before a successful breakout. Right now, the same thing is happening with the $4K level, but there’ll be a breakout soon”. Solana Price Cracks Under $200 Following the high of $263 in November, the Solana price has moved sideways and underperformed other altcoins of its league. Amid today crypto market crash, the SOL price has lost its crucial support of $200 and is currently trading at $193 as of press time. Crypto analyst Lieutenant Ponzi has drawn attention to Solana’s (SOL) weekly chart, pointing out a significant order block (OB) and a bullish bat pattern. According to the analyst, the $165-$170 range is emerging as a critical area of interest, suggesting potential resistance or a reversal zone for the cryptocurrency.

With this, the world’s largest meme coin has extended its weekly losses to more than 22%. The 24-hour liquidation data from Coinglass shows a 20% drop in open interest and $55 million in DOGE liquidations, of which $44 million is in long liquidation. Despite this, market analysts continue to be optimistic about DOGE. Market analyst BALO has highlighted crucial price levels for Dogecoin’s (DOGE) weekly performance. According to the analyst, a weekly close above $0.26 is necessary to maintain bullish momentum. Furthermore, if DOGE can reclaim the $0.42 level, BALO predicts a potential surge to $4, marking a significant upside for the popular meme coin.

The Fed’s hawkish FOMC has triggered the massive crypto sell-off. “Over bullish positioning” by investors is another reason for the crash. The crypto market had a massive crash, with Bitcoin (BTC) dropping below $100,000 even after several attempts to keep the price above $103,000 in the past few days. Ethereum (ETH) also plummeted to $3,300, a support level, after a 7.2% price crash in the past 24 hours. CoinMarketCap data shows Bitcoin’s dominance increased to 57.4%, while the Fear and Greed Index dropped to 62. BTC’s rising dominance indicates that the digital asset space did not have an altcoin season as the industry’s total market capitalization dropped to $3.35 trillion. The Fed’s Announcement and Market Reaction The hawkish FOMC announcement from the United States Fed triggered a sharp selloff across all risk assets, with Nasdaq falling 3.56%, S&P 500 dropping 2.95%, and BTC dropping 6.13%, as noted by Singapore-based digital asset firm QCP Capital .

Today, the token is up 3.18% and shows signs of recovery, which is in line with Bitcoin’s outlook. While the short-term outlook is noisy, the long-term outlook remains certainly bullish. This CoinGape article explains five reasons to not sell XRP and how the token could offer more upside in 2025. XRP Price: 5 Key Reasons To Not Sell XRP Tokens Although XRP price has shot up more than. 500% in 2024, its upside potential is not capped yet. Here are five key events that are yet to unfold that could have a massive positive impact ont the value of XRP and potentially catlayze another uptrend. Trump Inauguration: Trump wining the US elections on November 5 was a key trigger that kickstart the crypto bull market. Some believe that Trump January 20, 2025 inauguration event could lead to an even bigger rally. The reason for this is the expectation of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment that could benefit XRP and the broader crypto markets. Additionally, Trump’s pre-election statements on cryptocurrencies are positive. This could lead to help with XRP’s adoption and propel its price higher. Gary Gensler is out of SEC: Gary Gensler, the SEC chairman filed the lawsuit on Ripple at the end of 2020 and a dozen other crypto-related suits, has been considered an enemy to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Hence, the departure of Gary Gensler, a perceived crypto skeptic, from the SEC will reform the image of this regulatory body and lead to a shift in regulatory tone that favors cryptocurrencies. This development could be one key factor that boosts XRP price. SEC Lawsuit Settlement: Although the long-running battle between the SEC and Ripple came to a conclusion, it isn’t settled yet. Hence, a firm settlement could bring much-needed clarity and certainty to XRP’s regulatory status, leading to a rally in Ripple price. Alt Season Begins: As mentioned in previous CoinGape articles, an altcoin season could kickstart after the recent crash and extend all the way up to January 2025. Hence, capital rotation out of Bitcoin and into altcoins, including XRP, could see a huge uptrend. XRP ETF is Approved: Bloomberg analysts have already suggested that the XRP and Solana ETF could be next. Considering that Bitcoin saw such a massive uptrend after spot ETF approval, XRP could mirror this trend considering the demand. Moreover, the approval of an XRP ETF would provide institutions and safe way to invest in XRP. Hence, this event could lead to massive rally for XRP price. XRP Technical Analysis: Ripple Has A Long Way to Go Tony Severino, a certified analyst, posted on X, that he is “potentially not bullish enough on XRP.” According to Severion, XRP’s “three-month candlestick is above the Bollinger Band basis for the first time since April 2019”, reflecting volatility. A buy signal would emerge if the quarterly candlestick manages to push its above the “the upper Band” and closer there. Sevenrio also note that the Bollinger Bands “have been the tightest in XRPBTC history,” which is a signal that precedes volatile moves. To further support his bullish outlook, the analyst notes that the three-month Relative Strength Index (RSI) has crossed above the RSI-based moving average and rising toward the 50 mean level. If the three-month RSI manages to climb above 50, it would suggest a spike a bullish momentum, aka “increasing strength”. The third bullish indicator, according to Severiono, is the Fisher Transform that is “flipping bullish with a multi-year bullish divergence.” The certified analyst adds that the three-month Logarithmic MACD depitcs a “weakening bearish momentum” and that it is ready to flip “bullish for the first time on the chart.” XRP/USD 3-month Chart All in all, the analyst remains wildly bullish on XRP price and expects it to continue its ascent. However, there are a few conditions that need to be met for Rippel to trend higher. This outlook is in line with the five reasons why you should not sell XRP here.

In an interview with Scott Melker, he said that here’s even talk about exempting the U.S.-based cryptocurrencies from capital gains tax. This move could create a major shift in how crypto is treated in the U.S. market. Despite XRP’s massive market cap, Yusko isn’t a fan. He believes XRP and Cardano lack real development. Unlike Circle’s stablecoin, which is backed by actual dollars, Yusko sees these coins as missing true innovation, even though they have high market value. Pro-Crypto Leadership: A Shift in Power Yusko also touched on Trump’s visit to Nashville, where he spoke directly to voters. He mentioned Trump’s promises, including firing SEC head Gary Gensler, and how Trump is under pressure to make moves, such as freeing Ross Ulbricht and creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Yusko believes the current U.S. leadership is largely supportive of crypto. Key figures like Scott Bessent and the new SEC head are crypto-friendly, which could lead to positive changes in the industry. It’s a shift that could help propel the crypto market forward. The Technologist Revolution: Billionaires Taking Control Yusko said that it’s not just Trump – the real story is the rise of “technologist billionaires.” These innovators are pushing for changes that benefit both the tech industry and the nation. It’s not about political parties anymore; it’s about the tech leaders who want to shape the future. With all these shifts in power, Yusko believes we’re entering a new phase for crypto, one driven by smart, tech-savvy leaders. Trump, learning from global leaders like Putin, seems ready to let these experts lead the charge in innovation.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 07:53:52

However, the ever-volatile nature of BTC always leads to substantial corrections that provide opportunities for those who missed the initial train to get on board. In the past couple of days, bitcoin’s price tumbled by double-digits, which, according to Santiment, has made the crowd seek to buy the dip. Moreover, history shows that it could send BTC flying again. Is BTC About to Bounce? As the analytics platform noted, the last time these discussions exploded in a similar manner was in early August when the cryptocurrency’s price tumbled below $50,000. Just a few days later, though, the asset had climbed by over 25% to beyond $62,000. If history is to repeat itself now, even though BTC’s market cap is a lot higher, bitcoin could recover from its big retracement and head toward a new all-time high again of over $120,000. With Bitcoin falling as low as $95.5K today, the ratio of crypto discussions that are about buying crypto’s dip has reached its highest level in over 8 months. The last time we saw the crowd nearly this enthusiastic about dip buying was the major crash on August 4th. Since… pic.twitter.com/39NlpnGMCs — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 20, 2024 Not So Fast Although the ‘buy-the-dip’ history shows that BTC’s correction could be over, this narrative is not supported by other on-chain and technical metrics, such as one particular demand zone. IntoTheBlock posted even before bitcoin lost the $100,000 mark decisively yesterday that such an area had formulated at around $97,500, given the large number of investors purchasing at such prices more than 1.4 million BTC. These accumulations turned that level into an ‘important’ support zone, which has now been broken to the downside. Once such vital support lines are breached and investors who had entered recently see their positions in the red, at least on paper, many tend to dispose of their holdings, which leads to more intense selling pressure for the underlying asset. Will Bitcoin retrace below $100k? Interestingly, a significant demand zone has formed just under $100k. Over 1.45 million BTC was accumulated at an average price 97.5k, making this an important potential support zone. pic.twitter.com/vDcHEl8OKV — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 19, 2024 The post Bitcoin Could Skyrocket by 25% in Days if History Repeats But There’s a Catch: Data appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-20 07:54:18

The announcement , which came on Dec. 19, was the culmination of an in-depth probe into whether the project was in compliance with EU data protection laws. For failing to meet the set privacy standards, the regulator has particularly homed in on World’s iris-based digital identity verification system. Data Deletion and Compliance Deadlines BayLDA ordered World to create a GDPR-compliant data deletion process within a month to give all users the full right to request data erasure. It also includes records gathered in the early phase of operation of Worldcoin due to a lack of legitimate legal basis for acquiring such data. Improving Privacy Rights for Users Michael Will, president of BayLDA, said the ruling ensures EU fundamental privacy rights are upheld in a legally and technologically highly complex case. “Users who entrusted Worldcoin with their iris data will now be completely free to avail themselves of their right to erasure,” Will observed. The ruling bolsters the ambitions of the GDPR, which sets the course for individual data sovereignty. Anonymization Clarification Sought by Worldcoin In response, World Foundation filed an appeal to shed light from the judiciary on whether its PETs meet EU standards for truly anonymizing data. World argues that there is no consistent definition of anonymization-a critical privacy protection tool within AI-driven innovation-under the GDPR. Data anonymization is key to being able to validate that someone is human without compromising privacy”, said Damien Kieran, chief legal officer at World. He added that ambiguous definitions weaken the EU’s regime to protect privacy effectively. Ongoing Compliance Challenges Despite halting operations in several EU countries to improve GDPR adherence, BayLDA found multiple compliance gaps. The authority called for stricter protocols, including explicit user consent for certain data-processing steps. It also reserved the option to investigate potential administrative violations further. Commitment to Privacy and Innovation The World Foundation reiterated commitments to regulatory collaboration, promising that it would address privacy concerns while continuing to drive innovation. It said that “clear GDPR standards are necessary to move technology forward in the privacy-first world”.

Zeberg tells his 170,600 followers on the social media platform X that the anticipated “Christmas rally is still on.” According to the widely followed economist, Bitcoin is primed to rise past the current record high of around $108,200 and reach a new all-time high. Zeberg further says, “We are not at the top yet. BUT – we are much closer to the top and the rally will not continue for as long as many analysts seem to believe.” Bitcoin is trading at $101,784 at time of writing. According to the economist, Bitcoin could plunge by around 84% from the current level after reaching the cycle peak. “Well – my target after blow-off top is approximately $16,000. Will be interesting.” Turning to the wider crypto asset market, Zeberg says that altcoins are on the cusp of a massive rally amid a declining level of Bitcoin dominance – the ratio of the market cap of Bitcoin relative to the market cap of all other crypto assets. Zeberg says , “Crypto is THIS close to taking off in a major way! The most explosive phase of the altcoin season is about to set in.

Let’s discuss the trending cryptos and the reasons behind their trends. Top Trending Altcoin of The Day and Why? The number of cryptos in the market easily reaches millions, but today, the trending altcoins are Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana. The tokens already hold a top position on CoinmarketCap, in which investors’ demand and market cap have played the biggest role. As a result, these are trending even in the crypto market crash. Ethereum, the biggest altcoin in the market, has also grabbed Donald Trump’s attention, where the soon-to-be inaugurated US president holds $1.68M worth of ETH tokens. Similarly, Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial, began the ETH buying in the last few days. The Trump WLFI project has bought 722 ETH worth 2.5M USD with the current Ethereum price dip. It already has 8104 from its earlier ETH buying, showing rising interest in the token. Additional whales went for the same buying the dip strategies, fueling the ETH’s demand, currently trading at $3,402.59 with a trading volume of $59.06B after a 15% surge. Similarly, Dogecoin enthusiasts are flocking to buy. That’s because, the DOGE price almost tripled within a few days, from $0.15 to $0.46 in the recent rally. This is building confidence for further rallies. It is currently at an elevated position of $0.3202 with a $9.56B trading volume with a 50% increase. Interestingly, the SOL token’s hype is due to the Solana ETF, which might get approved at the beginning of 2025. After the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, Solana and XRP are next in line, and even a Bloomberg ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, believes that these will get approved pretty soon. With that, the token is gaining momentum, and analysts believe Solana’s price can hit $300 . It is currently at $193.53 with $7.79B after a 9% surge, clearly representing growing investor interest. Altcoin Season Next? In the crypto bull run, traders’ attention was divided among thousands of altcoins, not to forget Bitcoin and its milestone of BTC price hitting ATH at $108.2k. However, as the market is on a downtrend, investors have begun to focus on profit potential tokens. Interestingly, these include Ethereum, Solana, and many others, but analysts see it as a hint for the upcoming altcoin season. For weeks, analysts have been eyeing this moment. One called the next 1-2 weeks as the period of market resets and correction before paving the way for the altcoin to boom, as the alts-BTC correlation dropped to a 12-month low. Another analysis sees Donald Trump’s inauguration as the key moment. He says that Bitcoin will face a 20-25 correction in mid-January. Although the altcoins would face the same, their recovery will be instant, allowing them to flourish during the altcoin season. However, these are speculations for now amid the rising crypto market volatility. Additionally, as the Altcoin season index dropped to 47, the lower the number, the lower the chances of the altcoin dominations. Regardless, the next few weeks could give a better insight into these claims. What’s In There For You With These Altcoins? Bitcoin had the biggest bullish dominance this year, surging 2.5x since the beginning of 2024. However, many trending altcoins have presented similar rallies under the influence of BTC. However, that could go even better once the alt-BTC correlation breaks and the alternative cryptos get to follow separate trajectories. Even in the confusing and crashing crypto market, analysts foresee the altcoin season, under whose influence Ethereum, DOGE, Solana, and many other cryptos are booming with increased activity as investors are flocking to utility-based or long-term growth tokens to buy the dip.

The European crypto market changed dramatically, with euro-denominated trading volumes reaching a multi-year high of nearly €50 billion in November 2024, according to Kaiko’s Research report .

Despite the dip many analysts foresee the asset rebounding to targets as high as $5, with some projecting even greater peaks if a FOMO-driven rally occurs. XRP Follows the Market Decline Despite the enhanced volatility, the first half of December has been quite successful for Ripple’s XRP . At the start of the month, its price surpassed a multi-year high of $2.80, while at the beginning of this week, it consolidated above $2.50. However, things took a sudden turn on December 18, with XRP plunging below $2.30. S everal hours ago, the valuation dipped under $2.20. Currently, XRP is around $2.23 after a slight rebound, which represents a 6% decline on a daily scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most obvious factor that has impacted the price of the token is the severe correction of the entire cryptocurrency sector. The global crypto market capitalization is down almost 9% in the last 24 hours, currently set at around $3.42 trillion (CoinGecko’s data). Bitcoin (BTC), which hit a new all-time high of over $108,000 on December 17, is now worth less than $96,000. Ethereum (ETH) tumbled below $3,300, while Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and many more are down by double digits. The market started bleeding heavily shortly after the Federal Reserve announced its latest interest rate cut. It reduced the benchmark by 0.25%, but Jerome Powell hinted that next year, the policy might be halted due to an increase in the inflation rate. In addition to that , the spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed their biggest outflows in a single day. As CryptoPotato reported , over $670 million were withdrawn from the financial vehicles in total on a 24-hour scale, with Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s BTC leading the pack – $ 208.5 and $188.6 million, respectively. XRP’s Next Potential Targets Despite the substantial plunge, numerous analysts remain optimistic that XPR’s bull run is far from over. The popular X user Crypto Bitlord believes the latest correction has represented a local bottom, after which XRP could surge to as high as $5. Other market observers who recently chipped in are Dark Defender and Armando Pantoja. The former set $5.85 and $8.76 as short-term targets, while the latter assumed XRP could be headed toward $2.78 and then $3.87. Pantoja went even further, predicting a mass FOMO effect if the price reach $10-$12, and “that’s when it will get crazy.” The post Why is the Ripple (XRP) Price Down Today? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Federal Reserve|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-20 09:21:22

According to CoinGlass data, $856.7 million of these liquidations came from long positions, driven by the strong bullish momentum observed over the last month. Bitcoin slipped by 5% and is now trading at $96,350, as reported by CoinMarketCap. This downturn follows a pattern seen earlier this month, with Bitcoin’s dips below psychological levels triggering large-scale liquidations. On Dec. 5, a sharp 5.47% drop below $93,000 erased $300 million within minutes. A similar scenario unfolded on Dec. 10, when a crypto market pullback wiped out $1.7 billion in leveraged positions, marking the largest long liquidation of this cycle so far. Short-Term Volatility or a Bigger Trend? Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal attributed the sell-off to market unpreparedness for negative news amidst a month of bullish sentiment. “The market wasn’t braced for bad news, leading to indiscriminate selling. However, this seems like short-term angst rather than a prolonged downturn,” he stated . Other analysts echo this optimism. Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts hinted at a potential buying opportunity on the horizon. Similarly, Caleb Franzen, another prominent crypto analyst, contextualized the volatility as a natural occurrence during bull runs. Franzen pointed out that during the last bull cycle, Bitcoin experienced nine pullbacks over 16 months, all of which eventually gave way to higher highs. Fred Krueger, a Bitcoin maximalist, cautioned against using leverage in trading Bitcoin, highlighting it as a key factor in recent liquidations. Meanwhile, Hundal believes the crypto market’s next moves will hinge on expectations for the incoming Trump administration , which could bring significant changes to U.S. crypto policy. Crypto Santa Rally Still Possible? Despite the market turbulence, analysts remain hopeful for a “Santa rally” leading into the holiday season. Hundal stated that market participants should brace for volatility as the January 2025 inauguration of President Donald Trump approaches, with speculation around his plans for a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve fueling market dynamics .

Lightchain AI, the Polygon alternative, aims for a $20 target, promising a 6,666x return as it redefines blockchain with AI solutions. Table of Contents Why Lightchain AI is dubbed the Polygon alternative Can LCAI really reach $20? Why users should be paying attention to AI-blockchain crossovers Lightchain AI presale: A lucrative investment opportunity As the cryptocurrency market anticipates its next big movers, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a Polygon (MATIC) alternative with massive growth potential. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale , Lightchain AI is gaining attention for its smart use of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Expert traders predict that LCAI could reach $20 within the next 10 to 12 months, offering a staggering 6,666x return for early investors. Let’s dive into why Lightchain AI is being hailed as the next big thing in blockchain and how it stacks up against established players like Polygon. Why Lightchain AI is dubbed the Polygon alternative Lightchain AI is considered a Polygon alternative due to its smart approach to scalability and efficiency in blockchain technology. By integrating artificial intelligence through its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and employing a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, Lightchain AI enhances transaction throughput and reduces costs, similar to Polygon’s Layer 2 solutions. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world applications across various industries, such as healthcare and finance, positions it as a versatile platform for decentralized applications, much like Polygon’s ecosystem. Can LCAI really reach $20? According to expert traders, Lightchain AI’s price trajectory is backed by a combination of low initial entry, strong technology, and a growing market for AI applications. Key factors contributing to the $20 prediction include. Rapid adoption With its new technology and developer-friendly tools, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining traction among enterprises and developers. Market demand for AI The global AI market is expected to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2030, providing a significant growth opportunity for platforms like Lightchain AI. Deflationary tokenomics LCAI’s deflationary model ensures that as adoption grows, the token’s value will appreciate due to its built-in scarcity mechanisms. Upcoming mainnet launch The scheduled March 2025 mainnet launch will unlock the full potential of Lightchain AI’s ecosystem, attracting more investors and developers. With these factors in play, the $20 target is not only ambitious but achievable within the next 10 to 12 months. But many experts believe that LCAI’s growth potential extends far beyond the $20 mark.

This comes after Bitcoin’s price dropped 7%, hitting a low of $95,500 after achieving a historic high of $108,268, it lost about 12% of its value in just three days. US Bitcoin ETFs saw record withdrawals, with investors pulling out $672 million in a single day. This marks the largest outflow ever recorded, surpassing the previous record of $564 million set in May. The immediate catalyst was Bitcoin taking a nosedive at the critical level of $97K showing an extreme fear moment in the crypto market. The crypto market is in a panic situation as Trump’s policies might meet political resistance, market analysts like Arthur Hayes also predicted a severe market crash after Trump’s inauguration in January. Withdrawal Alert The majority of the outflows came from, Fidelity’s FBTC led with $208.6 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s BTC Mini Trust at $188.6 million and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB with $108.4 million. Grayscale’s GBTC saw $87.9 million leave, while Bitwise’s BITB saw $43.6 million exit. Furthermore, spot Ethereum ETFs also saw $60.5 million in outflows, ending an 18-day inflow streak. What Happened? The massive outflows are the aftermath of the US Federal Reserve’s negative stance on its recent rate cut. While the market was waiting for the Fed to complete its 100 basis, the Fed’s 0.25% drop in interest rate caused investors to panic. To make it worse, it hinted at fewer cuts in 2025, signaling a delay in regulations. Bitcoin’s price, along with other assets, saw sharp declines as traders reacted to these economic signals, leading to over $1 billion in leveraged liquidations. Short-Term Haul? However, the investor reaction is mixed. Since the indicators show a short-term haul, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is still showing a “greed” level of 74, suggesting that many investors are holding on to their positions, and anticipating a recovery. Many analysts are claiming this is an overreaction to the Fed’s comment and this will be a short-term fluctuation that happens after every Fed meeting. What’s Next for Bitcoin and ETFs? Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s price fluctuation is likely to continue, as global economic tensions are rising and regulatory issues are expected to delay. However, some ETFs, like WisdomTree’s Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), managed to attract new investments, indicating that not all investors are backing away. In short, the road ahead for Bitcoin will not be easy and it might see more outflows if the Fed maintains its stance over rate cuts in 2025. In such a scenario experts suggest holding on to your assets as the market will recover soon as new ETFs may flood the market sooner or later.",News|Bitcoin ETF|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 09:28:47

Four Altcoins Are Seeing A Buy Signal On The TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the TD Sequential signal that four different altcoins have seen on their 4-hour charts. The “TD Sequential” is an indicator from technical analysis (TA) used to locate probable turnaround points in a given asset’s price. Related Reading: Secret Bitcoin Driver: Exchanges Receiving $40 Million USDT Fuel Per Day The indicator involves two phases: the setup and countdown. During the first of these the setup, candles of the same color are counted up to nine. The nine candles don’t have to be consecutive. Once the counter hits nine, the setup is said to be complete, and the price could be assumed to have reached a reversal location. If the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were green, the TD Sequential would imply a top for the asset. Similarly, if they were red, the indicator would suggest a change of direction to the upside. The second phase, the countdown, begins as soon as the setup is over. This phase of the indicator works in the same manner, save for the fact that candles are meant to be counted up to thirteen instead this time. After the thirteen candles of the same polarity, another potential top or bottom could be considered to have been reached by the asset. Now, here are the charts shared by Martinez that show the completion of the TD Sequential phase of the first type for four altcoins: XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Maker (MKR), and Worldcoin (WLD). As is visible in the above graph, the four-hour prices of XRP, Solana, Maker, and Worldcoin have all completed a TD Sequential setup with nine red candles. This naturally means the indicator gives a buy signal for these altcoins. The pattern has taken shape as assets across the cryptocurrency sector have crashed following the US Federal Reserve taking a cautious approach towards further interest rate cuts.

XRP Price XRP slipped as low as under $2.18 during the crash earlier in the past day, but the coin appears to have seen a small rebound since then, as its price is now trading around the $2.31 mark.

Both coins are expected to climb even higher in 2025, with forecasts showing promising numbers. But while these tokens grab short-term interest, Rollblock’s potential stands out for bigger reasons. Its ongoing potential has already turned heads, raising more than $7 million and gaining momentum in the market. Unlike other projects, Rollblock combines utility and growth potential, giving investors a real opportunity to earn long-term rewards while enjoying the excitement of iGaming. Rollblock is confidently the next big winner Rollblock is changing online gambling with its innovative GambleFi platform. It combines blockchain technology and online casinos, giving players security, speed, and fun all in one place. Rollblock offers a major advantage: token holders get a share of weekly casino profits. The platform stands out with features that players love. It is licensed, so KYC is required to ensure users stay secure while enjoying fast crypto deposits and payouts. Rollblock offers many casino games, live sports betting, and a simple, user-friendly experience. RBLK, Rollblock’s token, adds even more value. Holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards and enjoy a buyback-and-burn system. This reduces the token supply, making $RBLK more valuable over time. Compared to PEPE and LTC , Rollblock’s focus on real-world use and passive income makes it a standout choice. For investors looking for innovation and consistent rewards, Rollblock might just be the next big winner. PEPE Coin – meme power and growth potential PEPE Coin saw an incredible 1,800% surge in 2024, turning heads across the crypto space. Forecasts for its future growth remain optimistic. Changelly expects its price to rise to $0.0000263 by December 2024, while Longforecast predicts a 16% increase by February 2025. Some scenarios even see PEPE reaching as high as $0.0036 next year. This meme-based coin appeals to younger investors because of its viral nature and community hype. However, tokens like PEPE Coin often lack practical use cases. Unlike utility-driven platforms like Rollblock, PEPE relies heavily on its popularity rather than offering real value or increasing its market cap through innovation. Litecoin (LTC) – stability and long-term growth LTC has shown strong performance in 2024, rising by 36.81% to trade at $119.20. Predictions for 2025 remain positive. CryptoNews expects LTC to climb to $213.16 by the end of the year. CoinGape forecasts an average of $204.04, with a peak at $227.56. Meanwhile, Cryptopolitan sees steady growth, projecting a minimum LTC price of $186.72. As a peer-to-peer payment coin, LTC offers stability and wide adoption for transactions. However, Rollblock sets itself apart with greater growth potential. Its thriving ecosystem, combined with rewards and increasing market cap , gives investors opportunities for consistent growth and valuable returns. Conclusion The growth potential for cryptocurrencies in 2025 looks promising, with coins like LTC and PEPE continuing to show steady progress. While cryptos like these remain a viable choice, Rollblock stands out as a stronger opportunity for investors. Its innovative approach, revenue-sharing model, and focus on rewards make it an attractive option. For those seeking long-term gains and diverse rewards, Rollblock offers far more than traditional tokens. Currently in presale at a low price of $0.0415, don’t miss out!

Imagine earning rewards just by participating in flight-related activities—whether through gaming, virtual simulations, or real-world travel. As the concepts of real-world asset tokenization (RWA) and the rapidly growing GameFi sector attract more investors, the F2E model is becoming an intriguing opportunity. With its potential to reshape how we think about both crypto and rewards, F2E is set to take off in ways many never expected. The RWA market is currently valued at around $19 billion, while the GameFi sector is worth about $22.7 billion. As blockchain technology and Web3 protocols continue to gain mainstream adoption, the F2E model is expected to grow significantly in the years ahead. F2E and Virtual Reality The F2E concept has primarily been linked to virtual reality, especially in gaming and simulation industries. For example, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 lets players earn in-game currency and other virtual rewards by completing flights and missions. This gamified experience is a big attraction for aviation and gaming enthusiasts alike. Blockchain and Earning Through Flight Games Some blockchain and cryptocurrency companies are now adopting similar models to turn virtual flying into an opportunity to earn crypto. BlockAirGame, for instance, is creating an F2E model where users can win crypto assets like Polygon (POL) by playing flight-related games. This combines the excitement of gaming with blockchain rewards. In the real world, several startups are also exploring the F2E concept. One example is Satoshi Airlines, which launched the Fly-to-Earn app. This app blends air travel with blockchain technology, allowing users to earn rewards for their participation. Spexi’s Investment and Growth Earlier this month, Spexi, a network focused on ultra-high-resolution drone imagery, raised $11.5 million in a Series A funding round led by BlockChange Ventures. This investment will help Spexi expand its services globally, contributing to the growth of the F2E space.

Investors ended a 15-day streak of inflows by withdrawing a net $671.9 million from the 11 ETFs, the largest single-day tally since their inception on Jan. 11, according to data from Coinglass and Farside Investors . Fidelity's FBTC and Grayscale's GBTC led the outflows, losing $208.5 million and $188.6 million, respectively. Other funds registered outflows, too, and BlackRock's IBIT scored its first zero in several weeks. Bitcoin extended its post-Fed losses Thursday, falling to $96,000, down nearly 10% from the record high of $108,268 seen early this week. The bearish sentiment was mirrored in the derivatives market, where the annualized premium in the CME's regulated one-month bitcoin futures fell to 9.83%, the lowest in over a month, according to data source Amberdata. A decline in the premium means cash-and-carry arbitrage bets involving a long position in the ETF and a short position in the CME futures yield less than they did earlier. As such, the ETFs may continue to see weak demand in the short-term. Ether ETFs also registered a net outflow, $60.5 million. That's the first since Nov. 21.

The plaintiffs argue that the token was misleadingly presented as having shareholder-like benefits, violating securities regulations. Notably, Hailey Welch, associated with the project, is not named as a defendant and will not be directly involved in the legal proceedings. Hawk Tuah’s launch in early December garnered significant attention in the meme coin market. The token quickly reached a market cap of $500 million but crashed within 20 minutes, leaving many investors with losses. The lawsuit claims that the token’s promoters targeted the U.S. market and failed to register it as a security, violating regulatory requirements. Rather than focusing solely on the sudden collapse, the lawsuit highlights concerns about the token’s distribution and its allegedly misleading structure. The plaintiffs allege that the company behind Hawk Tuah, overHere Ltd, suggested token holders would have shareholder-like rights. However, they claim the distribution was unequal and did not deliver on these promises. By focusing on securities law violations, the lawsuit aims to hold the company accountable through a strong legal argument. Meme coins continue to face scrutiny for their reliance on hype and celebrity endorsements, which often fuel fraudulent schemes. While rug pulls have decreased in 2024, the volatile nature of these tokens still presents risks for investors. High-profile figures, including celebrities and influencers , can amplify the appeal of questionable assets, further exposing the market to potential scams. In some cases, even hacked celebrity accounts have been used to promote fraudulent meme coins. Hailey Welch’s association with Hawk Tuah has drawn attention, though she remains uninvolved in the lawsuit. Her credibility within the community, however, may suffer regardless of the legal outcome.

Yet, investors remain bullish and shift their attention to rising stars that could surge 10X. One such newcomer is Crypto All-Stars ($STARS), which raised over $1 million in the past 24 hours. The project introduces the world’s first unified meme coin staking platform, MemeVault. Degens and HODLers can now earn passive yields from legendary tokens like $DOGE, $PEPE, and $SHIB. FOMO intensifies as the presale ends in four hours–investors rush to secure their share of Crypto All-Stars and triple their MemeVault staking rewards. MemeVault Brings Top Meme Coins Under One Umbrella, Offers Up to 1,362% Staking APY MemeVault is unique in the sense that it builds upon the success of all popular meme coins. Whether you stand for dogs, frogs, or Japanese cats , MemeVault welcomes everyone wishing to grow their holdings. Upon launch, MemeVault will support 11 top meme coins, but more will become available along the way. The current known APYs are as follows: $DOGE (287%), $SHIB (125%), $PEPE (1,267%), $WIF (1,362%), and $BRETT (104%). On top of that, $STARS is a utility token concealed as a meme coin. It’s meant to be held because it triples your MemeVault staking rewards. Its integral role in the ecosystem future-proofs $STARS, as HODLing creates scarcity and drives demand for remaining tokens in circulation. $STARS puts your otherwise zero-utility meme coins to work, all under one umbrella–isn’t it visionary? Experts Predict $STARS to 10X After Listing $STARS will be available at $0.0016782 for the next four hours if tokens don’t sell out earlier. Early supporters can still stake their $STARS at a 140% APY to maximize potential returns. Staking rewards will be distributed over two years at a rate of 2801.44 $STARS per ETH block. With over $25M raised, $STARS resembles another hot meme coin launch, Pepe Unchained ($PEPU), which surged over 230% in two days after raising $73M on presale. While the projects aren’t affiliated, both display strong utility and early momentum, which suggests $STARS could follow in $PEPU’s footsteps. Key opinion leaders like ClayBro already recognize $STARS’ potential and predict its price will 10X after listing. While the project team doesn’t disclose specific listing platforms, the community anticipates $STARS to first launch on high-liquidity DEXs like Uniswap and later on tier-1 CEXs like Binance. It’s true that tier-1 platforms only list legitimate projects. That’s why Crypto All-Stars passed independent audits by Coinsult and SolidProof , which identified no vulnerabilities or bugs in its code and certified that user funds are safe. Time Waits for No Man, So Act Now Time is ticking, so hurry up if you want to get $STARS at a below-listing price. Given that it appeals to the communities of all famous meme coins, the demand will only continue to grow, so there might be another chance to buy $STARS cheap like now. To buy $STARS, visit the official Crypto All-Stars presale , connect your wallet, and swap $ETH, $BNB, or $USDT for $STARS. You can also pay with a bank card if this is your first crypto bull run.

The broader cryptocurrency market entered a bearish state following yesterday’s FOMC meeting, with BTC falling below $100K. DOGE’s drop has brought it close to critical support levels, sparking speculation about whether it could dip below $0.2 soon. Will Dogecoin Price Drop Below $0.2 Soon? Crypto Expert tweeted on X post highlighting Dogecoin’s recent price trends, noting a potential key support level at $0.22076. The analysis suggests the Dogecoin price is undergoing a corrective phase after a significant 25% dip, raising concerns about a possible fall below $0.20 support levels. According to the crypto analyst, a rebound from $0.22076 could propel the meme coin toward ambitious targets at $0.40894 and $0.65557, marking a potential 165% rally. Market observers now watch closely as DOGE approaches this critical support level, awaiting signs of recovery or further decline. Source: X Why Is the Dogecoin Price Going Down? After the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Dogecoin price dropped alongside a widespread cryptocurrency market downturn. The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 25 basis points, as anticipated. However, Chair Jerome Powell stated there may be no further cuts in 2025. He also clarified that the central bank cannot purchase Bitcoin, despite prior political promises. Bitcoin’s decline to $100,000 triggered bearish sentiment, impacting memecoins, including Dogecoin, which saw sharp losses. Most top altcoins also experienced heavy selling pressure, evident from red candlesticks across price charts. DOGE Price Analysis The latest DOGE price hovered at $0.3066 on Dec. 20, marking a sharp 15% drop. Dogecoin underperformed the broader crypto market, which fell by 6%. This decline pushed DOGE below its critical $0.35 support. Over the past week, the Dogecoin price has seen a decrease of more than 25%, highlighting mounting challenges for the meme-based cryptocurrency amid increasing market pressure. On the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 19, inidcating an oversold. If bearish momentum continues, the Dogecoin Price prediction may slide further to test the $0.20 level. Despite these signs, a potential reversal could emerge if bulls defend key support zones effectively. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView Dogecoin price faces critical support levels as bearish momentum looms. While recovery is possible, traders remain cautious, watching for signs of reversal or a deeper decline below $0.20.

Gambling and Bitcoin in play,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xi-jinping-china-macau-hk-gambling-bitcoin/,"On Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the need for Macau to prioritize economic diversification as its “first” objective during a three-day visit to the Chinese gambling hub. The trip marked the 25th anniversary of Macau’s handover from Portugal, as the city aims to expand its role within China’s mainland economic framework. According to a Financial Times report , Xi made these remarks at the swearing-in ceremony of Macau’s new chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, who is the city’s fourth leader since the 1999 handover. Sam, Macau’s first leader born in mainland China who arguably has weaker ties to the business sector than his predecessors, is seen as aligned with Beijing’s push for diversification beyond the gambling industry, which currently accounts for 80% of the city’s tax revenue. Xi Jinping urges Macau to diversify its economy “ First, Macau should focus on promoting appropriate economic diversification, ” Xi urged, encouraging increased policy support and investment in emerging industries. He also stressed the importance of aligning Macau’s development with national strategies, including integration with the Greater Bay Area, a regional economic zone comprising Hong Kong , Macau, and Guangdong province. Anthony Lawrance, founder of consultancy Intelligence Macau, believes Xi’s visit will be influential in the city’s growth. “ It will be the first time that he heaps praise on Macau for a job well done. His previous trips were to admonish and cajole ,” he remarked. Macau’s gambling industry, the cornerstone of its economy, has thrived since the liberalization of its gaming monopoly in 2002, attracting investments from global casino giants like Las Vegas Sands, MGM, and Wynn. However, the city’s reliance on visitors from mainland China made it vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic, when stringent travel restrictions led to economic stagnation . Recent data suggests the city is pacing itself into recovery. In the first 11 months of 2024, Macau’s gross gaming revenue increased by 26.8% year-on-year to MOP 208.58 billion (US$25.8 billion), representing 77.4% of its pre-Covid level in 2019. Visitation also surged, with 29.05 million visitors in the first 10 months of 2024, marking a 28.1% increase compared to the previous year and nearing 87% over pre-pandemic levels. Hong Kong’s economic diversification rivals Mainland China In contrast to Macau, neighboring Hong Kong has successfully diversified its economy for years now. The city recently approved four cryptocurrency exchanges as part of efforts to establish itself as a global hub for digital asset trading. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission granted licenses to Accumulus GBA Technology, DFX Labs Company, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX, and Thousand Whales Technology, bringing the total number of licensed platforms in the city to seven. Previously approved platforms include HashKey, OSL, and HKVAX. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China, has traditionally operated under the “one country, two systems” framework, a policy introduced by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s. This arrangement allowed Hong Kong to maintain a high degree of autonomy in managing its own affairs, distinguishing it from mainland China . When Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997, Beijing pledged to preserve the region’s unique characteristics. As part of this agreement, China promised to uphold Hong Kong’s capitalist system and grant the city freedoms not available in mainland Chinese cities for fifty years. The freedom allowed Hong Kong to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, which took effect in April 2023, to issue licenses for all virtual asset service providers. Mainland China has been reluctant to follow the trend. While cryptocurrency trading is banned in mainland China, Hong Kong residents are allowed to purchase digital assets, which is why the city’s projected revenue from online gambling could surpass $600 million in 2024, as revealed by Statista.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana’s massive 10,000% surge since 2020 set records. Now, analysts highlight a DeFi altcoin with the potential to match that growth in 2025. Table of Contents Solana set for 5th bullish wave Remittix: The PayFi powerhouse set to dominate the $250t cross-border payment market Final words Solana (SOL) is one of the most trending cryptocurrencies in the market today. Over the years, its price has increased by more than 10,000%. Sadly, only a few people were lucky to have entered at the beginning. Now, as the market continues to heat up for 2025, one DeFi coin is emerging with a similar trajectory. The new entrant called Remittix (RTX) is tapping into a trillion-dollar sector to give its holders more gains than SOL has for those who missed one of the best cryptocurrency investment opportunities in history. Solana set for 5th bullish wave The Solana coin is among the best-performing coins in the market today. Its price increase in the last three years has been exponential. Solana’s price had previously fallen to $12 after the FTX exchange collapsed in 2022. Surprisingly, the Solana token produced an overwhelming price performance last year, crossing $150. Today, the altcoin is part of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the market according to market cap. CoinMarketCap data shows the value of the Solana crypto has spiked by 2.2% on the weekly chart. It is currently trading just below the $200 mark as it seeks to reach new highs in the coming months. A top analyst called Titan of Crypto predicts the value of Solana could pump to $400. According to him, SOL has retested the neckline of a cup and handle pattern and is now ready for an upward move. Another expert called King Charts noted the cryptocurrency is ready for the fifth bullish wave. This wave could push the altcoin past its current all-time high to $350. At the moment, the technical indicators of Solana are bullish. The relative strength index is below 50 which is the oversold region. The token has hit bottom and could be ready for the next leg up. The Hull Moving Average (9) is even showing a buy signal which supports the uptrend.

This marks a big step forward in resolving the aftermath of one of the crypto world’s most notable hacks. Hacked Victims Finally Receive $225 Million In a recent press release Grant Thornton, the liquidating firm overseeing Cryptopia’s case, confirmed that over 10,000 verified account holders have received payouts totaling more than $225 million in crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin. These distributions were made possible after years of hard-working efforts to identify users and verify millions of transactions from nearly a million accounts. Cryptopia’s claims portal, launched in 2020 , was a crucial tool in this process. Liquidators worked to ensure the payouts were aligned with a court decision from March 2020, which clarified how assets should be returned to users. More Funds to Be Distributed This initial distribution is just the beginning. Grant Thornton plans additional payouts for verified users, with the potential for “top-up” distributions for those who haven’t yet received their full holdings. These top-ups will likely use unclaimed assets from users who fail to register on the claims portal before the final cut-off dates. The liquidators have urged all remaining account holders to complete their registration on the portal to qualify for future distributions. New rounds of payouts are expected in the coming year, giving hope to more users waiting to recover their funds. The Cryptopia Hack Cryptopia , once New Zealand’s largest crypto exchange with 1.4 million users, was at its peak in 2018. It played a pioneering role in the local crypto space, even launching a stablecoin in 2017. However, the exchange’s story took a dark turn in January 2019 when a hack resulted in the loss of $16 million worth of crypto assets. Shortly after, Cryptopia went into liquidation, owing $4.2 million to creditors. Perhaps, the recent payouts give hope to thousands of affected users, showing that even in difficult cases, solutions can be found.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-20 09:49:41

However, a rival coin, Rexas Finance (RXS), guarantees even more profits. With a ground-breaking 38x gain expected, RXS may turn the same investment into $38,000, redefining crypto prospects. XRP’s Impressive Growth Trajectory Rising use in cross-border payments, good legal results, and growing investor confidence all explain XRP’s notable expansion. Analysts predict a 7x increase in the token’s price over the next two months. XRP’s ability to maintain a strong pan assertiveness in the crypto market has driven hope about its near-term future. Should this become a $1,000 XRP investment now, it might expand to $7,000, highlighting its attraction as a profitable prospect for anyone wishing to profit from its momentum. Several essential factors justify the expected 7x surge in XRP’s price. XRP’s strategic emphasis on transforming cross-border transactions has helped it become a major player in the payments sector as institutions increasingly use its technology. Its use has improved, and market confidence has been raised by its alliances with big financial institutions. XRP is a top competitor in the altcoin market because its potential for exponential expansion is intact, even if the larger crypto industry is also gaining strength. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Rival Coin Poised to Outperform XRP Gains Unquestionably, XRP has great development potential, but a competitor coin called Rexas Finance (RXS) is starting to revolutionize the crypto scene. By linking real-world assets (RWA) and blockchain technology, Rexas Finance presents an unmatched investment possibility that might surpass XRP’s gains. Although XRP is predicted to show a 7x gain, Rexas Finance’s potential for a startling 38x rally could turn a $1,000 investment into $38,000, much above XRP’s returns. Rexas Finance (RXS) transforms the blockchain scene by tokenizing actual assets, allowing users to buy, sell, or fractionalize assets effortlessly. RXS is building an ecosystem whereby almost any physical or intangible asset, from real estate and art to intellectual property and goods, may be expressed on the blockchain. This transforming strategy democratizes access to profitable investment prospects and removes obstacles to worldwide asset ownership. Users of Rexas Finance can tokenize assets from anywhere in the globe at any moment, opening countless opportunities. The presale success of Rexas Finance emphasizes its enormous possibilities. Priced at $0.15 as of writing, the presale, in its 10th stage, has generated an impressive $28.77 million after selling out its 9th stage ahead of time. This quick acceptance highlights investors’ increasing faith in Rexas Finance’s ambition and value. Unlike many other ventures, Rexas Finance, stressing its dedication to community-driven development, chose against venture capital financing. This choice is now popular for investors looking for long-term value, strengthening its credibility and attractiveness even more. Rexas Finance (RXS) Future Outlook Several elements influence the price momentum of Rexas Finance. Its CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listing have created a lot of hype and drawn more project funding. Furthermore, RWA tokenization is becoming increasingly sought after, so Rexas Finance is positioned to profit from this trend. Analysts anticipate a 38x rally in its price and a surge to $5.7. Rexas Finance is one of the most successful altcoins, able to provide unmatched returns for early adopters, and this explosive increase would make it among them. Although XRP and Rexas Finance provide interesting prospects, their investing potentials differ. XRP is a dependable alternative for investors looking for consistent development because of its well-known market presence and emphasis on cross-border payments. However, Rexas Finance’s revolutionary approach to RWA tokenization makes it a high-growth option with the potential to exceed XRP. With its 7x gain, a $1,000 investment in XRP is expected to expand to $7,000; similarly, the amount invested in Rexas Finance may generate $38,000, a 38x increase. In conclusion, XRP’s expected 7x surge makes it a desirable investment choice since it can make a $1,000 difference in two months.

According to a Dec. 20 announcement , the Solana-based meme coin will now be accessible to over 24 million Robinhood users. BONK became the fifth meme coin to be listed on the Menlo Park unicorn, which initially started offering crypto trading in February 2018. Robinhood listings typically lead to short-term price surges for newly added tokens, as seen with Dogwifhat ( WIF ) and Pepe ( PEPE ). WIF, the second meme coin listed in November, jumped 8.2% within an hour of the announcement, mirroring Pepe’s earlier price action . However, BONK ‘s price failed to capitalize on the listing, though it managed to recover some losses from the past 24 hours amid a broader market downturn. The meme coin exhibited notable volatility, dropping to an intra-day low of $0.00002671 before rallying to $0.00003094 following the listing announcement. It later settled around $0.00002905 at the time of writing, down over 4.5% on the day.

The meme coin market tumbled 9.96% in the past 24 hours, bringing its total market cap to $94.77 billion at press time. The decline is even more pronounced when compared to the monthly high of $137.06 billion reached on Dec. 9. Smaller tokens like Peanut the Squirrel and Brett have borne the brunt of the sell-off, as Bitcoin’s dip below $100,000 rattled retail investors and sent shockwaves through the speculative meme coin space. Upon writing, one Bitcoin was selling for $97,856. BONK experienced a similar sell-off, as data from Nansen showed an uptick in net flows over the past 7 days, which means more tokens were being deposited than withdrawn, typically seen as a sign that traders might be positioning to cash out. However, that metric has flipped negative over the past 24 hours, suggesting the Robinhood listing has reignited interest among investors. BONK token exchange flows | source: Nansen BONK’s price could gain momentum from its upcoming “BURNmas” event , which plans to burn 810.57 billion tokens initially, with the ultimate goal of burning 1 trillion tokens based on ecosystem activity.

Its growing appeal is driven by advanced technological integration, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, presenting it as a forward-looking project with high growth potential and immense community support. Here, we will spotlight said AI altcoin and explain why XRP and LINK holders demand it! IntelMarkets Sees Increased Demand From Investors: Here’s Why! Investors in established coins like XRP and LINK are showing interest in IntelMarkets (INTL) . Per recent data, more than $4.9 million has been invested in the AI altcoin amid its ongoing public presale, reflecting significant interest in INTL. INTL is a driving force in the IntelMarkets ecosystem, facilitating activities like trading, governance participation, and accessing incentives. Holders can also access tools like AI-powered robots for increased profitability. IntelMarkets is a perpetual contracts exchange where traders can engage in speculative asset trading. The platform stands out from other perpetual contract exchanges in that traders can hold a position longer or indefinitely, which is impossible on traditional exchanges. The firm operates on a dual-chain wheel spun by Ethereum and Solana. It integrated Ethereum so users can access smart contracts, liquidity pools, and decentralized applications. Meanwhile, Solana’s integration is geared towards achieving scalability and cost-friendly solutions. Given the vast role INTL plays in the IntelMarkets ecosystem, it is considered an essential part of this blockchain project. Its value proposition has brought it before XRP and LINK investors as a good crypto to buy. Analyst Foresees Ripple’s XRP Surpassing $4: Here’s Why! In his latest analysis, the wide-followed technical analyst Ali Martinez has painted a b3ullish future for XRP. Taking to X on December 17, 2024, Ali revealed a bullish pennant pattern formed by XRP’s sideways movement. This pattern is often a prelude to an explosive upward move for an asset. Ali stated that if Ripple’s XRP pushes past $2.60, it will get the ball rolling on its subsequent ascent to $4 and above. He substantiated this projection with the Fibonacci tool, highlighting price points where the Ripple coin would experience notable shifts. After the $2.60 level is beat, Ali’s Fibonacci levels at 2.414 ($3.63), 2.618 ($3.83), and 3.0 ($4.25) are potential milestones to watch out for. Despite this projection, Ripple investors have expanded to the AI altcoin INTL to boost their potential return. Nevertheless, Ripple’s XRP currently trades at $2.56, up 14.28% this week. Chainlink’s Chart Hints at an Inbound Explosive Move Chainlink is making rounds lately as LINK hints at a potential big move. The chart shows that Chainlink’s LINK broke out of a protracted downward trend in November 2024 and has continued climbing as buyers step in. However, the Chainlink coin price faces resistance between $28 and $30. These levels halted LINK’s upside rally, leading investors to take profits and buy into other AI altcoins like INTL. Meanwhile, more red candlesticks appear on the LINK price chart, suggesting that the bears are beginning to test the bulls’ grit. Failure to hold them off will see LINK drop as low as $24. The following support after $24 would be $21 and $19, which would be alarming for those who bought at the top. LINK trades at $28.11, with a 30.19% weekly gain. The INTL AI Altcoin Sees Investment From XRP And LINK Investors XRP and LINK investors have added INTL to their crypto investment list to diversify into, considering it is a good crypto to invest in for massive gains. INTL sells for $0.073 in Stage 8 of its public presale, with early investors already drenched in over 700% gains. When the INTL AI altcoin hits $0.110, its listing price, Stage 1 investors will have made 1,100% gains, while Stage 8 investors will receive a 50% profit.

And in this line, different crypto projects continue seeking a surge in value with analysts monitoring all relevant market dynamics. Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and the emerging DTX Exchange are capturing significant attention for different reasons amidst the current up and down crypto wave. Each project has unique qualities and potential, but let us see why DTX Exchange is positioned to stand out as a revolutionary force in the trading space. Solana’s (SOL) Current Position in the Journey for $350 Solana, one of the most popular blockchain projects for speed, is a strong name, with its processing ability that exceeds 65,000 transactions in one second. Hence, Solana is a favorite for decentralized applications and NFT products. It has been suggested among experts that SOL may touch a price target of $350 sooner than later, say by the year 2025. But to do that, the token would need to experience a drastic turn around on its current downward trend. After a rally in November 2024 that took it to an all-time high, the price of SOL has steadily dropped by 13% over the past month and is now around $210, testing a critical support level. A popular consensus is that Solana needs to find a way around its constant liquidity shortages and revamp institutional support to get back on the $350 track. Source: CoinMarketCap And while investors will always stick with a reputable asset like SOL, DTX Exchange is attracting many institutions with its features that support diverse and large-scale investments. Resilient Ripple (XRP) as a Top Contender in the Crypto Landscape Ripple has always shown that it will not fade away in the cryptocurrency market. Following the legal win against SEC, Ripple is well back as a reliable payment solutions provider. Analysts constantly rave about XRP’s growth potential after a 111% bull run from a month ago. Currently trading around $2.38, XRP is projected to reach $3 by early 2025. But the fact that it dropped in price by over 6% since yesterday also signals that XRP is not immune to market volatility and will definitely experience slumps even though the overall trajectory is positive. Source: CoinMarketCap Innovative features like RippleNet and increasing institutional adoption are primary drivers behind this optimism. However, DTX Exchange stands as a top alternative option catching the eye of investors. DTX Exchange Positioning Itself as the Future of Trading DTX Exchange is slowly coming up as a game-changer in the trading industry. With a mix of traditional and blockchain-based trading, DTX Exchange provides something different from others like Solana and Ripple. It is the first platform where you can trade stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex and others. In addition, DTX’s technology infrastructure is cutting-edge, including the Phoenix Wallet, a secure and efficient tool for managing various assets. Additionally, the exchange plans to introduce a platform for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), further expanding its utility. The platform’s commitment to quality and security is evident in its successful audit by SolidProof and its preview listing on CoinMarketCap. It is also a plus that early participants benefit from profit shares and voting rights. These positive investment features make DTX Exchange an interesting prospect to institutions and large-scale, who have a high volume of investment across different asset classes. As such, DTX is reflecting strong investor confidence. Its ongoing presale (in its sixth stage at $0.12) has raised over $10 million, and the community has grown to over 160,000 engaged members. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, DTX Exchange offers unparalleled opportunities with its robust features and community-driven growth.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-20 10:00:59

This is the first phase of Cryptopia’s distribution plan since it went bankrupt in 2020.

Grant Thornton, the public accountancy firm in charge of liquidating Cryptopia’s assets to customers, said that liquidators have been working towards identifying users to proceed with return payments since the launch of Cryptopia’s claim portal four years ago, following Justice David Gendall’s 2020 verdict. The firm revealed that 10,000 accounts is just the tip of the iceberg, as the exchange has an estimated total of 960,000 users entitled to compensation after the crypto exchange’s untimely demise. “This complex process also involved rebuilding the hacked cryptocurrency exchange and reconciling millions of transactions from nearly 960,000 users,” said Grant Thornton.

For now, Grant Thornton stated that it will continue to remind account holders to register on the portal and take the necessary steps to meet the requirements for future distributions. “The liquidators will give account holders notice of the soft cut-off date in the coming days. Further distributions for newly verified users are planned for the new year,” the firm added. Cryptopia went bankrupt in 2019, after the exchange suffered a hack that cost the exchange a loss of around $16 million in crypto assts. In May 2019, liquidators estimated that the exchange owed creditors an estimated total of $4.2 million.

This collaboration revolves around OpenEden’s tokenized T-bills (TBILL tokens), which allow investors to access low-risk, yield-generating assets backed by U.S. Treasury Bills. By utilizing Ripple USD (RLUSD) and other stablecoins, the partnership highlights a pivotal advancement in digital asset investment strategies. XRPL’s Institutional-Grade Features The XRPL’s robust infrastructure is equipped to support institutional-grade financial applications, making it an ideal platform for tokenization efforts such as OpenEden’s TBILL tokens. With features like Automated Market Maker (AMM), Decentralized Identifier (DID), Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT) capability, a Lending Protocol, and native Oracle support, XRPL creates a strong foundation for Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. The platform’s ability to integrate with stablecoins, including RLUSD, further strengthens its appeal to institutional and retail investors. As highlighted by OpenEden Co-Founder Jeremy Ng, the introduction of tokenized T-bills to XRPL marks a transformative moment. This development not only enhances the accessibility of yield-generating assets but also positions XRPL as a key player in bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. How the Integration Works OpenEden’s platform offers a streamlined approach for XRP holders to participate in earning passive income through tokenized T-bills. The process involves four simple steps: Acquiring Stablecoins: Investors can convert XRP into Ripple USD or another supported stablecoin directly on the XRPL. Minting TBILL Tokens: Using OpenEden’s platform, stablecoins such as RLUSD are deposited to mint TBILL tokens. These tokens are backed by U.S. Treasury Bills, ensuring low-risk exposure. Earning Passive Income: Holders of TBILL tokens earn regular interest from the yield generated by T-bills. Yields are paid in RLUSD, providing a consistent and reliable income stream. Flexible Options: Investors can choose to reinvest their earnings, redeem their TBILL tokens for stablecoins, or trade them for XRP or other digital assets on the XRPL. This seamless process allows investors to access high-grade financial instruments while taking full advantage of the transparency, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness offered by blockchain technology.

The partnership’s $75 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) underscores the growing market confidence in this innovative approach. By integrating stablecoins and tokenized RWAs into the XRPL, this initiative expands the utility of the XRP ecosystem beyond traditional remittance use cases. As the XRPL-OpenEden partnership continues to evolve, it showcases the potential for blockchain-based ecosystems to revolutionize traditional finance by offering secure, scalable, and profitable investment options to a global audience.

Movement ( MOVE ) recorded the highest gains among the top 100 largest crypto assets on Dec. 20, reaching an intraday high of $0.877 and closing with a market capitalization of nearly $2 billion. The altcoin’s price rally coincided with a 63% rise in daily trading volume, which exceeded $1.6 billion, indicating growing interest among traders. Additionally, CoinGlass data reveals that open interest in its futures market surged to an all-time high of $103.93 million, nearly double the $56.03 million recorded the previous day, signaling a jump in demand among traders. Why is MOVE rising? The major driver of the altcoin’s gains appears to be tied to its partnership with leading digital asset custody and security company BitGo, which will bring WBTC (a tokenized version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain) onto Movement’s mainnet. By incorporating WBTC, Movement aims to enhance its DeFi offerings, providing users with more options for asset utilization, liquidity provision, and participation in decentralized financial services. Movement’s price surge can also be attributed to the launch of its mainnet last week. As an Ethereum layer-2 network powered by MoveVM, Movement issued its native token, MOVE, last week. A portion of these tokens was distributed to early adopters and community members. Further, MOVE has gained significant traction by securing listings on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Upbit. You might also like: Can your crypto portfolio beat the market? Whales are buying these altcoins Movement kickstarted the token’s launch with an $830 million airdrop. Projects that combine a large user base, substantial airdrops, and strong exchange support often experience initial price spikes before stabilizing. The altcoin’s rally came as the broader crypto market slumped 9.1% over the past day, standing at $3.39 trillion when writing, fuelled by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) drop below the $100k level , which led to a cascading effect across the broader altcoin market with leading assets like Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ) and BNB ( BNB ) all posting losses over the past day. MOVE could rally to $1 again Experts suggest that MOVE could continue to rally in the coming weeks, with the price likely returning to $1 and potentially surpassing it. According to a crypto trading signal community on X, Rose Premium Signals, MOVE could continue its rally, potentially reaching $1.3, which represents an increase of approximately 60% from its current price levels. Meanwhile, analyst Globe Of Crypto observed that MOVE recently broke out of a bullish pennant pattern in the 4-hour time frame. Such a breakout typically signals a continuation of an asset’s price rally. Based on this, the analyst predicts that MOVE could rise by another 40-50%, potentially surpassing $1 in the next week.
