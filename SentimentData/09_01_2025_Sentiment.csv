With Remittix aiming to redefine the PayFi sector, its early funding phase has drawn significant attention from established meme coins. As the Dogecoin price stabilizes and PEPE faces competition, RTX joins the league of contenders in 2025. This article explores all three tokens for crypto enthusiasts looking for the next major breakout. Remittix: A PayFi Revolution In The Making The Remittix presale is gaining momentum as it captures the attention of early adopters and investors eager to ride the wave of the PayFi revolution. With its mission to transform cross-border payments by integrating blockchain technology and traditional financial systems, Remittix stands poised to redefine how money moves globally. What’s driving the hype? For one, the presale introduces a tiered token allocation system designed to reward early participation. Each block of tokens is sold at a fixed price, with subsequent blocks unlocking at higher price thresholds. This structure not only incentivizes early investments but also reflects confidence in the token’s long-term growth potential. The presale’s appeal is amplified by Remittix’s robust use cases. From enabling businesses to accept crypto payments via its Pay API to offering seamless fiat conversions for personal remittances, the platform addresses both niche and broad financial challenges. Investors are particularly drawn to its flat-fee structure, which eliminates hidden costs and ensures transparency—qualities that resonate in today’s evolving financial landscape. DOGE Faces Network Slowdown In 2025 The Dogecoin price has faced persistent selling pressure, with its price declining by 18% over the past month. The DOGE decline is partly attributed to reduced retail interest and stagnation in network activity. Technical indicators paint a bearish picture, with the RSI trending below 40, signaling weakened buying momentum. Furthermore, DOGE’s decline in active addresses and hodler’s balance support the bearish sentiment. DOGE has failed to sustain critical support at $0.065, leading analysts to eye the next support level at $0.050. With no major updates or collaborations, investor confidence in DOGE appears to be waning, potentially leading to further declines. Large Scale PEPE Dump Following Negative Netflows PEPE has seen a sharp 22% decline in its price over the past month, wiping out much of its prior gains. The coin’s poor performance is linked to decreasing transaction volumes and waning interest among speculative investors. Its RSI has slipped into oversold territory, but there’s no sign of a PEPE recovery as the MACD remains firmly negative. Adding to the challenges, PEPE has seen consistent negative netflow, suggesting large-scale dumping by early adopters. The coin is now trading dangerously close to a key support level of $0.000015. A breach of this level could trigger a cascading sell-off, pushing PEPE to test lower levels. Without strong use cases or renewed market interest, PEPE’s prospects for recovery remain dim. Conclusion As DOGE and PEPE face mounting challenges, the Remittix presale shines as a beacon for investors seeking growth in the PayFi sector. At just $0.0193, now is the perfect time to join the presale and secure a stake in a project poised to lead the financial revolution. Don’t wait—invest in Remittix today!

This follows Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s announcement of his resignation on January 7, in the wake of the abrupt departure of his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland. The Endorsement Musk shared a video of Poilievre discussing inflation and fiscal policy on X, captioning it, “Perfectly articulated.” As the Conservative Party leader, he is now widely seen as the frontrunner to succeed Trudeau, with Canada’s federal election scheduled for October 20, 2025. The video has gained a lot of attention, particularly from the cryptocurrency community, which has rallied behind him due to his pro-crypto stance and advocacy for innovation. The opposition leader has been a long-time supporter of Bitcoin, frequently appearing on digital asset podcasts and advocating for Canada to become the “blockchain capital of the world.” In his 2022 campaign, he made his backing of the flagship cryptocurrency clear by using it to pay for shawarma, a move reminiscent of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s purchase of burgers in New York’s PubKey bar, using BTC. A few weeks later, he donated $100 worth of Bitcoin to the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Additionally, he pledged to remove taxes on crypto donations if he became Prime Minister. The 45-year-old has also made several pro-crypto statements. On one occasion, he argued that “Canadians should have the freedom to use other forms of money, like Bitcoin,” criticizing the government for “ruining” the country’s fiat currency. Poilievre has also been an outspoken critic of Canada’s central bank. In April 2022, he attributed the North American nation’s record inflation to the institution’s controversial policies. He also said that alternatives like Bitcoin were essential in addressing Canada’s economic challenges. Further, a Reuters report from April last year showed that the 45-year-old voiced his support for legislation that would block the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the country. Poilievre’s Odds and Vancouver’s Bitcoin Moves Data from the prediction market Polymarket shows that Poilievre has an 89% chance of winning the upcoming election, far ahead of the next closest contender, Chrystia Freeland, who has just a 7% chance. In related news, on December 11, Vancouver’s City Council approved a motion put forward by Mayor Ken Sim, suggesting the city consider holding Bitcoin in reserve and accepting cryptocurrency payments for municipal services. Local media revealed that the proposal passed along party lines, with Sim and ABC Vancouver councilors in favor, while two Green councilors opposed it. Sim has also committed to donating $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in support of the initiative. “Bitcoin is the number one performing asset on the planet over the last 16 years, so to not even look at including it as a part of a diversified portfolio is, I think, reckless,” he said.

This page is going to be dedicated to the games that we can consider underrated in the gambling industry. As there are so many big games now that players can play, we understand that some players are unlikely to try new games that they may not like when they have games that they love. However, we think that going into these games with an open mind could help you find some new favorites. Bingo Bingo is a massive part of gambling and has been for decades now. However, with the recent technological advancements in the gambling industry, the popularity of bingo on online casinos has become an underrated part of the industry. Not only is playing online bingo as fun as it would be in the bingo halls, but it is also easier to play. Playing bingo in person requires you to find a bingo hall and be out while you play, however, playing online allows players to play online bingo wherever they want. As well as this, there are even more options available for bingo players who play online, with some games having higher winning potential or different themes entirely, the experience is crafted to give players whatever they want. As well as this, you have different types of bingo games, like slingo which we will get into later, that allows players to find the exact type of game they want at any time and in any place. Slingo Slot Games Now slingo is the hybrid of two of the most exciting casino games, bingo and slots, and offers layers of the perfect mix of both games. The positives we spoke about a minute ago, with players being able to play bingo at any time and in any place, remain true for when you play slingo slots but with even more variety available. The winning potential of slingo slots is higher than that of bingo games and with the nice blend of skill and luck, slingo slots are one of the most underrated games around. Baccarat Unlike with Bingo, baccarat is a game that you may have never even heard of despite being one of the best additions to the gambling industry ever. With it being overshadowed by poker and blackjack, baccarat hides in the shadows of these games and is waiting for new players. The reason why baccarat is so good is because the game itself is known for its simplicity and high winning potential which is the perfect blend you want for all your games. The game itself is easy to learn but hard to master, the game requires you to bet on whether you think the dealer or the player with a hand that is closer to nine. On the surface, it sounds easy and playing it is also as easy as it sounds. Although down the line there will be strategies that you can learn and tips that will help you win more , the game itself is easy to play and has a good winning potential despite the ease.

Lightchain AI, BlockDag Or Remittix?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/which-of-these-crypto-investments-will-likely-make-you-rich-in-2025-lightchain-ai-blockdag-or-remittix,"As the crypto industry progresses in 2025, creative ideas pushing the limit of technology are transforming various global sectors. With their innovative approaches to artificial intelligence, blockchain scalability, and crypto-fiat integration, three standouts—Litechain AI (LCAI), BlockDAG (BDAG), and Remittix (RTX)—are drawing investors in particular. Which of these initiatives, though, promises perhaps life-changing returns? Could it be BlockDAG's lightning-fast transaction speeds, Litechain AI's groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence consensus, or Remittix's seamless link between crypto and conventional finance? Read on to explore the particular advantages of these crypto projects. Lightchain AI Is Pioneering Inclusive Decentralized Intelligence By introducing Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a green consensus mechanism that focuses computational resources towards significant AI tasks, Lightchain AI is redefining the blockchain sector. PoI presents Lightchain AI as a sustainable substitute by lowering the environmental impact sometimes connected with blockchain activities. This breakthrough approach enables decentralized model training, allowing nodes to cooperate on creating worldwide artificial intelligence models without violating data privacy. Every node provides updates from local data that the network checks and combines into a single, shared model. Furthermore, Lightchain AI's decentralized inference marketplace lets users ask for AI-powered chores—such as data analysis or language translation—while nodes get the LCAI token for running these calculations. The current LCAI price in stage 11 is a tempting $0.004875 while the Lightchain AI presale is under progress. Significant rallies predicted by analysts this year already point to the LCAI token as a profitable investment. BlockDAG: Redefining Blockchain for a Sustainable Future By combining modern Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with a clear vision for scalability and sustainability, BlockDAG is redefining the crypto space. BlockDAG performs lightning-fast transaction speeds, processing thousands of transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization or security, unlike conventional blockchains. Its hybrid proof-of-work consensus system guarantees strong network integrity, and its sophisticated cryptography systems protect data against attacks. BlockDAG's EVM compatibility also enables smooth interaction with Ethereum's ecosystem, therefore enabling developers to use its low-code drag-and-drop tools to produce creative ideas. With this new platform, which promotes itself as a transforming agent, the BDAG token is among the top crypto coins to hold in 2025. Starting from just $0.0001 during the BlockDAGpresale, the BDAG price is expected to rise to $0.05 by the last presale stage. Having already raised more than $175 million, the BlockDAG presale highlights great investor trust. Remittix: Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance Seamlessly Remittix is redefining the way cryptocurrencies interface with existing financial systems, creating a seamless platform for fast crypto-to-cash conversions via bank transfers. Moreover, Remittix guarantees receivers remain ignorant that crypto was involved in the transaction with its creative technique, therefore establishing a clear and quick link between digital assets and traditional financial systems. By combining blockchain technology with current financial systems, this original solution exceeds rivals such as Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase in speed, security, and efficiency for cross-border payments. Positioned to profit from the $183 trillion worldwide banking sector, Remittixis becoming the best crypto investment choice for forward-looking investors. Meanwhile, Remittix provides an unmissable entrance point for investors ready to profit on the growing demand for crypto-fiat integration at a presale price of just $0.0193 per RTX token. Unlike many initiatives, Remittix lets all tokens be claimable merely five days after launch, therefore exempting presale buyers from vesting time. The RTX token is poised for further rallies as the financial industry adopts cryptocurrency solutions. Why Remittix Outshines Litechain AI and BlockDAG With innovative technologies that fit several sectors, Litechain AI, BlockDAG, and Remittixeach give interesting prospects as the crypto market gets ready for a bullish 2025. While BlockDAG advocates blockchain speed and scalability to hitherto unheard-of levels, LitechainAI pioneers AI-integrated decentralization. Remittix, however, stands out as the best crypto investment since it deftly closes the distance between cryptocurrencies and conventional banking, a market ready for explosive expansion in the coming years. The RTX coin presents a great chance for investors as the presale tokens are fast selling out because of the rising investor interest and limited token supply.

Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting dropped today, showing us a room full of officials who are uneasy about inflation and scratching their heads over what Trump’s policies on trade and immigration might mean for the economy. His name wasn’t directly mentioned—because, of course—but his incoming administration’s moves are all over the discussion. The Fed has been walking a tightrope since inflation started throwing tantrums. While recent data shows some signs of cooling, it’s not enough to make anyone at the Fed relax. Inflation slows, but not enough Total consumer price inflation, measured by the 12-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, was sitting at 2.3% in October, a drop from 3.0% in the same period last year. Core PCE inflation—stripping out the usual suspects like food and energy—was at 2.8%, down from 3.4% a year earlier. By November, estimates pointed to total PCE inflation at 2.5% and core inflation holding steady at 2.8%. Consumer price index (CPI) data told a similar story. In November, CPI inflation came in at 2.7%, with core CPI at 3.3%. Both figures are lower than they were in 2023, but they’re not low enough for anyone to throw a party. The Fed remains laser-focused on core inflation, which hasn’t cooled as much as expected, thanks to sticky categories like services. Labor market conditions are also changing, though only slightly. Average monthly payroll gains were slower in October and November compared to the third quarter, partly because of strikes and natural disasters. The unemployment rate inched up to 4.2% in November, with participation rates dipping as well. Still, wages didn’t flinch, holding steady with a 4% year-over-year increase in November. Economic growth holds steady, foreign markets stumble The US economy isn’t doing too badly—at least for now. GDP growth in the third quarter was solid, matching the pace of the second quarter. Consumer spending and private investments pushed the numbers up, but imports outpaced exports, creating a drag. In the fourth quarter, indicators showed that GDP growth stayed strong, with consumer and private spending leading the charge again. Meanwhile, imports dropped off in October, particularly capital goods. Overseas, it’s a bit complicated. The eurozone and Mexico saw growth in the third quarter, but by year’s end, momentum was running out of steam. Manufacturing slowed, and private consumption remained weak. China, meanwhile, struggled with low retail sales growth, weak domestic demand despite high-tech production in other parts of Asia staying hot, thanks to US demand. Inflation in advanced economies eased, thanks to earlier drops in energy prices, but services inflation refused to budge in some areas. Latin America, especially Brazil, faced a different beast, with rising inflation fueled by currency issues. Markets adjust to Fed signals Now let’s talk markets. Investors have been adjusting their expectations for rate cuts ever since the Fed started showing its cautious side. Treasury yields initially rose post-election but flattened out by the end of the period covered in the minutes. Near-term inflation expectations nudged higher, while long-term measures barely moved. Equity markets, on the other hand, were riding a wave of optimism. Stocks in cyclical sectors shot up, with investors betting on strong corporate profits. High-yield bond spreads narrowed, and the VIX—a gauge of stock market volatility—dropped to levels much lower than before the election. Bitcoin, though, remains below $100,000 after falling down yesterday. Internationally, things weren’t so rosy. Weak data from abroad and expectations of rate cuts from foreign central banks pulled bond yields down in advanced economies, boosting the dollar some more. Foreign equities underperformed US stocks, reflecting expectations of diverging economic growth between the US and the rest of the world. Central banks abroad were busy too. Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, and Mexico all cut rates during the period. Brazil, on the other hand, went rogue, hiking its rate by 100 basis points to fight inflation. Borrowing costs remain high, households feel the squeeze Despite some stability in short-term funding markets, borrowing costs in the US remained high across the board. Mortgage rates ticked down slightly but stayed historically elevated. Auto loans and credit card rates remained near record highs, although auto loan rates did see minor decreases. Corporate borrowers saw a bit of relief, with yields on investment-grade and speculative bonds dipping. Commercial real estate loans, after stalling in the third quarter, picked up slightly in October, but delinquencies in this sector continued to climb. Small businesses had it rough, facing tight credit conditions and weak loan originations. Households didn’t have it much better. While credit was generally available for those with strong credit scores, delinquencies on credit cards continued to rise. Federal Housing Administration mortgage delinquencies stayed above pre-pandemic levels, adding to the pressure on lower-income borrowers. The Fed will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed assets. However, officials are keeping a close eye on data and will make adjustments as necessary. They said, “The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-08 22:29:22

Trump’s Fury Over Interest Rates Signals Big Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-blast-trump-high-interest-rates/,"Bitcoin experts are buzzing as President-elect Donald Trump lashed out against current Federal Reserve policy, calling interest rates “far too high” despite persistent inflationary pressures. “We are inheriting a difficult situation from the outgoing administration,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago club, adding that officials seem to be “trying everything they can to make it more difficult” for his incoming team. The blunt remarks, coming fewer than two weeks before Trump’s inauguration, have stoked anticipation of a possible shift in US monetary policy—and raised speculation about a boost for Bitcoin and other risk assets in the new year. The 2017 Trump Playbook: Dollar “Too Strong”, Bitcoin Up? Although the economic and geopolitical landscape has changed since Trump’s first term, some market watchers see parallels to his 2017 rhetoric. Back then, he lambasted a US dollar that he deemed “too strong,” a stance that preceded a notable decline in the currency. The US Dollar Index (DXY) peaked near 104 in early January 2017 but began a downward trend that extended into early 2018, bottoming out around 98. Related Reading: Anticipating A ‘2025 Super Cycle’: Bitcoin Rallies With Trump’s Regulatory Reforms On The Horizon This sharp move in the dollar coincided with a broader risk-on environment, fueling rallies in equities as well as the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), drew a direct comparison on X. “The last time Trump said something was ‘too high,’ it was the dollar – back in January 2017, just days before his inauguration,” Bittel stated and recounted: “Here’s what he said: ‘Our companies can’t compete with them now because our currency is too strong. And it’s killing us.” Notably, last year, Trump also called recent strength a “tremendous burden on US businesses.” Bittel further argued: “Trump understands the impact of a strong dollar – and the same logic applies to high interest rates. They suppress exports, hurt corporate earnings, and slow economic growth.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Signal That Took Price From $69,000 To $108,000 Appears Again Speaking on the impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, Bittel concluded: “What happened next? Well, the dollar began a significant decline, setting the stage for one of the most pivotal macro moves we’ve seen in years – triggering a melt-up in risk assets. Déjà vu? I think so. Let’s see how it plays out.” Bittel is not the only expert speculating that the DXY may already have peaked, mirroring its 2017 topping pattern. Steve Donzé, Deputy CIO for Multi Asset at Pictet Asset Management Japan, shared a widely discussed chart on X, remarking “On time. Ready for pushback,” while overlaying recent DXY movements with the currency’s trajectory in early 2017. The chart suggests a similar pattern that could foreshadow renewed dollar weakness in the coming weeks. In a separate post, financial analyst Silver Surfer (@SilverSurfer_23) pointed to an uncanny timing overlap: “DXY topped on January 3rd, 2017—18 days before Trump’s Inauguration. DXY looks to have topped on January 2nd, 2025—19 days before Trump’s Inauguration.” He characterized the parallel as “crazy history repeating,” explaining that he sees a correlation between the path of the DXY before both inaugurations. Such analogies are fueling speculation that a repeat dollar slump could usher in an environment favoring risk assets. Should the dollar indeed enter a new downtrend—much like in 2017–2018—Bitcoin could ride a wave of renewed liquidity and speculative appetite. At press time, BTC traded at $94,950.

Simon’s Cat (CAT): From Meme to Marketing Genius Simon’s Cat is proof that meme coins can have claws. Launched just a few months back, CAT has surged in popularity thanks to its savvy marketing and an army of social media enthusiasts. With its roots in the viral animated series of the same name, this coin brings a touch of nostalgia and a hefty dose of charm to the crypto scene. But CAT isn’t just cute; it’s clever. The project has capitalised on its branding with a series of token burns, exchange listings, and airdrops that keep the community buzzing. One word: relatability. Everyone loves a cheeky cat, and Simon’s Cat taps into that universal appeal. But beyond the memes, CAT has plans to integrate into NFT marketplaces and offer exclusive content to holders. Imagine owning not just the coin but a piece of the brand itself—an exclusive NFT or a sneak peek at new episodes. Analysts predict Simon’s Cat could claw its way to a 50% price increase by the end of the quarter, making it one of the best new meme coins to invest in right now. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Satire Meets Serious Gains Non-Playable Coin, or NPC, started as a tongue-in-cheek jab at crypto culture but has quickly turned into a bona fide investment opportunity. Its name might scream “joke,” but this project is anything but. NPC’s innovative tokenomics and decentralised governance model have caught the attention of investors who know that meme coins often hide some serious tech under all the memes. NPC has built its brand on satire, but the real magic lies in its ecosystem. The coin is pegged to its own metaverse, where users can trade, play, and even create their own NPC avatars. It’s a meta twist on the crypto space that feels fresh and fun. NPC’s decentralised approach gives the community a real voice, from voting on project developments to deciding on token burns. This transparency has built a loyal following that sees NPC as more than a meme—it’s a statement. Conclusion: The Meme Coin Market’s Bright Future Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that BTFD Coin, Simon’s Cat, and Non-Playable Coin are leading the charge in the meme coin revolution.

With this in mind, a new altcoin, Remittix (RTC) , has become a hot topic among investors for its massive profit potential. Dubbed the “SHIB killer” and the best presale token of 2025, analysts project Remittix could offer up to 5,000% to early backers. Over 125 million RTX tokens have been sold, with over $2 million raised in funding in just a few weeks. Here’s why investors are backing Remittix to surpass Shiba Inu’s success. Remittix Redefines Cross-Border Transactions with Its Unique VIP Program Remittix (RTX) is taking a new approach to cross-border payments. Unlike competitors like Wise and Stripe, which mainly focus on fiat-to-fiat transactions, Remittix is building a platform that allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies instantly. These funds can then be sent to approved banks worldwide. The seamless process makes it nearly impossible for recipients to tell the transaction started as crypto. Plus, with Remittix’s flat fees and no hidden charges, the recipient gets what the user sends. Remittix has passed rigorous security audits by leading blockchain firms SolidProof and BlockSAFU, ensuring it’s safe and reliable. The team has also locked its liquidity pool and tokens for three years to build confidence further. This move prevents sudden sell-offs and stabilizes the project, proving its commitment to long-term growth and investor protection. The $RTX token is the backbone of the Remittix platform, driving key features like staking and governance. Investors can earn between 4% and 8% by staking their tokens. The VIP program offers tiered rewards for those aiming higher, with top-tier investors enjoying up to 18% APY and exclusive voting privileges. Presently in presale at $0.0193 per token, $RTX provides a distinctive opportunity for early investors. Industry experts forecast gains of up to 900% in presale and 4,500% post-launch. The increasing attention suggests Remittix might challenge industry titans like Shiba Inu in 2025. SHIB News: Whales Exit While Retail Investors Step In In the latest SHIB news, on-chain data shows a shift in investor behavior weighing on Shiba Inu. Wallets with 10 million to 100 million worth of SHIB tokens have dropped by 20%, andaddresses with $10,000 to $1M worth of SHIB dropped by 16-22%. This signals a major sell-off by larger investors, possibly due to fading confidence or profit-taking at current prices. On the contrary, smaller retail investors are investing more money into Shiba Inu's potential. Wallets with $1 to $1,000 worth of Shiba Inu have risen by 7.25%, reflecting an ongoing interest among everyday traders. While this shows that Shiba Inu still grabs attention, the market’s stability may be at risk as whales exit and smaller buyers take over. In other SHIB news, Shiba Inu’s trading volume is up 39%, offering some optimism. However, Shiba Inu must reclaim the $0.00002555 resistance level—where whales were active before—to spark a real recovery. Otherwise, the price might dip toward $0.00002200. A turnaround likely depends on stronger trading activity and renewed interest from larger players. For now, caution is key. Why Remittix Could Be the Next Shiba Inu Rival Shiba Inu took the crypto world by storm in 2021 but hasn't replicated that success since. Remittix's stated objective of transforming cross-border payments and the possible expansion of the $RTX token makes it a serious contender. A $100 investment in Remittix today has the potential to grow into $100,000, offering an incredible opportunity for early adopters.

He also emphasized its significance for innovative American companies seeking to trade on premier stock exchanges. “Exodus is thrilled to uplist on the NYSE American. It’s crucial that America’s innovative companies can trade on America’s premier stock exchanges. We expect this uplisting will raise Exodus’ corporate profile, while also enhancing liquidity for our current and future shareholders.” Richardson said . Exodus expressed its commitment to continue innovating within the cryptocurrency sector. The self-custodial wallet provider’s transition to a more prominent exchange will attract a broader investment base and increase its market visibility and shareholder value.

Table of Contents XYZ: The new meme coin heavyweight Ethereum IOTA Ethena POPCAT Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for a significant shift in 2025. Key digital assets are expected to rise above the rest, showing remarkable growth. This article uncovers the top five cryptocurrencies highlighted by ChatGPT to lead this upcoming surge. XYZ: The new meme coin heavyweight XYZVerse breaks the mold as the first all-sports meme token, blending the excitement of sports fandom with the viral appeal of meme culture. Its ecosystem goes beyond speculative hype, offering real-world applications like prediction markets, entertainment dApps, and community-driven rewards, making it a standout among meme coins and altcoins alike. Priced at $0.001333 in its presale phase, XYZVerse presents a significant opportunity for early investors. By the final stage of the presale, the token is projected to reach $0.1, a massive 7,402% increase. With the market poised for exponential growth, XYZVerse could become one of the most profitable digital assets of 2025. Backed by audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for major CEX and DEX listings, XYZVerse is built on a foundation of security and scalability. Its transformative approach of integrating sports and meme culture taps into a multi-billion-dollar industry, creating a robust platform with widespread appeal. While established names like Ethereum and XRP remain strong contenders, XYZVerse’s fresh approach and massive growth potential give it a unique edge. It represents the kind of forward-thinking project that could redefine meme coins and deliver substantial returns to early adopters. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for its potential 7,400% knockout. Ethereum Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that transformed the crypto world. Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, it introduced smart contracts, opening the door to a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps, including finance platforms and games. Based on past trends, predictions suggest ETH could reach $6,580.53, with a low of $2,700.31 in 2025. Looking ahead to 2030, these forecasts point to more potential growth. With its strong foundation and plans for improvement, ETH appears attractive in the current market. As more people embrace blockchain technology, Ethereum’s role could become even more significant. You might also like: $140M whale forecasts XRP at $9, XYZVerse to see 65,000% surge in 2025 IOTA IOTA is a new kind of technology that lets people and businesses exchange data and value in a safe and direct way. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, IOTA is built on the Tangle, which is like a web of connections. This unique design allows for fast and secure transactions without fees. IOTA also offers tools for creating apps, smart contracts, tokens, NFTs, and digital identities. With the IOTA 2.0 upgrade, the platform could make it stand out even further in the crowded crypto market. Compared to other coins, IOTA’s focus on secure and feeless transactions makes it attractive. In today’s market, where innovation is key, IOTA’s technology shows promise. Its collaboration with Shimmer and support for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts could help it gain more users and developers. Ethena Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum. It aims to create a crypto-native form of money that doesn’t depend on traditional banks. Imagine a digital dollar that’s secure, stable, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Alongside this, Ethena introduces the ‘Internet Bond’, a dollar-denominated savings instrument that’s available globally. This bond offers a new way to save and earn, all within the crypto ecosystem. By avoiding reliance on banks, Ethena addresses concerns about centralization. Compared to other stablecoins that are backed by reserves in banks, Ethena offers a decentralized alternative. With growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethena’s timing could be just right. Its ‘Internet Bond’ could also provide a compelling option for savers looking for returns without traditional financial intermediaries. You might also like: Hidden gem: XYZVerse takes the crown as the most promising new crypto POPCAT POPCAT is a meme token inspired by the viral Popcat meme from October 2020. The meme features two images of a cat named Oatmeal — one with its mouth closed and another edited to form an ‘O’ shape. This coin has no inherent value or financial expectations; it’s all about fun and entertainment. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown that internet culture can impact the crypto space. While POPCAT doesn’t bring new technology to the table, its charm lies in its connection to a beloved meme. In a market where trends can shift quickly and where community engagement matters, POPCAT might catch the eye of meme enthusiasts and crypto fans alike. Whether it becomes the next big thing or just a fleeting trend, POPCAT is certainly adding some feline fun to the crypto world. Conclusion ETH, IOTA, ENA, and POPCAT are promising, but XYZ, uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem, aims for 7,400% growth as the G.O.A.T. of memecoins.

This outlook is unfavorable for high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Liquidations in the Crypto Market Within 24 hours, $331 million worth of long positions were liquidated, with 131,979 traders affected. Ethereum (ETH) also slipped below $3,500, reflecting broader market distress. Bearish Technical Patterns Bitcoin broke below its upward channel, breaching the critical support at $97,204. The move has shifted momentum to the downside, with traders eyeing the $92,500 level as a potential demand zone. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Support and Resistance Levels Immediate support lies at $92,500, followed by a stronger zone at $91,947. On the upside, resistance is seen at $96,080, with additional hurdles at $98,856. Market Sentiment The RSI at 34.76 indicates oversold conditions, raising the possibility of a short-term rebound. However, sustained recovery depends on Bitcoin reclaiming $97,204 and breaking above resistance. Long-Term Outlook Despite near-term headwinds, Bitcoin’s fundamentals, including a $1.87 trillion market cap and limited supply of 21 million coins, remain strong. Analysts suggest monitoring demand levels near $92,000 for potential recovery. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin broke below critical support at $97,204, triggering bearish momentum. Economic data suggests fewer Fed rate cuts, weighing on high-risk assets. A bounce near $92,000 could form a double-bottom pattern, signaling potential recovery.

Their collaboration highlights the rising potential of 1Fuel, a project gaining attention for its innovative approach to blockchain solutions. With projections to become the best presale for 50x gains, 1Fuel is quickly becoming one of the hottest opportunities in the market, positioning itself as a game-changer in the crypto space. Virtuals Protocol trading volume surges despite recent decline Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) recently hit a record high of $5.14 , surging 55% after breaking out of an ascending channel. However, the momentum didn’t last long as bears took control, dragging its price down to $3. After some recovery, Virtuals Protocol is trading at $3.85 on CoinMarketCap, marking a 7% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite the decline, Virtuals Protocol's trading volume is up by 7%. This increase suggests ongoing market activity, though the outlook remains bearish. Investors are growing cautious as Virtuals Protocol struggles to maintain its previous highs. Many are now turning their attention to alternatives, including top low-cost crypto investments like 1Fuel, for potential profits. Arbitrum’s $190 Million investment in blockchain gaming amidst market setbacks 2024 was a game-changing year for Arbitrum (ARB). As one of the first intent-enabled chains, Arbitrum enhanced its interoperability and gained serious attention in the blockchain world. In 2024, Arbitrum surpassed Solana in on-chain activity, proving popular among users and developers. Today, in 2025, Arbitrum has already been hot because its DAO revealed plans to invest $190 million in blockchain gaming. Between 2025 and 2028, the DAO will support 100 gaming projects beginning this quarter to market the blockchain gaming system. Despite these changes, Arbitrum is trading for $0.906 after dropping 4% within the past day and losing 28% of its trading volume now at $390 million. Still, analysts see potential, forecasting $1 by Q1 and $5 by late 2025. With innovation, gaming, and its reputation as one of the top low-cost crypto investments, Arbitrum is capturing the attention of gamers and investors alike. 1Fuel: A game-changer in crypto with seamless transactions and high-staking rewards 1Fuel is shaking up the cryptocurrency world with its innovative features that simplify the process for users. One standout is its one-click cross-chain technology, which allows seamless transactions between blockchain networks. This removes the hassle of paying high fees or transferring funds between wallets, making it more user-friendly for everyday crypto traders. Privacy and security are at the core of 1Fuel. It includes a built-in privacy mixer and cold storage options, ensuring that users maintain full control over their assets while protecting against potential data breaches. These are especially crucial features in a business where privacy issues are prevalent. 1Fuel also features attractive staking rewards of up to 30% APR, making it a good option for passive income investors. The project also offers digital debit cards that consumers can pay daily for virtual and real money transactions. Having raised over $1 million in its presale round, 1Fuel is gaining serious attention.

Relief efforts are gaining momentum as local and international donors step in to provide much-needed aid.

According to The Giving Block’s Annual Industry Report on the State of Crypto Philanthropy , over $2 billion in cryptocurrency donations have been made as of January 2024. Pousty expressed hope that the Los Angeles Wildfires Emergency Response Fundraiser will mobilize similar contributions, stating, “Every contribution fuels the work of trusted organizations on the ground, bringing critical aid to those who need it most.” “Together, we can turn the collective strength of the crypto community into life-changing support for the residents of Los Angeles,” he added. Los Angeles Crypto Community Asks For Help While relief efforts are still ramping up, members of Los Angeles’ crypto community are calling for urgent assistance. Los Angeles-based crypto influencer “ Wendy O ” told Cryptonews that, “It’s absolutely tragic to see the damage from the fire and winds in Southern California occur.” Wendy O added that the LA wildfires impact all Americans. “It is true that homeowners insurance in California has been canceled for many – I dealt with this 2 years ago. Please show compassion to those impacted and help when you can,” she said. The palisades fire is now almost 12,000 acres. My heart is broken for my state and all impacted.

As Gensler’s term draws to a close, his tough stance on crypto regulation highlights his belief in the need for stricter oversight. His actions have shaped the current U.S. regulatory environment in ways that have sparked significant debate in the crypto community A Tough Stance on Crypto Regulation Since becoming SEC chair in 2021, Gary Gensler strongly believes that the cryptocurrency market needs stricter regulation. Speaking to Bloomberg TV recently, he argued that the market is “rife with bad actors.” He emphasized the need for better investor protection. His leadership has been defined by aggressive actions against some of the biggest names in the crypto world, like Coinbase and Ripple Labs . Under Gensler’s watch, the SEC filed nearly 100 enforcement actions related to cryptocurrencies, pushing companies to comply with securities laws. This came after his predecessor, Jay Clayton, filed 80 similar actions. Enforcing existing laws and ensuring crypto firms comply with them is a top priority for Gensler. Gary Gensler Faces Backlash Over Investor Protection Stance For Gensler, one of the key goals of the SEC is ensuring that everyday investors are given proper protections. He has repeatedly stated that most digital assets should be classified as securities. Also, crypto companies need to disclose more information to the public. In his view, the crypto market’s lack of transparency and regulation exposes regular investors to unnecessary risks. However, not everyone agrees with Gensler’s hardline stance. Critics argue that his aggressive approach has been destructive , stifling innovation in the crypto space. Many point out that the current legal framework does not fit well with the fast-moving world of digital assets. This makes it hard for companies to comply without facing legal challenges. Despite the backlash, Gensler has defended the SEC’s actions, arguing that protecting investors and maintaining market integrity is necessary. He sees regulation as a way to weed out bad actors and ensure that the remaining companies operate fairly. A New Era at the SEC: What’s Next for Crypto Regulation? As Gensler prepares to exit, the SEC is on the brink of a new chapter . President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to take over as the agency’s new head. Unlike Gensler, Atkins is likely to take a more balanced approach. Many expect his leadership to promote innovation in the crypto industry while ensuring proper oversight. Gensler remains proud of his achievements in bringing greater regulatory clarity to the crypto market. However, he noted that much work still needs to be done, especially as the digital asset landscape evolves rapidly.

38706325,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=640082,1736376900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38706325.jpeg,Terraform’s Do Kwon to go on criminal trial in early 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/terraforms-do-kwon-to-go-on-criminal-trial-in-early-2026/,"Do Kwon, founder of Terraform Labs, is officially heading to trial in January 2026. The charges? Criminal fraud tied to the $40 billion collapse of TerraUSD and Luna, two cryptocurrencies that turned the crypto market upside down in 2022. The trial, set to take place in New York, will be overseen by Judge Paul Engelmayer and is expected to stretch for four to eight weeks. Kwon’s legal saga has been anything but ordinary. His not-guilty plea last week caps a two-year extradition battle that saw both the United States and South Korea vying to prosecute him. After months on the run, hiding from authorities, and eventually getting arrested in Montenegro on unrelated charges, Kwon is now set to face U.S. prosecutors who are ready to hold him accountable for what they’re calling one of the largest fraud cases in crypto history. $40 billion lost, over a million affected Prosecutors claim Kwon’s actions wrecked lives—over a million of them, to be exact. Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel Gitner says that the number of victims includes individuals and organizations worldwide who invested in Terraform’s so-called decentralized financial ecosystem. His filing to the District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday said that determining the full extent of the damage is “challenging” due to the massive scale of transactions involving Terraform’s tokens, TerraUSD and Luna. “The Government estimates that the number of victims in this case exceeds hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities, and potentially totals more than one million,” Gitner wrote. Instead of reaching out to every affected person, the government plans to launch a public website to keep victims updated on the case, citing the impracticality of individual notifications. The charges against Kwon center on allegations that he deceived investors by marketing Terraform as a revolutionary decentralized platform. The system, which promised a blockchain-powered currency, payment network, stock market, and savings bank, was, according to prosecutors, built on lies. The indictment claims that Kwon and his team falsely portrayed Terraform as autonomous and governed by its users while maintaining tight, behind-the-scenes control. When TerraUSD and Luna imploded in May 2022, they wiped out $40 billion in market value. U.S. prosecutors accuse Kwon of orchestrating the collapse through “manipulative and deceptive” tactics that misled investors and left them with massive losses. After the Terra ecosystem collapsed, he vanished. For months, he evaded authorities until his arrest in Montenegro in 2023. Both South Korea and America filed criminal charges against him, kicking off a lengthy extradition battle. In December, Kwon was finally handed over to U.S. officials.

Celestia’s recent Ginger upgrade has doubled its data throughput, while Render Network’s partnerships are redefining decentralized GPU rendering, fueling exciting advancements across blockchain. With Render price hovering at $7.68 and popular crypto coins like Celestia focusing on scalability, Web3Bay , a presale standout, offers a fresh take on e-commerce that deserves attention. Blending cryptocurrency and traditional payments, Web3Bay bridges Web2 simplicity with Web3 innovation. Its presale offers participants governance rights and exponential potential, with token prices structured to deliver returns exceeding 6,000%. As Web3Bay positions itself as the future of e-commerce, early adopters stand to benefit from a secure, decentralized marketplace designed for the modern era. Why Web3Bay Could Be 2025’s E-Commerce Revolution Did you know that Web3Bay has already raised over $470,000 in its presale, selling more than 127.6 million tokens? Currently priced at $0.0039675 in the latest stage, the presale is structured to reward early participants with exponential growth potential. With a carefully planned price progression across 28 stages, Web3Bay offers over 6,000% ROI potential for those joining early, putting it ahead of many popular crypto coins. What sets Web3Bay apart is its vision of merging the familiar convenience of Web2 payment systems, such as PayPal (planned for future integration), with the decentralized power of Web3. This dual approach is designed to make blockchain-based shopping accessible to a wider audience. Beyond payments, Web3Bay aims to empower its community by granting 3BAY token holders governance rights in a decentralized marketplace—something traditional platforms can’t offer. Early adopters are not just securing tokens but also becoming stakeholders in what could redefine e-commerce. The presale’s unique structure and the platform’s roadmap, including decentralized storage and NFT integration, make Web3Bay an exciting opportunity in 2025’s blockchain landscape. For those looking to diversify their crypto holdings and tap into the future of decentralized commerce, Web3Bay stands as a strong contender among popular crypto coins. The question is: will you act before the presale stages move on? Render Price Trends: What’s Powering RNDR’s Growth? Render price currently sits at $7.68, reflecting its growing role in decentralized GPU rendering. Recent partnerships with Stability AI, OTOY, and Endeavor highlight Render Network’s vision of enabling next-gen AI models through blockchain-based computational power. Its transition from Ethereum to Solana has also improved efficiency and reduced transaction costs, further strengthening its appeal. With over 40 million frames rendered and a user base exceeding 200,000, the platform’s growth signals its potential as a key player in decentralized content creation. Community-approved upgrades are driving Render Network forward. Proposals like RNP-016, which improves node operator reliability, and RNP-017, which streamlines governance, reflect its focus on scalability and usability. As Render’s price gains traction, these innovations ensure its continued relevance in GPU rendering, keeping RNDR among the most exciting developments in blockchain technology for 2025. Celestia Upgrade: Driving Scalability and Growth for TIA The latest Celestia upgrade, known as the Ginger upgrade, has doubled the platform’s data throughput by reducing block times from 12 to 6 seconds. This enhancement positions Celestia as a leader in modular blockchain scalability, allowing developers to build custom chains with ease. Currently, TIA, its native token, is trading at $5.16, with a 24-hour volume of $207 million. This growth reflects rising interest in the platform’s innovative architecture, which decouples consensus from execution layers for increased efficiency. Beyond the Celestia upgrade, the project’s roadmap includes plans to scale block sizes to 1GB, supported by $100 million in funding secured last year. Features like enhanced data availability sampling and cross-chain compatibility make it a standout choice for developers. As TIA gains traction, Celestia continues to solidify its role in the blockchain space, offering unparalleled flexibility and performance. Summing Up With Render price at $7.68 and Celestia’s Ginger upgrade doubling its data throughput, both platforms continue to push boundaries in their respective niches. TIA’s current price of $5.16 and Render Network’s Solana migration reflect strong growth potential and innovation in blockchain technology. Web3Bay stands out as a transformative project in decentralized e-commerce. With its presale already raising over $470,000 and 3BAY tokens priced at $0.0039675, early participants can secure governance rights and benefit from potential returns exceeding 6,000%. As blockchain solutions seek to redefine their industries, Web3Bay’s focus on bridging Web2 and Web3 shopping experiences positions it as a compelling opportunity for 2025.

This activity underlines Toncoin’s escalating relevance in the crypto space. In parallel, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem has broadened with the debut of its NFT-centric Lap Dogs racing game, which underscores its commitment to immersive blockchain gaming and metaverse advancements. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) has introduced a Refer & Earn USDT system, positioning it as a prime candidate for the best long-term crypto opportunity. This program offers the uncapped earning potential, complementing its successful presale that has amassed over $176.5 million. BlockDAG’s strategy suggests considerable upside, making it attractive to both novices and veteran traders. Toncoin Whale Activity Surges to $8.75 Billion Toncoin whale activity has marked a substantial rise, with transaction volumes ballooning by 80% to reach $8.75 billion recently. This spike suggests that significant investors are actively accumulating or redistributing Toncoin, likely as a strategic move. Moreover, a 300% increase in the net flow of major holders over the past week further accentuates this dynamic. Throughout 2024, The Open Network (TON) has gained traction, witnessing significant growth in wallet creations and user engagement despite broader market volatility. The Toncoin whale activity serves as a testament to its growing market presence, with investors keenly observing for potential long-term benefits or strategic shifts. SHIB Ecosystem Unveils NFT Lap Dogs Racing Game The Shiba Inu ecosystem has launched Lap Dogs, a racing game that integrates Sheboshis and Shiboshis NFTs, pivotal to its gameplay. These digital characters offer unique attributes and customization options, enhancing player interaction. As a facet of the Shib Metaverse, Lap Dogs is set to redefine player engagement with NFTs. Recent advancements in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, like activating the Shibarium Metaverse land map and integrating Chainlink’s CCIP for enhanced multi-chain functionality, fortify its standing in blockchain gaming and metaverse development. While NFT integration continues to evolve, the expansion through Lap Dogs emphasizes Shiba Inu’s dedication to offering a dynamic and engaging platform for its community. BlockDAG’s Refer & Earn: Prime for Long-Term Gains! BlockDAG has enhanced its presale approach by launching a new Refer & Earn USDT system, providing significant cashback incentives to its buyers. Initially, participants receive a 6% cashback on purchases made through referrals, which increases to 10% for any additional transactions made within the same 24-hour period. Additionally, a steady 6% cashback is applied universally on all other purchases. This innovative referral system delivers instant USDT rewards without any restrictions on earnings, positioning it as highly rewarding within the marketplace. With over $176.5 million already raised and 17.7 billion BDAG coins distributed at a cost-effective price of $0.0248 per coin, the success of this presale highlights BlockDAG’s rapid growth and the strong potential for future gains. Having already provided early adopters with returns of 2,380%, BlockDAG is on a path that could see it exceed $600 million in funding—a testament to its reliability and potential for expansion. Looking ahead, BlockDAG combines affordability with community-centric rewards and scalability. These attributes, along with the attractive benefits of the referral program, make BlockDAG one of the best long-term crypto coins , offering significant opportunities for growth and continuous benefits. Market Dynamics: High Stakes in Long-Term Crypto As the first quarter unfolds, the crypto market reveals varied developments, from the surge in Toncoin whale activity to the expansion of the Shiba Inu ecosystem through its Lap Dogs NFT game. These events underscore the increasing importance of both established and nascent blockchain projects. Yet, BlockDAG’s pioneering Refer & Earn USDT system emerges as a key attraction for traders seeking lucrative rewards and the best long-term crypto opportunities. With immediate cashback of up to 10%, a robust $176.5 million presale, and a remarkable 2,380% ROI for early participants, BlockDAG is poised to lead in the evolution of enduring crypto projects. As its presale continues, BlockDAG remains the prime crypto opportunity to enrich a trader’s portfolio.

According to a new report by local news outlet Oost, an unnamed law student and professional soccer player from the Dutch city of Hegelo has been arrested and accused of defrauding investors and mishandling their funds. The report says that the man would invest money on behalf of his clients, who were his family, friends, fellow soccer players and others. However, he made risky crypto bets with their funds that went awry and he eventually ended up losing between $1.5 million and $4.5 million euros. The man was falsely known as a “crypto genius” by his peers who believed he had raked in massive profits from trading digital assets. After his financial mishap – in which he lost all of his own money as well – the man and his brother sent emails to their clients informing them of the loss. He then went into hiding after being harassed by a few of his victims, according to the report. The victims went on to hand over the evidence to police and after a months-long investigation, he was arrested and charged with fraud and embezzlement. He is further accused of taking on new clients despite his company being on the brink of collapse.

Data from Alphanomics shows that despite the accumulation of other tokens, they are still underperforming as attention shifted to the hottest trends. AI agent tokens are the best performers for the past 30 days of trading, marking the peak of a trend that only started at the end of 2024. The collection of AI agent tokens grew by 71.7% on average, driven by the top projects that gained the biggest share of attention. The sector lost around 5% of its valuation in the past 24 hours, though it retained its leading position. AI memes rallied by 44.4% in the past 30 days, retaining momentum from social media cults and their proximity to some of the AI agents. The pure AI narrative of utility and DePIN tokens expanded by 16.1% for the same time period. The third most active category of tokens was the Pump.fun ecosystem, gaining a total of 38% in the past month. Pump.fun tokens gained prominence for their organic origins, with some of the memes being selected for their wide adoption and lack of cabal ownership. Pump.fun is being used to launch AI agents, independent of other platforms like ELIZA or Virtuals Protocol, with most of the tokens having sufficient liquidity from their creators to move to Raydium. Those relatively new narratives diminished the hopes for a wide altcoin rally. The new narratives displaced a brief expansion for ‘ dinosaur coins ’ at the end of 2024. After that, the trend shifted to projects that could gain immediate social media appeal, while offering a functioning product. All of the three categories had outlier tokens, which drove the general trend. Most of the tokens in those categories remain risky and can quickly incur deep losses. Even experienced whales have posted losses while trying to snipe the most promising AI agents. There is also a crossover between ecosystems, where GRIFT and AVA give a boost to both Pump.fun and AI memes. AVA is also the hottest rising AI agent token, during a period of heightened competition. The AI space showed it can outperform in the short term, though the gains have been tested after Bitcoin (BTC) dipped under $94,000. With Ethereum (ETH) in the $3,200 range and Solana (SOL) under $200, the markets may break the 30-day trend. AI agents turn to the green AI agents retained a total valuation above $15B, with more than $2.4B in daily trading. The tokens of most agents are often shifting to the red, due to their low liquidity and profit-taking from early whales. However, AI tokens also proved resilient, often switching back to gains within hours. For Ethereum, the growth drive came from Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). The chain carried a wider selection of utility and task-specific AI agents. Solana, on the other hand, is more skewed toward personality agents, with AVA taking the lead. Solana AI agents shifted to the green, while competing for the biggest mindshare. | Source: Bubblescanner Solana AI agents aim for memetic appeal while building communities around their content and personalities. Agents like AI16Z and Eliza also have DeFi and utility features, while still focusing on their content and presentation. Base has already grown its own mix of utility and memetic agents. So far, only the top chains have built AI ecosystems, while BSC still has less than 20 agents. L2 chains like Arbitrum and Optimism are just starting out with the agentic trend. AI agents, however, are not simply displacing other projects and tokens. Just like the Web3, gaming, NFT, and other trends before that, older tokens provided the liquidity and infrastructure. The success of AI tokens hinges on the availability of DEX, lending, market makers, and an entire ecosystem capable of reacting quickly to new communities and trends. The AI agent space is yet to expand the real capabilities of agents, which currently focus on content and user engagement. For trading and on-chain activities, most of the tasks are still in the testing stage.

Speaking Wednesday in a Bloomberg Television interview , Gensler highlighted the ongoing lack of adequate disclosures and information digital asset firms provide to everyday investors. Gensler reflects on SEC tenure and shifts in crypto enforcement leadership Reflecting on his tenure, Gensler expressed pride in the SEC’s enforcement efforts in the crypto space, highlighting their steady consistency over the years. The former Goldman Sachs executive has been known for his aggressive enforcement actions against cryptocurrency entities. These efforts have targeted a wide spectrum, from fraudulent operators to major firms like Coinbase Global Inc. and proprietary trading firm DRW Holdings. Gensler announced in November his decision to step down as SEC chair on January 20, coinciding with President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to head the agency. Atkins anticipates adopting a more lenient approach toward the digital asset industry and reducing enforcement measures. In the interview, Gensler noted that his predecessor, Jay Clayton, initiated approximately 80 crypto-related enforcement cases during his leadership under the first Trump administration. Under Gensler, that number grew to about 100 cases. However, while Clayton’s focus centered on token issuers whose offerings were deemed securities, Gensler has prioritized enforcement against market intermediaries that bypass securities laws concerning registration and disclosure requirements. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC has experienced both victories and setbacks in court. Gensler has expressed skepticism toward the crypto industry Biden-appointed Gensler has vocally expressed skepticism toward crypto regulation. He came out forcefully against the FIT21 bill after it was passed in the House. The relationship between the crypto industry and Gensler has been contentious. The industry mostly views Gensler with skepticism and frustration. Many believe his strict enforcement approach and classifying most crypto assets as securities have stifled innovation and created legal uncertainty​. According to Gensler, crypto accounts for less than 1% of U.S. financial markets, yet it’s riddled with “scams.” I’ve never seen a field that is so wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals. Of these 10,000 to 15,000 projects, many of them will not survive. They’re like venture capital investments. They’re not going to survive. ~Gary Gensler Gensler expressed pride in their accomplishments but insisted there’s still work to be done.

Bullish Secures BaFin Licenses to Drive Expansion in Europe The approvals, granted on December 20, authorize Bullish DE to engage in crypto asset custody, proprietary trading, and principal brokerage. These licenses enable Bullish DE to expand its presence in Germany, capitalizing on the country’s increasing adoption of digital assets. We are proud to announce that #Bullish has secured licenses in Germany from BaFin, marking a significant step in strengthening our position within the EU. — Bullish (@Bullish) January 8, 2025 The new licenses were strategically obtained to align with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which took effect in December 2024. MiCA provides a unified regulatory framework for crypto businesses throughout the European Union, simplifying compliance processes across member states. Tom Farley, CEO of Bullish Group, said in a press statement , “Receiving BaFin’s approval underscores Bullish’s commitment to operating under the highest regulatory standards.” Bullish DE plans to focus on services designed for institutional and professional investors, leveraging its new licenses to enhance its offerings within the European market. In related developments, other companies have also secured BaFin approvals for their operations in Germany. On October 9, Frankfurt-based Tradias, the digital asset arm of Bankhaus Scheich, received a securities trading bank license .

Germany’s New Digital Finance Law Boosts Regulatory Framework for Crypto The BaFin approval for Bullish follows another key regulatory development: on December 18, the German Parliament (Bundestag) passed the Act on the Digitalization of Financial Markets (FinmadiG). This legislation aligns Germany with the European Commission’s Digital Finance Strategy and addresses critical areas such as crypto-assets, digital resilience, and money transfers. Germany's Bundestag passed the Act on the Digitalization of Financial Markets (FinmadiG) to align with upcoming EU crypto regulations, including MiCA. #MiCA #Germany #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/WWhadHLJPe — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 Rather than directly regulating crypto assets, the law strengthens oversight of companies in the digital finance space, focusing on exchanges and service providers. It seeks to prevent fraud and market manipulation, promoting transparency and accountability for a safer crypto environment. The FinmadiG law addresses three major EU regulations. The Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) , both effective December 30, 2024, establish a framework for crypto services across the EU and tighten regulations on fund transfer information to enhance transparency. The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) , which takes effect on January 17, 2025, strengthens cybersecurity requirements for financial institutions, including crypto providers.

The update, which will be rolled out in two phases, is scheduled for release during the first quarter of 2025. Kraken discussed Pectra’s impact on ETH holders, pointing out that it will enhance Ethereum’s scalability, UX (user experience), and security. With the Pectra split update, Ethereum will cater to a wide range of use cases and user needs, enabling Layer 2 solutions (L2s) to be more affordable and validators more flexible to manage. The preceding March 2024 Dencun update release introduced proto-danksharding to increase transaction speeds on the network. Derive’s Dawson projected that Ether could gain over 257% to hit $12K by the end of 2025 if Ethereum successfully implements the Pectra update. He added that a regulatory-friendly environment under Trump’s incoming administration could further support Ethereum’s growth. Dawson also believes that the growth of layer 2 solutions and enhanced interoperability could drive huge gains, especially for ETH holders. He, however, cautioned that Ether’s price could fall below $2K in a bearish case where spot ETH ETFs failed to attract institutional interest. Pectra is likely to make new Ether millionaires this year ⚙️ Phase 1 of Pectra is about to arrive! This update will include 19 fundamental EIPs and introduce key innovations like sponsored transactions, allowing others to cover fees for you. Additionally, it will enhance @ethereum 's scalability, efficiency, and usability 🙌 Check out… — Stakely (@Stakely_io) January 8, 2025 The Pectra update will bring huge changes, such as enhancing account abstraction, validator operations, and network performance. Pectra aims to improve experiences for Ethereum users and developers and set the stage for future scalability upgrades. The update is set to introduce 20 EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) that will address specific features and functionalities to streamline implementation. Pectra will be rolled out in two phases. The first phase (PectrA), comprising eight EIPs, is expected to be released during Q1 of 2025, while phase two (PectrB) will be available in 2026. Many elements in Pectra generate drawbacks at the code level, which could impact the network’s reliability, user trust, and ETH prices. The main feature of PectrA will allow users to find sponsors to cover their transaction costs, facilitating access to the network for those with low balances. EIP-7702 will eliminate the need to hold small ETH amounts to execute blockchain transactions. EIP-7251, on the other hand, will allow ETH stakers with 32 ETH or above to earn staking rewards. “This will make staking cheaper, leading more people to stake and thus decreasing staking rewards over time. For that reason, we’re extremely bullish about restaking. A lot of people will want to boost their staking rewards by also securing other networks.” -Gaia Regis, co-founder and CEO of Byzantine Key updates, such as increased validator stake limits and flexible staking withdrawals, will enhance network security and efficiency. Streamlined smart contract deployment will also be a crucial aspect of the Pectra update. Trump’s pro-crypto policies will be especially beneficial for ETH holders Saul Rejwan, managing partner at Masterkey, said that Ethereum and other major crypto sectors like DeFi and DePIN stood to benefit more from Trump’s presidency and a crypto-friendly U.S. SEC. He added that DeFi projects on Ethereum will thrive under Trump’s more favorable regulatory framework. Sectors like restaking needed a little regulatory push to attract institutional investors. Rejwan said he expected the new administration to lower barriers to entry and make it easier for early-stage crypto investors and resilient firms to innovate and thrive. Matt Houghan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, also expects Ethereum to boom in 2025 since the asset had three core things going for it. He pointed out that Ethereum sat at the center of the three biggest trends shaping crypto in 2025, including the rise of tokenization, stablecoins, and AI agents. Houghan asserted that Ethereum had dominant market share in the three areas. He said that ETH could break above its ATH of $4,878 to reach a new high of $7,000. According to Houghan, Washington’s new approach to crypto would unleash millions of entrepreneurs into crypto, and many of them would build apps on Ethereum and its L2s.

Per Busan Ilbo and Asia Kyungjae, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) said it would release more details after holding “discussions” with the Virtual Asset Committee.

(Source: MBCNEWS/YouTube/Screenshot) The FSC later responded by denying these reports , claiming that “nothing” had yet “been decided.” However, it now appears that the media reports were not as “groundless” as the FSC claimed. The regulator also said it wants to “protect” crypto “users,” and will help “improve” self-regulation in the sector. The FSC says it wants to “establish listing and delisting standards” for altcoins on domestic crypto exchanges. The body was speaking as crypto traders expressed growing fears of massive culls of meme coins and “kimchi coins” on domestic crypto exchange platforms. The FSC also said it wants to introduce new regulations to police the stablecoin sector. “There is a need to discuss how to create listing standards, what to do with stablecoins, and how to create rules of conduct for cryptoasset exchanges.

However, the media outlets noted that the FSC was largely “negative” on the matter of issuing Bitcoin spot ETF approvals. The Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo recently expressed a willingness to explore crypto ETF approval . In his New Year address, the Korea Financial Investment Association Chairman Seo Yu-seok spoke of turning the “digital asset market, including crypto ETFs,” into a “future growth engine.” “I will push for the legalization of token securities and cryptoasset ETFs to ensure that the digital asset market can become a driving force for the future growth of our capital market.” Korea Financial Investment Association Chairman Seo Yu-seok But FSC Director Kwon Dae-young said crypto ETF approval would be “a step too far.” He said that the government was “fully aware that changes are taking place globally.” North Korea released footage of the largest Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile launch into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan https://t.co/MLnxvj60OV pic.twitter.com/YD2J529cnO — Reuters (@Reuters) March 17, 2023 More Discussions Planned Seoul is currently “discussing the matter” with the Virtual Asset Committee, Kwon said.

This addition enables users to trade RLUSD on the platform together with other primary pairs, including USD, EUR, BTC, ETH, XRP, and USDT. The exchange added support for RLUSD on the Ethereum network, giving users a stable digital currency fully backed by the asset. RLUSD is intended to cater to both retail and institutional investors and offer a safe and efficient method of undertaking transactions in digital assets. RLUSD is denominated in US dollars and cash equivalents and is stable in liquidity. Additionally, Its compliance with certain legal procedures like the New York Trust Charter issuance is ideal for many financial users. RLUSD’s enterprise-grade features Ripple designed RLUSD for enterprise-grade applications. The stablecoin is intended for payments, tokenization, and DeFi, giving companies a reliable, blockchain-based means of conducting their operations. Leveraging Ripple’s experience in blockchain, RLUSD can be considered a reliable option for companies that want to use digital assets in traditional financial markets. Since the stablecoin is already integrated with the Ethereum network, it can be used in DeFi projects such as liquidity pools and decentralized exchanges. RLUSD availability has also been growing rapidly with Ripple’s efforts. As Cryptopolitan reported , Monica Long, the president of Ripple, stated that the company would soon announce more exchange listings. At the time of writing, RLUSD can be traded on the Archax, B2C2, Bitso, and Uphold exchanges, with future listings planned for Flowdesk and Zero Hash. Also, Ripple has partnered with Chainlink to make RLUSD available to the DeFi community. The collaboration was revealed on 7th January and will see Chainlink’s decentralized RLUSD price feeds integrated into the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. This partnership will help strengthen RLUSD within the DeFi ecosystem through the use of accurate and timely market data. This will be to increase reliability and address the issues of price manipulation and outages. RLUSD impressive growth The market adoption of RLUSD has picked up significantly, with more than 76% of the trading volume being recorded on a Bullish exchange, especially in the RLUSD/USDC and XRP/RLUSD pairs. At the same time, decentralized exchange Sologenic has a smaller share. The XRP/RLUSD pair on the platform has a 24-hour trading volume of $3.4 million, which is equal to 3.56%.

According to the analyst, a successful breakout of this bullish flag could result in a massive 50% price gain for XRP, bringing the cryptocurrency closer to its previous all-time high of $3.84, recorded during the 2021 bull run. XRP Price Targets $3.6 After Bullish Flag Breakout Over the past few weeks, the XRP price has formed a bullish flag pattern, indicating a potential for continued upward movement. According to crypto analyst Captain Faibik’s shared chart on X (formerly Twitter), XRP is preparing to break out of this bullish flag on the daily time frame chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk Of Supply Shock As ETF Issues Buy More BTC Than Was Produced In December A bullish flag is widely recognized as a continuation pattern. It forms when a cryptocurrency’s price is trading sideways or undergoing a correction and indicates the potential for a strong upward movement. On the analyst’s chart, XRP is testing the upper boundary of the bullish flag pattern, aiming to break above it and trigger its next price rally. Captain Faibik has predicted that if XRP successfully breaks out of this bullish flag and maintains a price above it, it could spark an impressive 50.22% rally. Currently trading at $2.2, If XRP can rally as much as 50% following its bullish flag breakout, its market price could jump significantly to $3.3. This projected target is just 16.36% away from breaching XRP’s $3.84 ATH, achieved during the previous bull run in 2021. Further solidifying his confidence in XRP’s future price trajectory, Captain Faibik’s recent prediction doubles down on former projections in earlier X posts, where the analyst forecasts a massive price increase to $3.66 for XRP. Elliott Waves To Push XRP Above $20 In another X post, a prominent crypto analyst identified as the “CryptoBull” predicted that the XRP price could soar above $20 later in this bull cycle. However, the analyst also projects that the cryptocurrency could reach a short-term target of $13 within the next few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000, What It Means For The Bull Market CryptoBull has based his optimistic XRP price projections on Elliott impulse waves, highlighting their impact on the cryptocurrency’s historical price movements. The analyst disclosed that Elliott impulse waves typically begin after a cryptocurrency experiences a significant price breakout. He further explained that in 2017, the five waves of the Elliott impulse wave cycle had triggered a price surge from $0.002 to $3.84, representing a staggering 70,000% increase. Based on this historical trend, CryptoBull projects that XRP could witness a similar bull rally. He forecasts that the five Elliott impulse waves could spark a 6,000% increase in the XRP price during this bull cycle, pushing it to new ATHs of $26.

Now in consolidation, the market might face a potential breakout if ongoing acquisition from BTC whales translates into a short-term price rally. Bitcoin Whales Taking Advantage of Correction According to CryptoQuant data , large buying activity has resumed onchain after what it termed the biggest selloff of 2024. As reported earlier by Coingape, the BTC price fell suddenly after the US jobs and ISM Services Prices PMI came in strong. Despite this macro data, which indicated no rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, traders stayed cautious. Today, the Bitcoin price traded from a high of $97,258.32 to as low as $92,525.84. Noting the price outlook, CryptoQuant Analyst Cauê Oliveira said market whales waited patiently to accumulate just below the $95,000 level. After the biggest dump of 2024, whales are accumulating Bitcoin again “However, large players took advantage of the consolidation to open TWAP positions, patiently accumulating just below US$ 95K.” – By @caueconomy Full post https://t.co/yGOkuW0zo7 pic.twitter.com/9lqlHoWa4O — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 8, 2025 In his detailed analysis, Oliveira said that institutional investors dumped around 79,000 BTC over a week. This action triggered a 15% correction that the market is still not free from. He pointed out that large whales took advantage of the situation to open “TWAP Position” over the past 30 days. Institutional Investors Shielding the Market Per the CryptoQuant analyst, Bitcoin whales have bought more than 30,000 BTC units over the past month. He confirmed that institutional investors are the primary source behind the buying pressure for the recovery of BTC. The analyst pointed out that the retail demand for BTC has remained at its highest level in five years. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales or institutional interest remains high overall. Most institutional buyers include firms like MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms. In a recent report, MicroStrategy bought $22 billion BTC in 2024. Following its purchases, the firm recorded a BTC yield of 74.3%. If related acquisitions continue, there are projections that it can help BTC print new highs in the mid-term. The Shift to a Third Force While institutional investors formed the Bitcoin whales caucus that pushed the coin’s price to an all-time high of $108,000 , nation states are predicted to join soon. After President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, conversations about a strategic Bitcoin reserve are growing. During his campaign, Trump pledged to set up such a reserve once he entered office, and the industry now expects him to fulfill his promises. If the US makes this move, market experts predict that other nations will follow. In the long run, the impact on Bitcoin price might be profound.

This bill seeks to allow citizens to escape the existing financial systems as prices continue to soar. The bill, filed for the 60th legislative session on February 3, aims to let Oklahomans get paid in Bitcoin and accept it as a form of payment. He noted that Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency with a limited supply, which can enable Oklahomans to save their earnings and investments. “As Bitcoin continues to rise and the value of the dollar continues to be printed away in Washington, D.C., Oklahoma must act to protect our people.” Senator Deever Voluntary participation for businesses and workers SB325 emphasizes that using Bitcoin payment options will be completely optional for both employers and employees. The proposal allows business entities and employees to choose the payment they prefer. According to Senator Deevers, Bitcoin is establishing itself as an important part of the traditional financial system. He mentioned that former President Donald Trump endorsed Bitcoin during his campaign and at different conferences. “Bitcoin has arrived into the mainstream of our economy, and it’s an essential part of the financial future,” he said. Oklahoma, through SB325, is trying to position itself as one of the early adaptors of financial technology, benefiting its citizens. The legislation will be considered during the state’s legislative session starting on February 3. He noted, “ This legislation puts Oklahoma in a leadership role nationally, ensuring our state embraces the future of financial technology .” Cryptocurrency adoption across the U.S. Oklahoma’s proposed Bitcoin initiative is in line with other US cities and states that have integrated cryptocurrencies into public service delivery. In November 2024, Detroit said it would become the largest city in the United States to accept cryptocurrency payments for taxes starting in 2025. PayPal will oversee the conversion of the cryptocurrencies to US dollars before the money is deposited into city accounts. In September 2024, Louisiana was the first state to accept cryptocurrency for government services. The supported cryptocurrencies were Bitcoin, Bitcoin Lightning, and USD Coin. The State of Louisiana’s Department of Wildlife and Fisheries received the first cryptocurrency payment on September 17, 2024. In addition, in a post on X, Dennis Porter, co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, disclosed that the 14th state is gearing up to bring legislation for the creation of a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.’ This is after similar attempts in 13 states. This growth shows an increasing interest of U.S. states in adopting Bitcoin as a part of the future economy.

The company indicated that spot BTC ETFs were primary drivers behind the current all-time high. Kobeissi Letter speculated that spot ETFs, unlike futures-based ETFs, provide investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin . It also pointed out that since spot ETFs started trading, Bitcoin funds have attracted $44 billion in cumulative inflows. According to Glassnode, more Bitcoin futures contracts are cash-margined than crypto-margined, indicating they are pegged on the US dollar, not cryptocurrencies.

He suggested that active and direct market participants are driving the surge rather than speculation. Lunde pointed out that inflows from futures-based ETFs such as ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) were also minimal and could not have led to the surge. The analyst provided a breakdown of open interest by cohort on the CME, pointing out that active and direct participants held over 85,000 BTC. Lunde highlighted that this amount was equal to what was held in March 2024. However, he pointed out that the 1x leveraged ETF declined throughout 2024 and held 31,752 BTC. Lunde also added that the 2x leveraged ETF has only recorded slight growth since March, indicating that leverage is no longer a growth catalyst in the current market. Bitcoin outperforms all other assets in 2024 According to Coinmarketcap, Bitcoin recorded an over 120% surge in 2024 amid developments in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Kobeissi Letter commented that BTC outperformed all other asset classes in 2024. Bloomberg also reported that BTC outperformed assets such as Cocoa, global equities, and gold in the past year. Coinmarketcap reported that in mid-December, BTC recorded an all-time high of $108,315 following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory. The surge was reportedly fueled by investor optimism since the presidential candidate had signaled that he would implement crypto-friendly policies once he assumed office. However, the price of digital assets eased after the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, announced that rate cuts would roll out slower than anticipated. The digital asset has since maintained its set wall between $99,700 and $100,000. However, as of the time of writing, BTC traded at $94,099, a 2% decline in 24 hours. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin clearing the $99,000 mark could cause large-scale liquidations, leading to a surge in spot price. Despite the market optimism, market players such as Peter Hughes, founder of Evolve Investing, warned investors against the volatility risks presented by Bitcoin. QCP Capital, in its note to its clients, also expressed its belief that the catalyst may come after institutions readjust asset allocation.

The clarification, released on January 8, 2025, addresses inaccuracies in Backpack’s January 7 press release, which suggested its involvement in asset recovery for former FTX EU customers. FTX Highlights Inaccuracy in Backpack’s FTX EU Acquisition Statements In a recent press release , FTX addressed statements made by Backpack entities regarding its purported acquisition of FTX EU. FTX stated that the January 7, 2025, Backpack announcement was made without FTX’s knowledge or involvement. According to the exchange, Backpack’s press release contain multiple inaccuracies that could mislead stakeholders. FTX emphasized that 100% of FTX EU share capital is still owned by FTX Europe AG, a subsidiary of FTX. While there was an earlier agreement to sell FTX EU to former insiders of FTX Europe as part of a settlement, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court overseeing the Chapter 11 process has not approved any transfer. The defunct exchange also confirmed that it was unaware of any indirect sale of FTX EU shares to Backpack before this week. Bankruptcy Court and Asset Recovery Process In addition, the defunct exchange clarified that Backpack has no role in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court-approved process for returning funds to creditors, including FTX EU’s former customers. The company reiterated that only FTX EU holds responsibility for determining and returning funds owed to its customers. The court’s Chapter 11 plan does not authorize the organization to make distributions to any creditors or former customers. The defunct exchange further stated that the amounts owed by FTX EU to its customers would be assessed solely by FTX EU following its sale, not by the exchange or the Bankruptcy Court. Therefore, the exchange disclaimed Backpack’s liability for repayments of EU customer funds. Furthermore, the defunct exchange expressed concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the information presented in Backpack’s materials. The report urged stakeholders to rely only on official FTX communications. Initial Distributions Under Bankruptcy Plan The defunct exchange also provided an update on its U.S. Bankruptcy Court-approved Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. The defunct exchange plan became effective on January 3, 2025, with the initial distribution record date set for the same day. Distributions to convenience class claimants are expected within 60 days, subject to regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, the exchange reaffirmed its commitment to adhering to the court’s processes and ensuring accurate communication with creditors. These developments come in light of recent media speculation that US President Joe Biden might pardon Sam Bankman-Fried , the founder of the defunct FTX Exchange. Biden’s recent pardon of his son has sparked further rumors that SBF could get the same treatment.

Leading coins like Ethereum, Ripple, and Chainlink hold significant positions in the market, while innovative newcomers like BlockDAG are redefining blockchain technology. Each coin presents unique advantages. For those aiming to enhance returns, this guide shines a spotlight on the top crypto gainers for 2025. From Chainlink’s infrastructure capabilities to BlockDAG’s growth prospects, these coins offer both potential and proven results in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): High Potential for Returns & Expanding Ecosystem BlockDAG (BDAG) has quickly become a significant player in the cryptocurrency sector, with a fundraising total of over $176.5 million and more than 17.7 billion coins distributed. With a current price of $0.0248 in presale batch 27, early supporters of BDAG have seen a 2380% surge in value, presenting a lucrative opportunity for those looking to maximize their gains. The network also features the BDAG400 bonus ending on 8th January, offering a 250% bonus for early purchases, alongside the Refer & Earn USDT program, which provides instant USDT cashback for both the referrer and buyer. This incentivized approach fosters broad participation and underscores BlockDAG’s commitment to its community. Leveraging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, BlockDAG achieves unprecedented scalability and decentralization. The roadmap includes a mainnet launch in 2025 and plans for listing on major exchanges, which will open up further liquidity and growth opportunities for participants. Analysts predict a possible increase in BDAG’s price to $1 this year, a potential 4,200% return for those joining before the current batch closes. These factors position BlockDAG at the forefront of our list of top crypto gainers , merging cutting-edge technology with immediate incentives. 2. Ethereum (ETH): The Pillar of DeFi Ethereum has transformed blockchain with its pioneering smart contracts, which are foundational to decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT markets. As the second most significant cryptocurrency, Ethereum is favored by developers and traders for its stability and potential for growth. However, challenges like scalability issues and high transaction fees have led some users to look for alternatives. Ethereum 2.0 aims to resolve these issues, though it has experienced delays. Still, Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem and its dominance in DeFi ensure it remains a critical asset in the cryptocurrency space. With a current price of $3,441, Ethereum is undeniably one of the top crypto gainers for 2025. 3. Ripple (XRP): Facilitator of Global Transactions Ripple has transformed cross-border payments by offering fast and economical transaction solutions. XRP’s effectiveness has drawn global financial institutions, placing it as a frontrunner in fintech. A recent legal triumph over the SEC has increased confidence, likely leading to expanded adoption. Although Ripple’s centralized model might draw some criticism, XRP’s practicality in improving international payments positions it as a preferred option among institutional traders. With a current price of $2.44 and innovative technology, XRP remains one of the top crypto gainers , especially for those interested in fintech advancements. 4. Chainlink (LINK): Decentralized Oracle Solutions Chainlink is essential for projects that require reliable oracles to link smart contracts with real-world data. Its decentralized network is crucial for DeFi applications, ensuring data accuracy and trust within blockchain operations. While its growth may be moderated by its dependency on smart contract adoption, Chainlink’s role in supporting blockchain infrastructure is vital. Continued innovations, such as hybrid smart contracts, enhance its utility and market position. Chainlink is projected to reach new all-time highs this year, solidifying its status among the top crypto gainers and as a vital component in the expansion of blockchain ecosystems. Choosing the Right Crypto for ROI Gains in 2025 Each of these cryptocurrencies offers distinct advantages. Ethereum appeals to those seeking a robust and tested ecosystem, while Ripple suits fintech enthusiasts with its efficiency in cross-border transactions. Chainlink caters to developers focused on infrastructure. BlockDAG, notable for its scalability, community incentives, and potential for a 4,200% return this year, is the most adaptable choice among the top crypto gainers . Combining immediate rewards with long-term growth potential, it stands out as the optimal choice for maximizing ROI. Investors should align their selections with their goals to fully capitalize on the opportunities best suited to their strategies.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 110,100 followers on the social media platform X that XRP may be gearing up for a new leg up based on its SuperTrend indicator. The SuperTrend indicator is a technical analysis tool that aims to identify potential entry and exit points based on an asset’s trend. Says Martinez, “The last time the SuperTrend indicator flipped bullish on the 12-hour chart, XRP went up 470%… It just flipped bullish again.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.28. Turning to Cardano, the trader thinks that ADA looks poised for a big rally after breaking out from a bullish continuation pattern on the daily chart. “Cardano ADA is breaking out of a bull pennant, targeting $3!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ADA is worth $0.99. Next up is the top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), which the trader says is being gobbled up by deep-pocketed investors. “Whales bought 140 million Dogecoin DOGE in [24 hours]!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez also notes that traders are currently bearish on Dogecoin, suggesting that the meme token may be primed to go against the crowd. “Dogecoin DOGE weighted social sentiment is at -0.60, which means the crowd remains very pessimistic about its upside potential. This might be a good time to be a contrarian!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.35.

Binance Founder Downplays Bitcoin $100K Milestone With A Bold Remark,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/boring-binance-founder-downplays-bitcoin-100k-milestone-with-a-bold-remark/,"A former executive of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange expects that Bitcoin could soar higher than the $100,000 level. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao believes that the firstborn cryptocurrency is capable of hitting a higher price point, following its brief recovery to $100,000 on Tuesday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges Below $100K Despite Positive Coinbase Premium Signal – What’s Next? A “Boring” Level? Bitcoin embraced the new year on a positive note as the crypto recorded a recovery that catapulted it to reach the $100,000 mark. Zhao, who is also the founder of Binance, suggested that the top crypto asset can do better and surpass the $100k price point. “100k is boring, right?” Zhao said in a post, responding to Bitcoin recovery. Investors have seen Bitcoin reclaim its lost glory after hitting $100,000 after the digital asset slid down the key level on December 19, staying below $100,000 for quite some time before gaining momentum to propel it to this milestone level. 100k is boring, right? — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 7, 2025 Bitcoin Destined To Reach New Heights Zhao, popularly known as CZ, asserted that Bitcoin is far more capable of reaching a price point beyond $100k. Hence, the former crypto firm executive was not surprised with BTC making a comeback and surging in the last 24 hours. The ex-Binance CEO’s post on X sparked excitement among members of the cryptocurrency community as Zhao’s post suggests that BTC prices could go up. Last month, Bitwise executive Matt Hougan predicted that the bullish run for cryptocurrency would still gain momentum until 2025. Hougan expects that other top crypto assets would soar in price such with Bitcoin leading the charge. Hougan believes that BTC could reach as high as $200,000 before the end of 2025, claiming that inflows from the Bitcoin ETFs could fuel the demand from corporate entities. This, as a result, would increase their exposure to the premier crypto asset. Related Reading: Less Than 1% Of Bitcoin Investors In Loss After BTC Reclaims $100,000 Positive Sentiment Continues Zhao has a positive outlook for cryptocurrencies, saying that 2025 would be a “send it’ year” for digital assets.

If you ever wondered why people tweet 4, it came from this tweet 2 years ago today. In hindsight, should’ve made “4” the “0”th point. 😂 2025 will be a “send it” year. https://t.co/6f27u0mYez — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 3, 2025 Other market analysts agree that digital assets would experience a surge in their prices in 2025, which would be driven by crypto adoption from institutional investors and national governments. Although the former Binance CEO believes in Bitcoin moving past $100,000, Zhao did not provide a price prediction for the year. However, there were occasions that Zhao hinted that Bitcoin could be traded at $850,000 per coin.

The add-on incorporates third-party functionality within the web browser interface. While alerting the users, the exchange said that they hadn’t released any Firefox browser extensions and called on users who might have mistakenly downloaded the add-on to move any funds or digital assets in wallets connected to the malicious extension. OKX further contacted Firefox to remove the applications before they harm users. OKX also further advised users to avoid downloading OKX-specific software from third parties. Fraudulent browser plugins have been used to access sensitive data and often steal funds. Crypto criminals use the technique, also known as a phishing scam, to steal cryptocurrency. Certik reports that phishing was among the leading crypto scams in 2024. Cybercriminals are executing vicious phishing scams CertiK published Hack3d: The Web3 Security Report 2024, highlighting the most notorious cyber security threats to cryptocurrency in 2024. The report states that crypto investors lost over $1 billion in 296 phishing scams in 2024, accounting for a 21% YoY rise from 2023. In September 2024, McAfee discovered malware known as SpyAgent on Android phones. The malware appeared like a legitimate Android application but was a scam that had affected over 280 fraudulent applications. Using optical character recognition (OCR), SpyAgent scans images stored on Android’s memory and steals sensitive information, including cryptocurrency passcodes stored in the images. The researchers at McAfee also noted that the malware replicated through text message links easily lured users to download the fraudulent app. This approach made it easiest for scammers to bypass the security features on Google’s app store. Decentraland September X breach saw users scammed by phishing links On September 19, 2024, Decentraland lost control of its X social media page. Hackers compromised the 3D virtual reality metaverse on the Ethereum network. Cybercriminals use the platform to promote phishing links to followers. They advertised a fake MANA airdrop, which lured users to click the links. Anyone who clicked the link and connected their wallets saw their funds drained by the malware. There has been no reports of exact figures stating how many people lost their funds to the fake OKX malware as of this writing.

With recent movements across major cryptocurrencies, the focus is gradually shifting towards emerging platforms offering innovative solutions. Polkadot’s steady performance, coupled with SUI’s notable collaborations, has kept investors intrigued. But if one name creates ripples in the space, it’s Qubetics ($TICS). The platform’s presale phase is turning heads for the impressive numbers and the technology backing it. This article will cover the developments and updates of Qubetics, Polkadot, and SUI—three cryptos making waves as 2025 kicks off. How Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE Secures Its Spot Among the Best Cryptos to Invest in January 2025 Blockchain development often feels like navigating a maze of complex code and intricate systems. Qubetics ($TICS) disrupts this pattern with its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, designed to simplify blockchain application creation. What makes QubeQode IDE unique? Imagine crafting blockchain applications by simply dragging and dropping components. Need token management or user authentication? It’s all pre-built and ready to integrate seamlessly. Even for those without extensive coding experience, QubeQode’s form-based configuration allows users to set application logic through intuitive forms. For more advanced developers, the IDE includes a comprehensive code snippet library. This treasure trove of pre-written code covers common blockchain tasks, expediting development time and minimising errors. AI plays a crucial role here, too. Qubetics leverages AI to assist in smart contract generation, providing secure and efficient code based on user input. Code completion, error detection, and application optimisation further streamline the development process, making it accessible yet powerful. Adding to the buzz, Qubetics recently held its third AMA session , addressing community questions and hinting at innovations. For those on the lookout for the best cryptos to invest in January 2025, Qubetics is drawing serious attention. Polkadot – A Resilient Player in the Crypto Market Polkadot (DOT) has had its fair share of ups and downs. Initially sold at $0.29 during its ICO in October 2017, the project faced challenges post-launch. However, 2021 marked a turning point, with Polkadot reaching an all-time high of $55 in November. Fast forward to 2024, and DOT hit a peak of $11.8, although it currently trades at $7.71 in 2025. While not at its previous heights, Polkadot remains a solid contender in the blockchain ecosystem, driven by its interoperability features and continuous development. SUI – A Star in Blockchain Innovation SUI’s growth trajectory highlights its scalability and commitment to developer-friendly solutions. Partnering with industry giants like Franklin Templeton, Router Chain, and Google Cloud through ZettaBlock, SUI stands out in real-time data access and dApp development. Despite a brief downtime in November 2024, SUI’s Global Accelerator Program continues to drive ecosystem growth by providing funding and expertise. Trading at $4.25, SUI’s expanding market presence makes it an appealing investment. Qubetics Presale Surges – Making a Strong Case as One of the Best Cryptos to Invest in January 2025 The Qubetics presale isn’t just another token sale—it’s an event attracting thousands. Currently, in Phase 16, the presale offers a unique structure. Each week, the price increases by 10%, culminating in a 20% surge during the final phase. This mechanism fuels anticipation, with investors eager to lock in the current rate of $0.045 per token. To date, Qubetics has raised over $9 million, boasting 13,700+ holders and 407 million tokens sold. Let’s break it down: a $500 investment today would secure around 10,972.14 $TICS tokens. Should the token hit $10, that same investment would be worth approximately $109,721.36—an ROI of over 21,844%. And if $TICS climbs to $15? We’re looking at a potential value of $164,582.03, translating to an ROI exceeding 32,800%. With numbers like these, it’s no surprise analysts are eyeing Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to invest in January 2025 . Conclusion Diversification remains key. Polkadot and SUI present strong cases for long-term growth, but the spotlight is undoubtedly on Qubetics. With its innovative QubeQode IDE and impressive presale figures, Qubetics positions itself as a frontrunner for those seeking the best cryptos to invest in January 2025. The potential returns are significant, and as each presale phase pushes prices higher, now might be the perfect moment to secure $TICS tokens. Qubetics isn’t just another project—it’s shaping up to be a game-changer in blockchain development.

With outgoing CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam set to step down on inauguration day, the new appointee is expected to play a crucial role in shaping the regulatory framework for the growing digital asset market in the United States. CFTC Chair Candidates Interviewed by Trump Admin According to Fox Business , a number of candidates have been reportedly met with by Trump’s transition team for the CFTC chair position with at least six individuals in the running for the post. Current frontrunners for the CFTC position include Summer Mersinger, the CFTC Commissioner, and Brian Quintenz, the current head of crypto policy at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The two candidates are familiar with cryptocurrencies and have some experience in the regulation of the industry. Quintenz has experience in the development of crypto regulations as he served at the CFTC and worked with the former chair Chris Giancarlo to issue clearance for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. The fact that he is connected to Andreessen Horowitz is beneficial because its founder Marc Andreessen is one of Trump’s leading advisors on crypto and AI. Mersinger, who is a sitting commissioner at the CFTC, is also an influential policy maker in Washington D.C. She has been a champion for innovation while standing for the rights of consumers within the cryptocurrency industry. She has been applauded by the industry participants for her dissents on enforcement actions against decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. A Shift in Crypto Regulation Under Trump’s Administration The CFTC chair pick is particularly significant due to Donald Trump’s aspiration to make the US the leading country in cryptocurrency innovation. The current outgoing Biden administration, with the SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler , has adopted a more enforcement-oriented approach to crypto regulation. This approach upset the crypto industry that said that such an approach creates ambiguities and drives businesses away to other countries. On the other hand, President elect Donald Trump has indicated that he will pursue a less hostile approach to regulation. While on the campaign trail, he was endorsed by many crypto executives and vowed to reverse what he and others saw as excessive regulation. There are already appointments to key roles of crypto-supporters including Paul Atkins to be the head of the SEC and Scott Bessent as the head of Treasury. Therefore, the appointment of a CFTC Chair that is favorable to crypto would only strengthen this agenda. Mersinger and Quintenz have also been vocal about their disapproval of the current ‘regulation by enforcement’ regime. They have urged the CFTC to assume the mantle of leading regulator of digital assets, claiming that the agency is in a better position to promote innovation than the SEC. Outgoing CFTC Chair Behnam’s Final Push for Crypto Legislation Outgoing chairman of the CFTC, Rostin Behnam has emphasized the importance of the comprehensive regulation of cryptocurrencies before his exit. Speaking at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday for the last time, Behnam pointed out that the absence of a specific set of rules has left certain issues that require the attention of Congress. Behnam said, “My position remains the same, and I will support the CFTC to address this gap if Congress wishes it to do so even after I am no longer part of the Commission.” He also said that new laws could take from six to ten months, with agency rulemaking taking one more year. While serving at the CFTC, the commission brought enforcement action s against several crypto companies, including the defunct exchange FTX and Gemini Trust. Nevertheless, Behnam pointed out that the current legal framework is inadequate to deal with the issues emerging from digital assets and called on the legislators to focus on the development of dedicated crypto laws.

Partnerships with industry leaders have boosted its market visibility, while Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 has contributed to its positive momentum. Meanwhile, Raydium’s trading volume surged 60% in a week, reaching $16.58 billion. This activity, fueled by Solana-based meme coins, drove the RAY token’s price to $5.6, a 50% increase from December 2024 lows. In addition, the Web3Bay (3BAY) token presale continues to attract attention, raising $470,000 and selling over 127.5M 3BAY tokens in record time. Its decentralized E-Commerce ecosystem integrates blockchain and traditional payment systems, offering a solid mix of security and scalability. As early adopters await a 6,430% ROI post-launch, Web3Bay is reshaping digital commerce through blockchain-driven advancements. Render Network Rallies 22% with Major Partnerships Render Network experienced a significant resurgence in early 2025, with a 22% price increase in January. This rebound follows a tough end to 2024, where Render crypto saw a significant dip, largely influenced by Bitcoin’s fluctuations. As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 mark, Render’s price has benefitted from its upward momentum, rising from $6.60 to $8.69. The key to this recovery has been Render Network’s strategic partnerships with major platforms like Dropbox, Blender, and Maxon Redshift. These collaborations have enhanced Render’s market visibility and bolstered investor confidence, contributing to a growing sentiment in Render’s network. Strong on-chain activity and increasing market optimism position Render Network for continued growth. Raydium’s Trading Volume Surge Fuels Bullish Momentum Raydium’s trading volume has surged, driving the price of the RAY token to new highs. The token saw a 50% increase from its lowest point in December, reaching $5.6, as Raydium’s trading volume jumped by 60% to $16.58 billion in the past seven days. This spike in Raydium’s trading volume comes due to a strong performance by Solana meme coins, which have dominated the market. Raydium has outperformed other popular decentralized exchange tokens, with its market cap rising to $1.3 billion. The increase in Raydium’s trading volume reflects growing investor confidence, as the platform solidifies its position as the second-largest player in the DEX space.

At the same time, the Polkadot ecosystem is prospering, marked by significant strides such as a $210 million treasury and enhanced interoperability between networks. Moreover, BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan is enhancing its international presence, crucial for boosting presale activity. This alliance has elevated its presale to over $176.5 million, making BlockDAG (BDAG) a prime candidate for the best crypto for 2025. BNB Bullish Sentiment Builds as Prices Stay Above $700 BNB’s bullish sentiment is intensifying as Binance Coin stabilizes around the crucial $700 mark. After breaking out of a downward channel, the cryptocurrency is testing previous resistance as support, hinting at potential bullish trends. An immediate resistance at $728 is an important barrier; overcoming it may lead to higher Fibonacci levels and a fresh upward surge. The BNB bullish sentiment is also highlighted by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which, despite showing market uncertainty, points towards a potential decisive upward trend. Staying above $700 suggests more potential for an upward trajectory, whereas failing to overcome resistance could lead to a reevaluation of lower support levels at $684 and $671, possibly extending the correction period. Polkadot Ecosystem Achieves $210 Million Treasury The Polkadot ecosystem has exhibited impressive growth in 2024, with its Treasury reaching a new high of $210 million, or about 31 million DOT. This fiscal milestone emphasizes the ecosystem’s robustness, bolstered by Polkadot’s inflation mechanism to regenerate resources. Additionally, the ecosystem has seen a 300% increase in parachain transactions, with Kusama hitting a peak of 140,000 transactions per second during the “Spammening” event in December. The network has also rolled out three trustless bridges—Snowbridge, Polkadot-Kusama, and Hyperbridge—that improve cross-chain connections. Despite a 20% decrease in DOT prices in 2024, these achievements highlight the network’s ongoing dedication to innovation and broader adoption. BlockDAG and Inter Milan: Pioneering Global Crypto Reach Through Soccer BlockDAG’s collaboration with Inter Milan represents a significant advancement in global crypto adoption by uniting modern blockchain technology with the dynamic domain of one of soccer’s greatest teams. With a vast fanbase worldwide, Inter Milan provides BlockDAG an exceptional stage to display its pioneering technology. Showcasing at the famed San Siro Stadium during games offers unparalleled exposure, positioning BlockDAG as a familiar name not just in the blockchain community but among a global sports-loving audience as well. More than just enhancing visibility, this partnership fosters deep connections. Through BlockDAG’s blockchain, Inter Milan supporters can enjoy exclusive digital collectibles, unique content, and special experiences that enhance their connection with the team. Engagements that involve players and bespoke fan experiences strengthen this bond further. By integrating blockchain with sports, BlockDAG demonstrates how technology can revolutionize fan involvement, creating a community that feels more engaged than ever. Moreover, this collaboration has significantly driven the growth of BlockDAG’s coin. During its presale, the coin’s value increased by 2380%, from $0.001 in the first presale batch to $0.0248 by the 27th batch, accumulating over $176.5 million. With more than 17.7 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s presale has become the largest on the market. This impressive growth, spurred by the partnership’s global visibility, establishes BlockDAG as a formidable contender for the best crypto for 2025 and cements its position in the blockchain sector. Key Insights & Future Crypto Leader The enduring BNB bullish sentiment signals its potential for further advancement as it remains stable above crucial price points, reinforcing its stature in the crypto market. The Polkadot ecosystem continues to demonstrate growth and innovation, with a treasury valued at $210 million and achievements in interoperability that encourage consistent adoption. However, BlockDAG is presenting the most compelling argument as the best crypto for 2025 . Its unprecedented presale success and a 2380% increase in coin value from the first batch underscore its robust momentum, while the Inter Milan partnership boosts its global profile. With the coin’s value escalating swiftly, those delaying their purchase might miss out on BlockDAG’s significant expansion.

Solana (SOL) is on the rise, with analysts predicting it could hit $250 soon. Kaspa (KAS), known for its high-speed transactions, is also gaining traction with a target of $0.5. Meanwhile, a new player is set to dominate the presale market – Lightchain AI . Currently priced at $0.004875 in its presale, Lightchain AI has raised over $8.5 million and is emerging as a top contender for significant growth. Unlike Solana and Kaspa, which focus on blockchain speed and scalability, Lightchain AI combines blockchain with artificial intelligence, paving the way for widespread adoption and long-term success. Solana’s Incredible Rise and Path to $250 Solana has been a big part of the blockchain world, famous for its quick deal speeds and cheap costs. After going through some highs and lows last year, Solana is ͏back on path, with experts saying it might hit $250 soon because of rising interest from big companies and use in the DeFi and NFT areas. Solana’s wins are mostly due to its smart Proof of History way, which helps it grow fast without giving up its decentralization. Even with its clear future, Solana still runs into rivals from other blockchains. While it’s set for rise, its need on network crowding and deal holdups in times of high want might be a thing that holds back its chance to keep steady work over time. Kaspa’s Target of $0.5 Speed and Scalability in a Competitive Market Kaspa, a highly scalable Layer 1 blockchain, has been gaining traction due to its high throughput capabilities. With a target price of $0.5, Kaspa aims to provide instantaneous block confirmation through its blockDAG technology, enabling faster transactions compared to traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, despite its scalability, Kaspa still faces the challenge of wider adoption. Its technology is relatively new, and although speed is its key selling point, it will need a more robust use case and developer ecosystem to compete with other established platforms in the space. Nevertheless, Kaspa’s high-speed transactions and low fees make it an attractive option for developers and users seeking blockchain efficiency.

38710391,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=672450,1736391638,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Solana Must Reclaim Momentum In The Coming Weeks – SOL/BTC Ratio At A Pivotal Point,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-must-reclaim-momentum-in-the-coming-weeks-sol-btc-ratio-at-a-pivotal-point/,"Solana is currently trading at $197, marking a 13% decline from the local high it achieved earlier this week. The broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing heightened indecision, with some fear creeping in as Bitcoin struggles to reclaim the pivotal $100,000 level. This hesitation has created ripple effects across altcoins, including Solana, which has seen its recent momentum stall. Related Reading: Ethereum Will Drop Before The Next Leg Up – Analyst Sets Target Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that $SOL/BTC could be a key pair to monitor in the coming weeks. Jelle suggests that Solana’s performance against Bitcoin may provide critical insights into its potential trajectory. While Solana remains a market favorite due to its robust ecosystem and innovative developments, its ability to reclaim strength relative to BTC will likely influence investor sentiment. As Solana continues to test key support levels, market participants are closely watching for signs of a breakout or further consolidation. The next few weeks could be decisive for Solana’s price action, setting the tone for its performance in the months ahead. Will Solana bounce back to reclaim its highs, or will market uncertainty push it lower? Investors are waiting for clear signals amid this period of flux. Solana Enters A Crucial Phase Solana is trading just above the critical $190 support level, a former supply zone that has flipped into demand. This level represents a key test for the asset as it seeks to solidify its bullish trajectory. Solana has been forming higher lows, a positive sign of strength, but it still needs to reclaim higher supply zones to confirm a sustained bullish trend. Top analyst Jelle recently shared his insights on X, emphasizing the importance of monitoring the SOL/BTC pair in the coming weeks. He noted that Solana is entering what appears to be a bullish phase, but its performance against Bitcoin will be a critical factor in determining its future direction. According to Jelle, Solana must reclaim the 0.0022 level against BTC to signal strength and confirm its bullish outlook. Should Solana fail to achieve this, Jelle indicated that he would consider reallocating some of his exposure back into Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Breakout Or Breakdown? The current market indecision, fueled by Bitcoin’s struggle to break above $100,000, has left many altcoins, including Solana, in a state of flux. A breakout above the 0.0022 level on the SOL/BTC chart would not only reinforce confidence in Solana’s bullish potential but also mark it as a strong contender in the ongoing market rally. Testing Demand At Key Levels Solana is currently trading at $196, navigating a critical demand zone between $193 and $200. This range serves as a key battleground for bulls and bears as Solana attempts to sustain its bullish trajectory. For bulls to regain control, the price must decisively break above the $200 level, invalidating bearish pressure and setting the stage for further gains. To solidify its bullish structure, Solana needs to reclaim the $222 mark. Achieving this would establish a higher high, reinforcing confidence among investors and signaling the continuation of its upward trend. However, failure to push above $200 could leave the price vulnerable to further downside pressure.

This could result in Solana entering a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before attempting another breakout.

However, investors looking to make huge profits in the long term are shifting to fresh high-potential tokens. This explains why RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging DeFi altcoin, has pumped significantly during its presale. Why are Dogecoin (DOGE) investors migrating to RCO Finance (RCOF)? Read on to discover! Dogecoin Jumps 19% In A Week: More Growth In Store. Dogecoin has impressed meme coin enthusiasts over the past week after surging by double digits. On December 30, Dogecoin was changing hands at around $0.3214. After trading around this level for days, Dogecoin spiked on January 3, 2025. This surge came after Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $98,000 level. Specifically, Dogecoin traded as high as $0.3980 on January 4. However, day traders started taking profits, and Dogecoin pulled back slightly. By January 6, Dogecoin (DOGE) had stabilized at around $0.3843. This price means Dogecoin has gained 19% over the past week. However, analysts foresee Dogecoin pulling back as investors search for high-potential tokens to maximize gains in 2025. This explains why Dogecoin whales have poured $500,000 into RCO Finance (RCOF). RCO Finance Stuns Investors With Its Crypto AI Features While Dogecoin has recorded notable weekly gains, investors are flocking to RCO FInance because this DeFi platform boasts a vast asset offering. Specifically, RCO Finance supports over 120,000 assets spread across 12,500+ classes. These include crypto, decentralized derivatives, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). This offering simplifies portfolio diversification, explaining why RCO Finance is quickly gaining ground. Moreover, RCO Finance runs on AI and blockchain technology. This avant-garde infrastructure enables this burgeoning platform to support an array of modern trading tools. The most noteworthy tool in the RCO Finance ecosystem is its AI-powered robo advisor. This robo advisor has caught investors’ attention because it uses machine learning and advanced algorithms to offer free custom investment recommendations based on your risk tolerance and financial objectives. To achieve this, the robo advisor analyzes the market and gleans actionable data. With the obtained data the robo advisor easily helps you pinpoint the best time to buy or sell specific assets. This approach helps prevent the need to rely on emotions, thus increasing your chances of profitability while minimizing risk exposure. Moreover, the robo advisor can complete transactions on your behalf. This feature lets you take a break from hands-on investing. Additionally, it enables the robo advisor to adjust your portfolio with high-potential investments in real-time, boosting your chances of profitability. RCO Finance has also made waves in the crypto industry because it issues non-KYC debit cards, which simplify the spending of altcoins like Dogecoin. On top of this, RCO Finance supports non-KYC registration. This provision lowers the barriers to entry and helps you maintain anonymity. RCOF Gains Traction During Stage 4: Huge Returns In Store Dogecoin whales are also flocking to RCO Finance to purchase its native token, RCOF. RCOF has won over investors because it is a safe investment. It is worth noting that SolidProof, a leader in blockchain security, audited RCOF’s smart contract and verified that it meets the crypto industry’s safety standards. RCOF has also grown significantly despite being in its presale. As of January 6, RCOF has raised $10.58 million, making it one of the fastest-growing ICOs. Amazingly, this crypto AI token has achieved this funding milestone during Stage 4 of its presale. Investors can now purchase RCOF at $0.0778 and await huge returns as this altcoin moves toward its listing price of $0.4-$0.6. Moreover, analysts foresee RCOF jumping 43,019% in Q1 2025. By surging 43,019%, RCOF will have outshined Dogecoin’s 7,400% climb in 2021. This explains why you should seize this rare opportunity to join the RCOF presale!

With 2025 fast approaching, investors are searching for the top coins to buy and hold this year, and it’s clear that several emerging and established coins are making waves.

Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics is offering groundbreaking solutions to problems like scalability, interoperability, and blockchain development through its native tools and features.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $157.81. ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $256.44 by 2031. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As the adoption of decentralized identities and Web3 technology continues to grow, ENS continues to position itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $32.45 Market Cap $1,153,113,307.64 Trading Volume $204,959,217.68 Circulating Supply 34,357,630.51 ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $34.00 24-h Low $32.00 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction (February 7) $105.40 (228.10%) Volatility (30-day Volatility) 37.45% 50-Day SMA $34.57 14-Day RSI 46.39 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $24.06 Ethereum Name Service price analysis: Bears remain in control of the market TL;DR Breakdown Ethereum Name Service’s price analysis shows a bearish trend. A breakout above $34.91 could renew bulls’ interest. The resistance for ENS is present at $37.11. The ENS price analysis for January 9 shows a recent decline, indicating bearish pressure after initial upsides. The resistance level is near $37.11, where selling pressure has been observed, while support is identified around $32.00, providing a potential rebound zone. The movement reflects a short-term downward trend, with traders watching for a breakout above resistance or further dips toward support to determine the next direction. Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart: Will ENS see renewed bullish momentum soon? The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) chart shows a bearish trend, with the current price of $32.51 trading below the 20-day SMA of $34.91, indicating weakened bullish momentum. Recent price corrections from highs above $48 in mid-December reflect profit-taking and high volatility. ENS to see renewed bullish momentum soon? The RSI at 43.02 suggests neutral to mildly oversold conditions. Another indicator, the MACD, shows a bearish crossover with a negative histogram, signaling limited buying momentum but hinting at a slowdown in selling pressure. A breakout above $34.91 could signal renewed bullish momentum, while a drop below $30 might lead to stronger support levels around $28. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis: ENS struggles as bear pressure intensifies The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) 4-hour chart shows the price struggling at $32.29, hovering just above the Chande Kroll Stop-long level of $32.00, which highlights bearish pressure. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.12 suggests sellers are slightly stronger, with limited buying activity in the market. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis Similarly, the Balance of Power at -0.11 points to bears having the upper hand, but not overwhelmingly so. To regain momentum, ENS needs to break above $37.11. Until then, the market remains under pressure, and further downsides or consolidation can be expected. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $41.00 SELL SMA 5 $40.43 SELL SMA 10 $35.64 SELL SMA 21 $35.75 SELL SMA 50 $34.57 SELL SMA 100 $25.97 BUY SMA 200 $24.06 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $37.23 SELL EMA 5 $38.56 SELL EMA 10 $39.68 SELL EMA 21 $38.12 SELL EMA 50 $31.90 BUY EMA 100 $26.87 BUY EMA 200 $23.50 BUY What to expect from ENS? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is currently under bearish pressure, with the price near the critical support level of $32.00. A drop below this could push the price toward $28, while a breakout above $37.11 could signal a bullish recovery. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will fully recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $124.93 by 2027. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending up to $250 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest.

The move, which came just days before President Joe Biden leaves office, is another piece of a larger strategy to control who gets to develop and use cutting-edge AI. According to a Bloomberg report , the plan purports to cut sales of AI chips used in data centers based on country and company. This is an effort to limit China and Russia’s access to advanced technology. Sources familiar with the issue said the goal is to prod AI growth in US-allied countries and force global companies to conform to American standards.

However, most countries would have limits on how much computing power they can bring in.

Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) has seen a massive 72% surge in trading volume, while Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is turning heads on Solana despite recent dips. Yet, the real excitement centres on BTFD Coin, whose innovative referral programme and growing Bulls Squad are creating buzz among crypto enthusiasts. Meme coins have always stood out for their ability to build loyal communities around fun and quirky concepts. From BTFD Coin’s bullish movement to the ancient prophecies of Goatseus Maximus and the rallying cry of “Peanut Forever,” these tokens prove there’s more to crypto than just numbers. BTFD Coin, however, is redefining the space with its referral programme, staking rewards, and engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, cementing its spot as one of the top new meme coins to join today . BTFD Coin: The Referral Programme That Rewards the Bulls What if earning crypto rewards was as simple as sharing a code? BTFD Coin’s referral programme is making waves in the crypto world, offering participants a chance to earn substantial rewards for inviting others to join the presale. Designed to benefit both referrers and referrals, this programme is quickly becoming one of the driving forces behind BTFD’s presale success. Here’s how it works: Once you connect your wallet on the BTFD buy page, you’ll receive a unique referral code. Share this code with your friends, family, or community members. When someone uses your code to make a purchase of $50 or more, they’ll receive an extra 10% in $BTFD tokens on top of their purchase. For you, every referral adds up—referrers who make it to the top 20 on the leaderboard by the end of the month receive 10% of the total raise amount in $BTFD tokens as a bonus. The competition resets monthly, running until the last day of the month at 6 pm UTC and restarting at 00:01 UTC on the 1st of the following month. It’s an exciting way to build the Bulls Squad while earning massive rewards. At its current price of $0.000142 in the 13th presale stage, the potential to stack $BTFD tokens is enormous. For example, if you refer someone who invests $1,000, you’d receive 10% of that in $BTFD tokens. By the time the token lists at $0.0006, those rewards could be worth significantly more. With over $5 million raised, 63 billion tokens sold, and 7,900 Bulls already onboard, BTFD Coin is proving to be one of the top new meme coins to join today. Its referral programme isn’t just about growing numbers; it’s about creating a thriving community where everyone benefits. Getting started is easy. Set up your wallet using MetaMask or Trust Wallet, connect to the BTFD buy page , and start sharing your referral code. With its bullish rewards, a vibrant community, and the added perks of staking and gameplay, BTFD Coin is setting a new standard for meme coins. The Bulls Squad is charging ahead—don’t miss your chance to join the movement. Goatseus Maximus: Prophecies of Growth Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) is no ordinary meme coin. Created by the enigmatic truth_terminal, it carries the weight of ancient meme prophecies while making waves in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space. Trading at $0.425, GOAT is down 17.18% in the last 24 hours but has seen a stunning 72% surge in trading volume, now at $174.2 million. This uptick in volume signals growing investor interest, especially as analysts predict a rise to $0.645 by February 2025. Longer-term projections are even more bullish, with a potential climb to $3.37 by 2030. While GOAT’s volatility warrants caution, its strong narrative and DeFi integration make it one of the top new meme coins to join today for investors looking to balance risk and reward. The community behind GOAT is just as unique as the token itself. Rooted in meme culture and powered by a blend of nostalgia and innovation, Goatseus Maximus offers more than just speculative gains—it’s a statement. If the trading volume continues its upward trajectory, GOAT could become a major player in the meme-inspired DeFi market. Peanut the Squirrel: Turning Volatility into Opportunity On the Solana network, Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is steadily building a loyal community. Although its price has dipped to $0.6051, with a 14.6% decline in the past 24 hours, PNUT’s trading volume has surged by 38.18%, indicating sustained interest from investors. The token’s charm lies in its whimsical branding and the viral #JusticeForPeanut campaign, which has ignited passion among supporters. The slogan “Peanut Forever” reflects the enduring appeal of meme coins like PNUT, resonating with its backers. Despite a 55.87% drop over the last month, many see this downturn as a prime opportunity to buy into the dip. Market experts suggest that PNUT’s potential hinges on maintaining momentum and deepening its presence within the growing Solana ecosystem. For short-term investors eager to ride the waves of volatility, Peanut the Squirrel is among the top new meme coins to join today, particularly for those drawn to its underdog narrative. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market continues to thrive on innovation and community spirit. Goatseus Maximus stands out for its rising trading volume and long-term potential, while Peanut the Squirrel’s Solana-based charm keeps it in the spotlight. However, the real winner here is BTFD Coin. With its referral programme, vibrant Bulls Squad, and growing presale success, it’s redefining what a meme coin can achieve. Don’t miss your chance to join this bull run— invest in BTFD Coin today and take advantage of its explosive growth potential.

The price recently dipped more than 5-6 percent, erasing the gains made in the last week. XRP could still experience some upward movement, though key levels are crucial for understanding whether the market sentiment is shifting. Key Levels to Watch XRP is currently in a consolidation phase , which could exist for a while. However, on a smaller time frame, this phase may be nearing its end. A final upward move could complete a larger 5th wave, potentially driving XRP to new all-time highs. The most recent Wave 4 bottomed in July 2023, with the market possibly entering the 5th wave upward. Resistance Zones (Long Term) Key resistance levels to monitor are the all-time high of $3.30 from December 2017. Above that, the next resistance points are $4.20 and $5.00. If XRP manages to reach a new high, a major correction could follow, similar to the previous Wave 2. This correction could be both deep and long, so caution is advised. Short-Term Market Structure On the smaller time frame, XRP is currently forming a triangle pattern, hinting at a market indecision. This typically precedes another upward move. A break above the $2.46 level would signal that a low has formed, potentially paving the way for new all-time highs. Current Support Levels Key support levels are between $2.29 and $2.40. If XRP falls below $1.96, it would signal a larger correction, though not necessarily a continuation of the triangle pattern. To keep the bullish outlook intact, XRP must hold above this green support zone. What’s Next for XRP? If XRP breaks above the last swing high at $2.46, it could signal the beginning of a move towards new highs. Until then, attention is focused on whether the price can hold at support and generate a strong reaction.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 03:48:04

Offering a blend of innovation and efficiency, it bridges the gap between DeFi (decentralized finance) and TradFi (traditional financial) systems. While the promise is vast, navigating its complexities is crucial for understanding its role in the broader financial ecosystem. The rise of crypto lending At its core, crypto lending allows borrowers to secure loans by providing cryptocurrency as collateral. This process is governed by smart contracts – self-executing programs on the blockchain that eliminate the need for intermediaries. Whether you’re an individual seeking a loan or an investor looking for returns, crypto lending offers a unique financial avenue. What sets decentralized platforms apart is their openness – anyone with crypto assets can participate, making financial services more accessible than ever. This trend is not just a fleeting moment in the evolution of blockchain. It represents a fundamental shift in how we perceive financial inclusivity and efficiency. So how does it work The mechanics of crypto lending are straightforward yet powerful. Borrowers provide collateral – often in the form of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) – to secure loans in stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. Lenders, on the other hand, earn interest on the assets they provide to the lending pool. Decentralized platforms rely on smart contracts to automate and secure transactions. These contracts ensure transparency, reduce operational costs and minimize risks associated with human error. In contrast, centralized crypto lending platforms operate similarly to traditional financial institutions, requiring a third party to manage transactions, which can introduce trust and custodial risks. Benefits versus challenges Crypto lending isn’t just about novelty – it’s solving real-world problems. Accessibility stands out as one of its most transformative aspects. In regions where traditional banking is limited or inaccessible, crypto lending provides an alternative. With just a digital wallet and internet access, individuals can bypass conventional barriers and secure loans. Transparency is another crucial advantage. Smart contracts bring an unprecedented level of clarity to the process. The terms are coded, immutable and accessible for review, which significantly reduces the likelihood of manipulation. For lenders, the allure often lies in the higher yields offered by crypto platforms compared to traditional savings accounts. These yields stem from the efficient allocation of resources and the global nature of the crypto market. However, crypto lending is not without its pitfalls. Market volatility is perhaps the most pressing issue. The inherently unstable nature of cryptocurrencies can erode the value of collateral, potentially triggering liquidation events for borrowers. Smart contracts, while innovative, are not immune to vulnerabilities. Bugs or exploitation of these contracts could lead to significant financial losses. Moreover, regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of complexity. The lack of consistent policies across jurisdictions leaves both lenders and borrowers exposed to sudden, potentially disruptive policy changes. The path to mainstream adoption For crypto lending to transition from niche to mainstream, several critical steps are needed. Regulatory clarity is at the forefront. A consistent regulatory framework can legitimize the sector, fostering trust and encouraging participation from institutional players. Improved user interfaces and educational initiatives are equally important. The complexity of DeFi platforms can be a barrier for many. Simplified platforms, coupled with robust educational efforts, can help demystify the process for everyday users. Finally, addressing risks through the development of insurance mechanisms and security upgrades will provide users with added confidence. These measures will mitigate potential losses, making the platforms more appealing to a broader audience. Final thoughts Crypto lending stands at the crossroads of innovation and practicality. It offers a glimpse into the future of finance, where access, transparency and efficiency are paramount. However, realizing its full potential requires overcoming significant challenges – regulatory clarity, improved security and user-friendly platforms – are just the beginning. As the financial world continues to evolve, crypto lending could be the key to a more inclusive and dynamic economic landscape. The journey may be complex, but the rewards are worth the effort.

Investors can verify the provenance of their tokens because each one is tagged with extensive source-of-origin data. By employing blockchain technology, an unchangeable record of ownership is made, thus reducing the chances of fraud and increasing transparency. The launch of the platform comes at a time of increased interest in RWA tokenization. This update comes on the back of a larger trend to tokenize real-world assets . In 2023, RWAs class had grown by 700% , bringing $860 million in revenue. According to Boston Consulting Group and ADDX , RWAs are expected to be a $16 trillion market by 2030. The decentralized, tamper-proof nature of blockchain will increase transparency and trust, while fragmentation opens up new ways to access and invest in valuable assets.

It’s a play on the Texas techno king’s love for Dogecoin and an acronym that stands for Department of Government Efficiency . DOGE Aims to Whip Inflation Now We either fix this or go de facto bankrupt https://t.co/hmjpx6uBfd — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2024 The magnetic tech engineer has advised the once and future president Trump broadly on a number of matters relating to technology, business, and public policy. His ideas for more government efficiency could help cut back overspending in Washington, DC, slow the growth in the federal budget deficit, and help curb rising prices across the economy due to inflation. High deficits cause inflation as government spending gooses the velocity of money in the economy and drives up prices. Meanwhile, new dollars created by the Federal Reserve and loaned to banks to buy the government’s debt inflate the dollar and increase prices as well. One recent study by the Princeton University Department of Economics estimates US budget deficits in 2021 caused about 30% of the US dollar inflation in 2021-22. Rising prices as a result of big spending in Washington start in financial markets, then ripple through the economy until they push up prices at the gas pump and grocery checkout. New Headwind for Bitcoin’s Price, Musk Warns If dollar inflation is solved, the price in dollars to buy cryptocurrency will actually drop, other things being equal. What matters is the ratio of dollars to crypto. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 7, 2025 The effect is especially dramatic in crypto markets and shows up conspicuously in Bitcoin’s price and that of other major token pools, such as ETH, XRP, SOL, and DOGE. In fact, many cryptocurrency investors say they favor crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ripple, and Dogecoin as a shelter for their savings from dollar inflation. While not all experts agree that Bitcoin is a hedge for dollar inflation, over any four-year period, money held as BTC has markedly increased in buying power while the inflating greenback loses its purchasing power parity. But Musk warned in an X reply thread on Tuesday that if the D.O.G.E. office’s plans are successful, it will represent a headwind for Bitcoin’s price, not support for growth. That’s because lower deficits and less inflation will slow the increase in prices across the board, including in traditional financial markets like stocks and Internet financial instruments like Bitcoin.

The flagship coin has experienced a significant decline in bullish momentum since mid-November. The upcoming second inauguration of pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President is likely to turn into a sell-the-news event amid heightened hype. Moreover, Bitcoin’s Futures Open Interest (OI), which is used to predict midterm expectations, has remained stagnant in the past two months. Midterm Expectations for Bitcoin Price Via MVRV Pricing Bands With the fear of Bitcoin price continuing in bearish sentiments in the coming days, possibly below $90k, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator has been suggesting a major rebound ahead. Currently, Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio is above the 1-year Moving Average (MA) of 2.18. Historically, Bitcoin price has spent around 5 percent of its trading days above the 3.2 MVRV ratio. Typically, Glassnode noted that the threshold for extreme euphoria is achieved after hitting above the 3.2 MVRV ratio. As such, if Bitcoin price were to reach the 3.2 MVRV ratio, which is associated with extreme euphoria, the corresponding value would be around $132k. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Fidelity Expects More Nation-States, Central Banks To Buy Bitcoin In 2025 , Market Picture Bitcoin price has continued to experience diminishing returns amid the ongoing mainstream adoption led by institutional investors.

The company used convertible note proceeds for share repurchases and covered calls, avoiding the trend of buying more Bitcoin with borrowed money. Despite strong sats/share growth, CleanSpark's stock performance lags Bitcoin's price, making it a better trading vehicle than a long-term investment. Back in October, I upgraded shares of CleanSpark ( CLSK ) from 'hold' to 'buy' after taking a more cautious outlook on the stock for most of 2024. CLSK was a high-flyer in 2023 after bottoming out in December 2022 during the depths of 'crypto winter.' Some of my earlier calls on CLSK in the low-single digits performed quite well in the first half of 2023. With nearly 9 months passed since the block reward halving last April and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) briefly surpassing the six-figure USD denominated price milestone, CleanSpark is one of the few Bitcoin mining stocks that remains a pure play on BTC. Data by YCharts Most of the other companies in the space have adopted high-performance computing as secondary business segments and the market has generally rewarded those names more in the last year as can be seen through the performances of stocks like Core Scientific ( CORZ ), IREN Ltd ( IREN ), and TeraWulf ( WULF ). Compared to other mining pure plays, CleanSpark has performed well having bested the returns observed in names like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and Marathon Holdings ( MARA ) over the last year. December Production During the month of December, CleanSpark mined 668 Bitcoin, second most of all public miners. This final month figure gave the company a total of 7,024 BTC mined during the full year for 2024. In the chart below, we can see that it has taken a constant ramp up exahash per second to generate similar amounts of BTC that were produced this time last year. CleanSpark, Author's Chart This is obviously a result of both the 50% reduction in the block reward subsidy as well as the growth in global hash rate. As mentioned, CleanSpark remains one of the few public mining stocks that is still fully dedicated to Bitcoin. At 18.8 BTC/EHS in December, CleanSpark is generally in-line with most of the public mining companies. The company continues to guide for 50 EH/s in the 2025 fiscal year. Convertible Notes On December 17th , CleanSpark announced the closing of a $650 million convertible note offering. Convertible notes have become quite trendy for Bitcoin-adjacent companies since it has worked so well for MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) over the last several months. The company's convertible notes pay zero percent and are due 2030. CleanSpark As part of the convertible note offering, CleanSpark has also entered into capped call transactions and repurchased 11.76 million shares of common for $145 million. This is a very interesting strategy because it is aimed at limiting the potential dilution of the stock through conversions from the offering. Per the press release: If the Company elects to settle the conversions of principal of the Convertible Notes in cash and to settle the remainder of any conversions in shares, and the conversions do not follow a notice of redemption or certain corporate events, the Company will not have to issue any additional shares (on a net basis, after accounting for the benefits of the capped call and the share repurchase), until the price of its Common Stock exceeds $33.67. Additionally, I find CleanSpark's convertible offering to be interesting because the company is bucking the sector trend and hasn't used the proceeds to simply buy more Bitcoin at the market rate. Rather, the $633.6 million in net proceeds from the offering, $90.4 million has been used to put on the covered calls and $145 million was used to repurchase CLSK shares. CleanSpark has $398.2 million remaining that it says it will use pay down its credit line with Coinbase ( COIN ), for capex, acquisitions, and corporate purposes. I actually like this approach more than just buying BTC with cash. CoinShares Per data compiled by CoinShares, CleanSpark has one of the lowest all-in costs to mine Bitcoin compared with the rest of the public market. In this bullish Bitcoin environment, it's easy to get excited about companies that raise capital through convertibles to buy more Bitcoin. It's it a bit more contrarian to raise capital through convertibles and not buy BTC. If CleanSpark's past corporate treasury management is any indication, the company might be best equipped to go against the grain and grow BTC through mining rather than debt-based purchases. BTC-Backing BTC Holdings (CleanSpark, Author's Chart) CleanSpark has exhibited a strong ability to grow the company's Bitcoin stack from 228 BTC at the end of 2022 to 9,952 BTC at the end of 2024. As I've mentioned about the publicly traded BTC miners multiple times, these companies have generally been able to grow capacity and capital through shareholder dilution. That has not necessarily boded well for shareholders long term but when looking at shares through a metric like sats per share, we can better assess if that dilution has been accretive to the company's BTC holdings: CleanSpark, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations CleanSpark has been able to grow sats/share over the last three years and has done so at a market-beating rate compared to the broader public mining stocks. Consider the year over year change in sats per share between CleanSpark and many of the other top miners in the industry: Sats/Share September 2023 September 2024 YoY CleanSpark 1,398 2,971 112.5% Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 217 435 100.1% MARA Holdings 6,530 8,804 34.8% HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) 2,016 2,194 8.8% Bitfarms ( BITF ) 253 253 0.0% Hut 8 ( HUT ) 10,524 9,739 -7.5% Riot Platforms 3,733 3,215 -13.9% Source: Company Filings, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations At 112.5%, CLSK shares have seen the largest growth in 'sat-backing' compared with other stocks. However, it should be noted that these numbers are only reflective of quarter-ended September 2024. We have broadly seen a large move toward convertible note issuance over the last several months from publicly traded Bitcoin-related companies. Also, it's important to point out that even before the rush to issue convertibles, CleanSpark's long term sats/share growth lags the price of BTC: End of Sept BTC Sats/Share BTC Price CLSK Price 2022 594 1,066 $19,425 $3.18 2024 8,049 2,971 $63,338 $9.34 % Change 1,255.1% 178.7% 226.1% 193.7% Source: Company Filings, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations In the table above, sats/share shows us that even though CleanSpark's HODL stack has had explosive growth, when adjusted for common shares outstanding the stock's BTC-backing lags the price of BTC - as does the price of the stock. Closing Summary The emergence of generative AI and HPC services as a potential secondary revenue stream has presented a ' fork in the road ' for Bitcoin mining companies; continue down the path of Bitcoin mining or pivot to the far more profitable HPC data center business? Based on the early reporting we're seeing from the companies that are actually generating revenue from HPC, there doesn't seem to be much of a question that HPC has better gross margins than mining today. However, that may not necessarily be the case long term. We've sort of seen this story before. Bitcoin Hashprice, 5yr history (HashRateIndex) Once upon a time, there was a rush to Bitcoin mining because the profit margin was so tremendous. Through HPC data centers, the allure of robust gross margins has led to yet another 'gold rush' though this one is attached to artificial intelligence and electrical infrastructure. Those fat margins could certainly prove to be temporary. In the event of a possible HPC data center bust, the companies that stick with Bitcoin mining could theoretically outperform those that chase HPC services. The ultimate question is does it make sense to buy miners over simply buying Bitcoin directly? History would suggest that even the mining companies that grow sats/share over time lag the price appreciation of BTC. Thus, I'm still of the view that CleanSpark is a terrific vehicle for trading but not necessarily a great a long term investment compared to Bitcoin. That said, I like CLSK more than most public miners fundamentally and have a position in the stock.",BTC-USD|CLSK,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-09 04:59:00

The price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh increase above the $700 resistance. BNB price is struggling to settle above the $700 pivot zone. The price is now trading below $700 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $695 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $680 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Holds Support After a downside correction, BNB price found support at $675. It is now recovering losses like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a move above the $685 level. The price was able to recover above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $745 swing high to the $674 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $695 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $700 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $700 level. The next resistance sits near the $710 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $745 swing high to the $674 low. A clear move above the $710 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $725. A close above the $725 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $740 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $750 level in the near term. Another Dip? If BNB fails to clear the $710 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $685 level. The next major support is near the $675 level. The main support sits at $650. If there is a downside break below the $650 support, the price could drop toward the $642 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $625 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone.

While he acknowledged that crypto is still a small part of the overall financial markets, he said that it’s full of bad actors and scams. Under his leadership, the SEC has filed about 100 enforcement actions in the past four years, compared to his predecessor Jay Clayton’s 80. Gensler believes that the crypto market is still struggling with fraud, with many projects acting like risky investments that may not survive. In an interview with Bloomberg , Gensler said, “In this field, it’s rife with bad actors.” He then broke down the crypto market into two parts, saying, “The public knows a lot about Bitcoin, which, depending on its market value, is two-thirds to 80% of the market value of crypto.” Gensler pointed out that there are “10,000 to 15,000 projects raising money from the public.” Many of these projects, he believes, are simply speculative investments, “hoping for a better future.” He explained, “I’ve been around finance for over four decades, and everything in the markets trades on a mixture of fundamentals and sentiment.” However, he added, “At any given time, I’ve never seen a field that’s so much wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals.” Gensler Says Crypto Projects ‘Won’t Survive’ He also warned, “Many of these 10,000 to 15,000 projects will not survive. They’re like venture capital investments. They’re not going to survive.” Gensler pointed to the existence of “small pump and dump schemes” that have caused problems in the industry. Reflecting on past events, he said, “We’ve lived through a few years where they became notorious, but they’re in jail now.” Despite the growing number of enforcement actions, Gensler thinks that the crypto market is still not complying with the rules. He sees his role as ensuring that the market works without fraud, manipulation, and misinformation. Gensler is set to resign on January 20 and Paul Atkins will serve as the SEC Chair next.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 05:11:36

With analysts predicting a bullish cycle for meme coins, now’s the time to jump in. Meme coins have evolved beyond mere internet jokes; they are now serious players in the world of alternative investments, offering high returns and community-driven momentum. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD), currently in Stage 13 of its presale for $0.000142. Known as the “Bulls Squad,” its passionate community is creating major buzz. With over $5 million raised and more than 63 billion BTFD coins sold, this project is set to redefine meme coin success. But that’s not all. We’ll also explore Bonk (BONK) and Pepe Coin (PEPE), established favourites that continue to dominate the meme coin frenzy. Let’s dive into why these are the top new meme coins to invest in this month. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Dip-Lover’s Dream BTFD Coin embodies the “ Buy the Dip ” ethos, offering a unique blend of presale profits, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, staking rewards, and community-driven power. It’s not just a coin; it’s a movement. At the heart of BTFD lies the dynamic Bulls Squad, a community of over 7,900 investors united by their passion for finding value where others see risk. The Bulls Squad embodies resilience, creativity, and teamwork, serving as the driving force behind BTFD’s success. With Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull leading the charge, this squad isn’t just a group—it’s a movement redefining what it means to invest in meme coins. The BTFD P2E game, launched on January 1, 2025, allows users to earn rewards while enjoying a fun and engaging experience. Unlike the beta version, which was just a teaser, the full version brings lucrative earning opportunities. Players can rack up in-game tokens and convert them to BTFD coins, enhancing their portfolios. Staking went live on December 2, offering a competitive 90% APY for investors. This makes holding BTFD a rewarding experience, turning passive holding into an active income stream. With a maximum coin supply of 173 billion and liquidity locked for three years, BTFD promises long-term stability. The presale is a goldmine for early investors. Starting at just $0.000004, the price has climbed to $0.000142 in Stage 13. At the end of the presale, the listing price will be $0.0006. Let’s break it down: if you invest $2,500 today, you’ll own 17,605,632 BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment will grow to $10,563—a remarkable 322% ROI.

It’s a no-brainer for anyone looking to capitalise on the meme coin craze. 2. Bonk (BONK): The Community-Driven Powerhouse Bonk is a community-first meme coin that has captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Known for its decentralised ethos, BONK thrives on its ability to rally people together, creating a vibrant and active community. One of Bonk’s standout features is its utility within the Solana ecosystem. It’s often used to reward community initiatives, adding a layer of utility that many meme coins lack. From NFT minting to liquidity provision, Bonk’s integration across Solana has cemented its position as a go-to alternative investment. Why Does Bonk Deserve a Spot on This List? Bonk’s unique blend of community power and utility within the Solana ecosystem makes it more than just a meme coin. It’s a symbol of what decentralised communities can achieve. 3. Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Legendary Meme Icon Pepe Coin pays homage to the internet’s beloved frog meme, but it’s much more than a nostalgic nod. With its deflationary model and strong community backing, PEPE has proven itself as a serious player in the meme coin market. What sets PEPE apart is its strategic tokenomics. The coin’s supply decreases over time through regular burns, ensuring scarcity and driving demand. Additionally, its liquidity pools and staking mechanisms make it an attractive choice among the top new meme coins to invest in this month. Why is Pepe Coin a Must-Have? Pepe Coin’s ability to blend humour with strategic financial incentives makes it a standout in the crowded meme coin space. It’s a perfect mix of fun and function. Final Thoughts: The Right Time is Now The meme coin market is hotter than ever, offering unparalleled opportunities for those willing to take the plunge. BTFD Coin reigns supreme with its innovative P2E game, high staking rewards, and thriving presale—truly a top new meme coin to invest in this month. Meanwhile, Bonk and Pepe Coin continue to shine as established favourites, each bringing unique value to the table. Time is of the essence. Don’t let this wave pass you by.

Meanwhile, Do Kwon faces a 2026 trial for fraud related to the Terra ecosystem collapse, with prosecutors seeking key evidence from his emails, devices, and trading records. Coinbase recently secured a partial legal victory with a court-approved appeal in its SEC case. FTX is still budding heads in the crypto space after it refuted claims by Backpack about acquiring its European arm. Avraham Eisenberg Sentencing Delayed Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, who was convicted of fraud and market manipulation related to an exploit of the Mango Markets decentralized exchange, is set to be sentenced on April 10. This decision follows a Jan. 7 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), where Judge Arun Subramanian granted a request from Eisenberg’s legal team to postpone the sentencing. Initially scheduled for Dec. 12 and later moved to Feb. 11, the delay was asked for due to the complexity of sentencing issues and the factual record of the case. The US prosecutor’s office did not object to the change. Eisenberg’s request to delay sentencing (Source: Courtlistener ) Eisenberg was arrested in December of 2022 after exploiting Mango Markets in October 2022 by draining over $100 million from the platform. While he returned approximately $67 million, he still kept more than $40 million after a governance vote by the community. Eisenberg has been in custody for nearly two years and could face up to 20 years in prison if sentenced to the maximum penalty, served consecutively. In addition to the criminal case, Eisenberg may also face civil enforcement actions from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These cases were stayed in March of 2023 and are expected to resume after the conclusion of his criminal proceedings. The SDNY prosecutors handling Eisenberg’s case have also pursued charges against other high-profile people in the crypto industry, including former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky. Kwon was recently extradited to the United States from Montenegro, and is scheduled to face trial in January 2026. Prosecutors Target Do Kwon’s Email and Social Media Prosecutors in the United States outlined their discovery plans in the criminal case against Do Kwon, including search warrants for his email and Twitter accounts. A Jan. 7 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York revealed that prosecutors anticipate uncovering “multiple terabytes of data” relevant to their case. The discovery includes search warrants for Kwon’s personal and business email accounts, his Twitter account, and four of his electronic devices, as well as trading records and materials from crypto exchanges. Kwon faces nine felony charges in the US for alleged fraud tied to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022, and was extradited from Montenegro on Dec. 31 after a year-long process involving competing requests from the US and South Korea. Prosecutors also revealed that recordings of Kwon, made without his knowledge and not directed by the government, may be included in the evidence for discovery. Some of these recordings were used in a prior SEC civil case against Kwon and Terraform Labs, which found both parties liable for fraud. Charges against Kwon (Source: Courtlistener ) In March of 2023, US prosecutors initially charged Kwon with eight counts, but later added a ninth count of money laundering conspiracy in a sealed superseding indictment in 2024. The money laundering charge is very similar to the case against Sam Bankman-Fried, who faced issues with charges added after his extradition from the Bahamas. Anticipating similar challenges, US prosecutors in Kwon’s case plan to ask for a waiver from Montenegro’s rule of specialty, which could potentially complicate the inclusion of the ninth charge. Kwon’s trial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 26, 2026, and he faces a potential lengthy prison sentence if convicted. Coinbase Wins Appeal in SEC Case Meanwhile, Coinbase achieved a small victory in its legal battle with the SEC after a federal judge granted an order for an interlocutory appeal. Judge Katherine Failla of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York approved Coinbase’s request to appeal an earlier decision denying its motion for judgment. All proceedings in the case have been stayed until the Second Circuit rules on the appeal. At the heart of the SEC’s case against Coinbase is the claim that certain transactions involving crypto assets qualify as investment contracts and therefore fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction as securities. Judge Failla acknowledged the possibility of reversal in her interpretation of investment contracts under the Howey test, due to conflicting rulings in other SEC cases against Ripple Labs and Terraform Labs. These cases led to varying interpretations of what constitutes a security, including a decision in the Ripple case stating that XRP token sales on exchanges were not securities . The SEC filed its enforcement action against Coinbase in June of 2023, and alleged that the exchange operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency since 2019. However, the SEC’s approach when it comes to regulating the crypto industry has drawn a lot of criticism from many in the sector, including claims that it has overstepped its authority under Chair Gary Gensler. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal , shared that he appreciates the court’s decision to grant the appeal. The company has also made it a priority to expose alleged government campaigns against crypto firms, like Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which targeted the debanking of crypto businesses. Coinbase has also been active in politics by contributing alongside Ripple to the political action committee Fairshake. This PAC spent over $90 million in the 2024 elections supporting pro-crypto candidates. FTX Denies Approval of Backpack’s FTX EU Acquisition Despite the sentencing of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried last year, the company still finds itself in trouble with the crypto industry. FTX recently refuted claims made by crypto exchange Backpack regarding its acquisition of FTX’s European arm, FTX EU. In a Jan. 8 statement, FTX clarified that the acquisition was not yet approved by the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and that Backpack’s announcements were made without the knowledge or involvement of FTX. The bankrupt exchange also clarified that Backpack was not authorized to distribute repayments to FTX creditors. Backpack was founded by Solana developer Armani Ferrante, and it announced on Jan. 7 that it acquired FTX EU as part of a court-approved bankruptcy process and pledged to begin creditor repayments by February. However, FTX disputed these claims by stating that any indirect transfer of FTX EU to Backpack had not been disclosed to the bankruptcy court or approved. The company also pointed out that it remains solely responsible for returning funds to its former customers. The FTX debtors previously reached an agreement to sell FTX EU to “certain former insiders” of FTX Europe as part of a court-supervised settlement. FTX said it was informed of an indirect sale to Backpack only recently and that no official authorization was granted for Backpack to handle creditor repayments. Backpack plans to leverage FTX EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (MiFID) II License to expand its European operations, but the company faced some challenges since its inception in 2022. The firm lost $14.5 million, or 88% of its operating funds, during FTX’s collapse but has continued limited operations with minimal funding. The exchange was initially funded by FTX and Jump Crypto. FTX’s reorganization plan took effect on Jan. 3, which allowed creditor repayments to start. Eligible customers, particularly those with claims under $50,000, will be part of an initial group to receive reimbursements within 60 days. Claims must be filed through the official website to qualify for repayment.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-09 05:25:11

In a post on X, Farina noted the rapid shift in market sentiment, stating that “a $10 XRP seems like a conservative price prediction” compared to just months ago when even a $2 forecast faced widespread skepticism. His remarks highlight the growing optimism about XRP’s potential in 2025, fueled by recent market performance and promising developments on the regulatory and political fronts. Suddenly, a $10 XRP seems like a conservative price prediction. Just a few months ago, calling for $2 would have been enough for people to try and tear down your reputation. How quickly the narrative shifts. 99% aren’t ready. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) January 6, 2025 XRP’s Recent Market Momentum XRP has experienced remarkable growth since late 2024, reaching levels not seen since 2018. The asset’s momentum has carried over into the new year. Despite a recent drop over the past 24 hours, the asset is still up over 10% in 2025, with its highest price this year over 22% higher than the end of 2024. At its current price of $2.29, it is still well above $2. As Farina noted, many analysts have shared predictions of $10 and more for the digital asset. They have attributed XRP’s rise to its breakthrough of key resistance levels which signals increased investor confidence, and major shifts in the U.S. political and regulatory landscape. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Developments Driving Optimism January 20, 2025, marks an important date for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. On this day, Donald Trump, the pro-crypto president-elect, will take office. Trump’s administration is expected to bring regulatory clarity to the industry, especially with the anticipated resignation of Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair. Trump’s nominee for SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, is considered a crypto-friendly figure, raising hopes for a more favorable approach to digital assets. The crypto community expects that the incoming administration may expedite the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC and potentially dismiss other ongoing lawsuits against similar blockchain firms. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed optimism about the year ahead, aligning with Farina’s positive outlook. According to Garlinghouse, 2025 could be transformative for XRP, as the company shifts focus to real-world utility and increasing momentum. As January 20 approaches, all eyes are on the incoming U.S. administration and its potential to redefine the crypto landscape. For XRP holders, the anticipation of a breakthrough year is stronger than ever.

While Thailand is piloting cryptocurrency payments in Phuket to modernize its tourism economy, institutional investors are once again accumulating Bitcoin after a significant price correction, reflecting renewed confidence in its long-term potential. Large Bitcoin Holders Resume Accumulation Amidst Post-Correction Recovery Bitcoin’s price trajectory has once again captured the spotlight as large-scale investors have resumed their accumulation of the cryptocurrency following a notable price correction late in 2024. After Bitcoin achieved an unprecedented six-figure milestone, its value experienced a sharp decline, spurring strategic buying activity among institutional investors. This trend signals a renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s potential for recovery and long-term growth. Cauê Oliveira, head of research at Blocktrends, revealed in a Jan. 8 post on CryptoQuant that institutional investors have purchased over 34,000 BTC, worth approximately $3.2 billion. This influx of buying pressure comes as Bitcoin begins to recover from its December plunge. Oliveira highlighted that the accumulation follows a significant sell-off by wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, which collectively dumped 79,000 BTC in the week after Dec. 21. This sell-off occurred shortly after Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $108,000 on Dec. 17, propelled by the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. However, the rapid price correction—approximately 15%—presented a buying opportunity for strategic investors. “Large players took advantage of the consolidation,” Oliveira explained, noting that institutional buyers executed trades in smaller increments to accumulate Bitcoin at prices below $95,000. The shift in Bitcoin’s seven-day balance change, which flipped positive after the late-December sell-off, suggests renewed buying momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $94,265, reflecting a modest 2.57% decline over the past day. This price movement aligns with broader market trends, as disappointing US jobs and economic data have dampened expectations of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts later in January. Despite these headwinds, analysts at Bitfinex are optimistic that the worst of the downward pressure on Bitcoin's price is behind us. In a Jan. 6 market note, Bitfinex analysts observed that sell-side liquidity in Bitcoin markets is “shrinking at a rapid pace,” suggesting that the cryptocurrency is entering a phase of stabilization and potential growth. Optimistic Projections for 2025 Looking ahead, several experts predict that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a historic rally in 2025. The anticipated inauguration of pro-crypto policies under incoming US President Donald Trump and growing nation-state adoption of Bitcoin are expected to provide strong tailwinds for the cryptocurrency market. Fidelity Digital Assets research analyst Matt Hogan echoed this sentiment in a Jan. 7 report, stating that “more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in Bitcoin.” This aligns with the views of Blockware analysts, who suggested last month that the establishment of a US Bitcoin reserve could significantly boost its price. In their projections, a worst-case scenario would see Bitcoin surpass $150,000, while a best-case scenario envisions a rise to over $400,000. The renewed interest in Bitcoin among institutional investors is underpinned by several key factors: Macroeconomic Shifts: With traditional monetary policies facing uncertainty, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive hedge against inflation and economic instability. Regulatory Clarity: The expectation of more transparent and supportive regulatory frameworks under a new US administration could further enhance Bitcoin’s appeal. Strategic Asset Allocation: As Hogan highlighted, institutional entities are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term strategic asset, complementing their broader portfolios. The recent resurgence of institutional Bitcoin accumulation marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency as it recovers from its late-2024 correction. With significant buying pressure from large holders and optimistic forecasts for the year ahead, Bitcoin’s role as a global financial asset continues to solidify. As nation-states and institutional players deepen their involvement, the stage is set for a potentially transformative year in Bitcoin’s history. Thailand to Pilot Cryptocurrency Payments in Phuket to Boost Tourism and Innovation In other Bitcoins news, Thailand is set to trial cryptocurrency payments in Phuket, one of its most popular tourist destinations, as part of a groundbreaking initiative aimed at offering foreign visitors an alternative payment method. The move, announced on Jan. 8 by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira, signifies a step forward in integrating digital currency into Thailand’s tourism-driven economy. Speaking at a seminar organized by the Marketing Association of Thailand, Chunhavajira emphasized that the pilot program will operate entirely within Thailand’s existing legal framework, requiring no amendments to current laws. This assurance seeks to allay concerns about regulatory overreach while highlighting the government’s commitment to fostering innovation within the bounds of legality. The deputy prime minister said that the program aims to make digital transactions more accessible in “tourism-focused cities” and to remain competitive to avoid missing out on business opportunities. The program will require foreign tourists to register Bitcoin (BTC) through a Thai exchange and verify their identities before using the cryptocurrency for purchases. A clearinghouse will then convert BTC transactions into Thai baht, ensuring smooth operations for both vendors and buyers. The trial is expected to enhance the tourism experience by providing a convenient and modern payment method, especially for tech-savvy travelers. The program is part of Thailand’s broader strategy to leverage digital innovation to boost its critical tourism sector, which has been recovering steadily following the pandemic. To demonstrate the program's effectiveness, Pichai referenced the situation of refugees from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, who could utilize BTC to buy real estate in Thailand rather than encountering difficulties in acquiring Thai baht. Thailand’s experimentation with cryptocurrencies in Phuket aligns with previous calls by prominent figures to advance the country’s digital asset landscape. In December 2024, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra urged the Thai government to adopt a proactive approach toward studying cryptocurrencies. Speaking at a lecture, Shinawatra advocated for sandbox experimentation to explore the potential of digital assets without immediately committing to large-scale adoption. He also raised concerns about the possible impact of incoming US President Donald Trump’s administration, particularly regarding trade tariffs and Trump’s controversial suggestion to use Bitcoin for settling US debt. Regulatory Evolution in Thailand’s Crypto Sector The pilot program comes at a time of significant regulatory developments in Thailand’s cryptocurrency market. Binance Thailand CEO Nirun Fuwattananukul highlighted these changes in an October 2024 opinion piece, where he discussed the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) move to expand fund investment opportunities in digital assets. According to Fuwattananukul, the proposed regulations are designed to create a “mature ecosystem where traditional finance and digital assets coexist.” The initiative, he noted, signals Thailand’s intent to move beyond merely legitimizing Bitcoin and toward fostering a dynamic and robust financial environment. The pilot program in Phuket is a strong indicator of Thailand’s ambition to position itself as a leader in digital finance and tourism innovation. By embracing cryptocurrencies, the country is taking a bold step toward attracting global tourists and investors who are increasingly comfortable with digital payments. If successful, the trial could pave the way for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies across Thailand’s other major tourist hubs, further solidifying the nation’s reputation as a forward-thinking destination. Moreover, it sets a precedent for other countries looking to integrate digital currencies into their economies without overhauling existing legal structures. Thailand’s move to pilot cryptocurrency payments in Phuket signals a progressive shift in its approach to digital finance and tourism. By leveraging Bitcoin’s global appeal, the initiative could enhance the country’s competitiveness, boost its tourism industry, and lay the groundwork for broader crypto adoption. As the pilot unfolds, it will be closely watched by both domestic stakeholders and the global cryptocurrency community, eager to see whether Thailand’s innovative gamble pays off.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-09 05:30:00

The crypto fall came after, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) was approved to sell 69,370 Bitcoin seized from the infamous Silk Road darknet marketplace. According to DB , the commercial value of crypto assets is approximately $6.5 billion, the Bitcoin stash has been at the center of a protracted legal battle. The court ruling on December 30 dismissed claims from Battle Born Investments, which had sought ownership through a bankruptcy estate and attempted to delay the sale. Why Sell Now? After a long legal tug-of-war, a federal judge finally gave the green light for the DOJ to cash in on the crypto. The DOJ justified the liquidation, citing concerns over Bitcoin’s price volatility and the potential risk of value loss if the assets were held for too long. A spokesperson confirmed the department’s intent to proceed with the sale in alignment with the court’s judgment. The U.S. Marshals Service is expected to manage the liquidation process, which could become one of history’s largest crypto asset sales. This decision comes after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal challenging the seizure last October. Battle Born also pursued a Freedom of Information Act request to uncover the identity of “Individual X,” who initially surrendered the Bitcoin, but that effort also failed. The news of selling the assets before Trump’s inauguration on January 20 is raising the eyebrows of crypto investors making the market a bit shaky. Crypto assets are already facing a downtrend due to the FOMC meeting. Crypto Reaction The market’s reaction to the news was immediate, with Bitcoin’s price dropping nearly 3%, from $95,000 to $93,800, before stabilizing around $94,300. Analysts suggest that such a significant liquidation could add downward pressure on the market, raising concerns about broader impacts on Bitcoin’s price stability. A crypto user known as DefiBanked hints at political motives behind the DOJ’s plan to sell 69,000 Bitcoin, suggesting the profits might be directed toward Ukraine. A move driven by Biden’s administration to suppress Bitcoin. The DOJ’s move underscores its focus on resolving high-profile crypto cases and recovering assets tied to illicit activities. While the government has yet to release an official statement, for the crypto world, it’s a reminder that even digital assets aren’t beyond the law’s reach. While the case outcome will set a precedent for future crypto cases, this government sell-off can also create a massive liquidity issue and many fear that it is a planned strategy by Biden to Stop Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plan. There is a buzz in the market that it is a planned move to drop Bitcoin prices as many analysts also think this is a trick to manipulate Bitcoin prices.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 05:45:08

This has led investors to question whether another BTC price crash under $90,000 is coming soon as the asset took a dip under $93,000 earlier today. US Govt Liquidates Silk Road Bitcoin on US DoJ Authorization As reported earlier by DB News , the US DOJ approved the government to sell 69,370 Bitcoins seized from the Silk Road darknet. DOJ cited Bitcoin price volatility as the reason for allowing the US govt to liquidate the assets. Hours after the reports, the balance in the US government wallet dropped to zero, from $6.7 billion on January 8, as per the data by Arkham Intelligence, Source: Arkham Intelligence Interestingly, the selloff comes just 10 days before Donald Trump took office at the White House on January 20. While the Trump team has been thinking about building strategic Bitcoin reserve , the Biden govt has made a hasty decision to liquidate Bitcoin. Source: DB News Interestingly, this decision from the federal judge comes soon after the new administration took charge of the office two weeks ago. The ruling, made on December 30, comes after the resolution of a prolonged ownership dispute with Battle Born Investments. The investment firm failed to get the ownership of BTC through a bankruptcy estate. Battle Born’s legal team has strongly criticized the decision, with their attorney characterizing it as “another egregious example of the DOJ’s abuse of the Civil Asset Forfeiture process.” They argue that the government employed “procedural trickery to make sure the facts are never heard.” BTC Price Correction Under $90,000 Soon? Following the rejection at the $100K level, the Bitcoin price is seeing strong selling pressure wiping off all the weekly gains. As of press time, the BTC price is trading 2.47% down at $93,915.9 with a market cap of $1.86 trillion. Furthermore, the BTC price is showing no strength in the derivatives market as the Bitcoin funding rates have dropped considerably. CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC noted: “In the recent Bitcoin rally, Funding Rates showed a sharp increase midway through the upward trend, suggesting a delayed influx of demand. However, after Bitcoin faced rejection at the $108K resistance, Funding Rates declined significantly”. On the other hand, short-term traders are moving to exchanges at a loss in what seems to be a panic selling ahead.

AI highlights SUI, TRON, and Rollblock as top Solana alternatives, with Rollblock’s GambleFi solutions leading the charge for Q1 2025 gains. Table of Contents Rollblock: A revolutionary platform with explosive potential SUI: Scaling blockchain to new heights TRON: The veteran blockchain that never slows down Conclusion Staying ahead of the curve is the key to successful crypto trading. Solana did numbers before falling 20% MoM post-US job data. The market fluctuations and FOMO had savvy analysts explore more potential profitable alternatives, and AI has done the heavy lifting. AI identified three top Solana alternatives to elevate user portfolio this quarter: SUI, TRON, and a new GambleFi underdog. Let’s explore what makes this trio the excellent gems for Q1 2025. Rollblock: A revolutionary platform with explosive potential Rollblock was the top pick for AI’s suggestions for Solana alternatives. This GambleFi ingenuity has proven to be so much more than the revolutionized iGaming solution. Importantly, it is built using provably fair gaming technology on the blockchain, ensuring everyone can verify that each bet is being overseen fairly and securely. Its income-generating feature adds to the allure. Users can earn passively by holding Rollblock, a rarity that made it even more attractive to AI. Also, holders can stake their tokens for an 18% APY yield. Rollblock’s presale proves just how much potential it holds. Selling at just $0.0445 and raising over $8.3 million to date. Its performance is remarkable, and that confirms its superior technical and market relevance.

The platform is positioned as a top choice for dApp developers who want reliability. SUI dedicated itself to usability and served different industries, such as gaming, finance, and social networking. This technical excellence has fueled SUI’s ecosystem growth. According to DeFiLlama, SUI’s TVL rode on the crest of this wave to a $2b ATH. The recent OKX Ventures investment in SUI’s Haedal Protocol has also fueled institutional interest. SUI is a technically rich product with a clear focus on being scalable, and it’s unsurprising it made AI’s picks. TRON: The veteran blockchain that never slows down Another alluring Solana alternative that made AI’s suggestions is TRON . TRON started as a decentralized content-sharing platform, expanded to DeFi and NFTs, and has solutions for the enterprise market. Because of its high throughput and low transaction costs, it is an attractive choice for users. TRON’s ecosystem continues to evolve, along with its strategic developments and partnerships. Recently, Bitget sealed a long-term partnership with TRON that included the acquisition of $10m TRX. This came weeks after Justin Sun hinted at an RLUSD launch on the network. Therefore, TRON is undoubtedly positioned to be one of the most important blockchain players to watch as the crypto market FOMO reaches a new peak. Conclusion Binance’s Fear and Greed Index reaching a weekly average of 70 signals growing FOMO, a time to get positioned for the next life-changing opportunity. However, SUI, TRON, and Rollblock present a golden opportunity for this. Although SUI and TRON have been impressive, Rollblock’s momentum has been extraordinary. Rollblock’s iGaming solutions and passive income allure present a compelling narrative for this quarter’s explosive run. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials.

Treasury yields have risen to 4.73%, their highest level since April 2024. Bitcoin’s price has dropped to $94,921, with altcoins also experiencing declines. Financial markets are getting tighter, with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and U.S. Treasury yields hitting new highs. The DXY is at 108.59, up 5.87% over the past year, while the 10-year Treasury yield is up to 4.73%, its highest point since April 2024. This is putting pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Why a Strong Dollar Hurts Crypto Higher Treasury yields make traditional financial instruments more attractive to investors. When bonds pay more, investors move their money away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Also, a strong U.S. dollar makes alternative investments like Bitcoin and altcoins less appealing because it’s a safer place to store value. Bitcoin’s price is down in the $94K range , a 3% drop.

This decline has sparked caution among investors, yet Dogecoin remains resilient, holding at a critical demand level. This zone could prove pivotal for the meme coin’s trajectory, as maintaining this support may lay the foundation for a fresh rally to new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Will Drop Before The Next Leg Up – Analyst Sets Target Top analyst CROW recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin’s potential to break above its multi-year trendline. According to CROW, such a breakout would be a game-changer, positioning Dogecoin for an aggressive rally. He suggests that $1 is only the first target in a series of upward movements that could redefine the market’s view of DOGE. The coming days will be crucial as Dogecoin battles between sustaining its current demand zone and the possibility of deeper corrections. With market sentiment split and broader crypto uncertainty, all eyes are on Dogecoin to see if it can capitalize on its strong demand and push through to reclaim its bullish narrative. Investors remain optimistic, awaiting confirmation of DOGE’s next big move in the ever-volatile cryptocurrency market. Dogecoin Prepares For A Breakout Dogecoin is holding strong at $0.34, a critical level that previously acted as supply but has now flipped into a robust demand zone. This price action highlights a significant shift in DOGE’s market dynamics, sparking optimism among investors. As the meme coin leader continues to set higher highs, the next target lies within higher supply zones, which could pave the way for further bullish momentum. Top analyst CROW recently shared a compelling technical analysis, emphasizing the monumental potential of Dogecoin. According to CROW, $1 is merely the first major milestone for DOGE as it emerges from the multi-year downtrend that began in 2021. Breaking free from this long-term bearish structure would not only solidify Dogecoin’s position as a market leader but also open the doors to price discovery, a phrase often associated with explosive gains. CROW’s analysis points out that Dogecoin’s chart is showing strong signs of accumulation, a critical phase in the market cycle that typically precedes massive rallies. If DOGE manages to reclaim the $1 level, it could trigger an influx of buying pressure, driving the price into uncharted territory. This potential shift underscores Dogecoin’s ability to capture market attention and maintain its place as a top-performing cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Solana Back Above Weekly & Monthly Support Levels – Analyst Expects New ATH With market sentiment cautiously optimistic and key technical indicators aligning, Dogecoin seems ready to embark on a new chapter of its journey. Investors are closely watching its movement around the $0.34 level, waiting for the breakout that could signal the start of an extraordinary rally. Price Action Showing Strength Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.34 after a clean breakdown from the $0.39 mark, a significant level of supply. Despite the recent decline, price action suggests strength as DOGE manages to hold its current level as a key demand zone. This resilience indicates that Dogecoin is positioned for a potential rebound if the broader market sentiment shifts positively. A market-wide recovery could set the stage for DOGE to challenge last year’s highs. The critical level to watch is $0.43—reclaiming and holding this mark would signal a massive bullish breakout. Such a move would likely draw significant buying pressure, propelling DOGE into a new phase of upward momentum and possibly price discovery. However, the downside risk remains. If Dogecoin fails to hold above the $0.33 level, selling pressure could intensify, leading to a deeper correction. Investors are keeping a close eye on these key levels as the market navigates through a period of uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Breakout Or Breakdown?

Van Straten noted that government bond yields around the world have been rising in recent months, creating a challenging macroeconomic environment for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. The US 10-year Treasury yield, often considered a global benchmark, climbed to 4.70% as of today. That’s a significant increase of over 100 basis points since the Fed initiated its first rate cut in September. This trend is even more pronounced in the United Kingdom, where the 30-year Gilt yield hit 5.35% this week, its highest level since 1998. That represents a 105 basis point jump since the Fed’s policy change. Similar upward movements in bond yields have been seen in Germany, Italy and Japan. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield in particular rose to 1.18%, its highest level in nearly 15 years, despite historically low rates in the country. Related News: Experienced Analyst Assesses Bitcoin Price After the Decline: “It Should Never Fall Below This Level...” While these rising yields didn’t initially dampen the cryptocurrency rally, Bitcoin and other major digital assets reached record or multi-year highs in December before the market calmed down. Bitcoin, for example, is down more than 10% from its all-time high of $108,000 just three weeks ago, and several other major cryptocurrencies have seen steeper declines. One notable exception to this trend is China, where bond yields have fallen sharply amid growing deflationary concerns. According to The Kobeissi Letter, China is currently experiencing its longest period of deflation since 1999, a stark contrast to the inflation-driven yield increases seen elsewhere. *This is not investment advice.

For investors with an eye on sustainable long-term success, the viral cryptocurrency presale, 1FUEL is turning heads and winning over whales. Read on to find out why this secure crypto wallet is commanding investor attention and leading analysts to project early returns in excess of 500%, with 100x returns on public launch. 1FUEL’s incredible growth potential could outperform both Solana and Ethereum 1FUEL’s one-click, cross-train transactions – along with a laundry list of other privacy, security and user-friendly features – has cemented its potential for exponential growth. Those same features could well see it turning some very notable heads as Solana and Ethereum navigate expected corrections, likely to come down the pipeline in March. It’s no coincidence that 1FUEL’s viral cryptocurrency presale has already attracted whales from Solana and Ethereum. It has raced to more than $1,157,219 raised, with stage two 98% complete. When is the Solana and Ethereum correction likely to occur? According to experts such as Arthur Hayes (co-founder of BitMEX), coins like Solana and Ethereum are expected to hit the end of the bull run around March, amid a wider slowdown. Thereafter, a major correction is expected, which means Solana, Ethereum and others, including Bitcoin, could give up much of the ground they’ve gained since December. The correction could be triggered by several factors including wider market sentiment. While President Trump has signalled that he intends to be much more accommodating of crypto during his second term at the White House, it’s unlikely that he will make sweeping changes right away. The slower his more favourable legislation is, the more likely Solana and Ethereum will face a correction. One of the first orders of business for Trump will be renegotiating the debt ceiling to keep the government operational. Before the debt ceiling is raised, Solana, Ethereum and other coin prices will spike. Thereafter, a ‘dollar liquidity negative’ situation could throw a spanner in the works for bullish momentum, Hayes theorises . The key factors driving investor interest in 1FUEL 1FUEL is setting out to reimagine what the term ‘secure crypto wallet’ means in practice with an extensive list of advanced features, cleverly designed to combine extensive security and privacy safeguards with welcome ease of use. 1FUEL’s one-click, cross-chain technology heralds the beginning of an exciting new era for digital asset management. While existing platforms demand a certain degree of crypto literacy – effectively locking out millions of non-advanced users – 1FUEL is just the opposite. It does the heavy lifting behind the scenes, asking users to do nothing more than select their preferred token before it takes on the complexity of cross-chain transactions. 1FUEL’s AI-powered system handles everything, from navigating multiple exchanges to optimising transaction fees. There’s also an in-built privacy mixer and cold storage, which provides high degrees of protection while also remaining accessible. Additional privacy is assured by disposable temporary wallets, and a P2P exchange. Real and digital cards will provide accessibility and utility, setting 1FUEL up for widespread use.

In May 2020, it was just 0.1%. In June 2022, it touched a peak of 9.1%. This inflation pattern has adversely affected the value of the US dollar. Inflation, thus, is something that determines the quality of life a working-class professional leads. Recent developments indicate that US states are keen to protect people from the threat of inflation. The Bitcoin Freedom Act introduced in the Oklahoma law-making house by Senator Dusty Deevers is the latest example. How much can this law impact the United States society? Let’s dive into the details! Ready? What is the Bitcoin Freedom Act? The act proposes that Oklahomans should be provided a chance to choose whether they want to receive their wages in Bitcoin or not. It also submits that businesses should be allowed to accept payments in Bitcoin. Why is the Bitcoin Freedom Act Significant? At the start of 2024, the US inflation rate stood at just 3.1%. In March, it touched a peak of 3.5%. Though in November it came down to 2.7%, it was far higher than the 1.2% inflation recorded in the same month in 2020. Growing inflation is one of the most serious threats the US economy is facing right now. Rising inflation means falling purchasing power. Bitcoin can save people from losing their purchasing power to inflation, as its total supply is fixed, and thus is unaffected by the threat of devaluation unlike traditional currencies. Oklahoma’s Leadership in Financial Innovation The introduction of the bill is likely to make a serious impact across the United States. The action has lifted the state to the celebrated position of innovation-friendly economies. It may encourage many to enter the world of financial innovation confidently. The Future of the Bitcoin Freedom Act The political stance against the cryptocurrency industry shifted when Republican candidate Donald Trump, who projected himself as a pro-crypto candidate, defeated Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who represented a crypto-skeptic regime, in the US presidential election. In the latest election, the Republican Party received a massive majority in Oklahoma, a US state that has emerged as a stronghold of Republicans, especially since 2011. The Bitcoin Freedom Act, also known as SB325, is expected to be discussed in the 60th legislative session of the 60th legislature. Reports say that the session will begin on February 3, 2025. In conclusion, the Bitcoin Freedom Act is more than legislation – it is a step toward financial empowerment and innovation. By embracing Bitcoin, Oklahoma is securing its place in the future of finance.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 06:13:26

Long also provided insights into the expansion of Ripple’s new RLUSD stablecoin, which she believes will see major adoption in the coming months. Ripple’s RLUSD Set For Broader Distribution Currently, RLUSD is listed on Bitso, MoonPay, and CoinMina, with additional listings in progress on platforms like Bullish and MercadoBitcoin. Asked about availability on larger US-based exchanges such as Coinbase, Long stated: “We are continuing to expand distribution and availability of Ripple dollars on other exchanges. So I think you can expect to see more availability, more announcements coming soon.” When pressed for a timeline, she emphasized: “Imminently.” Long highlighted the growing role stablecoins play in both trading and payments, describing them as “the way to on-ramp and off-ramp” in crypto. According to Long: “If we look at the crypto landscape overall, it has certainly been growing in the past couple quarters. We think this year is going to be a big year for crypto overall. And so demand for stablecoins, we think, will grow along with that. Ripple US dollar will have a premium role.” Since launching on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger in December, RLUSD has reached a market capitalization of around $53 million. Ripple has integrated Chainlink services into RLUSD to enhance its utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, further supporting Long’s vision for widespread adoption. XRP ETF: “Very Soon” In addition to RLUSD, Long addressed the prospect of an ETF, predicting a relatively short runway for regulatory approval: “I think we will see one very soon. I think that we will see more, you know, various crypto spot ETFs this year coming out of the US. And I think XRP is likely to be next in line after Bitcoin and ETH.” She noted that various asset managers—including Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and others—have already filed for XRP ETFs. Pointing to a more favorable regulatory environment, Long added: “There’s already been a number of different companies like Canary and others who have filed. And so we think especially with the administration change and that the approvals of those filings will accelerate.” In October, Bitwise filed a registration statement (Form S-1) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an XRP ETF. Since then, multiple firms have submitted applications, but the SEC has yet to make a decision. Long revealed that Ripple’s payments business doubled last year, indicating strong institutional and corporate demand for its solutions. She also cited an “especially big” close to 2024 for Ripple’s US business, noting that the company signed more local deals in the last six weeks of that year than in the previous six months. Speculation has mounted that the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly posture could speed up approvals of crypto ETFs. XRP prices have surged over 350% since Trump’s election victory, outperforming many other major cryptocurrencies during the same period.

However, a growing number of investors are turning their attention to Pepeto, a new memecoin making waves with its utility-driven approach and successful presale phase. Pepeto (PEPETO): Rising Through the Ranks Pepeto introduces itself as more than just a memecoin; it’s a robust platform aiming to redefine the utility of such cryptocurrencies. In its current presale phase, priced at just $0.000000103 per token, Pepeto has already raised over $3.4 million. This promising start is supported by a unique offering that includes a zero-fee exchange and a cross-chain bridge, setting it apart from typical memecoins.

Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Brief Overview Shiba Inu, famously known as a ‘Dogecoin killer,’ is a token that leverages the Ethereum blockchain, focusing on being a vibrant community-driven project. Despite its meme origins, SHIB has developed a substantial market cap of $12.57 billion, with a trading volume surge indicating active whale participation. This activity has contributed to a price uptick, making it a watch-worthy candidate in the crypto market. The Surge of Pepeto: A Closer Look Pepeto’s platform is built on a foundation of innovation and practical utility. Unlike many memecoins that primarily rely on hype, Pepeto offers tangible solutions like its zero-fee exchange, which allows users to engage in transactions without the burden of extra costs. Additionally, its cross-chain bridge enhances interoperability across different blockchain networks, facilitating seamless asset transfers. Another pillar of Pepeto’s strategy is its focus on community engagement and financial stability. The staking rewards system encourages long-term holding and contributes to a stable economic environment, reducing the typical volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. This approach not only supports token price but also fosters a loyal community around Pepeto’s ecosystem. While SHIB has gained attention due to its significant whale movements and community engagement, it often faces the challenge of proving its utility beyond being a meme. In contrast, Pepeto is crafted to offer real-world applications from the outset, aiming to sustain its value through practical uses and not just market sentiments. Don’t Miss Out On Pepeto As SHIB enthusiasts watch closely for a potential bull run fueled by recent whale transactions, forward-thinking investors are exploring opportunities with Pepeto. With its presale success and a clear roadmap toward a utility-centric crypto environment, Pepeto represents a compelling investment opportunity.

A multisign wallet, identified as “0xc69,” deposited 10 million $ENA (valued at $11.9 million) to Bybit approximately 13 hours ago. Despite this transaction, the wallet still retains 124.7 million $ENA (~$144 million), most of which remains staked. What’s noteworthy is that this multisign wallet has a history of offloading $ENA before notable price declines, indicating a potential market-timing strategy. Additionally, the wallet appears to share a Bybit deposit address with Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, raising speculation about its connections to key market players. Galaxy Digital Deposits $7.49M $ENA to Binance Galaxy Digital, another major entity, deposited 6.38 million $ENA ($7.49 million) to Binance six hours ago at a price of $1.173. This follows their earlier withdrawal of 10.9 million $ENA from Binance on December 5, 2024, at a lower price of $0.925. Currently, Galaxy Digital holds 4.45 million $ENA (worth $5.17 million), with an estimated total profit of $2.64 million from this trade, representing a 26% return. Their strategic movements suggest a calculated effort to capitalize on price differences and optimize returns.

Atkins, who has deep ties to conservative financial circles in Washington, will replace outgoing Chair Gary Gensler, who plans to leave on January 20. This shift raises questions about the future of the crypto markets. Atkins, known for his pro-crypto stance, is expected to be a strong advocate for the industry. He has previously worked with the Digital Chamber of Commerce and has experience in the crypto space. Under his leadership, crypto companies like Coinbase and Ripple may see a less aggressive regulatory approach compared to Gensler’s tenure, as Atkins is likely to focus on creating clear rules for the industry rather than enforcing harsh actions. Gensler recently said that his main goal was to protect investors by ensuring that crypto companies follow the rules and that people can make informed decisions. He pointed out that while less than 10% of Americans invest in crypto, most don’t fully understand the risks. In an interview with Bloomberg, Gensler opened up about his meeting with Atkins and said, “Paul and I did catch up. He knows this agency, he has worked this agency and he was a commissioner for six years.” Gensler said that he shared with Atkins an advice given to him by colleague.

But not all meme coins are created equal, and finding the gems that combine humour with long-term potential can be tricky. Enter BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Notcoin — three contenders battling it out for a spot in your portfolio. In today’s crypto frenzy, BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad is stealing the spotlight with its unique community-driven concept. As Neiro and Notcoin navigate short-term price dips, let’s explore what makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join for long-term gains . BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad Leads the Charge Centred around the Bulls Squad — a quirky, vibrant team of digital characters including Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull — this coin adds a sprinkle of personality to your portfolio. The Bulls Squad does more than look cool; each character embodies a unique aspect of the BTFD ecosystem, from community building to education and game promotion. Why the Bulls Squad Matters Imagine being part of an investment that’s not only lucrative but also packed with personality. The Bulls Squad actively engages the BTFD community through events, competitions, and even appearances in the platform’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. This dynamic team is a major reason why BTFD Coin has already raised impressive presale numbers, topping $5 million in presale funds so far. Real-Life Scenario: Profits With a Side of Fun Let’s break it down with some numbers. Say you invest $3,000 in BTFD Coin during its presale at the current price of $0.000142. This gives you 21,126,760 tokens. If the coin hits a projected $0.0006, your holdings could skyrocket to $12,676. Now, add the Bulls Squad’s continuous efforts to boost community morale and market traction, and you’ve got yourself a recipe for both financial and emotional wins. Neiro: The Next Big Opportunity? Neiro is making waves with its zero buy/sell tax and community-focused ethos. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, this meme coin presents itself as a serious contender for investors looking for Dogecoin-like success. The Numbers Game Currently priced at $0.04 with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $7 million, Neiro has seen a dip of 14.24% in the last 24 hours. While such fluctuations can be unsettling, they also present opportunities for savvy investors to buy the dip and ride the recovery. Why Consider Neiro? Neiro’s commitment to being a community-driven token makes it a notable choice for those looking to invest in a decentralised project with growth potential. Its zero-tax policy is particularly attractive for traders and long-term holders alike, and the project’s resemblance to Dogecoin’s early days keeps the hype alive. For those aiming to diversify their portfolio, Neiro holds promise, even amid its current price volatility. Notcoin: Gamified Growth Notcoin has carved a niche for itself in the meme coin world by combining community engagement with gaming mechanics. Born out of a viral Telegram game, this coin takes interaction to the next level with its innovative tap-to-earn mining system. Beyond gaming, Notcoin has extended its utility to transactions on platforms like Telegram, making it more than just a meme coin. The Ecosystem Advantage With a circulating supply of over 102 billion tokens and a market cap of $603 million, Notcoin has become a platform for web3 builders and enthusiasts. Its ecosystem encourages exploration and contribution, offering rewards for user participation. Whether it’s discovering new web3 products or earning through gaming, Notcoin has something for everyone. Numbers to Note Currently worth $0.005 with a trading volume of over $113 million in the last 24 hours, Notcoin has seen a 12.8% dip. However, its strong community engagement and diverse applications position it as a contender worth watching. Final Call to Action The presale stage of BTFD Coin is your golden opportunity to snag this gem before it hits the mainstream. With its vibrant Bulls Squad, robust community engagement, and promising growth potential, this coin is undoubtedly one of the best new meme coins to join for long-term gains. Don’t wait — join the presale today and secure your spot in the BTFD movement. After all, who wouldn’t want to ride alongside the Bulls Squad to financial glory?

This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg rejected a motion to prevent the forfeiture of 69,370 Bitcoin, allowing the Department of Justice to proceed with selling the assets, as stated in a court filing. The approval comes just shy of two weeks before the new administrator, who pledged not to sell the seized Bitcoin, takes office. The DOJ had cited Bitcoin price volatility as the reason for its need for a rushed sale of the assets. Judge approves Bitcoin sale, rejects Battle Born’s Bid to unmask ‘Individual X’ On December 30 , a federal judge granted the DOJ’s request to liquidate 69,370 Bitcoin seized from Silk Road. However, with this approval, Battle Born Investments failed in its attempt to postpone the sale. The document’s emergence this week remains unclear, and the DOJ has not made an official comment yet. Battle Born had previously submitted a FOIA request to the DOJ, seeking the identity of “Individual X,” who had signed a consent agreement for the forfeiture of seized Bitcoin from Silk Road before filing a lawsuit in court. However, in its ruling, the court found that DOJ had followed the correct procedures in invoking FOIA Exemption 7(c) to conceal Individual X’s identity. The court highlighted that the holder had compelling reasons to maintain anonymity, especially since the seized assets were tied to criminal activity. Battle Born Investments even contended that disclosing the identity was in the public’s interest and vital to maintaining transparency and accountability concerning government actions; nevertheless, the court concluded that Individual X’s privacy rights took precedence over that. Additionally, the court insisted that Battle Born failed to provide enough evidence to prove any government misconduct in protecting the identity of “Individual X”. Battle Born believes the DOJ used procedural trickery to hide the case’s facts Battle Born legal team is still displeased with the outcome of the case. Battle Born’s attorney even called the case “another egregious example of the DOJ’s abuse of the Civil Asset Forfeiture Process,” claiming the agency used “ procedural trickery” to conceal the truth. Nonetheless, the US Marshals Service is anticipated to oversee the liquidation, which will mark one of the largest sales of confiscated cryptocurrency to date. However, the court’s approval to sell the seized Bitcoin briefly impacted the market, causing Bitcoin to dip from about $95,000 to $93,800. It has since recovered slightly to $94,454 .

Here’s a breakdown of the year’s highlights: Meme Coins on the Rise The meme coin ecosystem experienced a fivefold increase in market capitalization, peaking at $112.6 billion. This surge was largely fueled by Solana’s high-performance network, which supported the growth of meme tokens. Despite this impressive rise, meme coins accounted for just 4% of the overall crypto market, dwarfed by major asset classes such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. Ethereum’s Evolution with Restaking Ethereum solidified its position as a leading blockchain, with the introduction of “restaking” as a key innovation. Projects like Eigenlayer, Karak Network, and Symbiotic Finance encouraged investors to maximize their holdings by staking ETH multiple times. While this added tremendous value to Ethereum’s ecosystem, it also introduced new risks that investors had to navigate. Bitcoin’s Dominance Remains Unshaken Bitcoin maintained its dominance, especially with the introduction of staking solutions tailored for BTC holders. Total Value Locked (TVL) in Bitcoin surged from 490 BTC in August to an impressive 33,500 BTC by December. Protocols like Babylon Labs played a pivotal role in driving this growth, offering innovative staking opportunities for Bitcoin enthusiasts. 2024 was a wonderful year for crypto. The Meme ecosytem saw a 5X growth facilitated by the @solana network but this meme craze accounts for only about 4% of the Crypto market share when compared to: #Bitcoin , #Ethereum and #stablecoins .

Stablecoins remained a vital pillar of the crypto market, offering liquidity and stability. A Balanced Ecosystem The 2024 crypto market showcased the complementary nature of major asset classes, blending utility, innovation, and community-driven initiatives. This synergy underscored the resilience and adaptability of the industry as it moved toward broader adoption. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Elon Musk’s “Kekius Maximus” Moment The narrative of the week revolved around Elon Musk, who referred to himself as “Kekius Maximus,” a move that triggered a staggering 900% surge in a related token. Meanwhile, controversy brewed as the creator of MIRA issued a public apology for their failed ZERO token experiment. Adding to the chaos, Yat Sui’s social media account was compromised, further stirring the pot in the meme community. AI Tokens Surge Amid Market Shake-Up AI-driven tokens continued to gain dominance, with Virtuals reaching a $4 billion market cap and ai16z climbing to $2 billion. The ai16z token led the pack with an impressive 115.55% weekly gain, while SIMMI followed closely, rising 91% with its bold claim that “the future isn’t human.” These advancements underline the increasing role of AI in reshaping digital assets.

The proposed bill, SB325, is designed to be entirely voluntary, emphasizing free-market principles. It allows employees, employers, and businesses to decide whether to use Bitcoin for transactions, salaries, and investments. One of the bill’s primary objectives is to establish a secure framework for the use of Bitcoin by individuals, businesses, and the state. Deevers praised President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, stating, “Bitcoin has arrived into the mainstream of our economy and is unquestionably a significant part of the financial future.” The senator highlighted that the legislation positions Oklahoma as a national leader in embracing financial technology, providing citizens with more financial options. The Bitcoin Freedom Act will be considered during the 60th legislative session starting Feb. 3. Deevers, an outspoken critic of inflation, said, “If Washington D.C. can ruin something, it likely will. And it is certainly ruining the US dollar.” He reiterated his commitment to protecting the financial well-being of his constituents, saying, “One of my biggest campaign promises was to fight for the financial well-being of those I represent.” On Jan. 9, Deevers also voiced opposition to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), warning they could lead to government overreach and undermine financial privacy. “Bitcoin promotes financial sovereignty,” he said, emphasizing its decentralized and censorship-resistant qualities, which safeguard individuals from government interference or inflationary manipulation.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-09 07:23:41

Historically, Bitcoin has spent just 5% of its trading days above this level, underscoring its rarity and the market’s restraint this cycle. Despite #Bitcoin 's impressive rally last year, MVRV levels above 3.2 – the typical threshold for extreme euphoria – haven’t been reached this cycle.

While retail demand remains at its lowest in five years, steady on-chain accumulation since June 2024 signals that institutions are focused on the long-term outlook for Bitcoin. After the big $BTC dump on Dec 21, institutions wasted no time, scooping up over 34,000 BTC under $95K in the last 30 days.

Institutions are playing the long game. pic.twitter.com/Y1ymidqRlt — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) January 8, 2025 Technical Patterns and Key Support Levels Bitcoin recently invalidated a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern after breaching the right shoulder. However, a swift reversal erased those gains, pulling the price back below the pattern and renewing bearish sentiment. The recent downswing has seen Bitcoin fall below a critical demand zone of $95,400–$98,400, where 1.77 million addresses purchased over 1.53 million BTC. If selling pressure drives Bitcoin below $92,000, the next major support lies between $74,000 and $78,000, raising fears of a potential crash. On the upside, Bitcoin must reclaim the $100,000 level to negate the bearish outlook and aim for new all-time highs. Short-Term Recovery or Further Decline? On the 4-hour chart, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a buy signal, suggesting a potential rebound to $98,600, where a $35 million liquidation zone exists. However, macroeconomic conditions and a weakening demand zone suggest caution remains warranted. ETF Inflows Signal Institutional Interest On January 7, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $52.39 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF contributing $596 million. The total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs now stands at $110.12 billion, indicating continued institutional interest despite market volatility. On January 7, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 52.3899 million US dollars, and the net inflow of BlackRock ETF IBIT was 596 million US dollars. The total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETF is currently 110.115 billion US dollars. https://t.co/59u0BnDSW8 pic.twitter.com/MRH4P1K7jZ — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 8, 2025 In conclusion, Bitcoin’s short-term outlook suggests a potential rebound, but a drop below $92,000 could spell trouble, leading to a steep decline toward $74,000. Reclaiming $100,000 is crucial for invalidating the bearish scenario and resuming its upward trajectory. #Bitcoin $BTC is back below $100,000! Now what??

According to Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, staying among the top 10% of XRP holders is now more difficult than ever, especially as the token’s value grows. If you hold more than 2,601 $XRP , you’re in the top 10% pic.twitter.com/aPWpOEW2Pk — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) January 5, 2025 What It Takes to Join the Top 10% of XRP Holders Farina’s analysis highlights that the number of XRP required to qualify as a top 10% holder has decreased over time, despite the rising cost of entry. In June 2024, when XRP was trading at approximately $0.47, investors needed at least 3,300 XRP to secure a spot in the top 10%. At the time, this required an investment of $1,551. Fast-forward to January 2025, the threshold has dropped to 2,599 XRP. However, the cost to meet this benchmark has surged to $6,263, as XRP is now valued at over $2.40 per token. For context, XRP currently has over 5.85 million wallets, with only 585,248 containing 2,599 XRP or more. This number represents the top 10% of holders. Meanwhile, wallets in the top 1%—approximately 58,000 addresses—hold at least 56,304 XRP, which equates to an investment of $135,000 at today’s prices. Farina predicts that as XRP’s price approaches $100, only a few thousand wallets will remain in the top 10%. He encourages those interested in XRP to consider accumulating the asset before higher prices make it unattainable for many. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Importance of Self-Custody Among XRP Holders In addition to discussing wealth brackets, Farina raised concerns about self-custody within the XRP community . While there are over 500 million cryptocurrency users globally, he estimates that only about 20 million actively self-custody their assets. For XRP specifically, Farina believes that fewer than half a million holders truly control their tokens in self-custody wallets. He warns that relying on centralized exchanges to store XRP comes with significant risks, particularly during rapid price increases. Without self-custody, investors may lose access to their tokens or miss opportunities to benefit from the token’s long-term growth. A Shrinking Pool of Top XRP Holders Farina’s insights also underline a key trend: as XRP becomes more expensive, the number of individuals able to maintain a top-tier position will continue to shrink. This reflects a shift in accessibility, as increasing prices push smaller investors out of the higher wealth brackets. The message is clear: securing and holding XRP now, especially in self-custody, offers a better chance of staying among the top holders in the future.

According to recent data, the 90-day percent return metric for TON indicates the early stages of an uptrend, raising expectations of a sustained rally in the coming weeks. This trend has been observed historically, with similar metrics signaling substantial gains in past bull cycles. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Recovery Continues — Is The Dwindling Staking TVL Ratio Bullish? Historical Data Suggests Strong Price Potential Kesmeci disclosed that historical analysis reveals that TON has previously demonstrated notable performance following reversals in the 90-day percent return metric. For example, in August 2023, TON rose from $1.72, delivering a 65% gain over 70 days. Similarly, in February 2024, the asset surged by 258% in just 43 days after a similar metric reversal. The most recent example, recorded in November 2024, saw TON climb 32% within 11 days. These instances suggest that when the 90-day percent return metric crosses into positive territory, it often serves as a precursor to significant upward price movement. The current trend, which began just seven days ago, has sparked optimism among investors who are considering short-term accumulation strategies. Kesmeci reveals that if historical trends persist, TON could experience a median gain of 65% over the next 43 days. The analyst wrote: Currently, we observe that the “90-day percent return” metric for TON has entered a bull trend for the fourth time. It has been only 7 days since this reversal. Based on previous data: Expected duration: 43 days (median value) Potential percentage return: 65% (median value) These insights suggest that TON is likely to continue its upward trend in the short term. However, it is worth noting that market conditions and external factors, such as overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector, could influence the trajectory of this trend. Toncoin Market Performance Since the year began, Toncoin has been unable to make a significant movement towards the upside. Instead, the altcoin has continued to face consistent decline. Over the past two weeks, TON has now plunged by a double-digit performance of nearly 12%. This has brought the asset’s price to currently trade below $6 as of today marking a 7.5% decline in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, despite the consistent decline from TON in recent weeks, the asset’s daily trading volume has seen an opposite trend.

Particularly, in the past 7 days, TON’s daily trading volume has moved from $200 million last Wednesday to now sitting at roughly 344 million as of today. Given the current trend in TON’s price, it is worth noting that this increase in TON’s trading volume might be from the continuous selling pressure in the TON market.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-09 07:36:35

However, the panicked crypto whale sold all of his ai deborah tokens just three minutes after purchasing them, as the token’s value plummeted, and he was only able to get 40 SOL worth $7,700.

Now, bolder and more extravagant price predictions are shared in the market. Some boost crypto enthusiasts’ sentiments, and others spread the fear of a crash. The prediction of the New Quantile model also provides a unique perspective on the Bitcoin price rally and when it will hit $1M. Let’s discuss the findings. Bitcoin Price Would Not $1M in 2025 Multiple Bitcoin price predictions for 2025 suggest that this digital asset will reach $1M. However, the new Quantile Bitcoin model discards such predictions. Its statistical outlook claims the possibility of $1M is extremely low for this year. The findings acknowledge the BTC price performance and its exponential growth but also question the feasibility of this six-figure target. Quantile regression analysis considers Bitcoin’s adherence to power law trends (a more than ten-decade analysis). It suggests the path to a million targets requires a dramatic bubble excursion. More importantly, at least a 4σ standard deviation is needed for the BTC price to hit $1M in 2025, where historical trends reveal that it only fluctuates between -1σ and +2σ. “To reach $1 million in 2025 would require a bubble excursion of 1.0 in the log, a multiplicative factor of 10 from the present price, and in log terms that is 1/0.24, which is greater than four standard deviations (> 4 σ). Throughout Bitcoin’s price history, we have not seen this even once, nor have we seen 3 σ, and prices have stayed overwhelmingly in the range of -1 σ on the downside and +2 σ maximum on the upside.” The Quantile finding also challenges Cathy Woods’s views on Bitcoin. She claims the price can range from $650,000 to $1.5 million, depending on the base and bull cases. The quantile model’s statistical findings present different timelines. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Timeline For $300K, $1M, $3M and $10M moneyordebt X post says that Bitcoin is getting more predictable with declining price volatility. In this, the quasi-periodic bubbles play an important role. It indicates the cycle peak followed by correction due to long-term power law trends. Interestingly, this happens every four years, and the cycle has been set as 2013, 2017, 2021, 2025, and 2029 are next. In these years, BTC can create major price milestones. Quantile’s Bitcoin price prediction revealed the timeline for this asset’s marking the major milestone. According to this, there is a 50% chance BTC price might hit $300k in 2029, with two years of uncertainty range, a 50% chance of $1M happening in 2034 with two years of uncertainty age, $3M in 2039, and $10M after 2046. Returning to Cathy Woods’s findings, the Quantile statistics claim that there is only a 20% chance that the price of Bitcoin will hit $650k by 2030 and an even lesser (just 5%) chance of $1M hitting in 2030. However, there is a 50% chance of this happening by 2034. What You Need To Know? The Quantile model’s findings on Bitcoin price prediction are pretty amusing, as they consider the quantile regressions, bubble excursions, and historical trends. According to that, the BTC will hit $300k in 2030 (plus or minus 2 years). More importantly, the most anticipated $1M target will be achieved in 2034 or plus/minus two years, challenging many current BTC price predictions, which claim that this could happen in 2025. The pi cycle indicator hints that the BTC will hit prime in Sept. 2025 . Based on that and other analyses, many analysts claim that a six-figure target can be achieved this year, but the Quantile model contradicts this. However, it also acknowledges the possibility of $300k if the bubble excursion got above 0.97 in quantile terms without popping before year-end.

Table of Contents Ethereum powering the DeFi and dApp revolution Cardano aiming for mass adoption with scalability Lightchain AI bridging blockchain and artificial intelligence As the crypto market enters 2025 with momentum, leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Lightchain AI (LCAI) are in the spotlight. Each of these projects brings unique innovations to the table, influencing their potential price trajectories. Let’s explore the Q1 2025 price predictions and the factors driving their growth. Ethereum powering the DeFi and dApp revolution Ethereum is a top blockchain. Experts think that by early 2025, Ethereum might hit around $5,000 to $6,000. This rise is helped by more people using decentralized money (DeFi) and unique tokens (NFTs). Big firms are also interested and getting rewards from staking adds to its lift. The main reasons for Ethereum’s success are the growth of Layer 2 answers like Arbitrum and Optimism which make it work better and faster. With Ethereum’s top developer group, these developments help it maintain its position as a market leader, making it a vital component of blockchain growth and adoption. You might also like: Lightchain AI may stand out in 2025 when compared with Sui and Floki Cardano aiming for mass adoption with scalability Cardano is widely recognized for its research-driven approach and commitment to scalability and sustainability. The upcoming launch of enhanced DeFi capabilities in Q1 2025 are expected to significantly boost its utility. Predictions suggest that ADA could trade between $1.50 and $2.50 during this period, with the potential for even higher gains if its ecosystem achieves significant adoption. Key factors driving this growth include the increasing use of its smart contract capabilities, strategic partnerships in emerging markets, and its strong focus on decentralized governance. These developments position Cardano as a leading blockchain platform, with the potential to attract more users and projects, further solidifying its role in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Q1 2025 will be a pivotal period for Cardano’s growth and influence. Lightchain AI bridging blockchain and artificial intelligence This new project is transforming the crypto space by combining artificial intelligence with blockchain to build an ecosystem designed for decentralized AI applications. With its smart Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), the project has already captured significant attention. Having raised over $8 million during its presale at $0.004875 per token, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining momentum as a utility-focused token. Strong community engagement and innovative technology are key factors driving its growth. Predictions suggest that by Q1 2025, LCAI could reach $0.15–$0.20, with further potential depending on adoption and ecosystem development. As Lightchain AI continues to expand its offerings, its unique approach positions it as a promising contender in the world of blockchain and AI integration.

According to local media, the PEA, in collaboration with the Crime Suppression Division, has seized 996 Bitcoin mining rigs during a raid on the mining farm located in the Phanat Nikhom district of Chonburi. Authorities discovered the operators of the farm had tampered with their electricity meters to use electricity for mining operations largely free of charge, leading to millions of baht in losses for the Thai state electricity provider. Those responsible for running the operation are yet to be identified, and the CSD is in the process of obtaining arrest warrants from the court. The operation was planned in a manner that would not raise suspicions. An unnamed staff member has testified that the theft was cleverly timed to occur only at night, with the power meter functioning as usual during the day to avoid detection. Bitcoin mining is a complex process that uses high-powered computers to solve mathematical problems, verify transactions, and create new bitcoins. This energy-intensive activity makes electricity the largest operational cost, leading some operators to resort to illegal methods to stretch their profit margins.

The PEA, in August 2024, took down a similar operation in Ratchaburi, a town west of Bangkok, after unregistered miners were found to be draining power from the local electricity grid, leading to frequent blackouts in the area and higher costs for residents. More recently, two individuals from the Surat Thani province were charged with stealing over $280,000 in electricity to power their mining rigs in an abandoned property. Meanwhile, back in 2022, the Department of Special Investigation in Bangkok spearheaded a series of raids, dismantling over 50 crypto-mining operations that were causing yearly losses of over $10 million in stolen electricity. Similar activities have been uncovered across other corners of the globe. As previously reported by crypto.news, Malaysia’s national electricity provider, in an October 2024 report, disclosed losses upwards of $100 million stemming from electricity theft to run Bitcoin mining hardware. These incidents have sparked a global reckoning, with governments tightening regulations, limiting electricity use, hiking tariffs, and even imposing outright bans to exert greater control over the crypto-mining industry.

Smart traders can no longer dismiss this vision as Rexas Finance (RXS) soars. Rexas Finance , the “next Solana (SOL) or Ethereum (ETH),” is pioneering the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), a market that will change global finance. Innovative features like the Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, a strong vision, and significant institutional interest make it a top candidate for exponential growth. Rexas Finance is not just a cryptocurrency; its potential for substantial returns and track record of disrupting asset markets could transform the landscape for early investors. Rexas Finance (RXS): Tokenization Impact Rexas Finance is pioneering real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, seamlessly integrating blockchain technology and tangible assets. Tokenizing real estate, precious metals, and commodities allows investors to create wealth and establish property investment experiences using cutting-edge technology. Trading was long reserved for the wealthy and institutional investors, but it is now more accessible. Imagine owning a quarter of a New York luxury apartment or a gold reserve from home. Rexas Finance democratizes ownership and provides unrivaled transparency and security, benefiting all participants. Tokenization on Rexas Finance overcomes high entry costs, geographic restrictions, and illiquid assets. Retail investors in Asia can now invest in high-end European properties for rental income and asset appreciation. Its QuickMint Bot simplifies Ethereum-compatible token minting, making blockchain-based asset ownership accessible to non-technical consumers. Rexas Launchpad helps startups and established businesses raise funds efficiently through token sales. Rexas Finance is a pioneer in a trillion-dollar business, changing global investment with solutions like Rexas AI Shield for top-tier security and Rexas GenAI for seamless platform navigation. Getting Rich With $100 on Rexas Finance Rexas Finance (RXS) allows investors to make $1,000,000 from a $100 investment. The project’s presale success was remarkable: It started at $0.03 per token and rose 6x to $0.175 in the eleventh presale phase. Over $34.9 million raised and early stages selling out in record time have attracted retail investors and crypto enthusiasts to Rexas Finance. Unlike many blockchain businesses that rely on venture financing, RXS’s public presale concept democratized funding and allowed regular citizens to join its ambitious journey. The 6X price surge from stage 1 to 11 customers and the expectation of even bigger profits post-launch show that this deliberate strategy has built a devoted audience. RXS is a potential long-term growth candidate because to its capped supply of 1 billion tokens and strategic allocations for marketing, liquidity, and staking pools. Its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, two of the most trusted cryptocurrency sites, boost RXS’s legitimacy and visibility beyond its presale success. These listings have increased investor confidence, helping Rexas Finance stand out in a congested industry. The CertiK audit, a blockchain security gold standard, adds credibility to the project. RXS attracts investors seeking exponential returns with its unique blend of innovation and security. It integrates cutting-edge asset tokenization technology and utilizes its developing network. With a strong debut and ongoing progress, a $100 investment in Rexas Finance might unlock a $1,000,000 future by 2028, making it a possible crypto industry game-changer. Is Rexas Finance the Next Ethereum or Solana by 2028? Attention has been very high on Rexas Finance tokens, which have become one of the most accumulated tokens, following Ethereum and Solana’s footsteps. The token recorded more than 716,000 entries in its ongoing giveaway, which is set to reward 20 lucky participants with 50,000 RXS tokens as incentives for participation. According to analysts, Rexas Finance (RXS) could follow Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) by 2028. Rexas Finance is revolutionizing crypto asset ownership by tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) and giving investors access to previously inaccessible assets. RXS offers cutting-edge wealth creation tools like the Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, allowing users to tokenize real estate, art, and commodities. Traders have noticed the project’s presale success, indicating high demand. Analysts see this as a harbinger of future expansion since RXS might scale swiftly and disrupt financial markets as Solana did. Strategic growth plans, including institutional investor alliances and a robust expansion strategy, have made Rexas Finance a serious competitor to duplicate Ethereum and Solana’s rapid value growth. The presale ends, and the coin approaches double-digit pricing. Crypto investors and enthusiasts should grab the moment to maximize their gains. This is an opportunity to invest in Rexas Finance, a blockchain project that will alter the industry and pay off early adopters.

In a Jan. 9 report , Santiment gave Dogecoin an optimistic crowd sentiment score of 1 out of 5, contrasting the positive sentiment rankings of 4 out of 5 for XRP and Solana. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has dropped 28% in market capitalization from its January highs, compounding the lack of interest. Despite the bearish trend, Santiment believes that DOGE’s “extremely quiet” phase may be the ideal opportunity for courageous investors to enter the market. If the broader crypto market begins to rally, Dogecoin may see a resurgence as predicted by its previous social trends and speculative excitement. Some crypto traders also believe that Dogecoin’s long-term outlook remains positive. Pseudonymous trader Wizz voiced confidence to their 768,700 X followers, suggesting that Dogecoin will surpass major cryptocurrencies in the next three to six months. $DOGE will outperform most majors the coming 3/6 months U heard it here Elon marketing starts soon. — WIZZ🥷 ( beware scammers ) (@CryptoWizardd) January 6, 2025 Similarly, crypto expert KrissPax noticed that DOGE’s recent price behavior resembles trends from a year ago, implying that a large price breakout could occur in 2025. This sentiment is echoed by other analysts, who predict that the leading meme coin will pump to $3-$5 by 2025. Market hype and legal developments impact DOGE Apart from social hype, Google searches for Dogecoin have dropped 74% since November 2024. Notably, this fall occurred simultaneously with the dismissal of a high-profile class-action lawsuit against Elon Musk and Tesla, which accused Musk of manipulating Dogecoin prices. Although social conversation and user interest have subsided, periods of low hype have historically proven beneficial for strategic accumulation. Dogecoin’s recent drop in sentiment and social media hype appears to be a buying opportunity for crypto investors. If DOGE can capture the market-wide bullish trend, it might make an impressive comeback that will reward investors who remain patient during the dump. Santiment says sentiment for BTC is neutral as ETH tries to stay above $3k Santiment also said that social media sentiment towards Bitcoin is currently neutral as analyzed by the ratio of positive and negative comments. The audience became negative following the Fed-induced retracement on Dec. 20. Meanwhile, Ethereum recently captured the spotlight after its price briefly regained the support level of $4,000, according to Santiment. Ethereum is now looking to maintain its market value of over $3,000 per unit, the report added. If this mark is breached, volatility will increase, and buying opportunities will appear with a higher risk tolerance, Santiment added.

Coutts tells his 32,400 followers on the social media platform X that the Fed will likely make additional rate cuts in the near future that would inject more liquidity into the markets and cause Bitcoin to surge. Coutts shares a chart showing the historical relationship between the global money supply (M2) metric and Bitcoin, suggesting an M2 increase would send BTC higher. “With the strong dollar becoming a real problem, I expected Bitcoin to be in the $80,000 range by now. This speaks to the strength of the underlying bid and the market’s expectations that the Fed will have to act; otherwise, things will start breaking. Regardless of the sequence of events, more liquidity is coming, and Bitcoin should be much higher six months from now.” Source: Jamie Coutts/X Coutts also expects greater adoption of Bitcoin by the private wealth segment, which includes high-net-worth individuals and families, noting these entities “are less concerned than CT’s (crypto Twitter’s) daily obsession over liquidity ups and downs.” Another one of Coutts’ predictions for the coming months is that the relatively new artificial intelligence (AI) agents crypto sector will continue an upward trend. Crypto AI agents are protocols built to autonomously perform tasks on behalf of users such as interacting with blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, trading and managing portfolios. Said Coutts, “Interest in AI agents in crypto took off in November 2024. Based on history, this trend is expected to last at least another four months, but probably longer. AI agents are not like the others – they unlock potential for every established and new use case.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,592 at time of writing, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

As a result, crypto markets have been making big bets on Bitcoin’s price increasing throughout 2025. But Trump hasn’t yet committed the federal government to making any new Bitcoin purchases. His more modest plan is to simply freeze the Bitcoin the government has already seized from those like Ross Ulbricht, who broke the law. So does that mean Schiff is right, and the government won’t be buying Bitcoin, even with Trump in charge? That’s not necessarily so. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has a more radical proposal for the government in Washington to purchase one million BTC over five years. Accordingly, unless Schiff knows something that markets don’t yet, it is entirely possible that the pro-crypto Republican Congress and White House could send the government on a BTC buying spree in Trump’s second term. Peter Schiff: Govt Won’t Be Buying Bitcoin Once it becomes obvious that the U.S. Govt. won’t be buying #Bitcoin , those who bought hoping to front-run that buying will sell. @saylor will be forced to accelerate his leveraged Bitcoin purchases to prevent a crash. But this will only delay the crash until $MSTR crashes first. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 8, 2025 After MicroStrategy announced its most recent monster purchase of Bitcoin—1,070 BTC for $101 million—the asset’s price surged within an hour. “But this will only delay the crash until $MSTR crashes first,” Schiff added. Lifelong Goldbug ‘Hates’ BTC ‘Speculative Mania’ It’s not that I hate Bitcoin itself. I hate the speculative mania in Bitcoin that has caused a huge misallocation of capital, which will cause millions to lose sums far greater than they can afford, and which will tarnish the image of sound money and libertarian principals. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 8, 2025 In reply to a commenter who asked, “Why do you hate Bitcoin so much, Peter?” the global hedge fund capitalist answered, “It’s not that I hate Bitcoin itself. I hate the speculative mania in Bitcoin that has caused a huge misallocation of capital.” It’s true that there are winners and losers in the volatile cryptocurrency exchange markets and that there are frequently BTC bubbles with steep corrections. But it’s not necessarily a flaw inherent to Bitcoin or to the cryptocurrency’s most vocal supporters. Crypto markets aren’t really different from stocks in this regard. They’re just more extreme because of the liquidity and velocity of these 24-hour-a-day markets, managed by automated Internet trading platforms and open to anyone around the world to participate. Of course, Schiff would be sure to add that he doesn’t like that about stock markets either.

ETH is down by more than two percent and is trading slightly below the $3300 level at the time of writing. Long-Term Analysis: Approaching the End of the Cycle Looking at Ethereum’s long-term chart, the market follows an Elliott Wave pattern, which helps analyze market sentiment. While the analysis remains somewhat subjective, Fibonacci levels and support areas add an element of objectivity. Ethereum is currently in an uptrend and may be nearing the completion of a larger cycle. After forming Waves 1, 2, 3, and 4 since the 2018 low, Ethereum could be nearing Wave 5, which signals a possible top for the trend. However, a higher high compared to the 2021 peak still needs to form. Momentum Weakening: Signals of Exhaustion Recent price action shows weaker momentum compared to earlier waves. Waves 1 and 3 saw aggressive price movement, but Wave 5 is showing signs of diminishing strength, which is typical for the end of a cycle. This could point to the final phase of the bull market, where tracking and trading Ethereum becomes increasingly difficult, and risk levels rise. Corrective Phase: Watching Support Zones Ethereum’s price is still within a corrective phase, with a potential Wave 2 forming in an ABC structure. As long as support levels between $2,470 and $3,167 hold, higher prices are still a possibility. The ideal target for this rally is $3,572. Bearish Shift: Key Support Breaks However, if Ethereum’s price breaks below the $2,470 support zone, the outlook will turn bearish. For now, the market remains in a corrective phase, but a move above key resistance levels, especially between $3,415 and $3,648, will confirm if a more bullish trend is forming.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 08:10:27

With the use of Stability AI’s technology, Story aims to address the critical challenge of properly attributing, tracking, and monetizing creative work generated via AI. Story is focused on addressing the lack of a clear path for creators to monetize their derivative works in the open-source ecosystem. Despite the incredible progress in AI, proper attribution and monetization for creators’ IP has not kept up with the rate of innovation. “We’re thrilled to leverage Stability AI’s models, to tackle the most pressing challenges we face with the rapid rise of AI,” said Jason Zhao, Co-Founder and Chief Protocol Officer at PIP Labs, Story’s initial core contributor . “The combination of AI and blockchain is not only incredibly powerful, but necessary. Blockchains secure digital property rights in the era of AI driven creative abundance. By leveraging Stability AI’s technology and Story’s technology, we’re showcasing how the proper incentive structures can ensure attribution and empower creators, driving AI development forward.” Story and its ecosystem applications will use Stability AI’s leading foundational image models to build AI applications that embed tracking of contributions across the AI development life cycle to enable fair compensation to all creators involved with a monetized output. Mahojin and ABLO are two AI applications building on Story that leverage Stability AI’s foundation models and Story’s blockchain technology. Mahojin , a search-to-generate AI remixing platform and ABLO , a collaborative AI platform that allows creators to design physical goods with leading brand IPs use Stability AI’s models to allow users to easily bring their creative vision to life and Story’s technology to enable better provenance and attribution across the AI stack. These two projects showcase real-world use cases and illustrate how to unlock new ways for creators to safeguard their IP and earn from their contributions in a dynamic, shared creative economy. “Empowering creators is at the core of everything we do at Stability AI. We are thrilled to see our models used in Story’s blockchain technology to ensure proper attribution and rewards contributors,” said Scott Trowbridge, Vice President of Stability AI . Story is committed to exploring different use cases for how AI and blockchain can come together to meet the evolving needs of creators and developers in the age of generative AI. For example, one area of exploration is registering training data like an artist’s unique style or voice as IP with transparent usage terms on Story. Anyone can then train and fine-tune their own model using this IP. If a creator uses this model to generate an output that is monetized, everyone in this chain of creation wins and benefits together. By leveraging Stability AI’s cutting-edge models, Story is taking a key step toward creating a sustainable and fair internet in the age of AI.

Many altcoins are also in dire situations, with notable price losses from the likes of DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, and others. BTC’s Troubles Keep Mounting It was just about 48 hours ago when the primary cryptocurrency was charting new yearly peaks. Recall that the asset had climbed above $102,000 after a relatively quiet weekend amid growing ETF inflows, but then the landscape changed after the US announced the latest jobs report. In a matter of minutes, the cryptocurrency plunged from six-digit territory to under $97,000 on Tuesday afternoon. The situation worsened on Wednesday as the bears kept pushing BTC south , which culminated in a price drop to $92,500 (on Bitstamp). After that weekly low, bitcoin bounced off and touched $95,000, but that was short-lived as the ETF flows turned negative, with nearly $600 million in the red. As the Thursday Asian trading session progressed, BTC dropped once again to under $93,000. Although it sits just above that line now, the asset has lost nearly ten grand since Tuesday morning. Its market cap has plummeted below $1.850 trillion but its dominance over the alts stands tall above 54% on CG. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 9.1.2025.

DOGE, AVAX, LINK, and XLM are the other massive losers within the same time frame, with declines of up to 7%. Nevertheless, the biggest and most painful decreases are evident from AI16Z and WIF. Both assets have tumbled by double digits (19% and $14%, respectively) to $1.47 and $1.62.

Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg denied a motion to block the forfeiture, clearing the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) to liquidate the $6.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. This is the largest crypto seizure in U.S. history , signaling a major closure in the case linked to the dark web platform shut down in 2013. Despite the ruling, the liquidation process will take time, as federal asset forfeiture involves several administrative steps and appeal windows. Portions of the Bitcoin stash have already been sold. On December 3, 2024, the DOJ moved nearly $2 billion in Silk Road Bitcoin to Coinbase, where the U.S. Marshals Service manages custody through Coinbase Prime. The case faced numerous legal challenges, including appeals to the Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court. Claimants like Battle Born Investments argued ownership rights, claiming they acquired the Bitcoin through bankruptcy proceedings. The court ultimately dismissed these claims, and the mysterious ""Individual X,"" who surrendered the Bitcoin to authorities in 2020, remains unidentified . The funds stem from Silk Road’s illegal transactions and represent one of the largest government crypto liquidations to date. The DOJ’s decision to liquidate coincides with President-elect Donald Trump’s imminent inauguration. Trump has previously expressed support for Bitcoin, advising holders ""never to sell"" at a crypto conference in July 2024. His administration plans to develop a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which could influence future government policies on crypto holdings. This development adds to the broader context of government involvement in cryptocurrency. In October 2024, it was reported that the government was preparing for this liquidation. Blockchain data revealed a transfer of Bitcoin to Coinbase shortly after, highlighting the scale of the planned sale. Legal and political dimensions have further complicated the case. Judge Seeborg, known for high-profile rulings, previously handled cases involving Google’s user tracking disclosures. His decision on the Silk Road Bitcoin aligns with the DOJ’s goal to finalize asset forfeiture while ensuring transparency. The Silk Road Bitcoin liquidation marks a turning point in the U.S. government’s crypto policies , potentially setting a precedent for handling seized digital assets. With Trump’s administration about to take office, the handling of these funds could carry political and economic implications, especially as the global crypto market continues to evolve.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-09 08:53:36

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-ethereums-drop-liquidated-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-long-positions-here-are-the-details/,"Cryptocurrency markets have experienced a wave of turbulence over the past 24 hours, leading to liquidations exceeding $520 million as Bitcoin and Ethereum faced sharp price swings. Crypto Market Sees Over $520 Million in Liquidations Amid Rising Volatility Data from Coinglass revealed that around 186,000 investors were liquidated, with total liquidations on centralized exchanges amounting to $524.8 million. Bitcoin (BTC) led the liquidations by closing out over $142.5 million worth of positions, $101 million of which were long positions. Ether (ETH) also saw significant liquidations totaling $89.9 million, $49.2 million of which were long positions. Liquidations occur when investors' positions are forced to close due to insufficient margin to cover losses during high market volatility. Bitcoin is down 2.26% over the past 24 hours, trading at $92,500 at the time of writing. This follows a brief surge earlier in the week when BTC surpassed the $100,000 mark, fueled by optimism over the new administration’s pro-crypto policies. Ether fell 0.85% to $3,208, extending losses after a double-digit drop the previous day. The volatility comes at a time of heightened market activity and investor sentiment, with analysts suggesting that recent macroeconomic developments and regulatory expectations could contribute to the volatility. Market watchers will continue to monitor the effects of heightened volatility and urge investors to exercise caution amid uncertain conditions. *This is not investment advice.

Money Printing To Propel Bitcoin? Despite surging past $100,000 on January 6, BTC faced a sharp decline to as low as $94,543 earlier today, casting doubt on the so-called “Trump rally” that many expected to last until Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surge To $200,000 By Mid-2025 Amid ‘Mild’ Price Pullbacks: Report Recent market action aligns with Hayes’ December forecast, in which he warned of a potential “harrowing dump” in the cryptocurrency market around Trump’s inauguration. At the time, Hayes attributed this predicted sell-off to perceived regulatory disappointments from the incoming Trump administration. However, in his latest post, Hayes suggested that the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) plan to inject $612 billion of fresh liquidity into the economy could make up for the lack of regulatory progress and ignite new bullish momentum for BTC. The BitMex co-founder remarked: A letdown by team Trump on his proposed pro-crypto and pro-business legislation can be covered by an extremely positive dollar liquidity environment, an increase of up to $612 billion in the first quarter. Hayes explained that the Fed is expected to ramp up money printing after Trump’s inauguration, likely driving BTC and other digital assets to a local top before a subsequent pullback. He added that market disappointment over lagging crypto regulation under Trump’s administration would exacerbate the correction. The crypto entrepreneur advised selling towards the end of Q1 2025 and waiting for favorable liquidity conditions to return in Q3 2025. Once fresh liquidity enters the market, Hayes suggested it would be time for risk-seeking investors to “turn the risk dial to degen.” Opinion Split On BTC Price Action While Hayes anticipates a BTC rally later this quarter, other analysts and market commentators remain cautious. For instance, a recent report by 10x Research noted that the Fed’s delay in cutting interest rates could dampen BTC’s bullish momentum. Similarly, technical analysis suggests that BTC may be forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on the weekly chart, raising fears of a drawdown to as low as $80,000. Yesterday’s failure to decisively reclaim the $100,000 price level has further unsettled the bulls. On the other hand, the CEO of Bitcoin mining firm MARA recently advocated a long-term “invest and forget” strategy for BTC. He suggested that a US strategic Bitcoin reserve could spark a global race among nations to accumulate BTC, driving up its price. Institutional interest in BTC is already on the rise, as evident from record inflows received by US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF). At press time, BTC trades at $95,154, down 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

The flagship currency is down almost 3% over the past 24 hours, as the crypto market lost $320 billion. BTC’s drop comes despite spot Bitcoin ETFs defying bearish sentiment and registered inflows of around $52 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) showed resilience, dropping only around 1.50% despite registering a substantial drop on Tuesday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is trading around the $3,300 level. Ripple (XRP) was one of the few assets that defied the market’s bearish trajectory as it registered a marginal increase, buoyed by its partnership with Chainlink (LINK) . With the crypto markets in the doldrums, its market cap has dropped almost 2% to $3.32 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) Slump Could Set Stage For Rally Near Trump Inauguration Bitcoin (BTC) saw a substantial decline as it dropped below $95,000 after resilient US job figures sent risk assets spiraling. The US Labor Department’s JOLTS report showed around 8.1 million job vacancies, significantly more than the anticipated 7.74 million. The numbers led to a risk-off atmosphere in the markets and sent bond yield upwards and a decline in risk assets like BTC. According to QCP BTC’s decline stemmed from liquidations of around $206 million in an hour. The volatility also reached the traditional markets, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq witnessing significant volatility. The response of the traditional markets highlights BTC’s interconnectedness with the wider financial market, especially during economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have registered a 94% decline, falling from $987 million to $52.9 million. However, BlackRock’s IBIT remained the exception, registering $596 million in investments and bucking the trend of outflows witnessed across all ETFs. Meanwhile, Ark and 21Shares registered significant outflows, with over $210 million withdrawn from the ARKB Fund. QCP also highlighted the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision and the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, which could substantially impact BTC’s price. However, the firm also stated the recent decline could be temporary, and markets could see a substantial rally when Donald Trump takes office. “With market anticipation building, we believe bitcoin’s pullback is merely a pause, setting the stage for a bullish rally as Trump’s inauguration fuels optimism.” SEC Must Work On Crypto Regulation Gary Gensler, the outgoing chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) believes there is a lot of work to be done in regulating altcoins and intermediaries in the crypto market. Gensler stated that regular investors still don’t receive adequate disclosures or information from digital asset firms. Gensler’s SEC tenure has been marked by enforcement action against several crypto players ranging from fraudsters to significant crypto names like Coinbase and DRW Holdings. Gensler announced he would step down as SEC Chair on January 20, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Atkins is known for his pro-crypto views and is widely expected to tone down enforcement action against crypto firms and take a favorable view of the industry. Gensler pointed out that his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who led the agency during the first Trump administration, brought 80 crypto-related cases. The agency under Clayton cracked down on companies issuing tokens that were deemed securities. However, Gensler focused on market intermediaries flouting compliance with securities laws for registration and disclosure. Gensler also believes a majority of crypto projects will not survive. “I’ve never seen a field that’s so much wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) continued to slide as concerns about rising bond yields and the Federal Reserve monetary policy continued to mount. BTC went from a recent high of $102,668 to a low of $92,546 as macroeconomic factors turned against risk assets like BTC. The flagship currency plummeted over 5% on Tuesday and nearly 2% on Wednesday, slipping below key moving averages and support levels. If sellers continue to dominate, BTC could give up the gains since the beginning of January and drop to $90,000. BTC is down nearly 1% during the current session, hitting a low of $93,512. BTC was bullish as the new year started, registering an increase of just over 1% on Wednesday (January 1) and settling at $94,376. Bullish sentiment increased substantially on Thursday as BTC surged past the 50-day SMA to an intraday high of $97,661. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $96,882, registering an increase of 2.59%. BTC faced considerable volatility on Friday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, the price dropped to an intraday low of $95,604 and rose to an intraday high of $98,832 before settling above the 20-day SMA at $97,878. Sellers retained control over the weekend as BTC registered marginal increases on Saturday and Sunday to settle at $98,309.

The industry is hoping for a series of executive orders on his first day in office, January 20, to lay the foundation for a crypto-friendly future. Bitcoin touched the epic milestone after Donald Trump won the presidential elections and touched the ATH of $108,000 in December. Trump’s biggest plan to create the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve has been buzzing since he announced the plan during his campaign. Here’s an insider scoop on Trump’s larger-than-life plans to make the US a Bitcoin powerhouse. Key Industry Demands Industry insiders are pushing for Trump to create a national bitcoin stockpile, ensuring that the U.S. holds a strategic reserve of bitcoin according to the reports . This could be done through the Treasury Department, although some experts believe this may require Congressional approval. Plus, crypto firms are seeking easier access to banking services, as many have struggled with financial institutions reluctant to engage with them due to regulatory concerns. Crypto Council and Regulatory Overhaul Trump’s team is also considering the creation of a crypto industry council, which would help guide policy and provide a structured approach to the growing sector. Furthermore, the industry expects Trump to address the regulatory issues, pushing for a review of existing rules to ensure they are better suited to the unique needs of cryptocurrencies. While the Biden administration has been more cautious, with regulatory crackdowns on crypto companies, Trump has promised to reverse these policies. His crypto-friendly appointments, such as SEC Chair Paul Atkins and White House crypto czar David Sacks, signal a shift towards a more supportive environment for digital assets. Market Impact Bitcoin’s price surged to new highs, surpassing $107,000, after Trump announced his plans for a Bitcoin Reserve. While it has since dipped below $100,000, the promise of a national stockpile has sparked optimism in the market. Despite the bullish call, Bitcoin has reacted negatively to the recent events Fed’s hawkish comments, and the DOJ’s court approval to sell the seized Bitcoins. Following the news, Bitcoin drastically fell to the $94,471 level. Overall, the crypto insiders are highly charged as they expect Trump to go aggressive on his crypto plans while crypto OG like Arthur Hayes has given a warning of the severe market crash after Trump officially takes charge.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 09:16:29

What’s the message that this BTC-friendly is trying to give to the crypto community? El Salvador’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase Reports indicate that at least eleven Bitcoin tokens have been purchased by the Central American country of El Salvador recently. The purchase may have cost at least $1 million, as the BTC price remains at around $93,347.36 right now. Before the purchase, the country held at least 6,011 BTC tokens. The latest purchase has raised the country’s BTC reserve to nearly 6,022 Bitcoin tokens, worth approximately $572 million. Experts believe that the latest purchase reflects the pro-crypto country’s ongoing commitment to the BTC market. A Consistent Bitcoin Buying Strategy by El Salvador El Salvador has been consistently increasing its BTC reserve since February, 2024. On February 29, 2024, the country’s Bitcoin reserve stood at 2,381 BTC. On March 15, it grew steeply to 5,689.7 BTC. By the end of the year 2022, the country had at least 6,002 BTC tokens in its reserve. Currently, it holds around 6,022 BTC. El Salvador’s Agreement with IMF: Bitcoin’s Role El Salvador is in a struggling state economically. The country’s effort to secure a $1.4 billion loan from the IMF was aimed at stabilising its embattled economy. Reports indicate that the country has plans to approach the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and several regional development banks in search of financial assistance. Reports add that El Salvador targets to bring in at least $3.5 billion as assistance to boost its economy. Four Key Conditions of the IMF The IMF recently accepted the loan application of El Salvador, but put forth at least four conditions, capable of destabilising the country’s extraordinary crypto ambitions. Firstly, the organisation wants the country to make Bitcoin acceptance voluntary for the private sector. Secondly, it demands the closure of the Chivo wallet – the official Bitcoin and Dollar wallet of the El Salvdor government that allows users to make and reserve transitions in BTC free of charge. Thirdly, it stipulates the discontinuation of the provision that allows people to pay taxes in Bitcoin. Lastly, it calls for the reduction of the engagement of the country’s public sector in BTC-related activities. In conclusion, El Salvador’s continued Bitcoin purchases highlight its commitment to cryptocurrency despite external pressures. With its strategic reserves growing, the country’s economic approach remains a bold experiment on the global stage.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 09:18:51

With its proven utility and growing institutional adoption, it has established itself as a market leader. Recently, the price of XRP has reflected its strong position in the market. Now, a new cryptocurrency called Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a potential competitor. Some analysts have started to refer to it as “the next XRP.” Here’s why Remittix is being compared to Ripple and how it might even surpass XRP in the long run. Ripple’s Proven Track Record XRP provides faster and more cost-effective solutions than traditional payment systems. It has much transformative potential, as shown by its integration into Japan’s $6.37 trillion banking sector. Further adoption by just 1% could inch the XRP price up to $3.50, and 10% could push it to $13.48. The surge of the XRP price to $2.03 in late 2024 further highlights growing institutional interest. However, regulatory hurdles, including its ongoing SEC lawsuit, continue challenging its progress. It reminds investors of the complexities surrounding XRP price stability in a competitive market. What Sets Remittix Apart? Like XRP, Remittix focuses on cross-border payments, but it brings additional innovations that cater to the evolving demands of the blockchain ecosystem. Its proprietary PayFi protocol addresses inefficiencies in traditional systems, enabling near-instant transactions with minimal fees. This advantage makes it particularly appealing to small businesses and underbanked communities a market often overlooked by major financial players. Remittix takes a more inclusive approach. It bridges the gap between fiat and crypto and simplifies access to digital finance for everyday users. This democratization of cross-border payments positions RTX as a more versatile and socially impactful solution. Moreover, Remittix’s presale success speaks volumes. Raising over $2.16 million in its early stages, RTX has already captured investor attention. Comparing Potential: XRP vs. Remittix Both XRP and Remittix excel in offering real-world utility for cross-border payments. While XRP boasts an established network and institutional partnerships, Remittix’s PayFi protocol provides a more flexible and inclusive framework for global transactions. XRP’s dominance stems from its deep integration with financial systems. Remittix’s ability to cater to diverse markets, including small businesses and underserved communities, gives it a broader reach. This adaptability could allow RTX to capture a significant share of the $150 trillion global remittance market. The bull run has been a key driver for both projects. XRP’s institutional adoption and regulatory clarity will likely fuel its growth. Meanwhile, Remittix’s transparent roadmap, audited smart contracts, and innovative technology position it as a strong contender for thriving during this period of rapid market expansion. Why Analysts Are Calling New Crypto Remittix the Next XRP The comparison between XRP and Remittix goes beyond their shared focus on cross-border payments; it highlights their potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and provide real solutions.

Centralized exchanges proved key for market growth, getting a boost from professional and institutional traders. Binance crossed the milestone of 250M registered users during the 2024 bull market, based on data from its annual report . Centralized exchanges proved key for liquidity and producing fast price reactions, despite the growth of competing DEXs. On average, daily volumes on Binance grew by 27%, while margin trading volumes were up by 390% for all of 2024. Binance carried more than $160B in user assets under custody, while breaking above $100 trillion in all-time trades. At the end of the year, Binance actively traded 388 listed assets, with 412 coins and tokens available on Binance Earn. Users flocked to Binance at the first sign of an accelerating bull market. The last 50 million users were added in the second half of the year. The exchange attracted new registrations both as a source of Bitcoin (BTC) for long-term investors, and as a hub for the newest meme and AI agent tokens. The exchange pivoted quickly to offer access to some of the hottest markets, bringing a mix of spot and futures pairs. For new traders, Binance offered a mix of easy access and educational products. Volumes expanded for spot, futures and leveraged trading, with additional user engagement from products like Spot Copy Trading. Additional incentives were given with the BFUSD reward-bearing asset for margin trading. Institutional users accelerated adoption in 2024 Institutional growth marked the tidal shift in 2024, with Binance becoming one of the key hubs for professional investors. Binance’s VIP users increased by 116%, while institutional user registrations expanded by 97%. Binance has pointed out institutions may be the main drive behind the next wave of adoption. Large-scale investors have grown with access to Binance Wealth and curated banking partnerships, mixing traditional finance and Web3. After years of clashing with local regulators, Binance doubled down on its efforts in 2024. The Binance compliance team expanded to 650 experts, securing regulatory clearance in 21 jurisdictions. Binance is also a mandatory reporter, responding to over 65,000 requests. The exchange also trained over 1,300 investigators from 80 countries. It also keeps close track of potential exploits, and has survived most of 2024 without major incidents. Over the past year, the exchange’s security team claims to have prevented losses of up to $4.2B for 2.8M users. The exchange has also locked and returned $88M to victims of fraud and scams, where the funds were still reachable. Binance brand moved into fintech and payment products While trading was the main source of traffic and income, Binance also kept expanding its influence as a payment gateway. Binance Pay grew its user base by 226% for the past period. Fiat to crypto onboarding spread to 20 new countries, adding millions of potential users. The service offers more than 1,000 widely available payment methods in 125 fiat currencies. As a result, Binance’s P2P market grew by 28% in terms of trades between users. Binance’s P2P service replaced previous OTC peer networks, which virtually disappeared from the world of crypto. User retention was also high for Binance, with 60% of P2P users returning for subsequent transactions. Binance Earn increased its value locked by 144%, by offering passive earnings and fixed-rate loans. On-chain yields was a one-stop service to access DeFi protocols, allowing users to participate through their Binance accounts. Binance watches the Web3 landscape closely, picking the best-performing assets, with some risk warnings. The on-chain yields service arrived as late as December, and may be one of the drivers of growth in the new year. Binance has also deposited BTC into Babylon Labs, allowing users to make use of the yield through their Binance account. Binance’s brand still carries decentralized products, but the past year shifted attention to in-house production. The exchange took charge of building up its community through Binance Square, while also taking an active role in curating new assets with daily offers from Binance Alpha. Over the past year, Binance set out to change the world of crypto by offering a one-stop access to airdrops, pre-market trading, and other products to simplify the constant growth of new tokens and yield opportunities.

The Binance BTC/USDT heatmap reveals high-leverage zones, highlighting potential short squeezes and long liquidation risks. Bright clusters in the $95,000 to $100,000 range suggest high-volume liquidation sweeps due to sharp market moves. Bitcoin’s price is around the $95,000 zone as of January 9, 2025, with critical liquidity clusters forming between $94,000 and $100,000. The Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap shows several high-leverage zones where traders are at risk, offering a snapshot of the market’s current liquidity dynamics. The heatmap shows the price ranges to be between $80,000 and $120,000 , but most of the action will be in the $95,000 to $100,000 range.

Known as the Bitcoin Freedom Act, the proposed bill , filed on January 8, seeks to enable employees and vendors in Oklahoma to opt for Bitcoin as a payment option for salaries and transactions. Senator Deevers emphasized the importance of acting swiftly, adding, “As Bitcoin continues to rise and the value of the dollar continues to be printed away in Washington D.C., Oklahoma must act to protect our people.” The bill, designated as SB325, ensures participation is voluntary, aligning with free-market principles. It provides a framework for the secure use of Bitcoin by the state, private businesses, and individuals while designating the cryptocurrency as an acceptable medium for salaries, investments, and transactions. A Vision for Financial Freedom Senator Deevers’ support for Bitcoin reflects his broader vision of financial independence. Praising President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, Deevers declared, “Bitcoin has arrived into the mainstream of our economy and is unquestionably a significant part of the financial future.” He further argued that the legislation positions Oklahoma as a leader in embracing financial technology. Deevers also used the opportunity to criticize central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) , which he believes pose a threat to individual freedoms. “CBDCs give central authorities the power to track, control, and restrict individual transactions, undermining financial privacy and freedom,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on January 9. He described Bitcoin as a counterbalance, praising its decentralized nature, censorship resistance, and ability to promote financial sovereignty. This proposal comes amidst rising concerns over inflation in the U.S. , which currently stands at 2.7%, according to Trading Economics. Senator Deevers has been vocal about the impact of inflation on everyday Americans, blaming federal policies for devaluing the dollar. He highlighted his commitment to protecting the financial well-being of Oklahoma residents, calling Bitcoin a tool to offset the economic challenges caused by inflation. Growing Crypto Infrastructure in Oklahoma Oklahoma has already demonstrated a commitment to supporting cryptocurrency innovation. In May 2024, Governor Kevin Stitt signed into law a bill that established a legal framework for blockchain companies and safeguarded crypto mining operations. This legislation, which became effective in November, made it easier for Bitcoin miners to operate in the state . The Bitcoin Freedom Act will be considered in the 60th legislative session, set to begin on February 3. If approved, it could make Oklahoma a trailblazer in state-level Bitcoin adoption and further solidify its position as a hub for blockchain technology.

The selloff also caused market volatility and temporarily pushed Bitcoin’s price below $93,000. Additionally, on-chain data showed large BTC movements to exchanges at a loss, and over millions in leveraged long positions were liquidated. Some analysts now predict a potential drop to below $90,000 before a rally to $126,000. Meanwhile, Oklahoma Senator Dusty Deevers introduced the Bitcoin Freedom Act to enable Bitcoin payments. $6+ Billion in Bitcoin Sold by US Government The United States government executed a huge liquidation of 69,370 Bitcoin (BTC) that was seized from the Silk Road darknet marketplace. The move is valued at $6.7 billion. This decision was authorized by the US Department of Justice (DoJ), and was part of a resolution to the prolonged ownership dispute with Battle Born Investments. The DoJ pointed to Bitcoin’s notorious price volatility as a justification for approving the sale. Arkham Intelligence reported that the US government wallet, which held the Bitcoin, saw its balance drop to zero on Jan. 8. The timing of the selloff raised quite a few eyebrows as it happened just 10 days before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The move also contradicts the Trump administration’s consideration of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Battle Born Investments lost its claim to the assets through a bankruptcy estate, and criticized the decision as an abuse of the Civil Asset Forfeiture process. Its legal team also condemned the DoJ for alleged procedural maneuvering. Bitcoin’s price responded by dipping under $93,000 and raising investor concerns about a further correction below $90,000. At press time, The price of BTC recovered slightly to trade at $94,075. On-chain data also points to rising panic among short-term holders, and about 23,200 BTC was recently moved to exchanges at a loss. Funding rates in the derivative market have also declined, which signals waning confidence in Bitcoin’s immediate upward trajectory. Despite the selloff and price dip, some well known people in the cryptocurrency community are still optimistic. Robert Kiyosaki sees the decline as an opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices. Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, predicts a liquidity infusion of $612 billion in the first quarter of 2025, which he believes will propel Bitcoin to new heights. Adding to the bullish sentiment, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele hinted at increasing the country’s Bitcoin holdings. Historically, Bitcoin’s January performance after halving years has been riddled by heightened volatility, and 2025 appears to be no exception. Fed Policy Concerns Also Behind Bitcoin Correction Bitcoin’s recent price correction has also been attributed to growing concerns over the US Federal Reserve’s tightening monetary policy, which is a factor analysts believe could play a major role in shaping Bitcoin’s price action throughout 2025. This downturn in BTC’s price has been linked to strong US economic data suggesting potential interest rate hikes, which make cryptocurrencies less appealing as investments. Ryan Lee , chief analyst at Bitget Research, believes that signals of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve exacerbated the market corrections. BTC’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Expectations of a rate cut have been delayed, and the CME Group’s FedWatch tool indicates that the first lending rate cut may now occur on June 18. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting on Jan. 29. The market’s reaction to these developments has been very evident, with over $631 million in leveraged long positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data . Analysts suggest that this large-scale liquidation could lead to a consolidation phase as traders adjust their leveraged positions. Bitcoin’s price could potentially dip below $90,000 before embarking on a rally above $126,000, according to some market analysts. John Glover , chief investment officer at Ledn, believes that Bitcoin may require another correction to end the period of holiday illiquidity, possibly testing the $90,000 level again before moving higher. He sees this phase as part of the fourth wave in wave analysis, and predicted a rally to the $126,000–$128,000 range after this consolidation. To avoid further downside, Bitcoin needs to hold above the $91,000 support level, according to crypto analyst Rekt Capital . The analyst also pointed out that Bitcoin’s failure to maintain support at $101,165 pushed it back into a lower trading range. Oklahoma Senator Pushes Bitcoin Payment Legislation Some US states are also still optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential. Oklahoma State Senator Dusty Deevers introduced the Bitcoin Freedom Act , which is legislation that would allow employees, residents, and businesses in the state to opt for Bitcoin as a means of payment for salaries and transactions. The bill was filed as SB325 , and is designed to provide a framework for the secure use of Bitcoin while maintaining voluntary participation to uphold free-market principles. Deevers strongly believes in Bitcoin’s potential to combat inflation and preserve the purchasing power of Oklahomans due to its decentralized and censorship-resistant nature. One of the main goals of the legislation is to position Oklahoma as a national leader in adopting financial technology innovations. It also aligns with President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, which Deevers praised for bringing the cryptocurrency into the economic mainstream. The bill also highlights Bitcoin’s role as an alternative to inflationary fiat currencies, and Deevers criticized the Federal Reserve’s policies for eroding the value of the US dollar. He stated that the act will empower citizens with more financial options while encouraging a forward-looking approach to financial technology in the state. The proposed legislation is part of Deevers’ broader campaign to address the financial challenges that are faced by his constituents. He is especially concerned about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and warned that they could lead to government overreach and undermine financial privacy. On the other hand, Deevers believes that Bitcoin promotes financial sovereignty by allowing people to control their money free from government interference or inflationary manipulation. Inflation in the United States has been rising since September 2024, and reached 2.7% after peaking at over 9% during the pandemic. This economic backdrop backed up arguments for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. US inflation on the rise (Source: Trading Economics ) Oklahoma has already taken steps to embrace cryptocurrency and blockchain technology after Governor Kevin Stitt enacted legislation in May of 2024 that created a legal framework for blockchain firms and safeguarded crypto mining activities.

These outflows come as Bitcoin’s price dropped below the $100,000 level earlier this week and Ethereum continues to face downward pressure.

Stocks and crypto both marched to their own chaotic beat. “Almost all participants judged that upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased,” the minutes revealed. Officials pointed fingers at strong inflation reports and the potential ripple effects of changes in trade and immigration policies. In response, they hinted at slowing the pace of rate cuts. For traders hoping for relief, that was a major buzzkill. But did Wall Street care? Not really. The S&P 500 climbed 0.16%, the Dow Jones added 0.25%, and even the Nasdaq, dragged down by tough days for giants like Palantir and Bitcoin whale MicroStrategy, only dipped 0.06%. No big crashes, no panic selling. Investors have seen worse, and they acted like it. Wall Street shrugs off the Fed’s caution The 10-year Treasury yield hit a dizzying 4.73% during intraday trading, its highest since April. Normally, a number like that would send shockwaves through the market, but traders barely blinked. Why? Simple. They’ve already priced in the Fed’s pessimism. December’s dot plot—which forecasted just two measly quarter-point cuts in 2025—was the real blow. Yesterday’s news? Old hat. Christopher Waller, one of the Fed’s governors, stepped in to calm nerves. Speaking from Paris, he explained that recent inflation spikes were driven by “imputed” prices like housing services. Meanwhile, “observed” prices, which cover other goods and services, show signs of disinflation. Translation: it’s not as bad as it looks. Waller even said he’d back more rate cuts in 2025 if the economy holds up. While stocks took the news in stride, crypto had a rougher time. Bitcoin slid to $92,000 on Thursday after hitting $102,000 just a few days earlier. Still, crypto enthusiasts remain bullish, convinced that better regulations this year will boost prices and help companies like Coinbase, MicroStrategy, and Robinhood. Bitcoin’s volatility isn’t new, but it’s hard to ignore its momentum. It’s already up 3% this year after a standout 120% gain in 2024. Fed’s official statement is confusing In their statement, Fed officials claimed that the economy is growing “at a solid pace,” but noted the labor market is easing and unemployment has ticked up—though it’s still low overall. Inflation is inching closer to their 2% target but remains elevated, and they’re not taking their eyes off the risks. The central bank lowered its target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter-point last month, bringing it to 4.25%–4.5%. They promised to keep assessing incoming data and adjust policies if needed, all while sticking to their dual mandate: maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed also said it would continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, keeping the balance sheet tight. What could shake things up next? The U.S. jobs report for December, due Friday.

The platform claimed the said extensions have appeared in the Firefox plugin store and pose a great risk to users, especially crypto wallets and private information . OKX stressed that it has never issued any Firefox-related plugins. It called upon those users who downloaded such fake extensions to transfer their funds to safe wallets without any delay. The company contacted Firefox with a request to remove such malicious plugins and also asked its users to download official software only from verified sources. This incident is a sign of the increasing sophistication of phishing attacks, which are more and more using fake plugins and other devious means to take advantage of users. Phishing Scams Dominate Crypto Losses in 2024 Phishing scams continue to top the list of dangers facing cryptocurrency users. According to CertiK’s “Hack3d: The Web3 Security Report 2024,” phishing scams accounted for over $1 billion in losses last year, a 21% increase from 2023. Such attacks also tend to be based on social engineering, fake apps, or browser extensions to compromise sensitive information. When users log in with their wallets or input their private keys, attackers drain the funds. CertiK noted that such scams represented a significant portion of the cybersecurity incidents affecting Web3 in 2024. SpyAgent Malware Targets Android Users In September 2024, McAfee cybersecurity researchers discovered a new malware, SpyAgent, designed to target Android smartphones. It was embedded in over 280 fraudulent apps that used OCR to extract sensitive information, including private keys, from stored images. The SpyAgent spread through the links to text messages that skipped the security provided through Google Play Store. Many times, users were misled by prompts that appeared legitimate and ended up downloading apps. Android users should avoid installation of apps from unverified sources, said McAfee, and regularly update their device’s security settings. Decentraland Hack Promotes Fake Airdrop In September 2024, Decentraland-an Ethereum-based virtual reality metaverse-was breached, with hackers taking control of its X account. The hackers used the account to publish phishing links that advertised a non-existent MANA token airdrop. Victims who clicked the phishing links and connected their wallets said funds were stolen.

After the popularity of many Telegram-based mini-games airdrops, the eyes are now on the Zoo game and the launch of its native token. More importantly, the Zoo airdrop listing and the ZOO token’s price at launch. So, let’s see the answers to these questions. Zoo Airdrop Listing Date, Key Details & More Zoo token airdrop is a much-awaited event for the Telegram community, as the game has earned significant hype in the market. Although it is quite different from telegram-tap-to-earn games, it is also gaining popularity, where people build the zoo. However, the listing date has not been revealed yet, leaving the players excited about the possible revelation soon. The mining phase is also in progress, allowing the participant to earn ZOO tokens before the token generation event and the most-awaited crypto airdrops. The Zoo’s mining phase , which has been live since December, is active until January 31, 2025. Thus, participants had two months to earn the tokens. Interestingly, every in-game token earned is equivalent to the on-chain token, so the number of tokens gathered in this mining phase is the number of tokens players will receive in the airdrop. The Zoo airdrop listing announcement is pending, but one Binance report sees the launch around February. However, the game player must wait for the official announcement and be further updated on when users will receive their worth. What Will Be the ZOO Token Price At Launch? With limited information on the Zoo airdrop and token launch, concluding the ZOO token price at this early stage is difficult. Analysts anticipate that the price will be similar to most Telegram mini-games token prices. It is important to note that the token’s price could vary from expectations, as it depends on the token supply, crypto airdrop acquisitions, and much more. Game players should wait for further updates. Here’s What You Need To Remember The Zoo is gaining traction among Telegram users, as the game assigns the simple task of building the Zoo in return for in-game tokens. With the upcoming Zoo airdrop, the players will receive the same in-game token for the on-chain token in 1:1 criteria. For now, the team has kept the token generation event and the crypto airdrop listing date a secret, but further clarity can come after January with the ending of the game’s mining phase. The same is true with the ZOO token price and additional details. Interestingly, another anticipated token launch is due this year, and the PAWS airdrop will go live soon.

38717427,https://coingape.com/?p=232696,1736417365,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Crypto Market Falls By 3%, How Soon Will It Recover?",https://coingape.com/crypto-market-falls-by-3-how-soon-will-it-recover/,"The crypto market has witnessed gloomy trading this week with a slump of around 3% today, while Bitcoin and top altcoins witnessed a significant retreat. This recent slump indicates that the investors are staying on the sideline due to the absence of any significant catalyst that could boost their sentiments. However, despite that, many experts said that these pullbacks are very likely during the bull run of the assets. Why Is the Crypto Market Falling Today? Despite the recent crypto market retreat, a flurry of experts deem it as a buying opportunity. It also reflects the long-term confidence of the traders towards the sector, especially with the shifting focus of the global investors towards the digital assets space. So, let’s explore the potential reasons behind the recent dip and see how soon can the market witness a recovery. US Fed’s FOMC Minutes Fuels Concern The latest US Fed’s FOMC minutes from the December meeting appear to have weighed on the financial market sentiment, let alone the crypto space. Notably, the latest FOMC indicated that the US Federal Reserve would be moving more slowly on interest rate cuts through this year due to uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s policies. The FOMC minutes revealed concerns about inflation and the potential impact of Trump’s policies on the US economy. Although the minutes have no mention of Trump, it signaled that the central bank would move cautiously with their rate cut plans ahead. As a result, the Fed reduced its outlook for expected cuts in 2025 to two from four, assuming quarter-point increments. This cautious approach has sparked concerns among investors, further adding to the recent market crash . Notably, the market also witnessed a selloff last month, when Fed Chair Jerome Powell also hinted towards a similar move. Robust US Jobs Data The recent US Jobs data by the Labor Department showed that the job market remained strong, cementing bets towards a potential hawkish move by the Fed ahead. The JOLTS job openings came in at 8.1 million through the last day of November 2024. A strong labor market would provide more space for the US central bank to move with tightened monetary policy plans ahead. Besides, the ISM Services PMI also showed that the US economy remained strong, indicating that the economy remained resilient despite the high interest rates set by the central bank. This move has also dampened the sentiment of the global financial market sentiment, potentially contributing to the recent dip in the crypto market. US Govt’s BTC Dump In Focus Apart from the macroeconomic woes, the recent BTC dump by the US government has further intensified the selling pressure in the market. For context, the US govt has recently dumped 69,370 BTC worth $6.7 billion from the Silk Road marketplace, which has weighed on the traders’ sentiment. The timing of the event is also important. The DOJ gave the green light for this move just ahead of Donald Trump is about to be sworn in as the President. Besides, the Trump administration also pledged to move towards a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve plan, which has fueled a massive rally in the market previously. Having said that, this recent move appears to have further dampened the investors’ sentiment today. However, experts like CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju refuted claims over the massive impact of the US Govt dump on the BTC price. In a recent X post, he highlighted last year’s $379 billion entering the market, which is around $1 billion per day. Having said that, he urged investors not to panic as the $6.5 billion dump “could be absorbed in just a week.” A recent CoinGape report also discussed that why Bitcoin price slipped recently after hitting the brief $102K level. Crypto Market Slips The global crypto market fell 2.67% during writing to $3.28 trillion, with the overall trading volume falling 12% to $162.27 billion. Besides, BTC price fell more than 2.3% and slipped below the $94K level, while Ethereum price was down 1.2% to $3,318. Other altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano also fell between 3% and 7%, reflecting the heavy selling pressure in the market. Simultaneously, the broader crypto market faces liquidation of around $483.73 million in the last 24 hours. Crypto Market Recovery Soon? The recent crypto market performance has forced many investors to stay on the sidelines. However, despite that, experts like Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki remained bullish on the long-term trajectory of the market, especially Bitcoin. The author said that the recent dip would provide a buying opportunity to investors at a lower price, indicating his optimistic outlook on crypto. Echoing a similar sentiment, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele also hinted towards BTC accumulation during this retreat. Having said that, it appears that the market will soon make a strong recovery with Bitcoin leading. Notably, Bitcoin has strong dominance over the broader digital assets and the top altcoins usually follow BTC’s path. Considering that, a Bitcoin recovery might bolster the broader market sentiment. Besides, the upcoming Donald Trump inauguration could also act as a major catalyst to boost investors’ confidence. Trump has actively voiced his support for the digital assets space. Besides, he also pledged to make the US the crypto capital, while hinting towards creating a BTC Strategic Reserve in the US. Considering that, the market may witness a strong recovery with Trump’s inauguration in focus.

Crypto Industry Lobbies Amid Selloff News,https://coingape.com/us-bitcoin-reserve-in-q1-2025-crypto-industry-lobbies-amid-selloff-news/,"The crypto industry has already started lobbying behind President-elect Donald Trump to approve a US Bitcoin reserve as soon as he takes office on January 20. As per the previous reports, Trump is willing to issue several executive orders starting from the first day, and the crypto industry leaders are pursuing key crypto orders as well. US Bitcoin Reserve Approval Soon Under Donald Trump? On the heels of Donald Trump’s inauguration, the crypto industry is urging the new administration to deliver on campaign promises to establish a pro-crypto regulatory environment. The industry is already having high hopes from Trump who pledged to be a “crypto President”. Sources familiar with the matter stated that the key promises include a federally-backed US Bitcoin reserve, ensuring crypto companies have access to banking services, and forming a dedicated crypto council, reported Reuters . Insiders say the industry is pressing for these executive orders to be issued within Trump’s first 100 days in office, with expectations that at least one directive could be announced as early as January 20. Analysts remain curious as to whether the President-elect will use executive orders, through the Treasury Department, to establish a federal Bitcoin reserve or if such a move would require Congressional approval. Bitcoin Policy Institute Submits Draft Proposal Crypto industry advocacy group the Bitcoin Policy Institute has submitted a draft proposal explaining how the reserve could be created. The draft talks of building a strategic Bitcoin reserve asset and mandates the Treasury Secretary to allocate $21 billion over a year to build a national Bitcoin stockpile. Zack Shapiro, head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, emphasized the importance of the United States taking the lead in monetizing Bitcoin even before its geopolitical rivals. “The U.S. should act now, rather than risk the price skyrocketing without holding any reserves,” he added. Other countries like Bitcoin-friendly Bhutan , Hong Kong, Germany, and Czech Republic are already working in that direction. The current Biden administration is acting completely opposite. Reports of the US government selling Bitcoins worth $6.7 billion, obtained through the Silk Road route, have gained traction recently leaving negative market sentiment. What to Expect With Crypto Policy Changes? Earlier in July, Donald Trump said that he would end Operation Choke Point unleashed by traditional banks on crypto firms. An executive order instructing bank regulators to adopt a more lenient approach toward crypto could signal the administration’s stance and offer political cover to agency officials. However, some executives cautioned that it would likely lack legal authority, as federal bank regulators operate independently. Jonah Crane, partner at financial firm Klaros Group said: “(They) are not going to change policy on the ground on day one. But they will tell you what direction this administration wants to head.” However, Trump transition team head Brian Hughes said that they are working actively to address concerns of the crypto industry. “There has been an effort in the Washington bureaucratic swamp to stifle innovation… but President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto,” he said.

This marked the second-largest daily outflow in the history of Bitcoin ETFs, narrowly trailing the $671.9 million outflow recorded on December 19 , according to Farside data . The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund bore the brunt of the day’s withdrawals, accounting for 45% of the net outflow. With $258.7 million pulled from the fund, this was its highest single-day withdrawal to date. Market Sentiment Bitcoin’s price temporarily fell to $92,500, driven by concerns over potential interest rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve in response to strong economic data. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, pointed to tightening monetary policies as a primary factor behind Bitcoin’s recent dip. Despite these challenges, the overall market sentiment has held steady. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which gauges sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, dropped to a “Greed” score of 69—down from the “Extreme Greed” score of 78 seen a month earlier. Bitcoin was trading at $93,200 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. An Uncertain Start to 2025 The new year has presented a mixed picture for Bitcoin traders. In a January 9 post on X, prominent trader Daan Crypto Trades described the asset’s performance as a “pretty undecisive start of the year.” While Bitcoin reached a local high of $102,500 earlier this month, it hit a new monthly low on January 8, reflecting the choppy nature of early-year trading. Daan added that seasonal volatility often obscures broader trends, making it premature to draw definitive conclusions. Despite the setbacks, market participants remain cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory . While ETF outflows and price fluctuations dominate headlines, analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency’s resilience in sentiment underscores its potential for recovery in the months ahead.

One Ethereum whale is at risk of collapse as it faces $5M liquidation for the third time. To some extent, this is standard in the crypto industry, but let’s discuss what went wrong and its further risks. Ethereum Whale Loses $18.5M In Liquidations A crypto whale lost $18.5M after facing constant liquidations, per a Lookonchain X post . The onchain analytics platform states that the whale suffered a massive loss today, as 1,495 ETH, equivalent to $4.97M, was liquidated. This incident makes it the crypto trader’s third liquidation incident in a month. Before this ETH news, the whale’s 44.86 WBTC, equivalent to $4.37 million, was liquidated on December 10, 202,4. Another 95.46 WBTC ($9.25 million) faced liquidation on December 6, 2024. Crypto whales bet on the performance of cryptocurrencies, whether they will move higher or lower. However, not all bets exceed expectations, and many suffer losses. One whale lost $20M in liquidation on Sui’s position when the price declined below the threshold. This incident raises questions about this ETH whale’s risk leverage strategies and whether it faces any other liquidation risks. Future Liquidation Concerns & Risks The Lookonchain ETH news noted that the Ethereum whale holds another position on the Aave protocol. As whales hold 541.68 WBTC, equivalent to $51.1 million, they are also at risk of liquidation. Surprisingly, Bitcoin is the driving force here. If the BTC price drops to $90,810, just 2.5% below its current price of $93.2K, $51.1M will be liquidated. This can negatively affect the ETH whale, especially as Bitcoin is on a downtrend today, losing 3% in the last 24 hours due to the crypto market crash. What’s Next? An Ethereum whale lost a massive amount of funds, with millions worth of cryptos getting liquidated. Lookonchain’s calculation brings the total loss to $18.5M. This happened in three liquidation events in just one month, showing crypto traders’ constant wrong judgments. Another $51.1M worth of WBTC is still at risk of getting liquidated, which will happen if the Bitcoin price drops 2.4% from the current level to $90,810. In contrast, the rise in Bitcoin price could limit the risk to the crypto trader.

Image generators are historically inaccurate, and the bodies of the characters in AI videos are indistinguishable. Is it proper to assert that organizations are still unaware of the potential of AI? That is the overall impression of this year’s CES – a showcase of AI-powered kitchen appliances, infant cribs, and other products that do not really need AI. This is an unexpected development, as AI companies in the United States alone raised $97 billion last year, which is sufficient to build 42 Spheres, what some have called a “wonder of the new world.” Underwhelming AI-powered products at CES 2025 For status, CES introduced Spicerr. It is an “intelligent” touchscreen spice dispenser that learns your preferences as you cook and recommends unique recipes. Spicerr’s usefulness is quite doubtful, to say the least. Spicerr does not grind, and it requires 15-$20 patented capsules that cannot be replenished. Apart from that, were folks looking for a salt and pepper shaker that suggested meals in the first place? Dreo’s ChefMaker 2, an AI-powered air fryer, also makes this list. In theory, it makes more sense than Spicerr. ChefMaker 2 can extract recipes from cookbooks using a page-scanning feature. It can also handle the difficult math of calculating cooking times and temperatures. But is cookbook scanning a feature that the air fryer-buying public requested? Who did it occur to that they needed to calculate cooking times? Razer’s Project Ava, as the company defines it, is an “AI gaming copilot” who was inexplicably named after the killer computer in the 2014 film “Ex Machina.” Ava essentially beats games for you without actually playing them. Ava obtains still images of your computer screen with your consent and then provides instructions. However, according to Sean Hollister of The Verge, Ava is controversial. This is because it was trained on gaming manuals, yet it fails to acknowledge the authors. It is also a source of distraction. In its present state, Ava operates with a delay of several seconds and disrupts the game’s audio to provide instructions. CES 2025 still delivered some AI highlights CES 2025 still featured mindblowing projects that could be of great use to the global community. For instance, the creative tool displayed at CES 2025 piqued the interest of content creators and designers interested in AI. In a matter of minutes, it is capable of producing text and images of exceptional quality. It applies intelligent algorithms to produce personalized and engaging content by monitoring trends and user preferences. This instrument facilitates the development of marketing strategies and the composition of captivating narratives. The instrument is uncomplicated for both novices and professionals, which results in the acceleration and enjoyment of creative endeavors. The most revolutionary healthcare technology came in the form of AI-powered medical assistants. These assistants are capable of providing real-time diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and health monitoring. They facilitate the comprehension of intricate medical information by engaging in conversations with users and applying advanced natural language processing. An AI-based learning companion was also introduced. The device offers customized tutoring to accommodate each student’s learning pace and method. The interactive elements consist of quizzes, games, and immediate feedback to enhance the learning experience and make it enjoyable. Finally, an AI delivery drone that could deliver the last mile accurately and efficiently. It had real-time mapping to see obstacles and changing weather conditions.

This decline is mostly because of the ongoing altcoin retreat and the few mainnet launch delays by the developers. Based on their past statements, the Pi coin mainnet launch will likely be delayed again, which may affect its performance. Will PI Network Delay The Mainnet Launch Again? The Pi Network price surged to nearly $100 in October as the countdown to the first grace period continued. It then crashed to $47 and bounced back to $91 as this deadline neared. These gains were short-lived as the developers postponed the grace period again to December. The same trend continued, and in December, they extended the verification period again to January 31st of this year. In the statement, they noted that their goal was to launch the mainnet in the first quarter of this year. They argued that more time was needed to ensure that at least 10 million pioneers moved their tokens to the mainnet. However, there is a risk that the mainnet launch may be delayed again as the developers have done repeatedly in the past few years. In the announcement below , the developers said that the open network can – not will – launch as soon as possible in Q1. Including the phrase can introduces uncertainty about the launch. Pi Network Announcement Pi Network’s developers have a lot to do ahead of the mainnet launch. They needs to verify millions of users, who will then migrate their tokens to the mainnet and create partnerships with tier-1 exchanges. According to the pre-mainnet requirements, the network needs to have at least 100 mainnet-ready apps in its platform before the launch. There are now about 80 of these apps, meaning that they need at least 20 before the mainnet happens. Pi Network Analysis: Path To $100 Remains Elusive Crypto analysts have been optimistic that the Pi coin price will get to $100 as the mainnet launch approaches. However, these hopes have not materialized, and the token has continued to consolidate below $50 in the past few weeks. This consolidation has happened slightly below the 50-day moving average and above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest levels since September this year. This trendline has created an important support level as the coin has failed to drop below it. The other risk is that the Pi coin has formed a pattern resembling a head-and-shoulders pattern, a popular bearish sign. Therefore, another mainnet approval delay would likely lead to a bearish breakdown, possibly to support at $43.10, its lowest shadow on December 20. Pi Network Price Chart Conversely, odds of approval would likely push the Pi Network price much higher, initially to $68.80, the right shoulder, then $100. Such a price action would mean that the ongoing consolidation is part of accumulation.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Saw Notable Plunges During Past Day The last 24 hours have been red for digital assets, with a bulk of the market observing a drawdown of more than 5%. Bitcoin has been no exception, as its price has slipped under the $95,000 level. It was only a couple of days back that the asset had shown a sharp recovery above the $102,000 mark. The steep crash since then would suggest the investors didn’t believe the rally would have legs, so they decided to take their profits while they could. Related Reading: Less Than 1% Of Bitcoin Investors In Loss After BTC Reclaims $100,000 Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has had it even worse than Bitcoin, with its price coming down to $3,350 after a drop of almost 8% during the past day. With its plunge, Ethereum has basically retraced all the bullish momentum that had come with this new year of 2025. Bitcoin still retains some of its gains, but if the current trajectory continues, it wouldn’t be long before it meets the same fate as well. With all the carnage that the digital asset sector has seen, it would be expected that the derivatives side of the market would likewise have gone through some chaos. Crypto Longs Have Just Taken A Massive Beating According to data from CoinGlass, a mass amount of liquidations have piled up on derivatives exchanges during the past day. “Liquidation” refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after it has amassed losses of a certain degree (the exact percentage of which may differ between platforms). Below is a table that breaks down the relevant numbers related to the latest cryptocurrency liquidations. As is visible, a total of $689 million in contracts have been flushed in the last 24 hours. Out of these, over $609 million of the positions involved were long ones. This means an overwhelming 88% of the liquidations affected the traders betting on a bullish outcome for the market. Given the crash that the cryptocurrency sector has gone through during this window, it’s not exactly a surprise to see this disparity between long and short liquidations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signal That Took Price From $69,000 To $108,000 Appears Again In terms of the contributions to the squeeze by the individual symbols, Bitcoin has interestingly not topped the charts this time around. Instead, Ethereum has been king with almost $152 million in liquidations. The fact that Ethereum’s drawdown has been more significant than Bitcoin’s has part to play in this, but it may not be the full story. It’s possible that the trend is an indication that the speculative interest around ETH has been particularly pronounced recently.

In the Ethereum network, Gas is used to pay for transaction fees. Gas prices are typically denominated in Gwei. Let’s take a closer look at what Gwei is and how it impacts your Ethereum ( ETH ) transactions. Table of Contents What is Gwei? Gwei explained Gwei and its role in transaction speed and cost How to calculate gas fees in Gwei? Factors that influence Gwei prices The future of Gwei and Ethereum gas fees What is Gwei? Gwei explained What does Gwei mean in crypto? It’s essentially the “spare change” of Ethereum, representing one billionth of an ETH (0.000000001 ETH). Gwei is widely used for Ethereum transaction fees because those costs are typically tiny fractions of ETH. Instead of wrestling with a long string of zeros, fees are expressed in Gwei for simplicity and clarity. You might also like: What is Ethereum? A comprehensive guide For instance, a transaction fee of 0.000021 ETH is easily understood as 21 Gwei. This shorthand not only simplifies calculations but also helps users quickly assess costs, making it easier to navigate Ethereum’s bustling and dynamic ecosystem. By standardizing fee expression in Gwei, the network ensures that even those new to crypto can engage with Ethereum transactions confidently and efficiently. Gwei and its role in transaction speed and cost On the Ethereum network, Gwei is more than just a unit of currency — it’s your ticket to faster transactions. When you set your transaction fee in Gwei, you’re telling miners how much you’re willing to pay for priority. Higher fees get quicker confirmations, especially during busy periods when demand skyrockets. This system ensures that everyone can find a balance between speed and cost. Whether you’re in a rush or just trying to save, Gwei gives you the flexibility to tailor transaction fees to your needs, making the blockchain experience smoother and more user-friendly. It’s a simple yet powerful way to manage transactions effectively. How to calculate gas fees in Gwei? In simple terms, to know how much you’ll pay, you just multiply the gas needed for the transaction by both the base fee and the priority fee. The formula looks like this: Total fee (Gas fee) = Gas used * (Base fee + Priority fee) Gas used is the amount of processing power needed to complete an Ethereum transaction. Basic operations, such as sending ETH, use minimal gas, while actions involving smart contracts use more, since they require additional data and execution steps. The base fee on Ethereum is automatically set by the network and can fluctuate depending on the level of activity at any given time. This fee is essential for keeping everything running smoothly and ensuring fair access for all users. It’s a fixed cost that every user must pay, regardless of how quickly they need their transaction completed. On the flip side, the priority fee is like a tip you give to miners or validators to get your transaction bumped up in line. The higher your tip, the quicker your transaction will be confirmed. Factors that influence Gwei prices Gwei price fluctuates based on the activity level on Ethereum. Think of it like this: when a lot of people are trying to send their transactions at the same time, it’s going to cost more. The base fee system adjusts Gwei price accordingly, but big events, like network updates or the release of new DeFi projects, can make it spike. Gwei price, in short, is a reflection of how much traffic the Ethereum network is dealing with. Gwei ensures that your transaction isn’t lost in the crowd during peak times. Knowing how it works can help you better manage costs and make informed decisions when sending ETH or using decentralized services. The future of Gwei and Ethereum gas fees The future of Gwei and Ethereum gas fees is promising, thanks to ongoing network upgrades and innovations. With the successful transition to Ethereum 2.0, which introduces PoS, gas fees have become more predictable and efficient. As Ethereum’s scalability improves with sharding and rollups, the cost of gas fees is set to decrease, making transactions more affordable. Even though gas fees will remain a key part of the network, the continuous enhancements to Ethereum’s infrastructure mean that transactions will be faster, cheaper, and more accessible for everyone in the future.

Now, as whispers of a 2025 altseason grow louder, many investors expect a similar boom. However, the crypto market has matured, and holding onto this belief may lead to disappointment. Let’s explore why selective altcoin growth is the defining feature of this cycle and how investors can adapt to the evolving market landscape. How 2025 Differs from 2021’s Altseason Market Saturation 2021: The altcoin market was relatively small, with fewer tokens competing for attention. 2025: Thousands of new tokens and aggressive marketing campaigns have flooded the space, diluting the market. Selective Gains vs. Universal Rallies While some altcoins recently delivered 10x-50x returns , not all tokens are performing. The total altcoin market cap (TOTAL2) has doubled since November 2024, but many coins remain stagnant. Evolved Market Dynamics Institutional Players: Increased institutional involvement adds complexity and changes the market’s behavior. Informed Investors: Retail investors are more educated, reducing the speculative frenzy seen in 2021. Current Altcoin Market Conditions Selective Growth in TOTAL2 The TOTAL2 market cap has increased by $800 billion since November, signaling strong inflows. However, if your altcoins haven’t gained despite this rally, it may indicate poor fundamentals or lack of demand. High Token Volume The overwhelming number of tokens ensures that many will underperform, with only select projects standing out. End-of-Cycle Dynamics The current market phase aligns with the end of a cycle , where only a few altcoins thrive while others stagnate. Adjusting Your Strategy for Altseason 2025 Focus on Quality Projects Prioritize altcoins with: Strong fundamentals Real-world utility Active development teams Set Realistic Expectations Don’t expect universal rallies; instead, focus on identifying winners within the noise. Monitor Market Signals Use metrics like TOTAL2 market cap and individual token performance to guide your investments. Avoid Over-Speculation Stick to altcoins with clear use cases and avoid chasing hype-driven projects without substance. Key Insights for Altseason 2025 Selective Success: Only a fraction of altcoins will deliver significant returns. Market Maturity: The crypto market’s evolution means nostalgia for 2021-style booms is misplaced. Opportunities Still Exist: While the environment is competitive, savvy investors can still capitalize on emerging trends. FAQs on Altseason 2025 What is altseason? Altseason refers to a market phase where altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) significantly outperform Bitcoin. Is 2025’s altseason different from 2021? Yes, the market is more saturated, and selective growth has replaced the broad-based rallies of 2021. Why haven’t my altcoins pumped? Poor fundamentals, lack of demand, or market dilution could explain why some tokens remain stagnant despite inflows. How should I invest during this altseason? Focus on altcoins with real-world use cases, strong fundamentals, and active development teams. Avoid speculative projects. Will there be another universal altcoin boom? Given the market’s saturation, a universal boom is unlikely. The 2025 altseason will likely feature selective growth. Conclusion: Redefining Altseason Expectations The 2025 altseason is shaping up to be vastly different from its 2021 predecessor. With the market now saturated and maturing, the idea of a universal altcoin rally is increasingly unrealistic. Instead, selective altcoin growth defines this phase, offering opportunities for those who adapt their strategies.

Cardano expands globally, Solana scales for growth, and Remittix transforms cross-border payments with an 800% presale surge predicted. Table of Contents Solana latest news: Scaling to new heights Cardano updates: Reaching into global markets Remittix takes center stage in cross-border payment space As the cryptocurrency market accelerates into 2025, Cardano (ADA) is broadening its reach into global markets. In contrast, recent news about Solana highlights significant scalability improvements and a surge in developer activity. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention with its cross-border payment platform and is currently attracting considerable interest from investors during its presale. So, how will these projects perform in the upcoming quarter? Solana latest news: Scaling to new heights Solana saw considerable fluctuations in 2024 but entered 2025 on a high note, recovering 4% of its losses from the previous month. The latest Solana news shows that SOL has been relentlessly working on scalability and transaction processing power for the network. Solana’s release of the alternative validator client, Firedancer, in 2024 conveyed the seriousness of this goal, and SOL can now handle over 65,000 transactions per second. For Solana, the latest news includes a steady stream of NFT-focused projects that have been choosing Solana as a hosting blockchain. This occurs more frequently as Solana’s developer-friendly infrastructure grows in appeal among new startups. Solana jumped more than 100% in 2024, and some believe it could rise to new heights in 2025 based on its scalability improvements and a healthy overall trend in the market. Cardano updates: Reaching into global markets Cardano (ADA) had a poor end to 2024 and has dropped 16.7% over the last 30 days, with a 10% dip in the last week alone. Despite broader market expansion, this came off the back of slow growth for Cardano throughout the year, with only an 84% gain in the last 12 months. Despite these concerning price movements, Cardano is still a favorite for its meticulous, research-driven approach. Cardano updates in the latter half of 2024 have focused on entering underserved markets, particularly in Africa, and promoting access to finance solutions among underbanked populations. Regarding the most recent Cardano updates, it is currently trading at $0.96 with a staggering $2 billion 24-hour trading volume.

For nearly a decade, Zhong evaded authorities, hiding his fortune in unconventional ways—including a Cheetos popcorn tin . But in 2021, he made one critical mistake that ultimately led to his capture. The Silk Road Bitcoin Heist: How It Happened The Silk Road Loophole In 2012, Zhong discovered a vulnerability in the Silk Road’s payment system. By rapidly initiating multiple withdrawal requests, he was able to drain a staggering 51,860 BTC from his account without depositing a corresponding amount. Immediate Disappearance After executing the heist, Zhong disappeared, leaving authorities with no leads. The decentralized and anonymous nature of Bitcoin at the time made tracking the stolen funds virtually impossible. How Jimmy Zhong Hid $3.3 Billion Unconventional Storage Methods Zhong went to great lengths to hide his stolen Bitcoin. Among his hiding spots: A Cheetos popcorn tin , which concealed a hard drive storing private keys. Underground safes and various stashes across multiple locations. Bitcoin Splitting To further obfuscate his tracks, Zhong split the Bitcoin into smaller amounts and moved them across hundreds of wallets, making it nearly impossible to trace the funds. The Mistake That Brought Him Down In 2021, Zhong made an error that unraveled nearly a decade of careful evasion: Converting Bitcoin to Cash Amid Bitcoin’s surging value, Zhong decided to liquidate a portion of his holdings. He transferred Bitcoin to an exchange to convert it into fiat currency. Authorities Take Notice The transaction flagged law enforcement, as modern blockchain analysis tools could link the movement of funds back to the original Silk Road theft. The Raid Following this lead, federal agents raided Zhong’s residence in Georgia. There, they discovered the hidden stash of Bitcoin, including the infamous Cheetos popcorn tin holding the hard drive with the private keys. Key Takeaways from the Jimmy Zhong Case Blockchain Transparency While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, the blockchain is fully transparent. Modern forensic tools can track illicit activity years after it occurs. Physical Security Measures Zhong’s reliance on physical storage methods like hard drives and hidden safes highlights the importance of securing digital assets in unconventional ways—but these methods are not foolproof. Greed and Mistakes Zhong’s downfall demonstrates that greed and impatience can undo even the most carefully planned crimes. His decision to cash out was his undoing. FAQs Who is Jimmy Zhong? Jimmy Zhong is a hacker who exploited a vulnerability on the Silk Road marketplace in 2012, stealing 51,860 Bitcoin worth $3.3 billion today. How did Zhong steal Bitcoin from the Silk Road? He used a withdrawal exploit on the platform, initiating multiple requests to drain funds without depositing anything in return. How did he evade capture for 9 years? Zhong split the stolen Bitcoin into numerous wallets and hid physical storage devices in unconventional locations, including a Cheetos popcorn tin. What led to Zhong’s arrest? In 2021, Zhong attempted to cash out a portion of his Bitcoin, triggering suspicion and leading to a federal investigation. What happened to the stolen Bitcoin?

Grayscale’s ETHE : Reported outflows of $3.4 million , adding to the overall decline. Data for BlackRock’s ETHA was unavailable, and the remaining ETFs saw no significant inflows or outflows on the day. Possible Reasons Behind the Outflows Profit-Taking Strategies With Ethereum’s price exhibiting notable gains recently, some investors in U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs may have opted to lock in profits, leading to large-scale withdrawals. Institutional Rebalancing The start of a new fiscal year often prompts institutional investors to adjust their portfolios, which may explain the substantial outflows. Market Concerns Broader market uncertainties, such as regulatory developments or economic pressures, could have influenced cautious investor behavior. Impact on the Ethereum Market Large outflows from U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs may not directly affect Ethereum’s price but can influence institutional and retail sentiment. As ETFs are often a gateway for broader investment in cryptocurrencies, such withdrawals could signify short-term hesitation among investors. Historical Context: Second-Largest Weekly Outflow The $159.4 million net outflows on January 8 represent the second-largest weekly outflow on record for U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs . This highlights the magnitude of the withdrawals and underscores the need for ongoing analysis of investor behavior. FAQs What are U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs? U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the real-time price of Ethereum, offering investors exposure to the asset without direct ownership. Why did U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs see outflows on January 8? The outflows could be attributed to profit-taking, institutional rebalancing, or market uncertainties surrounding Ethereum and cryptocurrencies in general. Which ETF recorded the largest outflows? Fidelity’s FETH reported the largest outflow, with $147.7 million withdrawn on January 8. Are outflows from U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs a bearish signal? Not necessarily.

This marks a significant continuation of the dollar’s upward trajectory, driven by economic and monetary policy factors. The strengthening of the dollar has broad implications for global financial markets, influencing everything from commodity prices to emerging market economies. What Is the Dollar Index? The Dollar Index (DXY) measures the performance of the U.S. dollar relative to six major world currencies: Euro (EUR): Accounts for approximately 57.6% of the index. Japanese Yen (JPY): Contributes about 13.6%. British Pound (GBP): Makes up 11.9%. Canadian Dollar (CAD): 9.1%. Swedish Krona (SEK): 4.2%. Swiss Franc (CHF): 3.6%. An increase in the DXY indicates a strengthening dollar, while a decline signals a weakening dollar. Key Drivers Behind the Dollar Index Surge Hawkish Monetary Policy The Federal Reserve’s commitment to controlling inflation through higher interest rates has boosted the appeal of the U.S. dollar as a safe-haven asset. Global Economic Uncertainty Ongoing geopolitical tensions and recession fears in other economies have heightened demand for the dollar, which is viewed as a global reserve currency. Weakness in Rival Currencies Euro: The Eurozone faces economic stagnation and energy crises, limiting the euro’s strength. Yen: Japan’s continued accommodative monetary policy contrasts sharply with the Fed’s tightening stance. Impact of the Rising Dollar Index Commodities Under Pressure The strengthening dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities like gold and oil more expensive for holders of other currencies, often leading to price declines. Emerging Markets Vulnerable A stronger dollar increases the burden of dollar-denominated debt in emerging markets, potentially slowing economic growth. International Trade Imbalances A rising dollar can make U.S. exports less competitive, impacting trade balances and corporate earnings for multinational companies. Market Implications Forex Markets Euro/USD: Likely to remain under pressure as the dollar strengthens. USD/JPY: Could see further gains if the Bank of Japan maintains its dovish stance. Equities U.S. equities, particularly export-oriented sectors, may face headwinds as a stronger dollar erodes overseas revenue. Cryptocurrency Market A rising dollar often correlates with bearish trends in cryptocurrencies as investors flock to traditional safe-haven assets. Outlook for the Dollar Index Short-Term The DXY could continue its upward trajectory if the Federal Reserve maintains its hawkish stance and rival economies struggle with stagnation. Long-Term The dollar’s strength may face resistance if global economic conditions stabilize or if the Fed signals a pause in rate hikes. FAQs What is the current level of the Dollar Index? The Dollar Index is currently at 109.18 points , reflecting continued strength. Why is the Dollar Index rising? Key factors include hawkish Fed policies, global economic uncertainty, and relative weakness in rival currencies like the euro and yen. How does a strong dollar impact emerging markets? A strong dollar increases the cost of dollar-denominated debt for emerging markets, potentially slowing their economic growth. What does a rising DXY mean for commodities? A higher DXY typically puts downward pressure on commodity prices as they become more expensive for holders of other currencies. Can the Dollar Index keep rising? The DXY could rise further if the Federal Reserve continues its hawkish stance and global economic challenges persist. How does the Dollar Index affect cryptocurrency? A rising dollar often leads to bearish trends in cryptocurrencies as investors prefer the relative safety of the dollar. Conclusion The Dollar Index’s surge to 109.18 points underscores the continued dominance of the U.S. dollar amid global economic uncertainty and aggressive monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. While this strength benefits some sectors, it poses challenges for commodities, emerging markets, and international trade. Investors should closely monitor the DXY and its potential ripple effects across financial markets.

With a current market cap of $401 billion , Ethereum’s struggles are exacerbated by technical breakdowns, oversold indicators, and significant liquidations. Analysts point to key support levels at $3,244 and $3,095 as critical for determining ETH’s near-term trajectory. Current Market Conditions for Ethereum Price Action Ethereum has fallen below the $3,244 support level and the 200 EMA on the 4-hour chart, signaling a weakening trend and potential for further declines. Market Cap and Liquidations Market Cap: Now at $401 billion, reflecting a sharp decline in investor sentiment. Liquidations: Approximately $146 million worth of ETH positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours. Spot ETF Outflows Ethereum spot ETFs recorded outflows totaling $86.79 million , adding to the selling pressure and reflecting reduced institutional interest. Technical Analysis: Indicators Signal Bearish Momentum Oversold RSI The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart indicates oversold conditions, typically a bearish signal unless followed by a sharp reversal. Death Cross Formation A potential death cross , where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, suggests continued downside momentum. Support and Resistance Levels Immediate Support: $3,244, already breached, indicating vulnerability. Next Target: $3,095, a critical level for potential stabilization. Resistance Levels: $3,400 and $3,500, where significant selling pressure is expected if prices rebound. Factors Contributing to Ethereum’s Decline Broad Market Weakness A general downturn in the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin’s struggles, has negatively impacted Ethereum. ETF Outflows The outflow of $86.79 million from Ethereum spot ETFs signals a lack of confidence among institutional investors. Macro-Economic Concerns Global economic uncertainty, including interest rate decisions and regulatory developments, has weighed heavily on risk-on assets like Ethereum. Technical Breakdown The breach of the 200 EMA and failure to hold key support levels reinforce bearish sentiment, inviting further selling pressure. Short-Term Outlook for Ethereum Bearish Scenarios If Ethereum fails to hold the $3,095 support level , the price could test lower levels, potentially dropping to the $2,900-$3,000 range . Bullish Reversal Potential For a reversal, Ethereum would need to reclaim the $3,400 resistance level and establish strong buying momentum to counteract oversold conditions. FAQs What caused Ethereum’s recent price decline? Ethereum’s price dropped due to bearish technical indicators, significant liquidations, ETF outflows, and broader market weakness. What are Ethereum’s key support levels? Current key support levels are $3,244 and $3,095, with a breach of the latter potentially leading to further declines. What is a death cross, and why is it significant? A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, signaling bearish momentum and potential long-term weakness. Why are ETF outflows impacting Ethereum’s price? ETF outflows reduce institutional demand, indicating waning confidence and contributing to selling pressure in the market. Can Ethereum recover from this bearish trend? Recovery would require reclaiming the $3,400 resistance level and sustaining buying momentum, along with improvements in broader market conditions. How does Ethereum’s RSI affect its outlook? An oversold RSI suggests the asset is undervalued in the short term, but further downside is possible without strong buying activity. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent 10% decline , coupled with bearish technical indicators and significant market liquidations, underscores the challenges it faces amid current market conditions. With key support levels at $3,244 and $3,095 under threat, ETH’s short-term trajectory hinges on whether it can stave off further losses or rebound from oversold conditions. Investors should watch for potential recovery signs around the $3,400 level while preparing for additional downside if bearish pressure persists.

The firm highlighted that Bitcoin’s MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio has not exceeded 3.2 during this cycle, a historical indicator of peak market euphoria. If Bitcoin were to reach this ratio, it could potentially correspond to a price of approximately $132,000 . What Is the MVRV Ratio? The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is an important metric used to assess Bitcoin’s market valuation in comparison to its realized value (the value of all BTC at the price they last moved). Key MVRV Thresholds: Below 1.0: Market undervaluation, often considered a buying opportunity. 1.0 to 3.2: Indicates healthy market conditions without excessive speculation. Above 3.2: Historically signals extreme euphoria and the potential for a market top. Current MVRV Ratio: Insights from Glassnode Subdued Euphoria Bitcoin’s current MVRV ratio remains below the 3.2 threshold , signaling that the market has yet to experience the over-optimism often associated with significant price peaks. Price Implications If the MVRV ratio were to reach 3.2 , historical trends suggest Bitcoin could hit approximately $132,000 , reflecting potential growth in the current cycle. Market Maturity The absence of extreme euphoria highlights a more tempered market, possibly due to increased institutional participation and a broader base of informed retail investors. Historical Context: MVRV and Market Cycles The MVRV ratio has proven to be a reliable indicator of market sentiment in previous Bitcoin cycles: 2013 Bull Run: The MVRV ratio exceeded 3.2, signaling market euphoria before Bitcoin’s peak. 2017 Bull Run: Similar patterns were observed, with the ratio breaching 3.2 at the cycle’s height. Current Cycle: The ratio’s inability to exceed 3.2 suggests that Bitcoin may have further room for growth before hitting a potential peak. Factors Contributing to a Subdued MVRV Ratio Institutional Influence The growing presence of institutions has tempered speculative behavior, leading to a more measured market sentiment. Regulatory Oversight Increasing regulatory scrutiny may have curbed excessive speculation, contributing to the absence of extreme euphoria. Market Maturity A broader understanding of Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition has led to more strategic, less emotional investment behavior. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Price? Upside Potential With the MVRV ratio below 3.2, there’s room for further price appreciation before Bitcoin reaches euphoric levels. Long-Term Outlook The tempered sentiment suggests a healthier market, reducing the likelihood of sharp corrections associated with speculative bubbles. Catalysts to Watch Factors like Bitcoin ETF approvals, macroeconomic trends, and adoption by major institutions could push the MVRV ratio higher, potentially driving Bitcoin toward the $132,000 mark. FAQs What is the MVRV ratio? The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value, providing insights into market sentiment and valuation. Why is 3.2 significant for the MVRV ratio? An MVRV ratio of 3.2 historically corresponds to extreme euphoria in the market, often preceding major price peaks. What does the current MVRV ratio indicate? The current ratio suggests that Bitcoin has not reached extreme euphoria levels, leaving room for further price growth. What price could Bitcoin reach if the MVRV ratio hits 3.2? According to Glassnode, Bitcoin could reach approximately $132,000 if the MVRV ratio exceeds 3.2 in this cycle. What factors influence the MVRV ratio? Factors include market sentiment, Bitcoin’s price movements, on-chain activity, and macroeconomic trends. How can investors use the MVRV ratio? Investors can use the MVRV ratio as a tool to gauge market sentiment and identify potential buying or selling opportunities. Conclusion Glassnode’s analysis of Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio highlights that the market has yet to experience the extreme euphoria often associated with price peaks. With the ratio below the critical 3.2 threshold , Bitcoin may still have significant growth potential, possibly reaching $132,000 in this cycle. Investors should monitor the MVRV ratio alongside other market indicators to make informed decisions in this evolving market.

Key Highlights of the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend 1. Major Selloff in December 2024 In December, institutional investors sold approximately 79,000 BTC , leading to a sharp 15% market correction . This selloff marked one of the largest liquidation events of the year. 2. Resumption of Buying Activity Over the past month, institutional players have accumulated 34,000 BTC , signaling renewed confidence and creating upward buying pressure for Bitcoin. 3. Long-Term Accumulation Trend Since June 2023, whales have steadily increased their Bitcoin holdings, even during periods of price volatility and retail inactivity. Drivers of Whale Activity Market Confidence The resumption of Bitcoin accumulation by whales suggests confidence in the asset’s long-term value, likely driven by macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event. Portfolio Rebalancing Institutional investors often rebalance their portfolios at year-end, contributing to the December selloff. The subsequent accumulation reflects strategic repositioning for 2025. Attractive Price Levels Following the December correction, Bitcoin’s price provided an attractive entry point for large-scale investors, encouraging accumulation. On-Chain Data Insights Whale Accumulation Patterns On-chain analysis reveals a steady inflow of Bitcoin into wallets holding over 1,000 BTC , a hallmark of institutional activity. Declining Retail Participation Retail demand remains at a 5-year low , according to CryptoQuant data, highlighting the growing dominance of institutional players in driving market movements. Supply Dynamics The accumulation trend reduces available Bitcoin on exchanges, potentially tightening supply and creating upward pressure on prices. Impact on the Bitcoin Market Recovery Momentum The recent accumulation of over 34,000 BTC by whales is providing critical buying pressure, aiding Bitcoin’s recovery from its December lows. Market Stability Institutional accumulation tends to stabilize the market, mitigating the extreme volatility often associated with retail-driven movements.

Historical Context of Whale Behavior Periods of Accumulation and Selling Whales are known to capitalize on price corrections to accumulate Bitcoin. Their activity during market downturns often foreshadows long-term price recoveries. December 2024 vs. June 2023 In June 2023, institutional accumulation started amid regulatory uncertainties. Despite fluctuations, this trend has persisted, reflecting a long-term bullish outlook. FAQs What triggered the major Bitcoin selloff in December 2024? Institutional portfolio rebalancing at year-end led to the sale of 79,000 BTC, causing a 15% price correction. How much Bitcoin have whales accumulated recently? Over the past 30 days, institutional investors have purchased more than 34,000 BTC, signaling renewed buying pressure. Why is whale activity significant for the market?

Retail demand is at a 5-year low , making institutional activity the primary driver of recent market trends. How does whale accumulation affect Bitcoin’s price? Accumulation by whales reduces supply on exchanges, potentially creating upward price pressure and market stability. Is this a bullish signal for Bitcoin?

Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index What Is the Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures overall market sentiment, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed) . It helps investors gauge whether the market is undervalued or overvalued based on collective sentiment. Scoring Zones: Extreme Fear (0–24): Indicates widespread pessimism, potentially signaling buying opportunities. Fear (25–49): Reflects cautious sentiment. Neutral (50): Neither overly bullish nor bearish. Greed (51–74): Signifies growing confidence and optimism. Extreme Greed (75–100): Suggests overconfidence, often a precursor to corrections.

Why is the Fear & Greed Index important? It provides insights into market sentiment, helping investors identify potential opportunities or risks based on collective behavior.

Is it risky to invest during the ‘Greed’ zone? Investing during the ‘Greed’ zone can be riskier, as markets may be overvalued. However, careful analysis of individual assets is crucial. What factors are included in the index calculation? The index considers volatility, market momentum, social media trends, investor surveys, Bitcoin dominance, and Google search trends.

Research analyst Park Woo-yeol predicts that Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) may follow in Ethereum ETFs’ footsteps, setting the stage for a new era in cryptocurrency investment. If approved, these ETFs could propel XRP and SOL to challenge Bitcoin and Ethereum’s dominance in the crypto hierarchy. Key Takeaways from Shinhan Securities’ Report High Probability of ETF Approval Shinhan Securities estimates a 70% or higher chance for XRP and SOL ETFs to receive regulatory approval in 2025. This optimistic outlook aligns with growing institutional interest in diversifying crypto-based financial products. XRP and SOL’s Position in the Crypto Hierarchy Park predicts that XRP and SOL could compete for the third spot in the cryptocurrency hierarchy, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a development would solidify their status as leading altcoins. Bitcoin’s Price Forecast The report also forecasts Bitcoin trading between $80,000 and $130,000 in 2025, supported by annual volatility levels of approximately 50% . This range suggests potential bullish momentum for the broader crypto market. Why ETF Approval for XRP and SOL Matters Increased Accessibility ETFs allow traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding them, enhancing accessibility and adoption. Market Liquidity Approval of XRP and SOL ETFs could significantly boost liquidity for these altcoins, increasing their trading volume and price stability. Regulatory Milestone ETF approval would signify regulatory recognition, potentially encouraging further institutional investments and partnerships. Factors Supporting ETF Approval for XRP and SOL Ripple’s Legal Triumphs Ripple’s recent legal victories against the SEC have strengthened its position, reducing regulatory uncertainties around XRP. Solana’s Ecosystem Growth Solana’s robust ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, makes it an attractive candidate for ETF products. Growing Institutional Interest The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs highlights the growing demand for diversified crypto investment options, paving the way for altcoins like XRP and SOL.

According to a recent post by CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost , the crypto exchange has been experiencing a consistent decline in stablecoin reserves since mid-December 2024. This trend follows a peak of $13 billion in stablecoin inflows in early December, raising concerns about a potential Bitcoin (BTC) price plunge. Key Insights from Binance Stablecoin Trends Declining Stablecoin Reserves The steady outflow of stablecoins from Binance indicates a significant shift in market sentiment. Stablecoins, often used to purchase volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are critical for maintaining buying pressure in the market. Comparison to May 2024 Crash Darkfost highlighted a similar trend in May 2024, where declining stablecoin inflows preceded a significant BTC price crash. This historical context raises alarms about the current market trajectory. Investor Caution “Outright stablecoin outflows indicate a more significant market shift, with investors leaning toward caution,” wrote Darkfost. This suggests that traders might be exiting positions or moving funds to safer assets amid market uncertainty. Possible Reasons Behind the Stablecoin Outflows Market Uncertainty Regulatory developments and macroeconomic factors may be driving investors to withdraw funds from Binance, reducing the availability of stablecoins for crypto purchases.

The current outflows could indicate profit-taking and a retreat to safety. Binance-Specific Concerns Lingering concerns about Binance’s operational transparency and global regulatory scrutiny might be prompting users to withdraw funds, further exacerbating the trend. Implications for Bitcoin (BTC) Weakened Buying Pressure A decline in stablecoin reserves on Binance directly correlates with reduced purchasing power for Bitcoin, which could lead to a price decline. Market Sentiment Shift Stablecoin outflows may reflect broader caution in the crypto market, potentially signaling a bearish trend for BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Risk of Price Volatility As stablecoin reserves dwindle, Bitcoin may become more susceptible to large sell-offs, increasing market volatility. Historical Context: Lessons from May 2024 In May 2024, Binance experienced a similar reversal in stablecoin flows, which preceded a significant market downturn. At the time, Bitcoin’s price plummeted by over 25% within weeks, underscoring the importance of stablecoin reserves as a leading indicator of market stability. FAQs What are stablecoins, and why are they important? Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to fiat currencies like the USD. They play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing liquidity and reducing volatility during market trades. Why are stablecoin outflows on Binance significant? Outflows reduce the buying power available on the exchange, signaling weakening market sentiment and potentially leading to a Bitcoin price decline. How do stablecoin trends correlate with Bitcoin prices? Stablecoin inflows often indicate increased buying pressure, while outflows suggest reduced demand, which can negatively impact Bitcoin’s price. What caused the May 2024 Bitcoin crash? The crash was preceded by declining stablecoin inflows, regulatory concerns, and heightened market uncertainty, all contributing to a significant drop in BTC’s price. Could stablecoin outflows on Binance affect other cryptocurrencies? Yes, as stablecoins are widely used for trading across various cryptocurrencies, their outflows can impact the broader crypto market. Is a Bitcoin price plunge inevitable? While stablecoin outflows are a warning sign, other factors like macroeconomic conditions, market sentiment, and institutional activity also play a role in determining Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Conclusion The continued stablecoin outflows on Binance since mid-December 2024 suggest a weakening of market confidence and buying pressure, which could lead to a Bitcoin price plunge . Drawing parallels to the May 2024 crash, analysts warn that the market might be entering a period of heightened caution and potential volatility.

Starknet Unveils Starknet Stack for Custom Blockchain Development Amid Quantum Computing Concerns In other news, Starknet, a leading zero-knowledge (ZK) Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has launched the Starknet Stack, a robust suite of tools enabling developers to create custom blockchains powered by Starknet’s zero-knowledge technology. The Starknet Stack offers three distinct configurations tailored to diverse blockchain use cases: StarkWare Sequencer: Closely aligned with the public Starknet stack, this preset offers a familiar environment for developers already accustomed to Starknet’s ecosystem. Madera: A fully customizable, open-source configuration, providing developers the flexibility to tailor their blockchain to specific needs. Dojo: An optimized mode designed specifically for gaming applications, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to enable fast, secure, and scalable gaming experiences. Leo Sizaret, StarkWare’s business development manager, emphasized the transformative potential of zero-knowledge technology, saying, “We believe zero knowledge technologies are the future of blockchain. It gives you exceptional security and scalability while also being quantum resistant and cost-efficient.” Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) enable the verification of information, such as identity or account ownership, without disclosing the underlying data. Starknet’s ZK-STARK technology, the foundation of its Layer-2 scaling solution, takes this approach further by providing quantum resistance and cost-effective scalability. The Starknet Stack release arrives as concerns grow about the potential threat of quantum computing to modern encryption standards used in blockchain networks. ZKPs are increasingly viewed as a safeguard against the theoretical risks posed by quantum computers, which could potentially break existing cryptographic algorithms. Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power, with potential implications for blockchain security. A recent highlight of quantum advancements was Google’s unveiling of Willow, a quantum processor capable of solving mathematical problems that would take classical computers billions of years, in just minutes. According to Google Quantum AI, Willow’s error correction capabilities mark a significant leap in quantum computing efficiency. However, computer scientists caution against overestimating the immediate threat posed by quantum computing. Current quantum processors, such as those involved in controversial experiments, are far from capable of breaking modern encryption standards. For instance, a study by Shanghai University in May 2024 claimed quantum computers could factor encryption algorithms, but it was revealed that the study's quantum machine could only break 22-bit keys—a far cry from the 2048-bit to 4096-bit keys used in blockchain and financial systems. Pioneering Post-Quantum Security While quantum computing’s immediate threat may be overstated, Starknet and other blockchain innovators are preparing for a quantum-resistant future. In November, Dr. XinXin Fan, head of cryptography at IoTeX, proposed using hash-based zero-knowledge proofs to safeguard Ethereum against quantum threats. His paper, which won the Best Paper award at the 2024 International Conference for Blockchain, emphasized the use of one-way hash functions as an efficient and secure method for quantum-proofing transactions. Dr. Fan's research sheds light on the proactive steps blockchain networks are taking to ensure long-term security in a quantum era.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|SOL|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-09 13:30:00

During bull markets, Dogecoin has shown remarkable performance, and because of Elon Musk’s influence on the market, this token may see a drastic change in its course in the coming months, stated WIZZ, a cryptocurrency analyst. Related Reading: Bitcoin As The New S&P 500 Of Our Time? This CEO Thinks So Will Elon Musk Change The Game? Musk’s involvement in the meme coin has caused previous price jumps in Dogecoin. WIZZ maintains that Musk’s upcoming ventures; including those of the upcoming Trump administration may thrust DOGE past other major altcoins. In light of surging interest into Musk’s endeavors, many in the digital currency scene are seeing a similar frenzy as his past sponsorships set off waves. One interesting fact has been Musk supposedly heading the “Department of Government Efficiency” during the Trump administration.

Analyst Ali Martinez found that during the 2020–2021 bull market, DOGE increased by more than 15,000. If history repeats itself, its token might reach a height of $23 or $1 to $3. Dogecoin is selling at about $0.33 right now. It has been going down a little, and it retreated by 2.40% in the last 24 hours. But some strong fundamentals and community support should be enough to give the meme coin some vigor in the months ahead. Based on data from CoinCodex and IntoTheBlock, there is more action on the blockchain, which suggests that investors are once again getting interested in DOGE.

Trump’s threat of tariffs and China’s weak economy has led Wall Street to increase its bets against the renminbi. However, this is to be supported by China’s largest sale of offshore bills. Today, the People’s Bank of China announced that it would sell Rmb60B($8.2B) of bills in Hong Kong in January. It will mark the largest single sale since auctions were introduced in the territory in 2018. Obviously, the bill sale will result in the renminbi liquidity being absorbed, thereby increasing the cost for traders to wager against the currency in markets outside of China. In the initial trading days of 2025, the renminbi has declined to over Rmb7.33 per dollar, its lowest level since September 2023. This development presents a challenge to the Chinese government, which has pledged to preserve the currency’s stability. Notably, The renminbi is not subject to the trading band and is freely transacted outside of mainland China. Unofficial guidance and discreet interventions have been implemented by China’s central bank to regulate depreciation in offshore markets. What are China’s odds of winning against Wall Street bets? Investors are of the opinion that the central bank will permit the gradual weakening of the currency. The renminbi is expected to reach Rmb7.5 per dollar or higher by the end of the year. This is a level that was last observed in 2007. However, Ju Wang, head of China rates and foreign exchange strategy at BNP Paribas said that with the announcement of the bill sale, “they are sending a sign that even with the tariff situation, they are trying their best to protect the currency.” Apparently, China has an estimated $1 trillion in unofficial support from state institutions and exporters. This support, in addition to $3.2 trillion in official reserves, could safeguard the currency if it reaches that threshold. Still, the PBoC has maintained its currency fix. This is an official daily exchange rate that allows the renminbi to fluctuate by 2% in mainland China. However, the renminbi has depreciated over the past month, remaining at approximately Rmb7.19 per dollar. A hedge fund manager said that recent moves in the currency “are all indicative of a trade with legs and a direction in policy where the authorities are pretty comfortable with a slow, managed weakening versus the dollar and some sense of stability versus a broader basket of currencies.” China’s renminbi performance since October 2024. Source: Financial Times The overnight rate to borrow offshore renminbi in Hong Kong soared above 8% on Tuesday, the highest level in three years. This makes it more expensive for investors who bet against the currency. Short-term predictions for China’s renminbi JPMorgan, Barclays, and BNP Paribas all anticipate that the renminbi will decline to Rmb7.5 per dollar by the conclusion of 2025. Nomura predicts that it will reach Rmb7.6 by May, while Bank of America predicts that it will reach Rmb7.4 by the end of the year. Some predict that it may diminish beyond Rmb7.5. Robert Gilhooly, senior emerging markets economist at Abrdn, stated, “Our working assumption is that the currency falls to between Rmb8 and Rmb8.1 by the middle of [2025], conditioned on this relatively large tariff shock.” He added that during the previous cycle of Trump tariffs in 2017, the risks were skewed toward a greater depreciation this time around. Additionally, The renminbi’s devaluation would enable Chinese exporters to maintain their competitiveness in the face of increased tariffs in the United States. However, it could also expose China to the allegation of currency manipulation, which was leveled by the previous Trump administration. Also, most investors expect the most significant weakness to occur after the new Trump administration’s tariff intentions are more widely known. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20.

As this innovative blockchain solution attracts the attention of crypto whales, investors are beginning to wonder - Could Lightchain AI be the next Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB)? Lightchain AI Not Just a Meme Coin Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which thrive on community hype, Lightchain AI is forging a unique path by combining real functionality with investor appeal. Its focus on solving inefficiencies within blockchain ecosystems sets it apart for those looking for more than fleeting gains. A key innovation driving Lightchain AI is its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which allows developers to seamlessly integrate AI-powered applications into blockchain ecosystems. Additionally, its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism replaces traditional methods by rewarding nodes for performing AI computations. This approach directly accelerates advancements in machine learning and predictive analytics. Lightchain AI’s presale success reflects growing confidence in its scalable solutions and cross-industry appeal. With a transparent roadmap and cutting-edge features, it’s positioning itself as a standout contender in the competitive crypto landscape. How Lightchain AI Could Rival Meme Coin Gains Putting money into Lightchain AI can be a fun chance for growth! With an start amount of just $1,000 at a token cost of $0.004875 you’d get about 205,128 LCAI tokens. Now, here is the fun bit; if the token sees a fair rise and hits 50 cents, that $1,000 could grow into a cool $102,564. And if you’re hopeful, think about LCAI reaching a dollar—your cash could zoom t͏o $205,128! It is the sort of chance that makes us think of early bets in well-known meme coins like DOGE and SHIB Sure, all buys hold some risks but the chances with Lightchain AI make it worth think for anyone wanting to tap into a crypto market’s big wins. Lightchain AI Could Be the Next Big Thing With its presale raising $9.7 million and whale investors backing its vision, Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as a serious challenger in the crypto space. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have defined the meme coin era, Lightchain AI’s unique approach and long-term growth potential position it as a project that could surpass the hype. For investors seeking the next major opportunity, Lightchain AI offers a rare chance to secure early gains in a project designed for lasting impact. Don’t miss the opportunity to be part of what could be the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu phenomenon. Explore Lightchain AI and see for yourself why it’s attracting the attention of crypto whales and everyday investors alike. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Is now the time to buy? DOJ potential BTC sell-off sparks deeper dip The Bitcoin (BTC) bull market is under threat right now. The market had been coming down from levels just above $100,000 when recent news of a potential sale of around $6.5 billion in BTC by the U.S. DOJ sparked a deeper sell-off. Market indicators starting to bottom Downward trending markets are not the best time for buying crypto, and certainly not cryptocurrencies that are even further along the risk curve, such as memecoins. That said, market indicators are starting to bottom, and a bounce could be likely in the near future. For those looking for potentially higher-than-usual gains, it could be time to buy some of the popular memecoins. $DOGE coming down to major support levels Source: TradingView $DOGE is coming down to major horizontal support levels. First at $0.31, and then at $0.28. The second of these levels may also coincide with the rising trendline as seen on the above chart. The trend is still up for $DOGE, and healthy retracements of 35% and 42% respectively could be great levels to start buying a position in what is arguably the most popular of all the memecoins. $PEPE at its bull market base level Source: TradingView $PEPE is currently sitting at the big horizontal support level that arguably defines the rest of its bull market. Up to now, the price has been building market structure above this level, and it has held beautifully, with the good possibility that it could become the bull market base for $PEPE. That said, if the price does fall through this level, with confirmation below, the next support is down at $0.00001324, with further levels below this as marked on the above chart. A buy-in at the current level should be protected by a tight stop loss. Fortune favours the brave. A good place to start building a $BONK position? Source: TradingView $BONK is currently at a very good horizontal level of support, with a retest of the descending trendline having also just been made. This looks like a good level to start building a position, with some lower levels as per the chart below. If the price were to fall below the lowest of these, and also below the bull market trendline, that would potentially be the end of the $BONK upward trend. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is coming down. This could either continue to come down to the bottom, or it could bounce at the 20.00 level, as it has done before. The two indicator lines will need to cross back up in order for major momentum to start buoying the price upward. Watch this indicator closely.

This groundbreaking platform aims to create an innovative hybrid exchange that would combine the best features of both CEX and DEX. It recently launched this platform as a work in progress. As it could dominate this market, which Statista predicts may be worth $13B by 2026, many market analysts are bullish about the growth potential of its native token, DTX. This crypto coin is now in phase seven of its presale, and experts foresee a potential 4x surge in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX) Launches Its Platform, Gains Massive Hype DTX Exchange (DTX) recently made headlines after launching its highly anticipated hybrid trading platform. On this platform, users will trade over 120K asset classes, including crypto coins, stocks, and FX, in total privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks. Furthermore, they will be able to access up to 1000x leverage. A $100 investment could give traders access to liquidity reaching $100K. The hype for DTX Exchange was already strong, as it released some other exciting products, like the Phoenix Wallet, a secure custody solution, and its VulcanX blockchain testnet. As an interesting side note, the VulcanX blockchain testnet managed to show 100K TPS, which is a big achievement. As the first crypto-native platform to offer ETF trading, stocks, and more, DTX Exchange could become a fan favorite for millions of traders. This statement has some merit, given that over 300K users have already been onboarded. Early Investors in DTX Exchange (DTX) Are Now 600% Richer Those looking to support this project are now buying its native token, DTX. It is now in phase seven of its presale, which has been going strong. Notably, early investors have already experienced a 600% return. Not only that, DTX Exchange has managed to raise over $11M so far and may reach $20M before this month ends. The DTX token will be a big part of its ecosystem. To incentivize purchases, the DTX Exchange team announced that DTX holders will have the ability to impact the platform’s future thanks to governance voting rights and get a percentage of its trading fee revenue. Because of these benefits, many traders are now rushing to buy this altcoin while its value is low. Currently, DTX is worth just $0.14 as it is in phase seven of its crypto ICO event. This is a 600% rise from its starting price of $0.02. However, phase eight of the presale will bring another 14% jump to $0.16. Additionally, everyone is waiting for a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap to list DTX, as its value is expected to reach $0.20 afterward. This growth could make DTX one of the altcoins to watch for fast returns this quarter. What Could the Future Bring for DTX Exchange (DTX)? DTX Exchange (DTX) looks set to change online trading forever. By addressing the limitations of both CEXs and DEXs, DTX may give its users and token holders significant value. Whether you are a seasoned trader or a beginner looking for an innovative platform you can trust, DTX Exchange gives you a sneak peek into the future of trading. Its groundbreaking technology and fair-launch model, which benefits both whales and retail investors, could make it stand out in the crypto space, too. Since the DTX token will have a smaller market cap, experts think its growth will be quicker, as it needs less money to surge. Therefore, they forecast a potential 4x surge for this altcoin this year.

The data signaled economic resilience, pressuring both equities and cryptocurrencies. Yet, amidst the fluctuations, Jamie Coutts, Real Vision’s chief digital assets analyst, sees a brighter horizon for Bitcoin, forecasting a significant price surge over the next six months. With the strong dollar becoming a real problem, I expected Bitcoin to be in the $80,000 range by now. This speaks to the strength of the underlying bid and the market's expectations that the Fed will have to act; otherwise, things will start breaking. Regardless of the… pic.twitter.com/uVYYbpRv2o — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) January 7, 2025 Fed Moves Could Fuel Bitcoin’s Rally Coutts argues that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates soon, injecting much-needed liquidity into the financial system. This, he believes, will provide a strong tailwind for Bitcoin’s price . Backing his outlook with historical data, Coutts highlights a strong correlation between the global money supply (M2) and Bitcoin. As M2 expands, Bitcoin has historically followed suit, making the current environment ripe for a potential rally. “Despite the strong dollar keeping Bitcoin below $80,000, the underlying demand remains robust,” Coutts explains. He suggests that market participants are already anticipating the Fed’s next moves, which could set the stage for Bitcoin to climb higher. Wealthy Investors Eye Bitcoin’s Long-Term Potential Another factor fueling optimism is the growing interest in Bitcoin among high-net-worth individuals and families. These investors, unlike the daily traders, fixated on short-term liquidity fluctuations, are focusing on Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Coutts believes this shift in adoption will play a crucial role in sustaining Bitcoin’s upward momentum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Today Drops : How You Can Turn This Dip into a 140% Gain in 2025 , Market Outlook: Short-Term Hurdles, Long-Term Gains Currently trading at $94,592 , Bitcoin has seen a 2.4% dip over the past day. Analysts expect the cryptocurrency to consolidate between $92,000 and $90,000 in the short term, with a potential rally in February. However, a daily close below $90,000 could trigger a steeper correction, possibly to $78,000–$74,000. If #Bitcoin $BTC falls below $92,000, a drop to the $78,000–$74,000 range could be on the horizon. https://t.co/B6bPCfLNjy — Ali (@ali_charts) January 8, 2025 Despite these challenges, Coutts remains confident in Bitcoin’s resilience. With increasing liquidity, broader adoption , and innovative developments in the crypto space, Bitcoin could be gearing up for a pivotal upswing in the months ahead.

Chey Tae Won, speaking during Nvidia’s CES press conference in Las Vegas, said SK Hynix is ramping up its chip development to meet Nvidia’s growing demands. According to reports , Nvidia’s co-founder Jensen Huang and SK Group Chairman Chey Tae Won discussed ways to expand AI applications. Both agreed to increase SK Hynix’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are the key elements of Nvidia’s AI accelerators. Shares of SK Hynix jumped over 5% in Seoul following the news, which has fueled substantial gains for the company so far this year. The Korean memory chip maker was Nvidia’s leading supplier during the AI boom sparked by ChatGPT, leaving its rival, Samsung Electronics behind. SK Hynix’s HBM3E chips propelled it to the forefront of memory solutions for AI and spurred successive advanced product training. How Korea gained an advantage in AI manufacturing Huang said AI systems that can “reason, plan, and act” could revolutionize all industries worth $50 trillion. Chey added that South Korea is crucial as a partner in this transformation because of its manufacturing strengths. Both SK Hynix and Nvidia agreed to explore further collaboration on Nvidia’s recent Cosmos platform to develop physical AI technologies such as robots and autonomous vehicles. Nvidia introduced its Cosmos platform for generative world models and advanced video tokenizers suited to its GPUs at the CES 2025 event in Las Vegas. Physical AI systems deal with practical tasks such as object manipulation and mobility, unlike ChatGPT-style software AI. HMB advancements ahead of Nvidia demand Nvidia’s generative AI systems need fifth-generation HBM3E chips, with SK Hynix leading the pack. According to Chey, whose company’s HBM is now advancing ahead of Nvidia’s requests, SK Hynix has the technological edge. SK is expected to introduce HBM3E 16-layer samples and 12-layer HBM4 products during the first half of 2025. Nvidia is the company’s largest customer, and the entire production of HBM chips for 2025 is already sold out. Currently, SK Hynix supplies Nvidia with HBM3E 12-layer products and is expanding its capabilities to address growing AI demand. SK Group also prioritizes AI data centers as a growth driver. Chey stressed energy-efficient solutions for power-hungry facilities, such as optimized power supplies, cooling systems, and energy management overall. SK believes there is a huge opportunity to collaborate these efforts with its broader technology-driven transformation.

On the other hand, BTC saw nearly $568.8 million outflows as nearly 5,870 BTCs were sold during the last trading day. Currently, the levels are testing the support close to $93,400, showing no signs of a rebound as the buyers stay aloof. In the meantime, the pullback has brought the levels close to a pivotal zone, as a breakdown may drag the levels close to $85,000 shortly. The token has been following a particular price action within each halving year. After the 2020 halving, the price of BTC plunged by over 35% in January, which further rebounded and surged high to mark a new ATH close to $70,000. Currently, the price has plunged less than 10%, which suggests the bulls are fairly in control. Too many big players seem to be spreading panic, maybe because they want to buy this dip or cause some instability before a change in power. Previously in 2021, the drop was caused by some double-spend FUD and this time by some employment-based news. Moreover, the US DOJ getting clearance for selling over 69,370 BTC worth $6.5 billion seized from Silk Road does not appear good for the BTC price rally in the short term. Will this push the price to as low as $85,000 this month? The historical BTC price action suggests a 10% pullback could be on the horizon as the indicators have turned bearish. The MACD lines are about to undergo a bearish crossover with a huge drop in the buying pressure and the RSI is constantly forming lower highs and lows. Therefore, the Bitcoin price appears to be primed to drop below $90,000 and reach levels close to $88,000 in the next few hours. Meanwhile, an extended pullback could drag the price to $85,000 or the average bands of the channel below $83,000. Although the January trade appears to be bearish, that does not mean the start of a bear market. This can be considered a temporary pullback as the Bitcoin (BTC) price remains under a bullish influence and on the path towards a new ATH above $110K or $115K in the upcoming days.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 13:52:50

The looming threat of being shut down by the US Government means that investors need a safe haven to pull back to if and when that happens. Volatility in the XRP price is expected and also unfortunate. The crypto whales have been fond of Ripple (XRP) over the years, but given the headwinds faced by Ripple (XRP), they are moving toward DTX Exchange, a new altcoin with a positive growth trajectory and rapid adoption. DTX offers high growth opportunities backed by robust fundamentals and utility. XRP Price to Face Massive Rally Before SEC Decision XRP Price is currently at $2.33 and has fallen 4.06% in a month. It is no wonder that investors are looking elsewhere. While Ripple has shown impressive technological improvements, the SEC case will be deciding the fate of the XRP price. XRP whales are positioning themselves to liquidate earnings if the case does not end favorably. Bearish signals mean that the XRP price’s trajectory in Q1 of 2025 is important. Analysts are skeptical that Ripple (XRP) will be able to outperform newer altcoins like DTX Exchange. The XRP price is currently below the $2.5 resistance; there is rising selling pressure on long-term XRP investors, which has led to a profit-taking frenzy. Ripple has also announced a 75% upturn in US hiring, which means it wants to capitalize on the incoming pro-crypto government, but the news has not done anything to help the XRP Price. Ripple must overcome resistance; any rejection at this level could further the downtrend. Source: CoinMarketCap DTX is the New Benchmark for Blockchain Innovation DTX Exchange (DTX) is the viral new altcoin, proving to be a game changer in the blockchain arena. It has already delivered impressive returns for early investors, and analysts are positive that the price will be 100 times its current $0.14 value once it is listed on Tier-1 exchanges. DTX is a breakthrough multi-asset trading platform that will allow users to trade traditional assets and crypto assets. Which means trading gold, forex, stocks, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, ETFs, and even tokenized real-world assets, all in one seamless platform. 300,000 users have joined the platform because of features like unmatched leverage, access to multiple asset classes, and privacy, thanks to no sign-up KYC checks. It is expected that the DTX price will break out soon and surpass major altcoins like Ripple (XRP). DTX’s VulcanX layer-1 blockchain has already launched its testnet successfully. It is pulling ahead of the competition faster than it can fathom and is set to be the best crypto investment of 2025. Key Takeaways DTX Exchange has disrupted the crypto space with its platform and has massive potential for growth. Its presale is in its 7th stage and is on its way to being the fastest-growing ICO of the year. For those looking to multiply their investments in 2025, DTX is your best bet. XRP whales have already diverted their liquidity to DTX and will be reaping major profits once DTX Exchange (DTX) is listed. DTX has a novel approach to trading, and this gives its token strong backing and positions it for long-term success.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell below $95,000, triggering a steeper sell-off among altcoins. However, there are signs that the coin may bounce back and possibly hit $122,000 in January. Bitcoin balances on exchanges are falling One key reason why BTC’s price may rebound in January is the ongoing imbalance between demand and supply. Demand has continued to rise this year, as evidenced by growing ETF inflows . Spot Bitcoin ETFs have added a net $1.3 billion in assets this year, while companies like MicroStrategy have continued rising. Bitcoin whales have also continued to accumulate , adding 34,000 coins since December. Bitcoin whales are still accumulating | CryptoQuant Supply is also shrinking, as seen in Bitcoin balances on exchanges. According to CoinGlass, the number of BTC coins held on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level in years. Balances now stand at 2.1 million, down from 2.72 million in January 2024. Therefore, this imbalance between demand and supply could soon benefit Bitcoin. Bitcoin balances on exchanges | CoinGlass FTX distributions and Donald Trump inauguration Another major Bitcoin price catalyst is the upcoming distribution of $16 billion from the FTX Estate to investors and creditors. Most of these funds are currently held in stablecoins like Tether ( USDT ) and USD coin ( USDC ). While some of the recipients will convert them into cash, some of the money will be changed into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Additionally, Donald Trump will be sworn in on January 20, ushering in a new era of crypto regulations. While much of this has already been priced in, there is a likelihood that BTC and other altcoins will rise ahead of the event and Gary Gensler’s resignation .

On the weekly chart, BTC has formed a bullish pennant pattern, shown in blue. This pattern consists of a long vertical line followed by a triangle-shaped consolidation. The recent sideways movement is part of this pennant formation. Bitcoin’s uptrend is being supported by the 50-week and 100-week Exponential Moving Averages, a sign that the bullish trend is intact. The Market Value and Relative Value indicator is moved to 2.4, meaning that it is still cheap. Most importantly, Bitcoin has yet to reach the target of its cup-and-handle pattern. The cup formation has a depth of 75%. Measuring the same distance from the upper side of the cup points to a target of $123,000.

A recently unveiled court filing , dated December 30, 2024, might have offered some insight into the recent downward pressure. Specifically, Judge Richard Seeborg denied a motion to temporarily suspend permission granted to the Department of Justice (DoJ) to offload 69,000 BTC, Bitcoin Gold ( BTG ), Bitcoin SV ( BSV ), Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), and other related assets seized by the government from the illicit Silk Road marketplace and valued at approximately $6.5 billion Depending on the exact details of the transactions, offloading such a quantity of cryptocurrencies could substantially impact market prices and could have led to a recent downturn. Why the DoJ is likely not behind the Bitcoin plunge Still, similar actions executed by various governments – Germany being a recent 2024 example – indicate that it is unlikely the DoJ is behind the Bitcoin price collapse. On the other hand, the timing of the ruling has raised eyebrows in certain segments of the community, with Donald Trump set to assume the presidency less than two weeks from press time on January 9 and less than a month after the court order was issued. In some ways, the decision appears like a show of spite toward the former and future commander-in-chief who previously promised to hold on to cryptocurrency – and particularly to all Bitcoin – acquired by the U.S. government, including through law enforcement or other similar actions. Though sitting presidents frequently use their final days in office to push through certain policies, it is worth pointing out that the DoJ’s Silk Road BTC has been subject to dispute for a long time, and it is more than likely that the timing, while superficially suspicious, is accidental. Bitcoin price dynamics Whatever the details of the Silk Road Bitcoin and its links with the downturn may be, not everyone is displeased with the current cryptocurrency market dynamics. To begin with, despite BTC trading at a relatively low $92,763 and being 3.17% in the red since 2025 started, it is worth remembering that the coin remains nearly 100% up in the last 12 months.

Amid the cheer, CoinDesk warned against being too optimistic, noting the undercurrents of sellers looking to reassert themselves. A week later, BTC has pulled back to $93,000 after failing to keep gains above $100,000 on Monday, CoinDesk data show. The latest downturn comes at a time of increased volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, where long-term yields have extended the Q4 2024 rally to hit multi-month highs due to economic data pointing to stubborn inflation in the U.S. It is not just nominal bond yields, the real or inflation-adjusted yields are creeping up too. The yield on the 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed security has jumped to 2.29%, the highest since November 2023, according to charting platform TradingView. When the yield offered by fixed-income products starts to look more attractive in real terms, the incentive to invest in risk assets diminishes. It's particularly true when the uptick in the yield is driven by hawkish Fed expectations rather than economic growth. That's precisely the case this week. With data pointing to sticky inflation, traders have pushed the timing of the next Fed rate cut to June. ""This morning's slide in the spot bitcoin price appears to be in response to higher yields in the Treasury market and the reduced likelihood of further rate cuts this year. This has impacted the short-term market outlook for crypto assets, which tend to fare better in more liquid conditions, ""Thomas Erdosi, head of product at CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk. Note that the yield spike is not just a U.S.-centric issue. Yields are spiking across the major economies with Japan and the U.K. joining the fray. The U.K. is experiencing its highest long-end yields since 1998. All this is impacting stocks, similar to what's happening with BTC. Major indices like the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have also lost their New Year gains. But here is a twist: Despite the macro uncertainties, BTC's Deribit-listed options market remains optimistic, with the dollar value of active calls tallying $14.87 billion at press time, nearly twice the value of active puts, according to data source Amberdata. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market while a put buyer is bearish. Moreover, the $120,000 strike call option remains the most popular, with a notional open interest of $1.47 billion. Calls at strikes $101,000 and $110,000 also boast an open interest of over $1 billion each. Meanwhile, the most popular put option at $75,000 has an open interest of $595 million. Overall, calls expiring after January continue to trade at a notable premium to puts, reflecting a bullish bias. ""We could potentially see a change in market fortunes by the end of this month. The inauguration of President Trump on Jan. 20, heralding an increased likelihood of a much more favorable regulatory environment for crypto, could be a key driver in crypto market sentiment,"" Erdosi added.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-09 13:58:52

Table of Contents MiCA fully comes into force What exactly is MiCA, and why was it introduced? How crypto companies are adapting to MiCA Expert insights: What MiCA means for crypto companies A long road ahead MiCA fully comes into force On December 30, 2024, the European Union rolled out the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, setting a unified rulebook for the EU crypto industry. The journey began on April 20, 2023, when the EU Parliament adopted MiCA to tackle issues like fraud, market collapses, and the lack of investor protection that had long troubled the fast-growing crypto space. Before MiCA, crypto businesses faced a patchwork of national regulations. Some countries encouraged innovation, while others threw up roadblocks. MiCA changes that by replacing fragmented rules with a single, harmonized framework for all 27 EU member states. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the U.S. is preparing for a crypto shake-up of its own. President-elect Donald Trump, set to begin his second term on Jan. 20, has declared his intention to make America the “crypto capital” of the world. In a series of high-profile appointments, Trump has tapped Silicon Valley veteran David Sacks as the White House’s AI and crypto “czar,” alongside Bo Hines, the newly named executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. Together, they aim to guide the U.S. toward crypto dominance. As crypto momentum gains pace, what does this mean for the industry, for companies, and for the millions of investors? To answer that, let’s break down the core of MiCA, why it was brought in, and how it’s reshaping the game. What exactly is MiCA, and why was it introduced? MiCA’s purpose is to regulate the crypto sector like any other major financial industry while boosting innovation. The framework focuses on three key areas—issuance of crypto-assets, services provided by crypto platforms, and stablecoins—bringing much-needed structure to a once-chaotic environment. Here’s how it works: Issuance and offering of crypto-assets MiCA sets the gold standard for transparency. Companies issuing tokens—whether exchange tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ), utility tokens, or stablecoins —must disclose their business models, risks, and governance structures. This ensures that investors aren’t left guessing about what they’re putting their money into. Regulation of crypto service providers Platforms like exchanges and wallets, which serve as the backbone of the crypto ecosystem, now have to register with the European Banking Authority. They must meet rigorous standards for security, governance, and risk management. These measures not only protect users but also elevate the credibility of the entire sector. Stablecoins (ARTs and EMTs): Stablecoins, such as asset-referenced tokens and electronic money tokens, face the toughest scrutiny under MiCA. Issuers must maintain sufficient reserves, implement buyback mechanisms, and comply with strict disclosure requirements. Starting June 30, issuers of ART and EMT will need to provide sustainability disclosures. By the end of the year, crypto service providers must also begin requesting these disclosures as part of the new requirements. Why now? MiCA arrives at a time when crypto has outgrown its “Wild West” reputation. The sector has matured into a multi-trillion-dollar industry with real-world implications for finance, technology, and even geopolitics. Yet, its rapid growth has exposed vulnerabilities—scams, unstable markets, and a lack of investor protection. MiCA addresses these challenges head-on by focusing on these key goals. Failure to comply with MiCA’s requirements won’t be taken lightly. Companies risk hefty fines, and non-compliant entities may even face operational bans across the EU. For some, this will mean rethinking their strategies entirely. For others, MiCA represents an opportunity to operate in one of the most secure and transparent crypto markets in the world. How crypto companies are adapting to MiCA The rollout of the MiCA regulations has prompted a wave of activity across Europe’s cryptocurrency industry. Companies are adjusting to the new framework, with some securing licenses to operate under the stricter rules, while others face compliance uncertainties. Four companies have already secured their MiCA licenses in the Netherlands, granting them the ability to operate across the EU’s 27 member states. The licenses were issued by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets. The companies include: MoonPay, a crypto payment platform, is now equipped to offer its services across the EU. BitStaete, a digital asset management firm, which can expand its reach to institutional and retail investors. ZBD is a fintech company leveraging Bitcoin’s Lightning Network for fast and low-cost transactions. Hidden Road is a prime brokerage and clearing firm focused on institutional crypto services. The four companies join the ranks of firms like Circle and Socios.com in obtaining regulatory approval through the EU’s new framework. However, not all companies have had a smooth transition under MiCA. In mid-December, U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase delisted Tether ( USDT ), citing compliance concerns with MiCA’s requirements. Despite the delisting, USDT remains available on other European exchanges, though its market capitalization has dropped by over 1% since MiCA came into force. USDT’s market cap, which was $141 billion on Dec. 19, has since fallen to $137.5 billion as of Jan. 8. The lack of clear regulatory guidance from EU authorities has left many exchanges in a wait-and-see position regarding USDT’s compliance. Tether, as the largest stablecoin issuer, faces increasing scrutiny over its reserve transparency. The impact of MiCA on its operations and those of similar issuers remains a critical area to watch as the regulation takes hold. Expert insights: What MiCA means for crypto companies With MiCA now in full force, crypto companies across the EU are bracing for changes. To gain deeper insights into the practical challenges and opportunities presented by this landmark regulation, crypto.news reached out to industry leaders who shared their thoughts on the immediate implications, long-term impacts, and potential hurdles in implementation. Here’s what they had to say. Operational and financial overhaul MiCA’s implementation has placed high demands on crypto companies, requiring substantial changes to their internal operations. From compliance upgrades to resource reallocation, the regulation is forcing businesses to restructure to meet its requirements making it a costly affair. Daria Morgen, Head of Research at Changelly, summarized the magnitude of these changes: “MiCA’s operational demands extend beyond simple policy adjustments—they represent a structural transformation for many crypto companies. Businesses will need to overhaul compliance teams, refine financial workflows, and invest heavily in advanced reporting systems.” Similarly, Chuck Zhang, CFO at PolyFlow, pointed to the financial burden associated with these changes: “Immediate impacts are going to be a significant amount of operations/reporting/compliance cost for operators in this space. The licensing requirements are stringent, but it does cover all EU member states. The reserve and liquidity adequacy is meant to provide a stable financial system and protect daily users, but will introduce more cost for companies in terms of its internal capital management.” For companies registered in countries like Poland and Czechia, which previously offered relatively lenient registration processes, the challenges are even more pronounced. Slava Demchuk, CEO of AMLBot, explained: “Currently, it’s relatively easy to secure VASP registration in certain EU countries with minimal requirements, but this will change in 2025. Many of these companies will not be able to meet MiCA’s uniform requirements. Based on past experiences in Estonia, where stricter rules led to the loss of around 1,500 VASP registrations, similar challenges are likely across the EU.” Relocation vs. retention MiCA’s comprehensive framework has sparked debate over whether crypto companies might relocate to less regulated jurisdictions like the UAE, UK, or USA. The decision to stay or move often hinges on the size and resources of the business. Morgen believes the EU’s stability will keep established players rooted, despite the allure of friendlier regulatory environments: “Yes, MiCA’s strict compliance requirements may push some crypto businesses to consider relocating to jurisdictions like the UAE, UK, or USA. However, the EU’s unified market and legal certainty remain strong incentives for established players to stay. While smaller firms might explore relocation, major players are more likely to adapt.” Zhang agrees but talks about the challenges smaller companies face. “This is going to hit small players a lot more as they aren’t equipped to handle the compliance and operational costs. I do expect some operators exiting to less stringent locales, but I hope the EU fosters a collaborative regulatory environment to retain innovation.” MiCA’s effect on innovation A critical question is whether MiCA will stifle or stimulate innovation within the EU. While some see the regulation as a pathway to stability, others worry it may discourage experimentation, particularly for startups with limited resources. Morgen highlighted this dual-edged nature: “MiCA holds the potential to create an environment where long-term innovation in the EU crypto sector can flourish. But compliance costs and strict oversight might slow down experimentation, especially for smaller startups that lack resources.” Zhang added that while regulatory clarity is valuable, overregulation could have unintended consequences: “In the long run, a collaborative and well-defined regulatory framework will bring stability to the crypto space. However, the short-term pain could include a brain drain, as smaller innovators might struggle to thrive under MiCA’s costs and complexities.” Friction in implementation Although MiCA aims to unify crypto regulations across the EU, its success depends on how well member states align with the framework. Experts expect delays and inconsistencies in its rollout, which could create an uneven compliance landscape. Morgen pointed to the challenges larger companies may face: “Larger companies could struggle with cross-border inconsistencies, as some EU member states lag in aligning their national legislation with MiCA standards. This could create an uneven compliance landscape.” Zhang highlighted the lack of precedent and expertise, which adds another layer of difficulty. “The relatively new nature of the regulation means there’s a lack of legal precedence and experts in navigating the rules. For crypto, both operators and regulators are relatively new to this, so there’s going to be a lot of discovery and conflicts as they figure it out along the way.” A long road ahead Ultimately, MiCA’s impact on Europe’s crypto sector will depend on how effectively companies adapt and how consistently the regulation is enforced across member states. MiCA will standardize compliance requirements across the EU, which is a huge positive. But many smaller VASPs may not survive the transition, especially those in countries where lenient registration processes previously prevailed. While MiCA’s long-term benefits include clarity and stability, the road to compliance is fraught with challenges. Whether the EU can strike the right balance between oversight and innovation will determine how the regulation shapes the future of the crypto industry.",Feature|Exclusive|European Union|Mica|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-09 13:59:01

As of today, January 9, 2024, XRP, along with other top assets, seems to be in decline. Where Will XRP Price Find Support? Meanwhile, you might be wondering where the price of XRP will fall, where it has found support, what the crucial levels are, and much more. Notably, XRP is one of those cryptocurrencies that typically doesn’t experience a significant price decline compared to other major assets after a crash, thanks to its strong fundamentals. Bullish Developments Offer Hope However, a recent meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty with President-elect Donald Trump offers hope for potential future gains in XRP’s price. Additionally, this meeting, taking place before Trump’s inauguration, is certainly a bullish sign. The potential launch of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) this year, as mentioned by Monica Long, has also helped the token remain stable. Additionally, a Paris-based market-making firm, Woorton, stated, “We’re seeing a bias toward buying XRP from our franchise this week, mainly from retail brokers and crypto-native funds.” This positive development surrounding XRP has the potential to boost the token’s price, but market sentiment is suppressing its impact. Currently, XRP appears weak and may experience further price declines in the coming days, which could present an opportunity to add it to your holdings. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XRP is poised to break yesterday’s low, signaling a bearish trend. Based on recent price action, if XRP closes a daily candle below the previous one, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 8%, reaching the support level of $2. Source: Trading View This level could serve as a potential rebound point. On a larger time frame, XRP appears bullish, with this price decline likely being a correction and a potential accumulation zone. Long-term holders and whales remain optimistic about the altcoin, as they seem to be heavily accumulating the tokens. Current Price Momentum Currently, XRP is trading near $2.25 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.90% in the past 24 hours.

The deal will allow investors to finance DAMAC's portfolio companies spanning across various sectors including real estate development, hospitality and data centers. By tokenizing assets, the companies aim to streamline traditional investment processes while increasing accessibility for both retail and institutional investors. Details of which DAMAC properties will be tokenized and specifications of the offerings will be announced in the coming weeks, a MANTRA spokesperson told CoinDesk. The offerings will be available starting in early 2025, the press release said. Tokenization of real-world assets, the process of converting traditional assets like real estate, commodities, funds and securities into digital tokens that represents ownership on a blockchain, is gaining traction globally. Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring tokenization in pursuit of operational efficiency gains like speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. The RWA market could grow to trillions of dollars through this decade, various reports from McKinsey , BCG , 21Shares and Bernstein projected. ""Tokenizing our assets will provide investors with a secure, transparent and convenient way to access a wide range of investment opportunities,"" Amira Sajwani, managing director of DAMAC, said in a statement. MANTRA focuses on the Middle East region to bring a diverse range of traditional financial assets to its blockchain. Earlier this year, the it said it will tokenize $500 million worth of assets of Dubai-based real estate developer MAG Group. The network's mainnet launch took place in October, and its native token OM's market capitalization rose by nearly 200% over the past three months to $3.6 billion, CoinGecko data shows. DAMAC has a history of exploring ways to use blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies. In 2022, the firm began accepting cryptocurrency payments in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), aligning with the UAE’s ambitions to become a crypto hub. Notably, President-elect Donald Trump said earlier this week during a press conference that DAMAC laid out plans for a $20 billion investment in data centers across several U.S. states.",Finance|Tokenization|Real World Assets|Tokenized Assets|MANTRA|United Arab Emirates,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-09 14:00:13

Analysis Company Says ""Risk Continues"", Announces Expected Level!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-bitcoins-decline-continue-analysis-company-says-risk-continues-announces-expected-level/,"The hawkish stance in the FED minutes released last night deepened the decline in Bitcoin, while the US government's subsequent court permission to sell the Bitcoins seized from Silk Road affected the price even more negatively. The Bitcoin price fell below $93,000, creating fear among cryptocurrency investors. Evaluating this decline, Singapore-based crypto firm QCP Capital said that there is a possibility that the Bitcoin price may drop to $90,000. Stating that macroeconomic concerns have increased with the FED minutes last night showing an increasingly hawkish stance, QCP analysts said that this situation could continue to pull down Bitcoin and altcoin prices. While the Fed stated that it will slow down the pace of interest rate cuts due to increasing inflation risks, analysts said that if Bitcoin falls below $92,000, it could fall to $90,000. Analysts last noted that they expect Bitcoin to consolidate between $92,000 and $95,000 in the short term and prices to remain weak. “Bitcoin rallied to $95,200 last night after successfully retesting the key $92,500 support. However, there was a decline again earlier today after news broke that the US government had granted permission to sell BTC seized from Silk Road. Bitcoin and crypto prices continue to be dragged down by adverse macroeconomic headwinds as the Federal Reserve Minutes released last night reveal an increasingly hawkish stance. FED members stated that they will slow down the pace of interest rate cuts due to increasing inflation risks. US markets will be closed today, so we expect prices to remain weak and move between $92,000 and $95,000 for a while. However, if Bitcoin falls below $92,000, it could lead to the $90,000 level being seen. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will Bitcoin's Decline Continue?

Dubbed Sony’s “Future Immersive Entertainment Concept” (FIEC), the system was demonstrated using the popular title The Last of Us , captivating attendees with its sensory-forward approach to gaming. The CES showcase featured a large cube made of high-definition Crystal LED panels, immersing participants by allowing them to step into their favorite games. Alongside the visual experience, the system integrates atmospheric elements to indulge players in the game world. Sony seeks immersion without VR headsets According to developers, Sony’s FIEC will seemingly eliminate the need for bulky Virtual Reality headsets. It relies on its proprietary Crystal LED technology to project ultra-high-definition visuals paired with synchronized environmental enhancements like scent and sound. The electronics company emphasized its position as a leader in entertainment technology, stating, “ We have many more stories for you to explore. ” Sony’s demonstration used The Last of Us , an acclaimed action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world. Players explored a dystopian landscape filled with hostile creatures known as “ the infected ” and experienced the sights, sounds, and even smells of the game’s environment. The Last of Us continuation is still “cloudy” The Last of Us game by Naughty Dog Studios has two installments, Part I and Part II , complemented by some downloadable content. The Last of Us Part II was the franchise’s last major installment. The team was initially working on a multiplayer spinoff titled The Last of Us Online . However, the project has since been abandoned, and Naughty Dog is focusing on other projects, such as its upcoming sci-fi title, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet . Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet follows Jordan A. Mun, a skilled bounty hunter stranded on the remote planet of Sempiria. The game, which Naughty Dog revealed has been in development since 2020, features a soundtrack composed by talented musical artists Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The Last of US series remains a flagship property for Sony , who have remastered both installments to fit into new-gen console Playstation 5 remakes. Enthusiasts are hoping Naughty Dog will announce a third installment of the game, as Studio Head Druckmann hinted that the story is not over yet. Hyperkin’s DualSense-inspired controller for Xbox In other gaming hardware news, Hyperkin unveiled a wired controller for Xbox and PC that takes clear inspiration from Sony’s DualSense controller. Named the Competitor, it mimics DualSense’s symmetrical analog stick layout, transparent buttons, and ergonomic design. Hyperkin announced that the controller will be available in two versions: a sleek black model and a white-faced variant with two-tone aesthetics. It also includes rear-facing inputs for added functionality. While the Competitor bears a strong resemblance to the DualSense , it lacks some of the nuanced haptic feedback features that set Sony’s controller apart. The DualSense offers features like adaptive triggers and dynamic vibrations, which have made tactile feedback a part of gaming. The Competitor, however, appeals to Xbox and PC users looking for premium design and build quality. Although the release date and pricing remain undisclosed, the controller adds to Hyperkin’s lineup of gaming peripherals, including its retro-inspired Duke controller for Xbox systems.

Lava is a novel protocol providing users with a fast and reliable experience interacting with blockchain apps. At the heart of the system is the LAVA ($LAVA) token, which routes user traffic, such as DeFi transactions and data queries, between wallets, data providers, and blockchains. LAVA holders are integral to the network, staking their tokens to direct traffic to the fastest and most reliable providers. This drives superior performance and scalability across 40+ chains, with Lava processing over 100 billion transaction requests to date , making LAVA an essential tool for maintaining a high-performing network with minimal downtime. Key integrations with Lava Network include leading dApps and enterprises such as Keplr, Paraswap, Axelar, and Hypernative, all of which depend on LAVA to keep their user traffic flowing smoothly and efficiently. Strong Fundamentals Behind $LAVA Lava’s rapid growth is backed by its robust fundamentals. Since its Mainnet pre-launch in late July 2024 , the network has secured over $3.5 million in ARR and $1m+ in onchain revenue. Its tokenomics model fosters long-term value: LAVA’s supply is capped at 1 billion tokens, with no inflationary mechanisms. All investor and team allocations are locked until 2026. LAVA’s tokenomics include a monthly burn mechanism that dynamically adjusts to attract more data providers to the network, with 1.5% of the total token supply burned so far. Lava also offers a first-of-its-kind revenue-sharing model where contributors can potentially earn rewards directly in the native tokens of supported blockchains. Over $1 million is currently being distributed in native tokens such as AXL, NEAR, and USDC, to LAVA stakers and data providers for securing and optimizing the protocol. Staking rewards can be explored at pools.lavanet.xyz, offering users a direct incentive to participate in the network’s growth. “Blockchains are digital cities with their own economies,” said Amir Aaronson, Head of the Lava Foundation. “As humans and AI agents increasingly move onchain, they need reliable roads to carry their transactions and data. $LAVA powers these roads, ensuring the free flow of digital commerce. Owning a piece of the Lava Network is like owning a share in the infrastructure that keeps these cities running.” Magma Devs, a contributor to Lava, raised $15M from prominent investors such as Hashkey, Tribe, and Jump, while Lava Foundation secured over $11M in a private token round from leading founders and community members from Cosmos, Polkadot, Filecoin, and NEAR. Lava is positioned as the protocol managing traffic from AI agents and dapps on every blockchain. For more information, users can visit lavanet.xyz .

Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) has recently faced a substantial price decline, dropping -44.69% over the past month and -9.24% in the last week. The current trading range is between $1.82 and $2.30, sitting close to the nearest support level at $1.54. Technical indicators point to bearish control, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 29.27 and a Stochastic value of 17.44, both suggesting oversold conditions. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.0535, reinforcing the downward trend. Despite this, the oversold indicators hint at a possible bullish reversal. If buying interest increases, the price could challenge the nearest resistance level at $2.49, representing an approximate 20% rise from the current average price. Surpassing this point might lead to a move toward the second resistance at $2.97, indicating a potential gain of around 44%. With the anticipated altcoin season and a broader market uptrend on the horizon, Dogwifhat may find the momentum to climb back up. Mog Coin (MOG) Mog Coin (MOG) is trading between $0.0000022406 and $0.0000032416. In the past week, its price increased by 4.79%. Over the last month, it experienced a drop of 38.85%, but it has gained 33.88% in the past six months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 29.14, indicating that the coin may be oversold. This suggests that selling pressure could be decreasing, and buying interest might be returning. The nearest resistance level is $0.0000035923. If Mog Coin moves above this point, it could target the next resistance at $0.0000045933. This would represent an increase of about 31% and 68% from the average current price, respectively. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is slightly negative, while the Stochastic indicator is neutral at 45.99. The coin’s price is also above its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, hinting at possible upward momentum. These factors together suggest that Mog Coin could see growth if positive trends continue. SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 (SPX) has seen significant price movement recently. Over the past month, its price has increased by over 110%, and in the last week alone, it has risen by nearly 36%. Currently trading between $1.05 and $1.77, the coin is showing signs of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 36.68, indicating that it is nearing oversold territory. The stochastic oscillator is also low at 17.12, suggesting that selling pressure may be diminishing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.0251, showing that bearish momentum may be slowing. Looking ahead, SPX6900 faces its nearest resistance level at $2.03. Breaking through this could open the path to the second resistance at $2.76, representing potential gains from current levels. The distance to the first resistance level from the current price range could offer an increase of over 15%, while reaching the second resistance could mean a substantial rise. The coin’s Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) over 10 and 100 days are close, indicating a potential for a trend reversal. Given the significant growth over the past six months, with an impressive increase of nearly 981%, there may be further room for upward movement as the market prepares for the next altcoin season. Turbo (TURBO) Turbo (TURBO) is trading between $0.009018 and $0.010910. Over the last week, its price dropped by 9.17%, and over the past month, it decreased by 21.54%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.43, indicating the asset is nearing oversold territory. The MACD level is negative, suggesting bearish momentum. However, the price is above the 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $0.00839 and close to the 100-day SMA of $0.00952, which may act as support levels. The nearest resistance is at $0.0117. If Turbo breaks this level, it could move toward the next resistance at $0.0136. From the current price, reaching $0.0136 would be an increase of around 40%. The stochastic indicator is at 68.27, implying there is room for upward movement before overbought conditions. With many expecting an upcoming altcoin season, Turbo may see growth as buyers return to the market.

The rate cut could mark the end of a series of rate cuts initiated by the Fed since September. The central bank cut rates by 50 bps in September, 25 bps in November, and another 25 bps in December, as anticipated by analysts. Powel acknowledged that U.S. inflation has significantly improved since 2022. However, he cautioned that Trump’s incoming tariff policies, immigration regulations, and tax proposals could impact inflation, prompting the Fed to adjust the rates accordingly. Trump’s tariff policies could spike inflation in the U.S. According to the Fed chair, experts believe that Trump’s promised policies could increase inflation pressures, prompting the Fed to adjust interest rates accordingly. He also explained that the Federal Open Market Committee was investigating how tariffs can affect inflation once implemented by the incoming president. On January 8th, the ADP employment survey revealed a declining trend in hiring and wage gains. The trend reinforces the prevailing macro uncertainty. However, Tuesday’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data painted a different narrative showcasing a stronger labour market. The scale appears to be falling on the bearish sentiment side, which aligns with the broader crypto market outlook. According to data from the crypto data aggregating platform CoinGecko, Bitcoin has declined by 1.6% in the last 24 hours, adding to its seven-day dip of 3.2%, as traders and short-term crypto investors react to the prevailing market conditions. Bitcoin appears to be trading within a daily range that has been holding since 26 November last year. The range further cements the uncertainty in the markets ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on 20th January. Data from CoinGecko shows that the global crypto market capitalization has declined by 3.1%, settling at 3.4 trillion at the time of this publication. Speculations on the U.S. government liquidating its Bitcoin stash arise The uncertainty is also fueled by rumours that the U.S. government could liquidate its Bitcoin stash worth approximately $6.5 billion. The Northern District Court of California allegedly gave the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) the green light to liquidate 69,370 Bitcoin. The court’s ruling was handed down by the chief U.S. district judge Richard Seeborg, who also denied a motion to obstruct the forfeiture of the assets, according to court filings dated 30 December. The liquidation could trigger market volatility and add to the ongoing bearish sentiment in the crypto sector. Trump promised the crypto community he would not liquidate the government-held Bitcoin while speaking at the Bitcoin Conference 2024. However, the current Biden-Harris administration still holds authority over the assets and could begin liquidating the digital assets at any time until Trump is sworn in.

The hard drive contains Bitcoin, which was mined in 2009. It was mistakenly disposed of and later found its way into a landfill. The Newport Authorities denied James Howells access to the dumping ground due to the hazardous nature of the area and environmental permit restrictions. While rejecting the case, Judge Keyser said the case had “no realistic prospect” of going to full trial and succeeding. Howells has submitted several requests to the authorities since 2013 to access the site and find the hard drive. He even offered to share part of the missing BTC if he found the hard drive. Howell’s case became popular in 2024, when Bitcoin experienced historic growth to reach $100,000, making over 130% yearly profits. James Howells is still chasing the fortune he lost 12 years ago James Howells is among the earliest adopters of BTC. In 2009, when BTC nearly cost nothing, he mined 8,000 Bitcoins. In 2013, when Bitcoin was valued at about $13, he accidentally disposed of the Bitcoin drive with all the Bitcoin intact. Since he noticed the loss, Howell has consistently tried to redeem the drive from the garbage site. Twelve years later, Bitcoin’s value has gone up almost 704,000 times, and Howell is optimistic he can find the drive. For more than a decade, the IT engineer has attempted to recover his lost Bitcoins fortune, trying different negotiation tactics with Newport City Authorities for a nod to access the landfill. However, he has always gotten negative feedback. On October 11 2024, the Newport City Council said it had communicated to Howells several times, telling him that excavation is impossible under its environmental permit due to “huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area.” On the other hand, Howells accused the local authorities of breaching environmental laws, claiming that he had 100 independent sets of evidence to support his claims. He claims that his evidence points to the council breaching its landfill permit by leaching arsenic, asbestos, ammonium nitrate and methane gases into the local environment.

The event could signal a significant start to 2025 for Ripple amid ongoing shifts in the cryptocurrency market. Ripple’s Promising Start to 2025 Garlinghouse shared the news in a January 7 post on X, describing the evening as a “strong” start to the new year. “Great dinner last night with Donald Trump and Stuart Alderoty,” the CEO said, sharing a picture of himself, his chief attorney, and the President-elect. In a separate post, Alderoty added some light-hearted commentary, claiming, “The beef bourguignon was really good.” The meeting follows recent reports of Ripple achieving a final victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in their high-profile legal battle dating back to 2020. Pro XRP attorney John E. Deaton has described the financial watchdog’s lawsuit as overreaching and harmful to the crypto firm’s operations. It has seen several developments and partial wins for the company, with Alderoty sharing a post on X hinting at finally beating the regulator, causing excitement within the crypto community about Ripple’s future. The development also comes as Donald Trump prepares to assume office. Garlinghouse recently revealed a strategic hiring shift, with 75% of Ripple’s current open positions now based in the United States. This contrasts with the previous four years, during which regulatory pressures from the SEC, under Gary Gensler, forced the firm to expand primarily outside the U.S. He attributed this post-election surge in crypto activity to the so-called “Trump bull market,” noting that the improved climate since his reelection has allowed Ripple to refocus on domestic growth. Political Discussions and Growing Presence The Mar-a-Lago dinner also aligns with broader discussions between political figures and cryptocurrency leaders. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a proponent of blockchain, has been in active discussions with Paul Atkins, who is set to become the SEC Chairman under President-elect Trump. Their talks center on reforming the agency’s regulatory framework to support digital asset innovation. Meanwhile, Ripple’s market presence continues to strengthen. XRP has emerged as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the past week, with several market watchers predicting significant price gains. Captain Faibik, a cryptocurrency analyst, recently projected a potential 50% price surge for the token, while others anticipate a new all-time high of $4. The firm is also expanding its product offerings, with President Monica Long announcing that RLUSD will be listed on more exchanges. Ripple has also partnered with Chainlink to integrate secure and accurate RLUSD pricing into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. With its growing presence, changing regulatory environment, and positive market indicators, 2025 could yet shape up to be as strong a year for the company as its CEO suggested over beef bourguignon with Donald Trump.

Although this development provides a bullish outlook for these coins, they have experienced significant price drops due to the current bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market. Notably, these declines come amid Bitcoin dipping below the $92K mark. Phala Network (PHA) has seen a 13% drop in the last 24 hours, while Steem and Usual also experienced significant declines. While Binance’s move may bring enhanced liquidity and user engagement, the broader market conditions could still impact these coins’ potential to rally. Binance Unveils New Trading Pairs for PHA, STEEM, USUAL, and PLN On January 9, Binance’s announcement revealed new trading pairs for Phala Network, Steem, Usual, and Polish Zloty. The new pairs, PHA/USDC, STEEM/USDC, USUAL/USDC, and PLN/USDC, will be available for trading starting January 10 at 08:00 (UTC). This move further expands its trading options, catering to a wider range of users. The announcement also confirmed the introduction of trading bot services for these pairs. Notably, PLN represents the Polish Zloty, a fiat currency, not a digital asset. These trading bots will enhance user experience by enabling advanced trading strategies across Binance Spot. However, users in certain restricted regions, including the United States, Canada, and North Korea, will not be able to trade these pairs due to regulatory constraints. The leading crypto exchange, Binance, continues to prioritize compliance with international regulations to maintain a secure trading environment globally. Phala Network Expands Its Reach with Ethereum Layer 2 Solution Phala Network (PHA), a prominent player in Polkadot’s ecosystem, has launched a Layer 2 network on Ethereum. Developed in collaboration with Succinct Labs and Conduit, this rollup leverages OP Succinct technology, combining optimistic and zero-knowledge proofs. This transition allows PHA to connect with Ethereum’s robust user base while offering cryptographic computing solutions. The project introduces Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology for secure, private smart contracts. With this, Phala Network aims to expand its AI capabilities, enhancing privacy and reliability for decentralized applications. Notably, the recent listings of Phala’s perpetual contract on Binance triggered a 300% price surge, showcasing growing interest in the project’s innovative solutions. What’s Next For PHA, STEEM, And USUAL Coins Phala Network’s (PHA) price saw a 13% drop in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.2970. The token recorded a 24-hour low of $0.296 and a high of $0.365. With a market cap of $237 million and a trading volume of $152 million, PHA remains up 82% over the last month and 170% in the last quarter. PHA Price STEEM price traded at $0.3028, with a 24-hour range of $0.28–$0.36. The coin was up 26% this month and 70% over the last quarter. It has a $146 million market cap and $613 million in trading volume. However, USUAL price declined by 11%, trading at $0.65. It had a 24-hour low of $0.64 and a high of $0.75. The coin’s market cap stands at $341 million, with a $166 million trading volume, though it is down 36% in the past week. Binance previously delisted trading pairs for Axelar (AXL), Coin98 (C98), and Enjin (ENJ) led to price declines for these tokens, as delisting reduces liquidity and market access. However, Binance’s listing of new pairs for tokens like PHA, STEEM, and USUAL could have the opposite effect. Listings on major exchanges generally improve token visibility, liquidity, and investor confidence, potentially resulting in price rallies. In other words, these tokens are expected to witness recovery ahead, given the exchange’s strong dominance in the market.

Rexas Finance , Avalanche, and Sui (SUI) are great options for 2025. These altcoins combine advanced technology, mass adoption, and innovation, making them strong investment opportunities with high-yield prospects. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Foremost Leader in Tokenization Real assets investment faces challenges such as high costs of entry. Rexas Finance addresses this issue and is revolutionizing how we approach high-value investments through blockchain technology via asset tokenization. By removing traditional barriers, the company increases opportunities for more people to own wealth by converting assets into digital tokens. The presale of the Rexas Finance project has been successful so far. RXS has already raised over $35 million and sold more than 390 million tokens to the public. The presale is in its 11th stage, with one token priced at $0.175, up from the initial price of $0.03 in the first stage. This steady growth shows investors believe in the project’s innovative model and future potential. Rexas Finance stands out in its effort to provide access to high-value markets. Assets such as real estate once concentrated in wealthy hands, are now accessible to retail investors through RXS, allowing for fractional ownership, diversification, and consistent earnings. A CertiK audit assures security and transparency, boosting the project’s credibility. Listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko enhance its profile, making RXS attractive to general and strategic investors. Forecasts suggest that RXS could reach $5 by late 2025 due to increasing adoption and demand for tokenized assets. Avalanche (AVAX): Positioned for a Post-Correction Rally AVAX has proven itself to be highly effective in developing apps. Following a market correction, analysts believe AVAX will demonstrate resilience. Currently, AVAX is trading between $33.90 and $42.50. CoinMarketCap shows an 8.50% dip on the weekly chart. Analyst Lucky predicts that Avalanche could surge to between $150 and $200 in the coming months. AMCrypto also suggests that the prolonged correction is ending, indicating market conditions are ripe for a price rally. Due to increasing adoption and market growth, AVAX is expected to reach $75 by February 2025. AVAX has remained neutral in sentiment, with indicators like the Relative Strength Index hovering around the midline. Price patterns suggest a potential breakout or consolidation. Avalanche’s innovative consensus mechanism, which enhances scalability, positions it as a top contender in the 2025 market. With improving market conditions and consolidation patterns, AVAX offers strong potential. Any portfolio seeking diversification into cryptocurrencies should consider AVAX, which is expected to skyrocket in the coming months. Sui (SUI): Another Blockchain To Add To Your Wishlist Investing in Sui will yield good profits. Last week, the token touched new highs, reaching $4.93, bringing its market capitalization to $12 billion. Despite a weekly decline of -12.80%, SUI has risen 18.45% this month and 396.52% over the past year. Analyst Ash Crypto forecasts that SUI could reach a low of $6 and a high of $8 in the coming weeks. Analyst Mags predicts that SUI could climb as high as $40 during this cycle. These optimistic forecasts are based on Sui’s steady price traction and increasing adoption. Sui stands out due to its ability to remain stable around its highs, reflecting investor confidence. It is close to surpassing Shiba Inu in market cap, giving it a competitive edge among altcoins. Investing in SUI offers exposure to a rapidly emerging asset with significant growth potential. Sui has strong fundamentals and a positive market outlook. With the right strategies, it has a bright future in 2025. Its resilience and momentum make SUI an attractive short-term and long-term investment option. Conclusion As the bull market continues, Rexas Finance, Avalanche, and Sui stand out as the best cryptocurrencies to consider in 2025. Each of these altcoins offers unique strengths and opportunities. For investors looking to benefit from the next phase of the bull market, these three tokens combine innovation, resilience, and growth potential. Diversifying across RXS, AVAX, and SUI could maximize your chances of achieving substantial returns in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

Because of its emphasis on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization—that is, the blockchain trading of physical objects like real estate and intellectual property— RXS has drawn notable interest. This invention releases excellent value for investors by bridging the gap between distributed technology and conventional finance. Rexas Finance's ecosystem also includes a token builder and launchpad, facilitating flawless token generation and project launches. Already showing excellent investor confidence, RXS has raised over $35 million in its presale and sold over 390.9 million tokens. Analysts estimate that RXS might reach $10 in 2025. Hence, it is a strong candidate for life-changing profits. Cardano (ADA): An Actual Giant on a Discount ADA is reasonably priced at $0.86 as of this writing. Despite its well-known reputation, it is accessible to a broad spectrum of investors. Strong blockchain architecture built with scalability and sustainability defines Cardano's strength. ADA is positioned for ongoing expansion, given its recent concentration on distributed finance (DeFi) and the forthcoming Hydra upgrade to boost transaction rates. ADA is still underappreciated about its potential, which offers a great starting place for long-term believers. Jupiter (JUP): A Decentralized Solutions Hidden Gem Jupiter does not seem to be as popular as some of its peers but it does have much to offer to investors. Leveraging blockchain technology to guarantee privacy and efficiency, the platform is concentrated on safe conversations and data sharing. JUP, priced at $0.84 as of this writing, presents a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for those who see the future of distributed communications. Given the growing need for privacy-oriented blockchain solutions, Jupiter has excellent potential to rise, rewarding early adopters with outstanding rewards. Polygon (POL): Enormous Potential Layer-2 Leader In crypto, polygon has been revolutionary since it offers Ethereum a layer-2 scaling solution addressing congestion and excessive transaction fees. Its simple architecture has drawn hundreds of distributed apps (dApps) and confirmed its standing among the most developer-friendly environments. Given its long-term promise, POL is currently a steal at $0.47. Since Polygon's scaling solutions complement Ethereum's expansion, its value is predicted to rise as the demand for effective blockchain technology grows. Arbitrum (ARB), Precision Scaling Ethereum Another Ethereum layer-2 solution that is becoming popular for low transaction costs and efficiency is Arbitrum. Without sacrificing security, its optimistic roll-up technology speeds up and more reasonably costs Ethereum's capabilities. Since its airdrop, ARB has been preferred by Ethereum enthusiasts and DeFi players. Given its network's fast expansion of distributed apps, ARB will likely be adopted even more. For those looking to expose themselves to the future of scalable blockchain technology, it is an excellent choice at the present price. Why These Tokens Are Poised for Massive Gains Although the larger crypto market is cyclical, some projects shine during altcoin seasons thanks to their distinctive value propositions, robust ecosystems, and rising acceptance. Leading this group with its creative approach to RWA tokenization and the inexpensive entry price is Rexas Finance (RXS). Established players such as Polygon (POL) and Cardano (ADA) provide scalability and stability, guaranteeing consistent increases. With their emphasis on Ethereum scaling and blockchain-based communication, Jupiter (JUP) and Arbitrum (ARB) vary the mix. These five cryptocurrencies, taken together, offer a well-rounded approach for short-term gains maximizing strategy. Final Thoughts Although turning $950 into $95,000 in weeks sounds ambitious, the crypto market has shown historically to be able to yield outsized gains. Investors can set themselves up for remarkable gains during the forthcoming bull market by carefully choosing high-potential altcoins such as Rexas Finance(RXS), Cardano(ADA), Jupiter(JUP), Polygon(POL), and Arbitrum(ARB). Among these, Rexas Finance is the most intriguing prospect since its low presale price and great expansion possibilities suggest. As always, crypto investments include dangers; hence, it is imperative to do extensive study and only make investments within your means of loss. But 2025 might be a transforming year for your portfolio with the correct token mix.

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-09 15:45:00

Perhaps the best way to decentralize the Bitcoin network is through home mining, and things are trending in the right direction. Yesterday, Solo Satoshi announced the Bitaxe Touch, the latest device in the world of home bitcoin mining. This new device will utilize the BM1370 ASIC chip from the Bitmain S21 Pro and will be able to reach a hashrate of up to 1.6 TH/s. It will also feature a touch screen that displays Bitcoin network stats including the total network hashrate, overall network difficulty and the block height. Say hello to the future of Bitcoin home mining. The world’s first open source touch screen Bitcoin miner. Built on top of Bitaxe and AxeOS, this device marks another chapter in the Open Source Bitcoin Mining Revolution. Solo Satoshi presents: The Bitaxe Touch. pic.twitter.com/8AVCBvfCRo — Solo Satoshi ™⚡️ (@SoloSatoshi) January 8, 2025 Part of what’s fueling innovation like the Bitaxe Touch is the work of Open Source Miners United, a Discord group started by Skot from Bitaxe with over 5,500 members where home mining enthusiasts share ideas and blueprints for new devices. The group has been set up so that anyone who wants to contribute to the development of the Bitaxe project can do so, and it even offers grants to certain contributors. The work of such contributors will likely be made easier when Block releases its own ASIC chip , which mining device developers will be able to use in their machines. And for those of you who aren’t so technically-inclined but who still want to get into the home mining space (and who live in colder climates), you can always purchase a Heatbit , which is essentially a plug-and-play home mining device that also serves as a space heater and an air purifier. Even with all of these new devices coming to market, I still believe we’re in the early innings of the home bitcoin mining movement and that this space will continue to blossom as more developers and everyday people enter into it. Indeed, the future of home mining is looking bright.",Takes|Bitaxe|Block|Home Mining|Bitcoin mining|Bitcoin Miner|Heatbit|Takes,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-01-09 15:48:40

Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the broader cryptocurrency market buckled on Jan. 9, extending a multi-day downturn with the total digital asset sector down 4% to $3.37 trillion in 24 hours. A QCP Capital researcher wrote on Telegram that macro headwinds weighed on crypto prices after minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting shared late on Wednesday, Jan. 8. Fed governor Christopher J. Waller said the central bank would stagger any further rate cuts to curtail rising inflation risks. The Fed indicated that they will slow down the pace of rate cuts given that the risks of inflation have increased. Yesterday’s ADP employment survey also added to macro uncertainty, showing a slowdown in both private sector hiring and wage gains. This heavily contrasted with Tuesday’s JOLTS jobs openings which painted a stronger labour market. QCP Capital on crypto downslide You might also like: Mark Cuban chooses Bitcoin over Gold as economic hedge After a rebound to $95,200, Bitcoin fell below its key support level of $92,500. QCP noted that BTC could consolidate between $92,000 and $95,000 until the next rally. It could also visit the $90,000 level if $92,000 is breached, the trading desk said. 24-hour BTC price chart – Jan. 9 | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin could also face selling pressure from the U.S. government, as the Department of Justice reportedly approved $6.5 billion of seized Silk Road BTC for sale. The DOJ’s decision came shortly before the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Some crypto advocates speculated on the timing of the DOJ’s announcement due to Trump’s promises to halt all government BTC sales and establish a national reserve. Yet, the impact of such a sale may be short-term due to demand from institutional giants like MicroStrategy and spot BTC exchange-traded funds on Wall Street. Trillion-dollar wealth manager Fidelity also expects more countries, companies, and governments to buy Bitcoin in 2025, which may boost market prices.

Bitcoin formed lows below $92,000 after falling to sustain above the gains. Meanwhile, the latest rejection from $4100 appears to have largely impacted the Ethereum price rally as the token is expected to lose support at $300. On the other hand, the trader’s interest in the token has faded to a large extent as the transaction count and volume have depleted. Active address count is an indicator that sheds light on the traffic over the platform, which in turn impacts the volatility of the token. A rise in the levels suggests an increase in the buy, sell, or swap trade over the platform, which may either increase or decrease the price. This change in prices attracts fresh volume over the token that is usually in favour of the bulls. Unfortunately, these levels have been declining since the last few days of 2024 and despite a rebound, it continued to form lower highs and lows. This indicates a massive drop in the trader’s participation, due to which a notable drop in the transaction count has also been recorded. With this, the price is expected to maintain a consolidated trend and as the bearish influence over the markets has increased, the ETH price is expected to undergo a 10% pullback soon. The weekly price action suggests the price is on its way to test the immediate support zone below $3000 between $2929 and $2814. However, a rebound is expected after reaching these levels that may elevate the levels back to $4000. This may complete the inverse head & shoulder pattern, which may further trigger a huge 50% upswing to mark fresh highs somewhere above $6500. Previously, when the Ethereum (ETH) price broke down from the neckline of the head & shoulder pattern, that triggered a 60% pullback, forming the lows below $1000. Therefore, a reverse effect now may initiate a similar upswing to form a new ATH in the upcoming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 15:51:17

Crucial SOL bullish predictions have slipped as the coin has formed several risky chart patterns. So, will it bounce back on January 9 or will the downtrend continue? Solana Price Support and Resistance Levels The outlook for the SOL price continues to darken today. It has dropped below the 50-day moving average and formed the risky three black crows candlestick pattern. This pattern is made up of three consecutive bearish candlesticks and is often a risky sign. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below the neutral point at 50 and is pointing downwards. Therefore, the outlook for the Solana price is bearish, with the potential target being at $175, the lowest swing on December 20. On the positive side, SOL price token sits at the major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines indicator. In many instances, this level often provides some substantial support for an asset. It is also notable because it coincides with the small ascending trendline that links the lowest points since December 20. That is a sign that the coin may find some buyers at this level. If that happens, the Solana price may rebound to the top of the trading range at $203. Therefore, Solana’s first support level is at $175.83, followed by the Strong, Pivot Reverse at $156. Its first resistance is at the psychological point at $200, followed by the strong pivot reverse level at $220. Solana Price Chart SOL Odds Of Hitting $210 Are Falling Crypto traders have turned highly bearish on Solana. According to Polymarket , the odds of Solana price rising to $215 by January 10 have fallen to a record low of 2%. This is a big drop since these odds stood at over 70% a few days ago. Solana Price Odds Solana’s recent downtrend trend is happening because of the ongoing Bitcoin sell-off and the change in sentiment among traders. Bitcoin price has crashed below $95,000, while the crypto fear and greed index has moved from the greed zone of 65 to the neutral point of 55. This sell-off is mostly because of the rising bond yields as hopes of more rate cuts fade. Minutes released this week showed that officials are concerned about inflation. They now expect to cut rates two times this year. In the future, however, Solana price has more catalysts that could push it higher. Odds of a SOL ETF approval have risen, while its fees and network activity have continued soaring this year.

Jeremy Allaire of Circle, the CEO of Circle, stated that the company will be giving $1 Million USDC on X. The donation is a major achievement for digital assets, given the increasing adoption of stablecoins as a tool for real-world use. Circle Donates $1M in USDC to Support Donald Trump’s Inauguration Fund According to a recent post on X by Jeremy Allaire, Circle has made a crypto donation of $1 million in USDC to the inaugural fund of President-elect Donald Trump. The announcement highlights the Trump Committee’s willingness to accept stablecoins, reflecting the evolving use of digital dollars in political funding. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized the broader implications of the crypto donation. He noted that the donation underscores the increasing adoption of USDC in high-profile transactions. The contribution aligns with Circle’s mission of promoting digital currency as a viable tool for financial innovation in the United States. This announcement comes a few weeks after the stablecoin issuer’s partnership with Binance to increase the usage of USDC. The partnership aims to bring USDC into Binance with the ability to trade, transact, and hold in its corporate treasury. This particular partnership will help in the provision of stablecoin and further development of the world’s financial systems. Donald Trump Committee Embraces USDC The Trump Committee’s acceptance of USDC demonstrates the growing relevance of digital dollars in various sectors. The $1 million crypto donation is part of a record $170 million raised by the committee for the upcoming inauguration. Circle CEO’s statement highlighted the crypto donation as a significant milestone for Circle and USDC. He remarked on the Committee’s willingness to accept USDC as a payment method, calling it an indicator of how far digital currencies have come in gaining acceptance. Jeremy Allaire commented, “We are excited to be building a great American company, and the fact that the Committee took payment in USDC is an indicator of how far we have come and the potential and power of digital dollars.” Circle’s contribution underscores the stablecoin’s utility in large-scale financial transactions. Donald Trump’s campaign committee’s use of USDC sets a precedent for digital assets in political financing. Circle continues to advocate for the use of USDC in diverse industries, from commerce to governmental initiatives. Late last year, the stablecoin issuer received approval from the OSC and CSA, making USDC the first to meet Canada’s VRCA regulations. This milestone ensures that USDC remains available on compliant Canadian platforms. Will Trump’s Administration Create a US Bitcoin Reserve in 2025? As Donald Trump’s inauguration nears, discussions around a US Bitcoin reserve have gained momentum . Industry leaders are urging the incoming administration to establish a federally-backed Bitcoin reserve to strengthen the nation’s financial infrastructure. The Bitcoin Policy Institute has proposed allocating $21 billion to build the reserve. Analysts suggest that the initiative could define Trump’s administration as a champion of digital innovation. Whether the proposal advances remains to be seen, but it underscores the crypto industry’s high hopes for the upcoming presidency. In addition, following Circle’s crypto donation, CNBC has reported that Google also contributed $1 million to Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. Google’s global head of government affairs, Karan Bhatia, confirmed the donation and announced plans to livestream the inauguration on YouTube. Other tech giants, including Meta, OpenAI, Amazon, and Apple, have also reportedly made contributions to the inaugural committee.

To read full editions, subscribe . ICYMI, Sol Strategies announced that it was investing CAD $25 million ($17.4 million) in the Solana ecosystem earlier this week. CEO Leah Wald told me ahead of the new year that Sol Strategies was focused on building up the “next level” of its business strategy. Obviously, given Sol’s focus, the firm is gonna be bullish on the ecosystem, but Wald noted how pleasantly surprised she was at the amount of developer activity and overall enthusiasm for Solana right now. She is skeptical, however, about a solana ETF being approved in the US “anytime soon.” “I think there’s quite a while until a SOL ETF gets approved. During that time, as a former issuer, I know that you have a long time where you’re working with the staff and you’re working on education. That gives [potential issuers] a year…to educate the staff and make sure that everybody’s up to speed on what you know SOL actually is, and the merits and benefits, and provide…that additional timeline for maturity,” she explained. But she does think that Canada is likely to approve a SOL ETF from 3iQ before we see a slew of US products because the Canadian issuer is “always ahead of the US.” Out of curiosity, and given Wald’s experience, I pushed her on why she thinks a potentially crypto-friendly regulator wouldn’t look to get an ETF that holds SOL out the door. She told me part of her reasoning was exactly because of the changing leadership at the SEC. If the new SEC chair “came in and said, ‘okay, all crypto ETFs are approved overnight,’ I think that that’s dangerous, actually,” she explained. It would be better to see a regulator who’s willing to put in the work to understand the differences between something like Solana and Ripple and speak to potential issuers prior to just greenlighting ETFs. I guess we’ll have to make do with the crypto ETFs we have at home. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

Then, Miguel Kudry from L1 Advisors shares his insights on the topic in Ask and Expert. – Sarah Morton You’re reading Crypto for Advisors , CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. 2025 Outlook for Crypto Adoption: Building Bridges to the Mainstream The crypto industry is entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose. Over the past year, the sector has witnessed key developments that signal crypto’s increasing integration into traditional finance (TradFi) and broader adoption of crypto assets, especially bitcoin. However, the road ahead will test the resilience of this growing ecosystem. As we assess the outlook for 2025, several factors emerge as critical to shaping the adoption trajectory: regulatory clarity, institutional participation, and technological innovation. 1. Regulatory Clarity: Turning Uncertainty Into Institutional Guidelines As I've briefly discussed on my CoinDesk podcast about election night results and the price action around it, regulatory clarity is emerging as a pivotal factor for crypto adoption. The market has already started pricing in the expectation that newly elected officials will bring long-awaited structure to the digital asset ecosystem. We will see some of those expectations starting to play out this year. Key areas where we are likely to see more clarity include: a) Definition and classification of digital assets: The U.S. is expected to refine how digital assets are classified - whether as securities, commodities, or some combination. This clarity will directly impact how tokens are issued, traded, regulated, and taxed. b) Stablecoins: These are likely to be a major focus for regulators due to their transformative real-world use cases and potential impact on financial stability. c) Taxation of crypto transactions: Recent changes have already been made, and we will likely see clearer tax reporting requirements for digital assets, various associated activities, and various industry players. Additional topics such as tokenization—including real-world assets—custodial and non-custodial wallets, regulated trading venues, decentralized finance (DeFi), anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) compliance, and consumer protections will also be actively discussed and potentially acted upon. 2. Institutional Participation: ETFs as a Catalyst In 2024, crypto ETFs experienced explosive growth, with billions in net inflows and notable launches. With new products, crypto ETFs now represent a rapidly expanding financial market segment, attracting significant investor interest and outperforming traditional funds. We will likely see a variety of adjacent products. For 2025, growing inflows and high volumes in BTC and ETH ETFs will likely continue to validate crypto as an asset class and streamline access for retail and institutional investors. This will open the path for other single-asset ETFs, multi-asset ETFs, and various adjacent ETFs (e.g., leveraged, inverse, market-timing, volatility). If regulatory clarity progresses fast enough, we may see the U.S.'s first crypto yield-generating ETFs (e.g., staking). These products could bring additional investor interest to the asset class and increase inflows into passive and active investment products. 3. Technological Innovation: The Convergence of Blockchain Scalability and AI Technological advancements in 2025 will be driven by Layer-2 blockchain scalability and AI integration. Rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, and interoperability will enhance transaction efficiency and user experience for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi. Simultaneously, AI agents operating on decentralized networks will solve and optimize a variety of tasks and interact with users and each other. This synergy simplifies Web3 interactions and ensures secure, transparent execution of AI decisions on blockchain. Together, these innovations will lower barriers to entry, attract developers and users, and accelerate mainstream adoption, making 2025 a pivotal year for blockchain and AI convergence. Summary The outlook for crypto adoption in 2025 is overwhelmingly positive, but not without challenges. Regulatory clarity, institutional participation, and technological innovation will be the pillars of growth. The question isn’t whether crypto will gain mainstream acceptance—it’s how fast and in what form. As we approach this next phase, those who adapt to the evolving landscape will lead the charge in shaping the future. - Leo Mindyuk, CEO, ML Tech Ask an Expert Q. What were the most impactful developments in the crypto market over the past year, and how have they shaped crypto adoption? The most significant development in crypto last year was the political shift, with President-elect Donald Trump making crypto a key part of his platform. Markets are only beginning to price in the impact of the Executive and Legislative branches, along with financial regulators, that not only refrained from fighting the crypto industry but also encouraged crypto innovation within the United States. Beyond bitcoin adoption and the potential establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve, the broader implications for financial markets are still unclear to many market participants. Some of the world’s largest financial institutions that were previously on the sidelines are now actively developing their crypto strategy in response to the new pro-crypto administration. Q. How is the evolving regulatory landscape likely to impact crypto markets and institutional involvement in 2025? The SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement approach has had a far-reaching impact on the crypto markets. A shift to a neutral - or even positive - stance means financial professionals and institutions will need to actively explore how to better serve their customers who are already engaged with crypto, particularly given its decisive role in the election. Additionally, they will need to adapt their offerings to remain competitive in a world where financial markets and assets increasingly operate on crypto rails. Financial advisors, in particular, now have more opportunities to serve their clients by incorporating crypto allocations and existing crypto portfolios into comprehensive financial planning and strategy. Q. Given the macroeconomic climate, how should financial professionals think about integrating crypto into broader investment strategies in 2025? The year 2025 will mark a pivotal shift for crypto, transitioning from merely being an asset class to becoming the infrastructure that underpins a growing portion of all asset classes. Put differently, with the adoption of crypto rails, financial professionals will be better equipped to respond to the macroeconomic climate, further accelerating the flywheel of asset tokenization, portfolio allocations, and broader adoption. - Miguel Kudry, CEO, L1 Advisors Keep Reading J.P.

However, IntelMarkets (INTL) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL) have emerged as strong contenders for huge profits in 2025. For example, market experts like Trader Tardigrade and Wizz have made some bold price predictions for DOGE and SOL. Meanwhile, INTL is making headlines thanks to its upside potential. Notably, this project aims to tap into the AI market, which is expected to be worth $826B by 2030, as per Statista. Although it is in phase nine of its presale right now, many experts foresee a potential 4x surge for this crypto coin in 2025. IntelMarkets (INTL) Excites Traders With an 811% Price Growth While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) see some price gains, all eyes are on IntelMarkets (INTL) . This project is now in phase nine of its presale, which has seen an 811% price increase. Given that this crypto ICO event is not yet over, this percentage is bound to increase. With over $6M raised so far and $10M may be coming before this week ends, it is clear demand is high for IntelMarkets. This hype can be attributed to the fact that IntelMarkets will launch the very first AI-powered trading platform. Therefore, users will experience self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time, and autopilot bots automatically taking positions. With these features, IntelMarkets could bring the future of crypto trading. Those interested in this project are now rushing to buy its native token, INTL. It costs just $0.082, an 811% rise from its starting price of $0.009. But the next stage of its presale will cause the altcoin price to reach $0.091. Once a Tier-1 CEX lists INTL, its price is expected to soar to $0.11. Because of this 34% growth, INTL may be one of the altcoins to watch. Trader Tardigrade: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) Will Surge Soon Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the top crypto coins right now. CoinMarketCap shows that its value has increased by around 10% on the weekly chart. During that time, the Dogecoin price fluctuated between $0.30 and nearly $0.35. Market analyst Trader Tardigrade remains optimistic for Dogecoin (DOGE). According to his X post, this meme coin is consolidating like in 2017 before a major price surge. As a Dogecoin price prediction, he mentioned the $3.80 level. Although the Dogecoin crypto may see a surge soon, its high market cap of $50B could slow its growth. As this meme coin now needs a lot of new money for its price to surge, many investors are sidestepping it for INTL instead. Solana (SOL) Price Expected To Rise, Analyst Claims Solana (SOL) is another altcoin riding a bullish wave. On the one-week chart, its value has increased nearly 5%. CoinMarketCap data points to the Solana price moving between $190 and almost $195. According to expert Wizz, this bullish trend for Solana (SOL) may continue. In a recent X post, he said this altcoin may see a jump past $242 soon. This Solana price prediction has excited the crypto community. Nevertheless, many traders are still putting the Solana coin on the back burner as its highest upswings may have passed. On the YTD chart, its value has jumped over 100%. As a result, traders are looking at INTL for faster returns. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Outshine Dogecoin (DOGE) & Solana (SOL)? IntelMarkets (INTL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL) could all see big price gains this year. However, one altcoin may stand out—IntelMarkets. This project will introduce groundbreaking technology combining AI and blockchain while having a smaller market cap than other altcoins. Therefore, its price will surge much faster with less money. Because of this, experts remain bullish as they foresee a potential 4x jump for INTL in 2025.

Despite dominating the DeFi sector, Ethereum still has scalability issues, and network outages plague Solana. Because of these issues, ETH and SOL whales are shifting their focus to newer projects like this AI altcoin RCO Finance (RCOF) . Offering cutting-edge features, practical utility and a projected 21,029% ROI, RCOF is capturing the attention of large-scale investors. Why Whales Are Looking Beyond Ethereum and Solana The migration of large-scale investors from Ethereum and Solana to newer AI altcoins is driven by several factors that have stunted ETH and SOL’s growth. Despite hosting over 60% of all DeFi projects, Ethereum’s network still struggles with high gas fees and scalability issues, especially during peak periods. It has tried to resolve these issues with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Still, it hasn’t fully resolved these issues, causing users and developers alike to switch to faster, more cost-effective options. While Solana has done a great job resolving some of Ethereum’s issues, offering high transaction throughput at lower fees, frequent network outages have eroded investor trust. For whales, reliability is a critical factor, making Solana’s instability a growing liability. Both Ethereum and Solana are mature assets with significant market capitalizations. This maturity leaves little room for explosive growth, unlike with newer lower-cap AI altcoins. Aside from explosive potential, these AI altcoins also offer innovative features that attract whales. RCOF, for instance, offers AI-powered trading tools and the potential for a 21,029% ROI, making it an unmatched investment for whales looking to capitalize on the buzz and growth around AI altcoins. RCO Finance: The AI Altcoin Promising 21,029% ROI For Ethereum and Solna whales, RCO Finance has emerged as a standout investment option for its unique blend of innovative features, real-world utility and exponential growth potential. This AI altcoin is revolutionizing investing by leveraging AI to make the princess more efficient and profitable. This technology allows RCOF to offer advanced AI-powered trading tools that provide personalized investment guidance, predictive modeling, risk assessment and more. The robo-advisor is a standout example of these trading tools. This trading assistant personalizes investment and trading plans based on your personal financial targets, investment timeframe, and comfort level with risk. By factoring in your preferences, it can help you create a portfolio that grows with you. This handy tool offers real-time insights, enabling you to make smarter choices and optimize your investments. This data-driven approach ensures you avoid emotional trading, which can make you susceptible to making regrettable decisions because of fear and greed. It also offers automated trading and portfolio management. This feature offers real-time adaptability, allowing you to capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate risk since the robo-advisor can execute trades and rebalance your portfolio on your behalf. This hand-off approach appeals to both beginners and expert traders because you don’t have to constantly check the market and adjust your portfolio manually. RCOF offers access to more than 120,000 tradable assets, including real-world assets, which you can buy using cryptocurrency. Tokenizing these assets democratizes access to them, opening up new investment and diversification opportunities for investors. It further enhances this accessibility through its non-KYC policy, which allows users to sign up and participate without fulfilling stringent KYC requirements. This breaks down geographical barriers and attracts users who are privacy-conscious. Investors can stake RCOF tokens to earn consistent yields, creating a reliable income stream while supporting the network. A rigorous audit by SolidProof guarantees a secure and transparent platform, bolstering confidence among whales and smaller investors alike. Join RCOF Before Ethereum and Solana Whales Drive Prices Higher Innovation is the lifeblood of the crypto market, and to stay ahead, Ethereum and Solana whales recognize the need to diversify into emerging AI projects like RCOF. Powered by innovative AI features, real-world applications and early-stage advantage, this AI altcoin is the ultimate opportunity for investors seeking exponential returns. The RCO Finance presale is live, and tokens are still available at $0.0777. This low price offers a great opportunity to secure more tokens before whale demand drives the price higher. But you have to act now. Don’t miss out on RCOF’s 21,029% growth. Invest today.

CEO Jeremy Allaire thinks this shows how far digital dollars have come. “Circle has contributed $1M USDC to President Trump’s Inaugural Committee. We are excited to be building a great American company, and the fact that the Committee took payment in USDC is an indicator of how far we have come and the potential and power of digital dollars,” he announced . Trump, now officially pro-crypto, has turned his inauguration into a showcase for blockchain-backed money, much like his campaign. Circle’s contribution is just the latest in a growing list of donations. Big players pour cash into Trump’s inaugural fund Google stepped up with its own $1 million. “Google is pleased to support the 2025 inauguration with a live stream on YouTube and a direct link on our homepage. We’re also donating to the inaugural committee,” said Karan Bhatia, the company’s global head of government affairs. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Meta both dropped $1 million each late last year. Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon also joined the list. But let’s be real: the crypto industry is leading this money train. According to FEC data, crypto PACs and groups connected to the blockchain industry raised $245 million during the last election cycle. That’s nearly half of all corporate contributions, according to the watchdog group Public Citizen. The Stand With Crypto Alliance, launched by Coinbase, even graded lawmakers to figure out which candidates deserved crypto cash and which needed to be shut down with aggressive ads. It wasn’t just about lobbying after the elections. The crypto world went all-in to ensure pro-crypto lawmakers won seats. Nearly 300 lawmakers backing blockchain now sit in Congress, giving the industry unprecedented power to push its agenda. Crypto giants make it rain The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, were among the top contributors. Together, they handed over $10.1 million. Ripple’s Chris Larsen went even bigger, dropping $12 million to support the right candidates. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, wasn’t far behind. He shelled out $1.3 million across various PACs, including Fairshake and JD Vance for Senate Inc. He also supported both Democrats and Republicans, proving crypto isn’t partisan. Even Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal got involved. He showed up at two Trump fundraisers, including one in Nashville during a big-time Bitcoin event. Kraken’s chairman, Jesse Powell, made a $1 million donation. And then there’s the rest of the crypto elite. Phil Potter, former Bitfinex strategy chief, donated $1.6 million. Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital pitched in $878,600. Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam added $735,400. The list keeps going: Union Square Ventures’ Fred Wilson gave $1.4 million, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla contributed $198,500, and BitGo CEO Mike Belshe threw in $119,825. Even Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, jumped in with $67,100. The crypto industry has learned from Big Tech’s mistakes. Instead of trying to fix problems after elections, blockchain advocates targeted seats in Congress before the votes were even cast. They dumped cash into battleground states, supporting pro-crypto candidates and taking down opponents. Stand With Crypto’s grading system made it simple: you were either with crypto or against it. The strategy worked. This isn’t the first time crypto has tried to influence politics, but this cycle was on another level. FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried tried to buy influence in previous cycles but failed spectacularly. Now serving 25 years for stealing $8 billion, he’s a reminder of exactly how NOT to do it.

JasmyCoin (JASMY) JasmyCoin (JASMY) has experienced a turbulent period. Over the past week, its price decreased by 3.67%. The decline was more pronounced over the last month, with a drop of 22.60%. However, looking at the bigger picture, the coin has gained 32.55% in the past six months, suggesting potential resilience. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.03252, which is below the 100-day average of $0.03697. This could indicate short-term bearish momentum. The relative strength index sits at 42.80, hinting that the coin is approaching oversold territory. Meanwhile, the stochastic oscillator is at 77.93, and the MACD level is slightly negative at -0.00053715. Currently trading between $0.03296 and $0.04264, JasmyCoin faces important price levels ahead. The nearest resistance is at $0.04659. Breaking above this could lead the price toward the next resistance at $0.05627, which would be a significant percentage increase. On the downside, support is found at $0.02723, and further at $0.01755. Falling to these levels would represent a considerable decline from the current price. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price increased by 4.55%, showing a slight upward trend. However, in the past month, it faced a decline of 17.86%. Despite this short-term dip, Dogecoin’s price skyrocketed by 215.21% over the last six months, reflecting significant long-term growth. Currently, Dogecoin is trading between $0.33 and $0.42. The nearest resistance level is at $0.46. If the price breaks this point, it might aim for the second resistance at $0.55. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.27, with a second support at $0.1766. These levels could determine the coin’s next move, either strengthening or facing more pressure. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.34, slightly below the current price range, while the 100-day average is $0.37. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 41.28, suggesting that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level stands at -0.0042, indicating mild bearish momentum. These factors suggest that Dogecoin’s price could remain volatile in the near term. IOTA (IOTA) IOTA (IOTA) has been trading between $0.30 and $0.40 lately. Over the past six months, its price surged by 102.56%, showing strong growth. However, the last month saw a drop of 18.76%, and the past week recorded a slight decrease of nearly 1%. The coin’s current price is close to its 10-day simple moving average of $0.32 but below the 100-day SMA of $0.35. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.98, edging toward oversold territory, which might signal a potential rebound. The MACD level is negative at -0.0058, indicating bearish momentum, while the stochastic oscillator stands at 62.96, suggesting possible price stabilization. If IOTA breaks above the nearest resistance level of $0.44, it could target the next resistance at $0.55, offering an upside of over 30%. Conversely, falling below the support at $0.23 might lead to a decline toward the second support at $0.13, a significant drop. Traders are watching these levels closely to gauge IOTA’s next move. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant price fluctuations recently. Over the past week, the price dropped by 7.73%. In the last month, it fell by 32.72%. However, looking at the past six months, the coin has surged by 105.49%. These numbers show that while there has been a short-term decline, the long-term trend remains positive. The current price ranges between $0.00001813 and $0.00002258. The simple moving average over the past 10 days is $0.00001779, and over 100 days it’s $0.00001979. The relative strength index (RSI) is at 40.82, indicating that the coin is not overbought or oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.000000248, suggesting a possible downward trend. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $0.00002445. If the price breaks above this, it could reach the second resistance at $0.00002890, which would be an increase of around 20% from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00001555. If the price falls below this, it might drop to the second support level at $0.00001110, a decrease of about 25%. The stochastic indicator is at 62.30, hinting at potential upward movement. Conclusion While JASMY, DOGE, IOTA, and PEPE show strong potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) offers a unique opportunity by blending sports and memes, aiming for 20,000% growth.

According to an announcement CleanSpark shared on Jan. 9, its Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury reached 10,097 BTC, all mined through its own activities. The milestone came a day after the company revealed it had mined 668 BTC in December 2024. The company’s Bitcoin treasury as of the end of last year stood at 9,952 BTC. Read more: CleanSpark mined 668 Bitcoin in December, holds 9952 BTC “Surpassing the 10,000-bitcoin mark reflects CleanSpark’s commitment to operational excellence, strategic growth, and disciplined capital management,” said Zach Bradford, chief executive officer and president of CleanSpark. The milestone is a result of the miner’s dedication and unwavering focus on efficiency and responsibility. CleanSpark has seen a 236% year-over-year increase in its BTC holdings. “Every bitcoin in our treasury has been mined in the United States, supported by American energy and jobs—underscoring our dedication to sustainable growth and innovation in the global bitcoin ecosystem,” the CleanSpark chief executive added. CleanSpark mined its first BTC in December 2021. Growth has come amid diversification of the company’s mining portfolio, with acquisitions and other expansion efforts key to this. The company’s acquisition of GRIID Infrastructure and seven new facilities in Knoxville , Tennessee, align with this trajectory. Bitcoin’s recent price gains, with the cryptocurrency hitting all-time highs above $108,000, have also boosted the market for miners. As of 10:54 ET on Jan. 9, 2025, BTC was trading around $94,287.

Fidelity Analysts Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/who-will-win-the-race-between-ethereum-and-solana-fidelity-analysts-explained/,"As the competition between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) continues, a report came from Fidelity that will increase the competition. The report prepared by Fidelity Digital Assets stated that Ethereum's strong fundamentals provide an advantage over Solana in the long term compared to ETH. Fidelity analysts said Solana’s growth is tied to memecoins, but investors prefer Ethereum for stability. Fidelity Digital Assets highlighted Ethereum’s strong fundamentals, such as developer activity, TVL, and stablecoin supply, in its 2025 Digital Asset Outlook report, giving ETH a long-term advantage over Solana. Analysts who also acknowledged Solana’s growth said that SOL stands out with its speed and low transaction costs. However, analysts noted that much of Solana’s success was due to memecoin trading. At this point, analysts comparing Ethereum and Solana argued that Ethereum's fundamentals are less dependent on speculation and therefore more stable in the long run. Fidelity noted that upgrades like Solana’s Firedancer and Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade could shape short-term trends, saying: “Short-term price trends often revolve around narratives, and given the planned upgrades for both networks, a remarkable race could be on the horizon between ETH and SOL throughout 2025,” Solana said. While Solana’s Firedancer upgrade aims to significantly increase transaction speed, Ethereum’s Prague/Electra (Pectra) upgrade focuses on improving functionality, scalability, and user security. Ethereum currently offers a distinct advantage over Solana due to its accessibility through exchange-traded products, but that could change with favorable regulations in 2025, analysts said. Fidelity analysts added that they expect investors to return to Ethereum as the bull market continues. *This is not investment advice.

With the partnership, DAMAC Group will leverage MANTRA blockchain to tokenize its at least $1 billion assets. “This partnership with DAMAC Group is an endorsement for the RWA industry,” said John Patrick Mullin, CEO of MANTRA. The Group will enable token-based financing for a wide range of assets. These assets will be available for the Group’s portfolio of companies, a release shared with Cryptonews, noted. Further, the Group aims to bring greater transparency, security, and accessibility to its assets through MANTRA blockchain. DAMAC Group comprise of real estate developments firms, hospitality and data centres. The Group started accepting crypto payments in 2022. “Partnering with MANTRA is a natural extension of our commitment to innovation and forward-thinking solutions,” Amira Sajwani, Managing Director of Sales & Development at DAMAC, noted. “Tokenizing our assets will provide investors with a secure, transparent, and convenient way to access a wide-range of investment opportunities.” The MANTRA Chain officially launched its Mainnet in October 2024, marking a significant step forward in bringing RWAs on-chain. Following the launch, its native OM token’s market cap surged by nearly 200% in the past three months to $3.6 billion, CoinGecko data noted. MANTRA Becomes Preferred Blockchain for RWAs The Layer-1 blockchain offers advanced tech modules, compliance mechanisms, and cross-chain interoperability. It empowers developers to seamlessly participate in the evolving RWA tokenization space. MANTRA implements regulatory mechanisms at the protocol level through its chain with its ‘compliance’ feature, pioneering compliance and innovation in RWA tokenization. Further, according to Boston Consulting Group, the RWA market will grow up to $16 trillion by 2030 . Additionally, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink earlier predicted that “the next generation of markets is tokenization.” The post Layer-1 Blockchain MANTRA to Tokenize $1B RWA for UAE-Based DAMAC Group appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|DAMAC Group|MANTRA|Real World Assets,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|OM,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-09 17:02:33

At the same time, a newcomer, Remittix (RTX) , is quietly establishing itself as a disruptive force in the cross-border payment sector. By combining blockchain technology with traditional fiat systems, Remittixcould emerge as one of the biggest opportunities for significant gains this year. Cardano Drops 13% In 24 Hours Cardano (ADA) continues into 2025, holding its research-driven approach close with several updates planned. Cardano has been releasing updates during its Basho era, mainly focusing on scalability and network optimization. In addition, a few tweaks were made following Cardano's long-awaited Hydra upgrade that has dramatically boosted transaction throughput, making the Cardano blockchain more attractive for DeFi projects and enterprise adoption. Despite advancements on the technological front, Cardano has seen some big swings, most recently dropping 13% in the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, Cardano (ADA) remains a real force in the crypto space, occupying a mighty market cap of $34.47 billion. Solana Continues To Battle With Network Outages Solana (SOL) has been on a general upward trend throughout 2024 despite many fluctuations throughout. It was a rough end to the year for Solana, and its value dropped 14% during the last month, but 4% of that has been recovered so far in January. Solana remains a favorite for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, with the release of the Firedancer validator client confirming this status. More than 65,000 transactions a second are now possible on Solana (SOL). Despite all this success, Solana (SOL) still experiences the occasional network outage, a historical problem for the platform, and has been criticized by many in its community for just how long this has been going on. Remittix Sets A New Standard For Cross-Border Payments As Cardano and Solana tussle it out, Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming a top pick as a cross-border payment solution. Unlike traditional players like Wise and Stripe, Remittix uses blockchain technology to facilitate instant, cheap, transparent crypto-to-fiat transfers. Remittix (RTX) lets users transfer over 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies sent directly to bank accounts worldwide. This simplicity and efficiency set it apart from its competitors. Users benefit from flat fees with no hidden charges for currency conversion or wire transfers, making it cheaper than most traditional banking solutions. Businesses, too, are empowered with tools like the Remittix Pay API, which facilitates crypto payment acceptance and fiat settlement. Remittix's (RTX) user-centric approach ensures recipients experience the convenience of fiat payments without needing to understand cryptocurrency. This unique capability positions Remittix as a disruptor in a space where no major player offers this level of integration between blockchain and fiat systems. With a clear vision and solid fundamentals, Remittix is a promising entrant to the crypto space with the potential to capture a significant market share in the cross-border payment space. With tokens available for a mere $0.0193, the presale has already raised over $2.16 million. Projections suggest an 800% price surge by the end of the presale and potential exponential growth post-launch, making this an unmissable opportunity for proactive investors.

Deevers framed the proposal as a response to inflation, which he said undermines the purchasing power of Oklahomans. He highlighted Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature, contrasting it with traditional currencies impacted by monetary policies. Bitcoin as Paycheck? Interestingly, the bill in question promotes voluntary participation and aims to boost financial flexibility for employees and businesses while positioning Oklahoma as a leader in financial technology. Citing Bitcoin’s growing acceptance, Deevers highlighted the crypto asset’s mainstream relevance and alignment with free-market principles. “There is a reason President Trump campaigned heavily as a pro-Bitcoin candidate and spoke at prominent Bitcoin events. Bitcoin has arrived into the mainstream of our economy and is unquestionably a significant part of the financial future. This legislation puts Oklahoma in a leadership role nationally, ensuring our state embraces the future of financial technology while providing our citizens with more financial options.” SB325 will be considered in the upcoming 60th legislative session starting February 3. The latest development comes after Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed a landmark bill last May, creating a legal framework for blockchain technology and digital assets. The legislation prevents government restrictions on the legal use of digital assets, bans additional taxes on crypto payments, and legitimizes digital asset mining, with noise ordinances applying to both residential and industrial zones. Other jurisdictions, such as Texas , Louisiana, Montana, and Arkansas, have passed similar laws safeguarding crypto mining as well as custody rights. Meanwhile, Deevers’ proposal reflected a broader movement among US states to adopt Bitcoin-friendly policies as they push forward with their own ambitious crypto initiatives. Bitcoin Push Ohio Representative Derek Merrin recently unveiled House Bill 703, the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act that allowed the state treasurer to invest public funds in Bitcoin. Citing concerns over dollar devaluation, Merrin deemed Bitcoin to be a revolutionary tool for preserving financial value and strengthening Ohio’s fiscal framework. The legislation, though non-mandatory, enables strategic allocation decisions involving Bitcoin. A similar move was seen in Pennsylvania as well as Texas.

The DoJ seized the BTC in question from the illicit Silk Road marketplace, yet it faced a legal challenge last year from private claimants who sought to block any sale. But a judge has now struck down the claimants’ motion, freeing the US Government to sell its stash of Bitcoin, worth around $6.5 billion by today’s price. This has amplified negative sentiment in the market today, yet the DoJ is unlikely to sell the 69,370 BTC all at once, meaning that Bitcoin’s price prediction for this year remains largely positive. What’s Going On? Will BTC Fall to $10,000? Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg actually issued the ruling on December 30, but it came to light only yesterday evening. Seeborg had denied a motion from Battle Born Investments, as well as First 100 and 1st One Hundred Holdings, who had both claimed that the seized BTC belonged to them. this is not on the DOJ website. where is your actual source sir? — Kevin Svenson (@KevinSvenson_) January 9, 2025 Well, this line of reasoning didn’t wash with Judge Seeborg, who has reaffirmed the DoJ’s right to sell the 69,370 BTC. As noted above, the price of Bitcoin responded negatively to this news, with the coin now down by 3% in a week and by 4% in a month (while remaining up by 101% in a year). Its chart today shows a very sudden loss of momentum in the past few days, with its indicators signaling that the coin is now very much in oversold territory. Source: TradingView Its RSI (purple) has touch 30, while its 30-period average (orange) is about to fall below the 200-period average (blue), forming a ‘death cross.’ Such a cross could indicate further losses, with BTC potentially on course to drop below $90,000 in the near term, before rebounding. Yet today’s news is not all doom and gloom, insofar as the US Government will not be able to sell all of its BTC at once, since forfeiture laws dictate several more checks and procedures. On top of this, the DoJ may have already sold around 19,800 BTC, which it moved to Coinbase in early December . At the same time, President-elect Donald Trump has previously vowed not to sell the government’s trove of Bitcoin , while also suggesting that he would initiate plans for a US strategic reserve of BTC. Trump “ we’re going to build a $BTC strategic reserve for the United States. We will never sell confiscated Bitcoin again! “ Biden 10 days before he leaves office ** hold my beer ** “Let’s dump $6.5B worth of Bitcoin from SilkRoad that we confiscated before my presidency ends” — Johnny (@CryptoGodJohn) January 9, 2025 Furthermore, President-elect Donald Trump has promised not to sell the government’s Bitcoin and has suggested creating a US strategic reserve of BTC. If Trump follows through on these promises, Bitcoin may rebound to $105,000 by the end of the month even if there are further drops in the meantime. That said, a drop to $10,000 is unlikely unless there is a major shift in market conditions or regulatory policies. New Meme Tokens Promise Market-Beating Gains For any traders worried that the Silk Road Bitcoin may end up hitting the market, they may prefer diversifying into newer tokens, which don’t carry so much legal baggage. There are a number of new coins in the market that show high potential, with several presale coins gaining lots of momentum as they prepare to list. One of these is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , an ERC-20 token that has raised an incredible $44.5 million in its ongoing sale. $40M raised. Frogs strong together. The future is green. pic.twitter.com/ijSnXJq9x9 — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 3, 2025 Wall Street Pepe is more than just another meme token, with the project in the process of launching its own trade intelligence platform. Once it platform launches, it will provide investors with real-time analysis and market insights, including buying signals and insider trading tips. It will also operate its own online community spaces and forums, where users will be able to share advice and strategies, while also competing in trading contexts. The winners of such contests will earn rewards in WEPE, which they will also be able to stake for a passive income. This all promises to make WEPE very profitable, with the coin already having a strong online following, judging by its numbers on X . Investors can join its sale by heading over to its official website , where WEPE is selling at $0.00036644. This will rise repeatedly over the course of the sale, meaning that investors should act quickly if they want the best possible returns.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-09 17:10:00

Today’s 7.22% decline marks a notable setback for ADA, making it one of the hardest-hit altcoins. Though, on a weekly basis, it is among the most resilient, losing just 3.01%. More so, a 27% dip in trading volume over the past 24 hours, scraping 1.75 billion, offers hope that the downtrend may be losing momentum. Plomin Fork Nears: When Could it Go Live? The Plomin hard fork aims to implement full decentralized governance at its core, eliminating reliance on a central authority for key decisions. For approval, both Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and the Intersect Constitutional Committee (ICC) must endorse the proposal. Voting will occur in several rounds, with a phased January 14, 19, and 24 deadlines, respectively. Of the 213 SPOs who have voted, 209 have supported the upgrade. However, this only represents 17% of the total stake – the collective amount of ADA voters hold. 17.7% of the stake has already voted for the Plomin hard fork. 227 SPOs voted, 224 of them voted YES. The threshold is 51%. Deadline is January 24th. pic.twitter.com/4NTLU3yxuE — Cardano YOD₳ (@JaromirTesar) January 7, 2025 At least 51% of the stake must vote to ratify the hard fork, though there is still time with the final decision expected by January 29. If successful, Cardano will become the first mover as a fully self-governing protocol.Many blockchains and protocols, including Ethereum, Polkadot and Avalanche, stand to follow with implemented governance phases. Cardano Price Teeters on Technical Breakthrough: Could it Flip Solana? With the bulk of the voting process still ahead, the Cardano price impact from the Plomin hard fork may not be fully realized. However, current technical indicators offer some insight into how far its implementation could take ADA. ADA / USDT 1D chart, pennant pattern breakout. Source: Binance. Following the recent breakout of a bullish pennant pattern, which has been forming since early November, Cardano’s price could see substantial upside in the coming weeks. If the pattern fully materializes, it sets a price target of around $1.8575, marking a 100% increase from current levels. While this would not be enough to overtake Solana’s $92 billion market cap, there is potential for Cardano to take on Solana in the coming years. However, to achieve this, Cardano would have to attract more developers and users to sustain its growth trajectory. In the near term, Cardano’s price could face further downside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below neutral at 43, and the MACD line is about to cross below the signal line, indicating potential bearish momentum. Consequently, a retest of the strong support zone around $0.8283 seems likely, with deeper support at $0.7107 being a potential target. This New Opportunity Could Rally Harder While the Plomin hard fork’s approval could create tailwinds for the Cardano price running into 2025, 2024 proved memecoins as the foremost sector driving gains this cycle. With the meme coin market surging over 330% last year, those elusive 10-100x opportunities seem a dime a dozen. But let me guess, you’ve missed out? Well, Meme Index ($MEMEX) offers a solution, providing exposure to a broad meme coin index, minimizes risk while capturing upside potential. Something which may be credited to its instant success, raising over $2.1 million in its presale already! The Meme Index is an Ethereum-based platform offering a curated selection of meme coins, balancing strong growth potential with risk management. With four distinct baskets, investors can tailor their strategies – whether seeking steady growth or chasing higher risks. https://x.com/memecoin_index/status/1877374715234496844 While the Titan Index is the heavy-hitter basket, featuring the top 10 meme coins with a market cap of over $1 billion, those looking to maximize their gains may find the High-risk High-reward Frenzy index more attractive. After all, fortune favors the bold. Even just by holding, investors can rake in passive gains by staking their $MEMEX . With dynamic rates rewarding early adopters and loyal stakers, the current staking APY stands at an impressive 1098%.

The international banking group also highlighted that it aimed to capitalize on the country’s established financial infrastructure and balanced regulatory environment. The bank’s move into the region came as institutional demand for digital asset services advanced across the European Union. “Standard Chartered’s global reputation and demonstrated commitment to this space adds a layer of credibility that is meaningful for institutional adoption.” – Gautam Sharma, Brevan Howard Digital’s CEO Standard Chartered announced that it appointed Laurent Marochini, former Head of Innovation at Societe Generale, as CEO of the Luxembourg entity.

Every Meme Coin Investor Should Hold This Crypto Too,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/best-investment-for-2025-every-meme-coin-investor-should-hold-this-crypto-too,"The meme coin sector remains the hottest in the cryptocurrency market, despite the latest crypto crash. While whales are buying the dip on large-cap tokens like Dogwifhat and Popcat, new projects like Large Language Model (LLM) are defying the bearish outlook with thousands of percentage rallies. A meme coin supercycle is coming. However, Meme Index (MEMEX) , the first decentralized index fund for meme coins, has emerged as one of the best investments for 2025. Considered the smart way to invest in meme tokens, experts believe this crypto is one that every meme coin trader — especially small-scale retailers — should hold. The MEMEX presale has already raised over $2 million in a few short weeks. Meme Index - What’s The Hype? “There’s just too many meme coins to invest” is a major problem for all investors, especially the small-scale retailers with limited funds. The problem is exacerbated during a crypto crash. Following the latest market decline, Peanut The Squirrel - which has a $2.47 billion all-time high - is sitting at a $560 million valuation. Popcat at $530 million, Goatseus Maximum at $360 million, Moo Deng under $200 million and CHILLGUY at $136 million are all attractive buys. Sudeng (HIPPO), a Binance Futures, meme coin is at just $80 million. However, it is unlikely that small-scale buyers can invest in them all. They would either go all in on a couple of investments or spread their limited budget, thus diluting their gains. However, Meme Index could be a game-changer — all MEMEX holders can now invest in meme coin baskets, gaining a broader market exposure and spreading the risk. MEMEX holders will have four baskets to pick from, depending on their risk appetite. There is the Meme Titan Index for safe players, featuring billion-dollar tokens like Dogecoin and Pepe. Second is the Meme Moonshot Index, comprising projects that have recently outperformed the “Titans” and are knocking on the billion-dollar mark. Next up is the Meme Midcap Index, featuring assets within the $50 million and $250 million valuations. Currently, PepeCoin, Moo Deng, FWOG, DEGEN and CHILLGUY would currently fall in this category. Finally, the Meme Frenzy Index is designed for the degens seeking outsized returns, no matter the risk. This basket would likely include coins that often end up creating millionaires overnight. Notably, MEMEX holders will vote on which meme coins to include in each basket, a feature that could have massive bullish ramifications for investors. Through the power of community intelligence, investors will be able to benefit from coins like LLM, the ones that they otherwise would have missed. Considering that each project included in a basket will have community support, it is unlikely that they turn out to be outright scams. It is, therefore, no surprise that Meme Index is being viewed as one of the best meme coin investments for 2025, considering only MEMEX holders will be able to invest in the aforementioned baskets. Best Meme Coin Investment of 2025? Even besides its features of innovation and community intelligence, MEMEX ticks many other right boxes for being one of the top meme coin investments. In line with the latest trend, early MEMEX buyers can stake the coin and earn attractive passive income, currently at a reward rate of over 1000% per annum. However, the yield percentage is designed to decrease as more coins are staked, which rewards the early adopters. Similarly, there wasn’t any private sale of the meme coin, which reduces the likelihood of scams and rug-pulls. Moreover, its smart contract audit reveals that the contract owner can’t engage in nefarious schemes like “honey potting” investors, minting new tokens or pausing the contract. Unsurprisingly, experts are bullish on MEMEX’s upside potential, with many viewing it as one of the best meme coin investments this year. A few are eyeing as much as 10x returns from it. Interested buyers can stack the new coin with just a few clicks using the over-the-counter widget on its presale website.

Great dinner last night with @realDonaldTrump & @s_alderoty . Strong start to 2025! pic.twitter.com/UjM6lahUG4 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 8, 2025 He didn’t divulge what exactly the trio discussed, but given the presence of Alderoty, it’s reasonable to assume that they broached the subject of Ripple’s legal status. The company is currently facing appeals from the SEC , which is in the process of challenging certain aspects of the ruling Judge Analisa Torres delivered in 2023 in the long-running legal battle between the two parties. It’s possible that Garlinghouse and Alderoty are pushing Trump and his incoming administration for a quick end to this saga, with Trump’s pick of the pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chairman potentially going some way to doing just that. However, it seems that the market has not really taken this latest meeting between Garlinghouse and Trump ( the pair also met in November ) as new information, with XRP surging in the first few weeks after the US election. Today, its chart shows a continued loss of momentum, with its indicators moving into oversold positions. Source: TradingView For instance, its relative strength index (purple) has dropped below 50 and seems to be on its way to 30. Meanwhile, its 30-period average (orange) is also descending, with XRP potentially not recovering until it crosses below the 200-period average (blue). Either way, XRP will make a recovery sooner or later, given the strength of its fundamentals and the largely positive market conditions. It’s likely that the next few months, with the inauguration of Trump out of the way, will help it return to $2.50, before reaching $3 by H2. Likewise, if the current overall market momentum continues, $10 XRP could be on the cards in late 2025. High Returns with New Presale Tokens As strong as XRP looks, its status as an established token could mean that it’s not one of this year’s best performers, with newer coins likely bringing more dramatic gains. This is likely to include presale tokens, which are often promising in that they build up a strong following and investor base prior to listing. A great example of this comes from Flockerz (FLOCK), an ERC-20 token that has raised an impressive $9.2 million in its soon-to-be-ending sale. Let your flock flag fly! 9M Raised is no small feat! The flock is pushing hard for Flocktopia! pic.twitter.com/Ad8c15xPFi — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) January 7, 2025 Flockerz is interesting because it’s the market’s first vote-to-earn token, with its platform rewarding holders for participating in governance votes. This is likely to make FLOCK a very profitable token to hold, seeing as how every decision concerning its growth and development will be decided by holders. Owners will also be able to stake the coin, earning a staking income on top of any voting rewards. FLOCK could therefore enjoy significant demand, with the coin having a max supply of only 12 billion. 25% of this supply will go to staking, with 25% going to governance rewards and 20% to the coin’s presale. Its sale will end in 13 days, with investors able to join by visiting its official website . FLOCK is selling at its final presale price of $0.0066616, although it’s likely to rise much higher once it lists for the first time.

However, one market observer envisioned a double-digit crash if the price fails to close above $4 by March 10. New ATH Soon? Ripple’s XRP started 2025 on the right foot, with its price surging to almost $2.50 on January 4. However, the decline witnessed across the broader crypto market in the past few days put the brakes on the rally. XRP briefly plummeted to as low as $2.23 on January 7 and is currently worth approximately $2.27 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Nonetheless, many analysts who regularly observe the token’s price performance think a fresh resurgence could be in the cards. For example, the X user with almost 400,000 followers – Crypto Bitlord – urged people to invest in XRP, describing it as “the safest asset in all of crypto.” The Great Matsby also weighed in, expecting the valuation to hit a new all-time high of $9 in the near future . “XRP is so damn bullish that it’s one of the last coins that hasn’t even touched the daily Ichimoku cloud yet,” they said. The daily Ichimoku cloud is a technical analysis tool that helps traders identify trends, potential reversals, and support/resistance levels. It combines several components, including ongoing market trends, momentum, and future projections. Other industry participants chipping in as of late are CRYPTOWZRD and the veteran trader Peter Brandt. The former believes XRP’s pump to $4 is “inevitable,” while the latter suggested that the asset’s market capitalization could surpass a whopping $500 billion. Meanwhile, the XRP army recently got hyped following the meeting between the newly elected US president – Donald Trump – and two of Ripple’s bosses – Brad Garlinghouse and Stuart Alderoty. What the men discussed during dinner remains unknown, but the crypto community was quick to give some interesting suggestions. Some of the speculations include the potential growth of Ripple and the further development of the local cryptocurrency sector. Something for the Bears While the overall sentiment surrounding XRP is quite optimistic, there are some market observers who foresee a potential crash. One person to outline such a thesis is the X user EGRAG CRYPTO. The analyst (who usually makes bullish price predictions for Ripple’s native token) recently opined that it should “finish above $4 with strong confirmation on the weekly chart.” This needs to happen before March 10 , or otherwise , the token might collapse by over 70%. The X user based their forecast on the Lunar eclipse , which is scheduled for that period. EGRAG CRYPTO claimed that the phenomenon has been followed by a crypto market correction in the past. It is worth mentioning that there is no economic basis to suggest that the next Lunar eclipse can cause fluctuations in the sector.

The Bitwise CIO’s remarks come following the court’s approval for the government to sell these coins. Bitwise CIO Comments On US Government’s Potential Bitcoin Sale In an X post , Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan mentioned that the market will hoover it up if the US government actually sells its $6.5 billion Silk Road stash in the remaining days of the Biden Administration. He added that the new administration, led by Donald Trump, would buy these bitcoins back if the Biden administration sells them. However, it remains uncertain whether that will indeed happen, as Trump has yet to comment on this. Hougan’s comments come following the court’s green light for the government to liquidate the 69,000 BTC ($6.5 billion) that it seized from the dark web marketplace Silk Road. Meanwhile, while the US might be looking to offload these coins, other countries are looking to adopt a crypto Reserve. Bhutan’s Gelephu Mindfulness City recently announced plans to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB in its reserves. Peter Schiff Holds A Different Opinion While the Bitwise CIO believes that Donald Trump’s administration will buy these coins back, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has suggested this is unlikely. In an X post, the renowned economist asserted that the US president-elect won’t buy these coins or even more if Biden’s government sells the BTC stash before he takes office. Schiff also believes Biden’s government will sell these coins before January 20. He mentioned how he has been warning since the election in November last year that this current administration would sell all the US-owned BTC before Trump takes office. He added that Trump’s only campaign promise was not to sell the US-owned BTC, but he never promised to buy any more. A $6.5 billion BTC sale by the US government could significantly impact the Bitcoin price. Interestingly, amid this potential price decline. Peter Schiff has also predicted an MSTR stock crash due to the company’s Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin Price Could Be Ready To Rebound Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided some optimism amid the recent Bitcoin price crash. In an X post, he stated that BTC could be getting ready to rebound. For Bitcoin to move higher, the analyst revealed that it needs to break above $94,600. A break above this resistance level could lead to a further rally to $96,300 or even $97,000. Meanwhile, the analyst also revealed that 66.38% of traders on Binance are betting on a Bitcoin price rebound. The analyst noted that these traders have a track record of being right.

On January 9, the banking giant announced its new European entity situated in Luxembourg, which will act as its “regulatory entry point for the provision of crypto and digital asset custody services”, operating under a digital asset license obtained in compliance with the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation. The move will expand the bank’s digital asset portfolio, and it plans to leverage Luxembourg’s “well-balanced regulatory and financial environment” to meet the growing demand for secure and regulated digital asset custody services across the European Union, the announcement noted. Laurent Marochini, former Head of Innovation at Société Générale will spearhead the bank’s efforts as CEO of the new entity in Luxembourg where it plans to leverage the region’s “well-balanced regulatory and financial environment” to offer secure and compliant digital asset custody services to institutional clients. Commenting on the development, Standard Chartered’s Global Head of Financing & Securities Services Margaret Harwood-Jones said: We are really excited to be able to offer our digital asset custody services to the EU region, enabling us to support our clients with a product that is changing the landscape of traditional finance whilst also providing the level of security that comes with being an appropriately regulated entity. The new entity complements the bank’s broader efforts to tap into the $3 trillion cryptocurrency market and follows the launch of its digital asset custody services in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in September 2024. It wasn’t disclosed which crypto assets would be available to European customers, but the bank currently offers Bitcoin and Ether exposure to its clients in the UAE. Standard Chartered’s foray into blockchain Standard Chartered has a long history with cryptocurrencies, which dates back to 2021 when the bank first announced its intention to offer cryptocurrency trading services. Since then, it has indirectly ventured into crypto trading through its subsidiary, Zodia Markets , a platform offering institutional-grade cryptocurrency trading and settlement services. Over the years, the bank has demonstrated strong support for Bitcoin and was among the few leading institutions predicting that Bitcoin could surpass $100,000 by the end of 2024. Further, the bank has been actively exploring tokenization and completed the first live test of tokenized deposits within Hong Kong’s fintech sandbox in collaboration with Master Card. Meanwhile, in July, it joined the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s stablecoin issuer sandbox alongside Animoca Brands and some other leading institutions, leveraging Zodia Custody’s institutional digital asset custody capabilities to securely manage the issuance and custody of stablecoins during the sandbox experiments.

With rising retail investor interest and speculation surrounding a potential U.S.-based Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), the cryptocurrency is positioned for further growth in 2025. These developments could fuel a significant price rally, solidifying Solana’s status as a key player in the crypto market. Solana Price Surge Anticipated with US ETF Adoption Solana price recently slipped below the critical $200 mark, experiencing a weekly decline of over 7%. However, analysts predict a potential rebound in the coming months, driven by key developments. The anticipated approval of a Solana-focused Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States could significantly boost the demand for altcoin. With five firms, including VanEck and Grayscale, vying for ETF approval, optimism among investors is rising. Market experts believe the approval, likely under President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration, will catalyze retail participation. Despite current corrections, Solana is expected to lead a market recovery by 2025, fueled by growing investor interest and increasing retail demand. SOL Price Analysis The latest SOL price is trading at $191.07, marking a 0.60% decline over the past 24 hours. After failing to sustain its recent upward momentum, Solana has slipped below key support levels, signaling potential further downside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 31, indicating oversold conditions in the short term. While this could point to a potential relief rally, sustained bearish pressure could push the RSI deeper into oversold territory, dampening recovery efforts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator highlights a strengthening bearish trend. The MACD line is below the signal line, accompanied by widening bearish histograms. This setup suggests that selling pressure may persist in the coming sessions. Upside resistance is visible at $200, a psychological level that could trigger buying interest if reclaimed. Beyond this, the next resistance zone lies near $220, aligning with the recent failed breakout level. On the downside, a breach below $190 may accelerate selling, with $160 emerging as a significant support target for Solana price prediction. Solana Price The potential approval of a U.S.-based Solana ETF could drive significant investor interest. While current conditions indicate short-term challenges, Solana’s strong fundamentals and growing demand position it for a potential price rally in 2025.

The SEC Chairman addressed the criticism he’s received during his tenure, notably from high-profile figures like President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk. In an interview with Bloomberg, Gensler recalled a quote from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: “If you’re not willing to be attacked, you can’t go into the public square and debate policy. This role is about overseeing the capital markets that touch everything in our economy. It’s about raising money for most of what we do and how people save,” Gensler said. “I feel terrific about it.” He said that such attacks are part of the process in a democracy, especially when policies affect 330 million Americans. Gensler also touched on the rapidly growing space of cryptocurrency, which has drawn increasing attention from both regulators and the public. “It’s a small part of the market,” he said. “But it’s a space that we keep a close eye on. Gensler also opened up about the SEC’s recent efforts to improve market efficiency, such as reducing the stock settlement cycle from two days to one. This change allows investors to access their funds faster. Additionally, the SEC has implemented new rules requiring companies to notify consumers if their personal data is compromised, addressing a gap in previous federal regulations. However, Gensler acknowledged that some financial intermediaries, such as brokers and stock exchanges, have raised concerns about these changes. He pointed out that, while these entities may object to the new rules, the SEC’s ultimate goal is to serve everyday consumers and ensure that the market operates fairly for them.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 17:44:51

With the nearest resistance at $2.81, a push above this level could signal a strong rally. The coin has gained nearly 12% in the past week, indicating renewed interest. Despite a slight dip over the past month, XRP has soared over 400% in six months. The RSI is near neutral, suggesting room for growth. If XRP breaks past the second resistance at $3.32, we could see significant gains. With the altcoin season approaching, XRP might be gearing up for a substantial move upwards. Dogecoin Eyes Breakout as Momentum Builds Towards $0.55 Dogecoin is showing promising signs, trading between $0.33 and $0.42. Over the past week, it has increased by over 10%, indicating growing momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $0.46. If it breaks this barrier, it could move towards the second resistance at $0.55, which would be a significant rise from current levels. The RSI is around 40, showing that the coin is not overbought, and there may be room for growth. The 10-day SMA is close to the current price, suggesting potential for upward movement. With the overall crypto market turning bullish, Dogecoin could see substantial gains ahead. Bitcoin Nears Key Resistance Amid Bullish Momentum Bitcoin is trading between $93,442 and $101,009, showing signs of a potential rally. Over the past six months, it has surged by 66.92%. The nearest resistance is at $103,706. Breaking this level could push the price toward the second resistance at $111,273, offering gains of over 10%. The Relative Strength Index stands at 33.38, indicating the coin is close to oversold territory, which might lead to an upward reversal. The recent 1-week price change of 2.60% hints at growing momentum. With the crypto market poised for a bull run, Bitcoin could lead the charge, reaching new highs and setting the stage for an altcoin season. Conclusion XRP, DOGE, BTC, and may have less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, stands out.

The total supply is capped at 21 million coins. Every four years, a ""halving"" event reduces miners' rewards by half, affecting supply and mining profitability. Bitcoin aims to provide secure and decentralized transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks. Its potential lies in transforming financial systems and offering an alternative to traditional currencies. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin remains significant and continues to attract interest for its technological innovation and growth potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on Ethereum. Launched in 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with 1 quadrillion tokens. Half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a large portion to a COVID-19 relief fund in India and burned 40% of the total supply. Being on Ethereum allows SHIB to work with applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system. This integration with Ethereum's ecosystem gives SHIB potential beyond a meme coin. In the current market cycle, its broader utility positions SHIB as a coin with possible growth prospects. Conclusion While BTC and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN appeals to those seeking luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale end and potential thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows BONK, WIF, and Popcat's path. Building a community of alpha leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

Citing information from Guelph Police Service spokesperson Scott Tracey, CBC reports that the scheme started in an online chat forum where the victim connected with a person whom he came to believe as someone from his childhood in China. The two began talking in a public forum in July. By September, the conversation had moved to private chat, and the purported childhood friend had managed to entice the victim into making crypto investments. Tracey says that from mid-September to the end of November, the man sent approximately $188,000 to the fraudster. “The victim started making transfers to this person, believing that he was sending the transfers for the purposes of buying cryptocurrency.” The unnamed victim contacted the police this week, fearing that he was scammed after the friend asked for more funds, specifically a 30% verification fee. But the police say there is a small chance of recovering the lost funds given that the scammer is based overseas. In this case, the victim believes the perpetrator is somewhere in Asia. Says Tracey, “It’s very difficult for us to obviously investigate that and the victim was told that it’s almost impossible to recoup the lost funds. That’s why we try to be as proactive as we can in terms of telling people that this is happening and encouraging them not to fall victim and to be aware of some of the warning signs.” Tracey says people should always ask questions when conversing with someone online about cryptocurrency. “The scams that are going around are always being altered to try to defeat peoples’ skepticism. I think we have to adjust our response and encourage the public to adjust their response to meet the new techniques being employed by the scammers.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The operation, which caused major financial losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of Baht, was dismantled on January 9, 2025. The mining farm had rigged its electricity meters to consume large amounts of power at night while appearing normal during the day. During the raid, nearly 1,000 Bitcoin mining rigs were seized, with the operation carried out in collaboration with the Crime Suppression Division (CSD). The identities of the operators remain unknown, and investigations are ongoing. Bitcoin mining requires electricity for its high-performance computers, and some miners resort to illegal activities to reduce costs. This incident is not the first of its kind in Thailand, with previous illegal mining operations discovered in 2024, causing local blackouts. Thailand’s Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) is expected to increase efforts to prevent electricity theft, while the CSD continues to investigate this operation. The global issue of illegal Bitcoin mining is not unique to Thailand, as countries like Russia have also dealt with similar incidents, including a raid in 2024 where authorities seized hundreds of mining rigs that were exploiting household electricity rates. Additionally, Thailand faces growing concerns over crypto-related crimes, including a cross-border fraud network recently dismantled in 2024 that operated across Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar. However, in November 2024, Binance’s Chief Marketing Officer, Rachel Conlan, said that Thailand is one of the exchange’s top 20 global markets, with crypto penetration in the country estimated at 12%, double the global average.

38725702,https://blockworks.co/news/thorchain-executive-decision-restructuring,1736445600,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,ThorChain struggles following executive decision,https://blockworks.co/news/thorchain-executive-decision-restructuring,"ThorChain founder JP Thorbjornsen and the development team have decided to pause the ThorFi Savers and Lending programs for the next 12 months. The decision, announced Thursday, comes after consultations with key community members, devs and node operators, according to the project’s Discord. Thorchain is a decentralized liquidity protocol that enables cross-chain asset swaps without the need for wrapped tokens or centralized exchanges. It allows users to trade native assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and others directly on the platform, using its native token, RUNE, to facilitate transactions and secure liquidity pools. But the protocol is undergoing a major restructuring to make it more secure and easier to understand. THORFi, a complex component of the ecosystem, has been identified as a primary source of volatility, particularly due to un-throttled redemptions that are driving away new participants and hindering progress on the 2025 roadmap, developers say. By pausing these features, the team aims to ensure that the protocol is ready to scale efficiently. Read more: Code vulnerability puts damper on RUNE’s wild run Under pressure Inflation of RUNE’s circulating supply has contributed directly to the token’s poor price action. Several mechanisms are behind this inflation, including block rewards distributed to validators. As with many chains, RUNE is minted to reward participants, thus diluting its value. There is a growing consensus that these rewards should be reduced, but the specifics and timing of such changes are a matter of debate. Beyond block rewards, other mechanisms such as Savers and Lending programs have added additional pressure. The Savers program, which was designed to create buy pressure for RUNE, has instead exacerbated the situation by creating substantial sell pressure when users withdraw their deposits. The dynamic is simple: When users enter Savers, they must purchase RUNE, but when they exit, they sell it. This cycle becomes problematic when RUNE is underperforming relative to bitcoin. As users exit at lower prices, they trigger further declines in RUNE’s value, creating a feedback loop. Lending has similarly introduced inflationary effects. While it has already been shuttered, its lingering impact continues to affect the RUNE price. Loans and collateral, primarily backed by BTC and ETH, have created liabilities that are hard to repay as the value of RUNE declines. The situation is compounded by the fact that, due to the current state of the market, more RUNE is being minted to cover obligations, further diluting the token. Sunset of Savers In light of these concerns, community members have called for immediate action to address the protocol’s structural weaknesses. The most immediate of these is the sunset of the Savers program, which continues to exert downward pressure on RUNE’s price. The plan put forward includes a 72-hour period for dissent and discussion, allowing the community to voice concerns and potentially campaign for an unwinding of the decision. If no changes occur, a six-month “timeout” will follow, during which no further discussions or economic changes will be entertained. Developers will shift focus entirely to the app layer, optimizing bandwidth and accelerating development without the overhang of THORFi-related distractions. After six months, the idea is to tokenize Lending and Saver positions, offering holders early liquidity on a peer-to-peer market. By the 12-month mark, a restructuring plan will be presented to provide liquidity for legacy THORFi holders, potentially introducing a System Income Tax that would remain until all positions are cleared. Some have called for a more radical solution: Force the closure of all outstanding loans. On X, ThorTrades expressed his concern on the sunset plan. “If BTC trades at $75-85k, Rune will trade under $3 likely. Best to use this bad moment in the market to get rid of something bad (loans),” he wrote, arguing this aggressive action should be taken immediately. “The right moment to force loans to close was above $6 but the second best moment might be now.” So it seems Thorchain is at a crossroads. The combination of underperforming RUNE, inflated supply, and growing liabilities threatens to undermine the protocol’s long-term viability. It’s clear that some immediate action is needed to halt this spiral. The protocol has already made strides in decentralization and cross-chain liquidity, but to ensure its survival, the Thorchain team looks to confront these internal challenges head-on. The question now is whether node operators will play ball, and what comes of brewing community backlash. As JP put it, “prepare your pitchforks,” and be prepared to make the tough calls to save the protocol. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Prioritizing accessibility, Geo Genesis is expected to make Web3 accessible even to inexperienced users and encourage wider participation in decentralized ecosystems . As such, the launch signals a shift from asset-based to knowledge-centric apps, showcasing the protocol’s steady focus on decentralized collaboration. Geo Genesis Spaces Central to the Geo Genesis design are the so-called Spaces, collaborative hubs where users and whole communities can gather to manage and govern knowledge collectively. Spaces are built on the modular Aragon OSx framework, which allows for scalable decentralized governance. In the future, Spaces will also offer fully customizable governance processes. This approach aims to promote interconnected knowledge while aligning the platform with Web3 principles such as verifiability, openness, and composability. Web3 knowledge graphs Yaniv Tal, The Graph co-founder and leading Geo Genesis developer, described Web3 as fundamentally about information. As the company’s latest development, Geo Genesis embodies this stance as a platform where knowledge is organized into interconnected knowledge graphs. The GRC-20 standard plays a crucial role in this organization, enhancing interoperability, adaptability, and composability of knowledge across decentralized applications (dApps). Geo Genesis early access Geo Genesis is now in early access, featuring the default governance framework characterized by two key roles: Editors (i.e., those who vote on governance matters) and Members (i.e., those who contribute to their Space). During the early access phase, communities can request invites to start building their own Spaces or explore those already available in the knowledge graph. In addition, there is an initial group of Editors working on delivering cryptocurrency news to illustrate how knowledge graphs can structure stories more effectively. As mentioned, communities will gain full customization capabilities in the near future, paving the way for an even more decentralized and collaborative platform.

The product will allow anyone to create spaces and build knowledge feeds. The Graph will launch a new platform, Geo Genesis, centred around user-generated spaces with curated knowledge feeds. After years of development, The Graph created the GRC-20 standard for data aggregation, tapping the rich information of other Web3 apps. Geo Genesis will bring a new form of content format, the Spaces, which mixes data aggregation with Web3 social media. Geo Genesis will let users design their information feeds with collaboration and voting features. The Geo Genesis feature will work as one of the subgraphs for the platform, with most of its capabilities still in the making. All user-generated knowledge spaces will be reflected in The Graph’s decentralized structures. Contributors to the Spaces will also be able to vote and achieve consensus on data and content. Geo Genesis aims to attract regular users rather than just experienced developers. The Graph aims to go beyond mechanical data, though this information is key for app-builders. As the crypto space switches to narratives and memes, The Graph aims to collect human-readable and composable data. The new Geo Genesis feature will add mechanisms for curation and governance and support for Natural Language Processing through LLMs. The platform will fulfil the goal of unified access to all data while creating human-readable knowledge graphs. Geo Genesis opens with early access tests Geo Genesis will launch as a limited launch, with a waiting list for early access. The platform’s goal is to build a collection of creators who will build their Spaces with Web3 data. The other participants in the ecosystem will be the Editors, who will curate and evaluate the spaces. At the early stage, users can request an invitation and join as Members to contribute content. Anyone can browse the available news, data boards, or other spaces curated by editors. The structure of Geo Genesis resembles previous Web3 SocialFi apps, where voting and curation can be tokenized and bring value. The new data and news format will show the capabilities of The Graph while also building a new SocialFi feature. While offering a user-directed front, The Graph will also expand its data querying capabilities to produce more content based on Web3 information. The Graph builds information packages for the decentralized Internet and Web3 apps, where on-chain data is not always available. Some of the curated data help Solana developers , where not all on-chain events are always accessible. The Graph still offers data composition tools for developers So far, the Graph has mostly directed its features toward developers. The project has existed since 2018, quickly becoming the go-to indexing tool for multiple chains. The Graph supports data and indexing for over 80 blockchains, including Ethereum and its L2, Solana, Avalanche, Gnosis, and others. The Graph will aim to expand its specialized data services, focusing on verifiable data and new query languages and adding support for LLMs. As Web3 apps become more complex and the search for the best tokens becomes complicated – the graph expects more demand for data and analytical tools and the ability to build dashboards. Even before creating the roles of content producer and editor, the Graph network offered roles as data indexers or delegators , while anyone could build and launch a new subgraph. The Graph is a utility product and one of the well-established crypto networks. Over the years, It has raised more than $82M in financing, launching its GRT token as a utility asset. The project has received backing from Coinbase Ventures and other smaller funds. GRT tokens are trading around $0.20, still down from their peak above $2.30 during the 2021 bull market. Interest in GRT may increase as a new wave of developments focusing on AI agents takes over Web3.

As a result, a crypto analyst has shared a rather lengthy X (formerly Twitter) post outlining what to expect following this significant decline. He warns of critical levels to watch as selling pressures intensify, noting that both macro and technical indicators paint a mixed picture of Bitcoin’s short-term price trajectory. Key Levels To Watch After The Bitcoin Price Crash According to prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the Bitcoin price is once again trading below $100,000 after surpassing this milestone earlier this week. Martinez revealed that in the previous day, Bitcoin breached the right shoulder of a Head and Shoulder pattern, completely invalidating its bearish setup at the time. However, in just 24 hours, the cryptocurrency erased these significant gains, pushing its price back below the right shoulder of the technical pattern and reigniting bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidations Cross $24 Million As Bulls Suffer Double-Digit Beat Down With its massive crash below $100,000, Bitcoin has now plummeted significantly below the key demand zone between $95,000 and $98,000, an area where approximately 1.77 million wallet addresses had purchased more than 1.53 million BTC, worth over 141.3 billion at the present market rate. While many investors typically buy and hold BTC for profit, the recent Bitcoin price crash has raised concerns that owners of the 1.77 million wallet addresses may be forced to sell off their holdings to cut down potential losses. Martinez warns that rising selling pressures could push the Bitcoin price below $92,000, potentially triggering an even sharper and more rapid decline, with limited support until it reaches the $74,000 mark. Notably, the analyst labels a drop below $92,000 a “free fall territory,” meaning Bitcoin could continue to crash as panic selling intensifies and liquidity dries up. Adding to the ongoing uncertainty, Bitcoin’s reversal below the right shoulder of the Head and Shoulders pattern, combined with current bearish market conditions, has reignited fears, leaving many investors bracing for a deeper price crash. Rebound On The Horizon Or More Pain Ahead? Despite Bitcoin’s current bearish outlook, Martinez reassures crypto community members that a price rebound is possible. The analyst disclosed that Bitcoin’s TD sequential indicator recently flashed a buy signal on the 4-hour chart, suggesting that a potential price recovery and rebound may be underway.

Martinez highlights that a sustained break above the $100,000 mark is critical to invalidating Bitcoin’s current bearish outlook and setting the stage for new all-time highs. However, if Bitcoin fails to reclaim this psychological level and falls below $92,000, it risks further downside, potentially correcting toward new range lows between $78,000 and $74,000. As of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at $94,154, meaning a drop in these range lows would mark a massive 17.16% to 21.41% decline.

Amid this, Bitcoin (BTC) the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has experienced a price decline of over 10% and has reached a crucial level. $1.02 Billion Worth of BTC Outflow from Exchanges It has been three days since the market witnessed a continuous price decline, but one thing gathering significant attention from crypto enthusiasts is the ongoing accumulation by long-term holders, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges, during the same period, witnessed an outflow of over $1.02 billion worth of BTC. This substantial outflow indicates that long-term holders have withdrawn these BTC from exchanges to their wallets, which is a positive sign. Is This the Right Time to Buy Bitcoin? This data clearly shows that whales and long-term holders are consistently buying BTC , taking advantage of the recent price decline ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. BTC’s Path to $100K or a Drop to $74K? With the continuous price decline, the BTC price has reached its crucial level near the $92,250 mark, where it consistently experiences price rebounds.
