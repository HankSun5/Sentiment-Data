With Remittix aiming to redefine the PayFi sector, its early funding phase has drawn significant attention from established meme coins. As the Dogecoin price stabilizes and PEPE faces competition, RTX joins the league of contenders in 2025. This article explores all three tokens for crypto enthusiasts looking for the next major breakout. Remittix: A PayFi Revolution In The Making The Remittix presale is gaining momentum as it captures the attention of early adopters and investors eager to ride the wave of the PayFi revolution. With its mission to transform cross-border payments by integrating blockchain technology and traditional financial systems, Remittix stands poised to redefine how money moves globally. What’s driving the hype? For one, the presale introduces a tiered token allocation system designed to reward early participation. Each block of tokens is sold at a fixed price, with subsequent blocks unlocking at higher price thresholds. This structure not only incentivizes early investments but also reflects confidence in the token’s long-term growth potential. The presale’s appeal is amplified by Remittix’s robust use cases. From enabling businesses to accept crypto payments via its Pay API to offering seamless fiat conversions for personal remittances, the platform addresses both niche and broad financial challenges. Investors are particularly drawn to its flat-fee structure, which eliminates hidden costs and ensures transparency—qualities that resonate in today’s evolving financial landscape. DOGE Faces Network Slowdown In 2025 The Dogecoin price has faced persistent selling pressure, with its price declining by 18% over the past month. The DOGE decline is partly attributed to reduced retail interest and stagnation in network activity. Technical indicators paint a bearish picture, with the RSI trending below 40, signaling weakened buying momentum. Furthermore, DOGE’s decline in active addresses and hodler’s balance support the bearish sentiment. DOGE has failed to sustain critical support at $0.065, leading analysts to eye the next support level at $0.050. With no major updates or collaborations, investor confidence in DOGE appears to be waning, potentially leading to further declines. Large Scale PEPE Dump Following Negative Netflows PEPE has seen a sharp 22% decline in its price over the past month, wiping out much of its prior gains. The coin’s poor performance is linked to decreasing transaction volumes and waning interest among speculative investors. Its RSI has slipped into oversold territory, but there’s no sign of a PEPE recovery as the MACD remains firmly negative. Adding to the challenges, PEPE has seen consistent negative netflow, suggesting large-scale dumping by early adopters. The coin is now trading dangerously close to a key support level of $0.000015. A breach of this level could trigger a cascading sell-off, pushing PEPE to test lower levels. Without strong use cases or renewed market interest, PEPE’s prospects for recovery remain dim. Conclusion As DOGE and PEPE face mounting challenges, the Remittix presale shines as a beacon for investors seeking growth in the PayFi sector. At just $0.0193, now is the perfect time to join the presale and secure a stake in a project poised to lead the financial revolution. Don’t wait—invest in Remittix today!

This follows Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s announcement of his resignation on January 7, in the wake of the abrupt departure of his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland. The Endorsement Musk shared a video of Poilievre discussing inflation and fiscal policy on X, captioning it, “Perfectly articulated.” As the Conservative Party leader, he is now widely seen as the frontrunner to succeed Trudeau, with Canada’s federal election scheduled for October 20, 2025. The video has gained a lot of attention, particularly from the cryptocurrency community, which has rallied behind him due to his pro-crypto stance and advocacy for innovation. The opposition leader has been a long-time supporter of Bitcoin, frequently appearing on digital asset podcasts and advocating for Canada to become the “blockchain capital of the world.” In his 2022 campaign, he made his backing of the flagship cryptocurrency clear by using it to pay for shawarma, a move reminiscent of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s purchase of burgers in New York’s PubKey bar, using BTC. A few weeks later, he donated $100 worth of Bitcoin to the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Additionally, he pledged to remove taxes on crypto donations if he became Prime Minister. The 45-year-old has also made several pro-crypto statements. On one occasion, he argued that “Canadians should have the freedom to use other forms of money, like Bitcoin,” criticizing the government for “ruining” the country’s fiat currency. Poilievre has also been an outspoken critic of Canada’s central bank. In April 2022, he attributed the North American nation’s record inflation to the institution’s controversial policies. He also said that alternatives like Bitcoin were essential in addressing Canada’s economic challenges. Further, a Reuters report from April last year showed that the 45-year-old voiced his support for legislation that would block the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the country. Poilievre’s Odds and Vancouver’s Bitcoin Moves Data from the prediction market Polymarket shows that Poilievre has an 89% chance of winning the upcoming election, far ahead of the next closest contender, Chrystia Freeland, who has just a 7% chance. In related news, on December 11, Vancouver’s City Council approved a motion put forward by Mayor Ken Sim, suggesting the city consider holding Bitcoin in reserve and accepting cryptocurrency payments for municipal services. Local media revealed that the proposal passed along party lines, with Sim and ABC Vancouver councilors in favor, while two Green councilors opposed it. Sim has also committed to donating $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in support of the initiative. “Bitcoin is the number one performing asset on the planet over the last 16 years, so to not even look at including it as a part of a diversified portfolio is, I think, reckless,” he said.

This page is going to be dedicated to the games that we can consider underrated in the gambling industry. As there are so many big games now that players can play, we understand that some players are unlikely to try new games that they may not like when they have games that they love. However, we think that going into these games with an open mind could help you find some new favorites. Bingo Bingo is a massive part of gambling and has been for decades now. However, with the recent technological advancements in the gambling industry, the popularity of bingo on online casinos has become an underrated part of the industry. Not only is playing online bingo as fun as it would be in the bingo halls, but it is also easier to play. Playing bingo in person requires you to find a bingo hall and be out while you play, however, playing online allows players to play online bingo wherever they want. As well as this, there are even more options available for bingo players who play online, with some games having higher winning potential or different themes entirely, the experience is crafted to give players whatever they want. As well as this, you have different types of bingo games, like slingo which we will get into later, that allows players to find the exact type of game they want at any time and in any place. Slingo Slot Games Now slingo is the hybrid of two of the most exciting casino games, bingo and slots, and offers layers of the perfect mix of both games. The positives we spoke about a minute ago, with players being able to play bingo at any time and in any place, remain true for when you play slingo slots but with even more variety available. The winning potential of slingo slots is higher than that of bingo games and with the nice blend of skill and luck, slingo slots are one of the most underrated games around. Baccarat Unlike with Bingo, baccarat is a game that you may have never even heard of despite being one of the best additions to the gambling industry ever. With it being overshadowed by poker and blackjack, baccarat hides in the shadows of these games and is waiting for new players. The reason why baccarat is so good is because the game itself is known for its simplicity and high winning potential which is the perfect blend you want for all your games. The game itself is easy to learn but hard to master, the game requires you to bet on whether you think the dealer or the player with a hand that is closer to nine. On the surface, it sounds easy and playing it is also as easy as it sounds. Although down the line there will be strategies that you can learn and tips that will help you win more , the game itself is easy to play and has a good winning potential despite the ease.

Lightchain AI, BlockDag Or Remittix?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/which-of-these-crypto-investments-will-likely-make-you-rich-in-2025-lightchain-ai-blockdag-or-remittix,"As the crypto industry progresses in 2025, creative ideas pushing the limit of technology are transforming various global sectors. With their innovative approaches to artificial intelligence, blockchain scalability, and crypto-fiat integration, three standouts—Litechain AI (LCAI), BlockDAG (BDAG), and Remittix (RTX)—are drawing investors in particular. Which of these initiatives, though, promises perhaps life-changing returns? Could it be BlockDAG's lightning-fast transaction speeds, Litechain AI's groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence consensus, or Remittix's seamless link between crypto and conventional finance? Read on to explore the particular advantages of these crypto projects. Lightchain AI Is Pioneering Inclusive Decentralized Intelligence By introducing Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a green consensus mechanism that focuses computational resources towards significant AI tasks, Lightchain AI is redefining the blockchain sector. PoI presents Lightchain AI as a sustainable substitute by lowering the environmental impact sometimes connected with blockchain activities. This breakthrough approach enables decentralized model training, allowing nodes to cooperate on creating worldwide artificial intelligence models without violating data privacy. Every node provides updates from local data that the network checks and combines into a single, shared model. Furthermore, Lightchain AI's decentralized inference marketplace lets users ask for AI-powered chores—such as data analysis or language translation—while nodes get the LCAI token for running these calculations. The current LCAI price in stage 11 is a tempting $0.004875 while the Lightchain AI presale is under progress. Significant rallies predicted by analysts this year already point to the LCAI token as a profitable investment. BlockDAG: Redefining Blockchain for a Sustainable Future By combining modern Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with a clear vision for scalability and sustainability, BlockDAG is redefining the crypto space. BlockDAG performs lightning-fast transaction speeds, processing thousands of transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization or security, unlike conventional blockchains. Its hybrid proof-of-work consensus system guarantees strong network integrity, and its sophisticated cryptography systems protect data against attacks. BlockDAG's EVM compatibility also enables smooth interaction with Ethereum's ecosystem, therefore enabling developers to use its low-code drag-and-drop tools to produce creative ideas. With this new platform, which promotes itself as a transforming agent, the BDAG token is among the top crypto coins to hold in 2025. Starting from just $0.0001 during the BlockDAGpresale, the BDAG price is expected to rise to $0.05 by the last presale stage. Having already raised more than $175 million, the BlockDAG presale highlights great investor trust. Remittix: Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance Seamlessly Remittix is redefining the way cryptocurrencies interface with existing financial systems, creating a seamless platform for fast crypto-to-cash conversions via bank transfers. Moreover, Remittix guarantees receivers remain ignorant that crypto was involved in the transaction with its creative technique, therefore establishing a clear and quick link between digital assets and traditional financial systems. By combining blockchain technology with current financial systems, this original solution exceeds rivals such as Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase in speed, security, and efficiency for cross-border payments. Positioned to profit from the $183 trillion worldwide banking sector, Remittixis becoming the best crypto investment choice for forward-looking investors. Meanwhile, Remittix provides an unmissable entrance point for investors ready to profit on the growing demand for crypto-fiat integration at a presale price of just $0.0193 per RTX token. Unlike many initiatives, Remittix lets all tokens be claimable merely five days after launch, therefore exempting presale buyers from vesting time. The RTX token is poised for further rallies as the financial industry adopts cryptocurrency solutions. Why Remittix Outshines Litechain AI and BlockDAG With innovative technologies that fit several sectors, Litechain AI, BlockDAG, and Remittixeach give interesting prospects as the crypto market gets ready for a bullish 2025. While BlockDAG advocates blockchain speed and scalability to hitherto unheard-of levels, LitechainAI pioneers AI-integrated decentralization. Remittix, however, stands out as the best crypto investment since it deftly closes the distance between cryptocurrencies and conventional banking, a market ready for explosive expansion in the coming years. The RTX coin presents a great chance for investors as the presale tokens are fast selling out because of the rising investor interest and limited token supply.

Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting dropped today, showing us a room full of officials who are uneasy about inflation and scratching their heads over what Trump’s policies on trade and immigration might mean for the economy. His name wasn’t directly mentioned—because, of course—but his incoming administration’s moves are all over the discussion. The Fed has been walking a tightrope since inflation started throwing tantrums. While recent data shows some signs of cooling, it’s not enough to make anyone at the Fed relax. Inflation slows, but not enough Total consumer price inflation, measured by the 12-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, was sitting at 2.3% in October, a drop from 3.0% in the same period last year. Core PCE inflation—stripping out the usual suspects like food and energy—was at 2.8%, down from 3.4% a year earlier. By November, estimates pointed to total PCE inflation at 2.5% and core inflation holding steady at 2.8%. Consumer price index (CPI) data told a similar story. In November, CPI inflation came in at 2.7%, with core CPI at 3.3%. Both figures are lower than they were in 2023, but they’re not low enough for anyone to throw a party. The Fed remains laser-focused on core inflation, which hasn’t cooled as much as expected, thanks to sticky categories like services. Labor market conditions are also changing, though only slightly. Average monthly payroll gains were slower in October and November compared to the third quarter, partly because of strikes and natural disasters. The unemployment rate inched up to 4.2% in November, with participation rates dipping as well. Still, wages didn’t flinch, holding steady with a 4% year-over-year increase in November. Economic growth holds steady, foreign markets stumble The US economy isn’t doing too badly—at least for now. GDP growth in the third quarter was solid, matching the pace of the second quarter. Consumer spending and private investments pushed the numbers up, but imports outpaced exports, creating a drag. In the fourth quarter, indicators showed that GDP growth stayed strong, with consumer and private spending leading the charge again. Meanwhile, imports dropped off in October, particularly capital goods. Overseas, it’s a bit complicated. The eurozone and Mexico saw growth in the third quarter, but by year’s end, momentum was running out of steam. Manufacturing slowed, and private consumption remained weak. China, meanwhile, struggled with low retail sales growth, weak domestic demand despite high-tech production in other parts of Asia staying hot, thanks to US demand. Inflation in advanced economies eased, thanks to earlier drops in energy prices, but services inflation refused to budge in some areas. Latin America, especially Brazil, faced a different beast, with rising inflation fueled by currency issues. Markets adjust to Fed signals Now let’s talk markets. Investors have been adjusting their expectations for rate cuts ever since the Fed started showing its cautious side. Treasury yields initially rose post-election but flattened out by the end of the period covered in the minutes. Near-term inflation expectations nudged higher, while long-term measures barely moved. Equity markets, on the other hand, were riding a wave of optimism. Stocks in cyclical sectors shot up, with investors betting on strong corporate profits. High-yield bond spreads narrowed, and the VIX—a gauge of stock market volatility—dropped to levels much lower than before the election. Bitcoin, though, remains below $100,000 after falling down yesterday. Internationally, things weren’t so rosy. Weak data from abroad and expectations of rate cuts from foreign central banks pulled bond yields down in advanced economies, boosting the dollar some more. Foreign equities underperformed US stocks, reflecting expectations of diverging economic growth between the US and the rest of the world. Central banks abroad were busy too. Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, and Mexico all cut rates during the period. Brazil, on the other hand, went rogue, hiking its rate by 100 basis points to fight inflation. Borrowing costs remain high, households feel the squeeze Despite some stability in short-term funding markets, borrowing costs in the US remained high across the board. Mortgage rates ticked down slightly but stayed historically elevated. Auto loans and credit card rates remained near record highs, although auto loan rates did see minor decreases. Corporate borrowers saw a bit of relief, with yields on investment-grade and speculative bonds dipping. Commercial real estate loans, after stalling in the third quarter, picked up slightly in October, but delinquencies in this sector continued to climb. Small businesses had it rough, facing tight credit conditions and weak loan originations. Households didn’t have it much better. While credit was generally available for those with strong credit scores, delinquencies on credit cards continued to rise. Federal Housing Administration mortgage delinquencies stayed above pre-pandemic levels, adding to the pressure on lower-income borrowers. The Fed will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed assets. However, officials are keeping a close eye on data and will make adjustments as necessary. They said, “The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-08 22:29:22

Trump’s Fury Over Interest Rates Signals Big Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-blast-trump-high-interest-rates/,"Bitcoin experts are buzzing as President-elect Donald Trump lashed out against current Federal Reserve policy, calling interest rates “far too high” despite persistent inflationary pressures. “We are inheriting a difficult situation from the outgoing administration,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago club, adding that officials seem to be “trying everything they can to make it more difficult” for his incoming team. The blunt remarks, coming fewer than two weeks before Trump’s inauguration, have stoked anticipation of a possible shift in US monetary policy—and raised speculation about a boost for Bitcoin and other risk assets in the new year. The 2017 Trump Playbook: Dollar “Too Strong”, Bitcoin Up? Although the economic and geopolitical landscape has changed since Trump’s first term, some market watchers see parallels to his 2017 rhetoric. Back then, he lambasted a US dollar that he deemed “too strong,” a stance that preceded a notable decline in the currency. The US Dollar Index (DXY) peaked near 104 in early January 2017 but began a downward trend that extended into early 2018, bottoming out around 98. Related Reading: Anticipating A ‘2025 Super Cycle’: Bitcoin Rallies With Trump’s Regulatory Reforms On The Horizon This sharp move in the dollar coincided with a broader risk-on environment, fueling rallies in equities as well as the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), drew a direct comparison on X. “The last time Trump said something was ‘too high,’ it was the dollar – back in January 2017, just days before his inauguration,” Bittel stated and recounted: “Here’s what he said: ‘Our companies can’t compete with them now because our currency is too strong. And it’s killing us.” Notably, last year, Trump also called recent strength a “tremendous burden on US businesses.” Bittel further argued: “Trump understands the impact of a strong dollar – and the same logic applies to high interest rates. They suppress exports, hurt corporate earnings, and slow economic growth.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Signal That Took Price From $69,000 To $108,000 Appears Again Speaking on the impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, Bittel concluded: “What happened next? Well, the dollar began a significant decline, setting the stage for one of the most pivotal macro moves we’ve seen in years – triggering a melt-up in risk assets. Déjà vu? I think so. Let’s see how it plays out.” Bittel is not the only expert speculating that the DXY may already have peaked, mirroring its 2017 topping pattern. Steve Donzé, Deputy CIO for Multi Asset at Pictet Asset Management Japan, shared a widely discussed chart on X, remarking “On time. Ready for pushback,” while overlaying recent DXY movements with the currency’s trajectory in early 2017. The chart suggests a similar pattern that could foreshadow renewed dollar weakness in the coming weeks. In a separate post, financial analyst Silver Surfer (@SilverSurfer_23) pointed to an uncanny timing overlap: “DXY topped on January 3rd, 2017—18 days before Trump’s Inauguration. DXY looks to have topped on January 2nd, 2025—19 days before Trump’s Inauguration.” He characterized the parallel as “crazy history repeating,” explaining that he sees a correlation between the path of the DXY before both inaugurations. Such analogies are fueling speculation that a repeat dollar slump could usher in an environment favoring risk assets. Should the dollar indeed enter a new downtrend—much like in 2017–2018—Bitcoin could ride a wave of renewed liquidity and speculative appetite. At press time, BTC traded at $94,950.

Simon’s Cat (CAT): From Meme to Marketing Genius Simon’s Cat is proof that meme coins can have claws. Launched just a few months back, CAT has surged in popularity thanks to its savvy marketing and an army of social media enthusiasts. With its roots in the viral animated series of the same name, this coin brings a touch of nostalgia and a hefty dose of charm to the crypto scene. But CAT isn’t just cute; it’s clever. The project has capitalised on its branding with a series of token burns, exchange listings, and airdrops that keep the community buzzing. One word: relatability. Everyone loves a cheeky cat, and Simon’s Cat taps into that universal appeal. But beyond the memes, CAT has plans to integrate into NFT marketplaces and offer exclusive content to holders. Imagine owning not just the coin but a piece of the brand itself—an exclusive NFT or a sneak peek at new episodes. Analysts predict Simon’s Cat could claw its way to a 50% price increase by the end of the quarter, making it one of the best new meme coins to invest in right now. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Satire Meets Serious Gains Non-Playable Coin, or NPC, started as a tongue-in-cheek jab at crypto culture but has quickly turned into a bona fide investment opportunity. Its name might scream “joke,” but this project is anything but. NPC’s innovative tokenomics and decentralised governance model have caught the attention of investors who know that meme coins often hide some serious tech under all the memes. NPC has built its brand on satire, but the real magic lies in its ecosystem. The coin is pegged to its own metaverse, where users can trade, play, and even create their own NPC avatars. It’s a meta twist on the crypto space that feels fresh and fun. NPC’s decentralised approach gives the community a real voice, from voting on project developments to deciding on token burns. This transparency has built a loyal following that sees NPC as more than a meme—it’s a statement. Conclusion: The Meme Coin Market’s Bright Future Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that BTFD Coin, Simon’s Cat, and Non-Playable Coin are leading the charge in the meme coin revolution.

With this in mind, a new altcoin, Remittix (RTC) , has become a hot topic among investors for its massive profit potential. Dubbed the “SHIB killer” and the best presale token of 2025, analysts project Remittix could offer up to 5,000% to early backers. Over 125 million RTX tokens have been sold, with over $2 million raised in funding in just a few weeks. Here’s why investors are backing Remittix to surpass Shiba Inu’s success. Remittix Redefines Cross-Border Transactions with Its Unique VIP Program Remittix (RTX) is taking a new approach to cross-border payments. Unlike competitors like Wise and Stripe, which mainly focus on fiat-to-fiat transactions, Remittix is building a platform that allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies instantly. These funds can then be sent to approved banks worldwide. The seamless process makes it nearly impossible for recipients to tell the transaction started as crypto. Plus, with Remittix’s flat fees and no hidden charges, the recipient gets what the user sends. Remittix has passed rigorous security audits by leading blockchain firms SolidProof and BlockSAFU, ensuring it’s safe and reliable. The team has also locked its liquidity pool and tokens for three years to build confidence further. This move prevents sudden sell-offs and stabilizes the project, proving its commitment to long-term growth and investor protection. The $RTX token is the backbone of the Remittix platform, driving key features like staking and governance. Investors can earn between 4% and 8% by staking their tokens. The VIP program offers tiered rewards for those aiming higher, with top-tier investors enjoying up to 18% APY and exclusive voting privileges. Presently in presale at $0.0193 per token, $RTX provides a distinctive opportunity for early investors. Industry experts forecast gains of up to 900% in presale and 4,500% post-launch. The increasing attention suggests Remittix might challenge industry titans like Shiba Inu in 2025. SHIB News: Whales Exit While Retail Investors Step In In the latest SHIB news, on-chain data shows a shift in investor behavior weighing on Shiba Inu. Wallets with 10 million to 100 million worth of SHIB tokens have dropped by 20%, andaddresses with $10,000 to $1M worth of SHIB dropped by 16-22%. This signals a major sell-off by larger investors, possibly due to fading confidence or profit-taking at current prices. On the contrary, smaller retail investors are investing more money into Shiba Inu's potential. Wallets with $1 to $1,000 worth of Shiba Inu have risen by 7.25%, reflecting an ongoing interest among everyday traders. While this shows that Shiba Inu still grabs attention, the market’s stability may be at risk as whales exit and smaller buyers take over. In other SHIB news, Shiba Inu’s trading volume is up 39%, offering some optimism. However, Shiba Inu must reclaim the $0.00002555 resistance level—where whales were active before—to spark a real recovery. Otherwise, the price might dip toward $0.00002200. A turnaround likely depends on stronger trading activity and renewed interest from larger players. For now, caution is key. Why Remittix Could Be the Next Shiba Inu Rival Shiba Inu took the crypto world by storm in 2021 but hasn't replicated that success since. Remittix's stated objective of transforming cross-border payments and the possible expansion of the $RTX token makes it a serious contender. A $100 investment in Remittix today has the potential to grow into $100,000, offering an incredible opportunity for early adopters.

He also emphasized its significance for innovative American companies seeking to trade on premier stock exchanges. “Exodus is thrilled to uplist on the NYSE American. It’s crucial that America’s innovative companies can trade on America’s premier stock exchanges. We expect this uplisting will raise Exodus’ corporate profile, while also enhancing liquidity for our current and future shareholders.” Richardson said . Exodus expressed its commitment to continue innovating within the cryptocurrency sector. The self-custodial wallet provider’s transition to a more prominent exchange will attract a broader investment base and increase its market visibility and shareholder value.

Table of Contents XYZ: The new meme coin heavyweight Ethereum IOTA Ethena POPCAT Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for a significant shift in 2025. Key digital assets are expected to rise above the rest, showing remarkable growth. This article uncovers the top five cryptocurrencies highlighted by ChatGPT to lead this upcoming surge. XYZ: The new meme coin heavyweight XYZVerse breaks the mold as the first all-sports meme token, blending the excitement of sports fandom with the viral appeal of meme culture. Its ecosystem goes beyond speculative hype, offering real-world applications like prediction markets, entertainment dApps, and community-driven rewards, making it a standout among meme coins and altcoins alike. Priced at $0.001333 in its presale phase, XYZVerse presents a significant opportunity for early investors. By the final stage of the presale, the token is projected to reach $0.1, a massive 7,402% increase. With the market poised for exponential growth, XYZVerse could become one of the most profitable digital assets of 2025. Backed by audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for major CEX and DEX listings, XYZVerse is built on a foundation of security and scalability. Its transformative approach of integrating sports and meme culture taps into a multi-billion-dollar industry, creating a robust platform with widespread appeal. While established names like Ethereum and XRP remain strong contenders, XYZVerse’s fresh approach and massive growth potential give it a unique edge. It represents the kind of forward-thinking project that could redefine meme coins and deliver substantial returns to early adopters. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for its potential 7,400% knockout. Ethereum Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that transformed the crypto world. Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, it introduced smart contracts, opening the door to a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps, including finance platforms and games. Based on past trends, predictions suggest ETH could reach $6,580.53, with a low of $2,700.31 in 2025. Looking ahead to 2030, these forecasts point to more potential growth. With its strong foundation and plans for improvement, ETH appears attractive in the current market. As more people embrace blockchain technology, Ethereum’s role could become even more significant. You might also like: $140M whale forecasts XRP at $9, XYZVerse to see 65,000% surge in 2025 IOTA IOTA is a new kind of technology that lets people and businesses exchange data and value in a safe and direct way. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, IOTA is built on the Tangle, which is like a web of connections. This unique design allows for fast and secure transactions without fees. IOTA also offers tools for creating apps, smart contracts, tokens, NFTs, and digital identities. With the IOTA 2.0 upgrade, the platform could make it stand out even further in the crowded crypto market. Compared to other coins, IOTA’s focus on secure and feeless transactions makes it attractive. In today’s market, where innovation is key, IOTA’s technology shows promise. Its collaboration with Shimmer and support for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts could help it gain more users and developers. Ethena Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum. It aims to create a crypto-native form of money that doesn’t depend on traditional banks. Imagine a digital dollar that’s secure, stable, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Alongside this, Ethena introduces the ‘Internet Bond’, a dollar-denominated savings instrument that’s available globally. This bond offers a new way to save and earn, all within the crypto ecosystem. By avoiding reliance on banks, Ethena addresses concerns about centralization. Compared to other stablecoins that are backed by reserves in banks, Ethena offers a decentralized alternative. With growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethena’s timing could be just right. Its ‘Internet Bond’ could also provide a compelling option for savers looking for returns without traditional financial intermediaries. You might also like: Hidden gem: XYZVerse takes the crown as the most promising new crypto POPCAT POPCAT is a meme token inspired by the viral Popcat meme from October 2020. The meme features two images of a cat named Oatmeal — one with its mouth closed and another edited to form an ‘O’ shape. This coin has no inherent value or financial expectations; it’s all about fun and entertainment. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown that internet culture can impact the crypto space. While POPCAT doesn’t bring new technology to the table, its charm lies in its connection to a beloved meme. In a market where trends can shift quickly and where community engagement matters, POPCAT might catch the eye of meme enthusiasts and crypto fans alike. Whether it becomes the next big thing or just a fleeting trend, POPCAT is certainly adding some feline fun to the crypto world. Conclusion ETH, IOTA, ENA, and POPCAT are promising, but XYZ, uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem, aims for 7,400% growth as the G.O.A.T. of memecoins.

This outlook is unfavorable for high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Liquidations in the Crypto Market Within 24 hours, $331 million worth of long positions were liquidated, with 131,979 traders affected. Ethereum (ETH) also slipped below $3,500, reflecting broader market distress. Bearish Technical Patterns Bitcoin broke below its upward channel, breaching the critical support at $97,204. The move has shifted momentum to the downside, with traders eyeing the $92,500 level as a potential demand zone. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Support and Resistance Levels Immediate support lies at $92,500, followed by a stronger zone at $91,947. On the upside, resistance is seen at $96,080, with additional hurdles at $98,856. Market Sentiment The RSI at 34.76 indicates oversold conditions, raising the possibility of a short-term rebound. However, sustained recovery depends on Bitcoin reclaiming $97,204 and breaking above resistance. Long-Term Outlook Despite near-term headwinds, Bitcoin’s fundamentals, including a $1.87 trillion market cap and limited supply of 21 million coins, remain strong. Analysts suggest monitoring demand levels near $92,000 for potential recovery. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin broke below critical support at $97,204, triggering bearish momentum. Economic data suggests fewer Fed rate cuts, weighing on high-risk assets. A bounce near $92,000 could form a double-bottom pattern, signaling potential recovery.

Their collaboration highlights the rising potential of 1Fuel, a project gaining attention for its innovative approach to blockchain solutions. With projections to become the best presale for 50x gains, 1Fuel is quickly becoming one of the hottest opportunities in the market, positioning itself as a game-changer in the crypto space. Virtuals Protocol trading volume surges despite recent decline Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) recently hit a record high of $5.14 , surging 55% after breaking out of an ascending channel. However, the momentum didn’t last long as bears took control, dragging its price down to $3. After some recovery, Virtuals Protocol is trading at $3.85 on CoinMarketCap, marking a 7% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite the decline, Virtuals Protocol's trading volume is up by 7%. This increase suggests ongoing market activity, though the outlook remains bearish. Investors are growing cautious as Virtuals Protocol struggles to maintain its previous highs. Many are now turning their attention to alternatives, including top low-cost crypto investments like 1Fuel, for potential profits. Arbitrum’s $190 Million investment in blockchain gaming amidst market setbacks 2024 was a game-changing year for Arbitrum (ARB). As one of the first intent-enabled chains, Arbitrum enhanced its interoperability and gained serious attention in the blockchain world. In 2024, Arbitrum surpassed Solana in on-chain activity, proving popular among users and developers. Today, in 2025, Arbitrum has already been hot because its DAO revealed plans to invest $190 million in blockchain gaming. Between 2025 and 2028, the DAO will support 100 gaming projects beginning this quarter to market the blockchain gaming system. Despite these changes, Arbitrum is trading for $0.906 after dropping 4% within the past day and losing 28% of its trading volume now at $390 million. Still, analysts see potential, forecasting $1 by Q1 and $5 by late 2025. With innovation, gaming, and its reputation as one of the top low-cost crypto investments, Arbitrum is capturing the attention of gamers and investors alike. 1Fuel: A game-changer in crypto with seamless transactions and high-staking rewards 1Fuel is shaking up the cryptocurrency world with its innovative features that simplify the process for users. One standout is its one-click cross-chain technology, which allows seamless transactions between blockchain networks. This removes the hassle of paying high fees or transferring funds between wallets, making it more user-friendly for everyday crypto traders. Privacy and security are at the core of 1Fuel. It includes a built-in privacy mixer and cold storage options, ensuring that users maintain full control over their assets while protecting against potential data breaches. These are especially crucial features in a business where privacy issues are prevalent. 1Fuel also features attractive staking rewards of up to 30% APR, making it a good option for passive income investors. The project also offers digital debit cards that consumers can pay daily for virtual and real money transactions. Having raised over $1 million in its presale round, 1Fuel is gaining serious attention.

Relief efforts are gaining momentum as local and international donors step in to provide much-needed aid.

According to The Giving Block’s Annual Industry Report on the State of Crypto Philanthropy , over $2 billion in cryptocurrency donations have been made as of January 2024. Pousty expressed hope that the Los Angeles Wildfires Emergency Response Fundraiser will mobilize similar contributions, stating, “Every contribution fuels the work of trusted organizations on the ground, bringing critical aid to those who need it most.” “Together, we can turn the collective strength of the crypto community into life-changing support for the residents of Los Angeles,” he added. Los Angeles Crypto Community Asks For Help While relief efforts are still ramping up, members of Los Angeles’ crypto community are calling for urgent assistance. Los Angeles-based crypto influencer “ Wendy O ” told Cryptonews that, “It’s absolutely tragic to see the damage from the fire and winds in Southern California occur.” Wendy O added that the LA wildfires impact all Americans. “It is true that homeowners insurance in California has been canceled for many – I dealt with this 2 years ago. Please show compassion to those impacted and help when you can,” she said. The palisades fire is now almost 12,000 acres. My heart is broken for my state and all impacted.

As Gensler’s term draws to a close, his tough stance on crypto regulation highlights his belief in the need for stricter oversight. His actions have shaped the current U.S. regulatory environment in ways that have sparked significant debate in the crypto community A Tough Stance on Crypto Regulation Since becoming SEC chair in 2021, Gary Gensler strongly believes that the cryptocurrency market needs stricter regulation. Speaking to Bloomberg TV recently, he argued that the market is “rife with bad actors.” He emphasized the need for better investor protection. His leadership has been defined by aggressive actions against some of the biggest names in the crypto world, like Coinbase and Ripple Labs . Under Gensler’s watch, the SEC filed nearly 100 enforcement actions related to cryptocurrencies, pushing companies to comply with securities laws. This came after his predecessor, Jay Clayton, filed 80 similar actions. Enforcing existing laws and ensuring crypto firms comply with them is a top priority for Gensler. Gary Gensler Faces Backlash Over Investor Protection Stance For Gensler, one of the key goals of the SEC is ensuring that everyday investors are given proper protections. He has repeatedly stated that most digital assets should be classified as securities. Also, crypto companies need to disclose more information to the public. In his view, the crypto market’s lack of transparency and regulation exposes regular investors to unnecessary risks. However, not everyone agrees with Gensler’s hardline stance. Critics argue that his aggressive approach has been destructive , stifling innovation in the crypto space. Many point out that the current legal framework does not fit well with the fast-moving world of digital assets. This makes it hard for companies to comply without facing legal challenges. Despite the backlash, Gensler has defended the SEC’s actions, arguing that protecting investors and maintaining market integrity is necessary. He sees regulation as a way to weed out bad actors and ensure that the remaining companies operate fairly. A New Era at the SEC: What’s Next for Crypto Regulation? As Gensler prepares to exit, the SEC is on the brink of a new chapter . President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to take over as the agency’s new head. Unlike Gensler, Atkins is likely to take a more balanced approach. Many expect his leadership to promote innovation in the crypto industry while ensuring proper oversight. Gensler remains proud of his achievements in bringing greater regulatory clarity to the crypto market. However, he noted that much work still needs to be done, especially as the digital asset landscape evolves rapidly.

38706325,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=640082,1736376900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38706325.jpeg,Terraform’s Do Kwon to go on criminal trial in early 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/terraforms-do-kwon-to-go-on-criminal-trial-in-early-2026/,"Do Kwon, founder of Terraform Labs, is officially heading to trial in January 2026. The charges? Criminal fraud tied to the $40 billion collapse of TerraUSD and Luna, two cryptocurrencies that turned the crypto market upside down in 2022. The trial, set to take place in New York, will be overseen by Judge Paul Engelmayer and is expected to stretch for four to eight weeks. Kwon’s legal saga has been anything but ordinary. His not-guilty plea last week caps a two-year extradition battle that saw both the United States and South Korea vying to prosecute him. After months on the run, hiding from authorities, and eventually getting arrested in Montenegro on unrelated charges, Kwon is now set to face U.S. prosecutors who are ready to hold him accountable for what they’re calling one of the largest fraud cases in crypto history. $40 billion lost, over a million affected Prosecutors claim Kwon’s actions wrecked lives—over a million of them, to be exact. Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel Gitner says that the number of victims includes individuals and organizations worldwide who invested in Terraform’s so-called decentralized financial ecosystem. His filing to the District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday said that determining the full extent of the damage is “challenging” due to the massive scale of transactions involving Terraform’s tokens, TerraUSD and Luna. “The Government estimates that the number of victims in this case exceeds hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities, and potentially totals more than one million,” Gitner wrote. Instead of reaching out to every affected person, the government plans to launch a public website to keep victims updated on the case, citing the impracticality of individual notifications. The charges against Kwon center on allegations that he deceived investors by marketing Terraform as a revolutionary decentralized platform. The system, which promised a blockchain-powered currency, payment network, stock market, and savings bank, was, according to prosecutors, built on lies. The indictment claims that Kwon and his team falsely portrayed Terraform as autonomous and governed by its users while maintaining tight, behind-the-scenes control. When TerraUSD and Luna imploded in May 2022, they wiped out $40 billion in market value. U.S. prosecutors accuse Kwon of orchestrating the collapse through “manipulative and deceptive” tactics that misled investors and left them with massive losses. After the Terra ecosystem collapsed, he vanished. For months, he evaded authorities until his arrest in Montenegro in 2023. Both South Korea and America filed criminal charges against him, kicking off a lengthy extradition battle. In December, Kwon was finally handed over to U.S. officials.

Celestia’s recent Ginger upgrade has doubled its data throughput, while Render Network’s partnerships are redefining decentralized GPU rendering, fueling exciting advancements across blockchain. With Render price hovering at $7.68 and popular crypto coins like Celestia focusing on scalability, Web3Bay , a presale standout, offers a fresh take on e-commerce that deserves attention. Blending cryptocurrency and traditional payments, Web3Bay bridges Web2 simplicity with Web3 innovation. Its presale offers participants governance rights and exponential potential, with token prices structured to deliver returns exceeding 6,000%. As Web3Bay positions itself as the future of e-commerce, early adopters stand to benefit from a secure, decentralized marketplace designed for the modern era. Why Web3Bay Could Be 2025’s E-Commerce Revolution Did you know that Web3Bay has already raised over $470,000 in its presale, selling more than 127.6 million tokens? Currently priced at $0.0039675 in the latest stage, the presale is structured to reward early participants with exponential growth potential. With a carefully planned price progression across 28 stages, Web3Bay offers over 6,000% ROI potential for those joining early, putting it ahead of many popular crypto coins. What sets Web3Bay apart is its vision of merging the familiar convenience of Web2 payment systems, such as PayPal (planned for future integration), with the decentralized power of Web3. This dual approach is designed to make blockchain-based shopping accessible to a wider audience. Beyond payments, Web3Bay aims to empower its community by granting 3BAY token holders governance rights in a decentralized marketplace—something traditional platforms can’t offer. Early adopters are not just securing tokens but also becoming stakeholders in what could redefine e-commerce. The presale’s unique structure and the platform’s roadmap, including decentralized storage and NFT integration, make Web3Bay an exciting opportunity in 2025’s blockchain landscape. For those looking to diversify their crypto holdings and tap into the future of decentralized commerce, Web3Bay stands as a strong contender among popular crypto coins. The question is: will you act before the presale stages move on? Render Price Trends: What’s Powering RNDR’s Growth? Render price currently sits at $7.68, reflecting its growing role in decentralized GPU rendering. Recent partnerships with Stability AI, OTOY, and Endeavor highlight Render Network’s vision of enabling next-gen AI models through blockchain-based computational power. Its transition from Ethereum to Solana has also improved efficiency and reduced transaction costs, further strengthening its appeal. With over 40 million frames rendered and a user base exceeding 200,000, the platform’s growth signals its potential as a key player in decentralized content creation. Community-approved upgrades are driving Render Network forward. Proposals like RNP-016, which improves node operator reliability, and RNP-017, which streamlines governance, reflect its focus on scalability and usability. As Render’s price gains traction, these innovations ensure its continued relevance in GPU rendering, keeping RNDR among the most exciting developments in blockchain technology for 2025. Celestia Upgrade: Driving Scalability and Growth for TIA The latest Celestia upgrade, known as the Ginger upgrade, has doubled the platform’s data throughput by reducing block times from 12 to 6 seconds. This enhancement positions Celestia as a leader in modular blockchain scalability, allowing developers to build custom chains with ease. Currently, TIA, its native token, is trading at $5.16, with a 24-hour volume of $207 million. This growth reflects rising interest in the platform’s innovative architecture, which decouples consensus from execution layers for increased efficiency. Beyond the Celestia upgrade, the project’s roadmap includes plans to scale block sizes to 1GB, supported by $100 million in funding secured last year. Features like enhanced data availability sampling and cross-chain compatibility make it a standout choice for developers. As TIA gains traction, Celestia continues to solidify its role in the blockchain space, offering unparalleled flexibility and performance. Summing Up With Render price at $7.68 and Celestia’s Ginger upgrade doubling its data throughput, both platforms continue to push boundaries in their respective niches. TIA’s current price of $5.16 and Render Network’s Solana migration reflect strong growth potential and innovation in blockchain technology. Web3Bay stands out as a transformative project in decentralized e-commerce. With its presale already raising over $470,000 and 3BAY tokens priced at $0.0039675, early participants can secure governance rights and benefit from potential returns exceeding 6,000%. As blockchain solutions seek to redefine their industries, Web3Bay’s focus on bridging Web2 and Web3 shopping experiences positions it as a compelling opportunity for 2025.

This activity underlines Toncoin’s escalating relevance in the crypto space. In parallel, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem has broadened with the debut of its NFT-centric Lap Dogs racing game, which underscores its commitment to immersive blockchain gaming and metaverse advancements. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) has introduced a Refer & Earn USDT system, positioning it as a prime candidate for the best long-term crypto opportunity. This program offers the uncapped earning potential, complementing its successful presale that has amassed over $176.5 million. BlockDAG’s strategy suggests considerable upside, making it attractive to both novices and veteran traders. Toncoin Whale Activity Surges to $8.75 Billion Toncoin whale activity has marked a substantial rise, with transaction volumes ballooning by 80% to reach $8.75 billion recently. This spike suggests that significant investors are actively accumulating or redistributing Toncoin, likely as a strategic move. Moreover, a 300% increase in the net flow of major holders over the past week further accentuates this dynamic. Throughout 2024, The Open Network (TON) has gained traction, witnessing significant growth in wallet creations and user engagement despite broader market volatility. The Toncoin whale activity serves as a testament to its growing market presence, with investors keenly observing for potential long-term benefits or strategic shifts. SHIB Ecosystem Unveils NFT Lap Dogs Racing Game The Shiba Inu ecosystem has launched Lap Dogs, a racing game that integrates Sheboshis and Shiboshis NFTs, pivotal to its gameplay. These digital characters offer unique attributes and customization options, enhancing player interaction. As a facet of the Shib Metaverse, Lap Dogs is set to redefine player engagement with NFTs. Recent advancements in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, like activating the Shibarium Metaverse land map and integrating Chainlink’s CCIP for enhanced multi-chain functionality, fortify its standing in blockchain gaming and metaverse development. While NFT integration continues to evolve, the expansion through Lap Dogs emphasizes Shiba Inu’s dedication to offering a dynamic and engaging platform for its community. BlockDAG’s Refer & Earn: Prime for Long-Term Gains! BlockDAG has enhanced its presale approach by launching a new Refer & Earn USDT system, providing significant cashback incentives to its buyers. Initially, participants receive a 6% cashback on purchases made through referrals, which increases to 10% for any additional transactions made within the same 24-hour period. Additionally, a steady 6% cashback is applied universally on all other purchases. This innovative referral system delivers instant USDT rewards without any restrictions on earnings, positioning it as highly rewarding within the marketplace. With over $176.5 million already raised and 17.7 billion BDAG coins distributed at a cost-effective price of $0.0248 per coin, the success of this presale highlights BlockDAG’s rapid growth and the strong potential for future gains. Having already provided early adopters with returns of 2,380%, BlockDAG is on a path that could see it exceed $600 million in funding—a testament to its reliability and potential for expansion. Looking ahead, BlockDAG combines affordability with community-centric rewards and scalability. These attributes, along with the attractive benefits of the referral program, make BlockDAG one of the best long-term crypto coins , offering significant opportunities for growth and continuous benefits. Market Dynamics: High Stakes in Long-Term Crypto As the first quarter unfolds, the crypto market reveals varied developments, from the surge in Toncoin whale activity to the expansion of the Shiba Inu ecosystem through its Lap Dogs NFT game. These events underscore the increasing importance of both established and nascent blockchain projects. Yet, BlockDAG’s pioneering Refer & Earn USDT system emerges as a key attraction for traders seeking lucrative rewards and the best long-term crypto opportunities. With immediate cashback of up to 10%, a robust $176.5 million presale, and a remarkable 2,380% ROI for early participants, BlockDAG is poised to lead in the evolution of enduring crypto projects. As its presale continues, BlockDAG remains the prime crypto opportunity to enrich a trader’s portfolio.

According to a new report by local news outlet Oost, an unnamed law student and professional soccer player from the Dutch city of Hegelo has been arrested and accused of defrauding investors and mishandling their funds. The report says that the man would invest money on behalf of his clients, who were his family, friends, fellow soccer players and others. However, he made risky crypto bets with their funds that went awry and he eventually ended up losing between $1.5 million and $4.5 million euros. The man was falsely known as a “crypto genius” by his peers who believed he had raked in massive profits from trading digital assets. After his financial mishap – in which he lost all of his own money as well – the man and his brother sent emails to their clients informing them of the loss. He then went into hiding after being harassed by a few of his victims, according to the report. The victims went on to hand over the evidence to police and after a months-long investigation, he was arrested and charged with fraud and embezzlement. He is further accused of taking on new clients despite his company being on the brink of collapse.

Data from Alphanomics shows that despite the accumulation of other tokens, they are still underperforming as attention shifted to the hottest trends. AI agent tokens are the best performers for the past 30 days of trading, marking the peak of a trend that only started at the end of 2024. The collection of AI agent tokens grew by 71.7% on average, driven by the top projects that gained the biggest share of attention. The sector lost around 5% of its valuation in the past 24 hours, though it retained its leading position. AI memes rallied by 44.4% in the past 30 days, retaining momentum from social media cults and their proximity to some of the AI agents. The pure AI narrative of utility and DePIN tokens expanded by 16.1% for the same time period. The third most active category of tokens was the Pump.fun ecosystem, gaining a total of 38% in the past month. Pump.fun tokens gained prominence for their organic origins, with some of the memes being selected for their wide adoption and lack of cabal ownership. Pump.fun is being used to launch AI agents, independent of other platforms like ELIZA or Virtuals Protocol, with most of the tokens having sufficient liquidity from their creators to move to Raydium. Those relatively new narratives diminished the hopes for a wide altcoin rally. The new narratives displaced a brief expansion for ‘ dinosaur coins ’ at the end of 2024. After that, the trend shifted to projects that could gain immediate social media appeal, while offering a functioning product. All of the three categories had outlier tokens, which drove the general trend. Most of the tokens in those categories remain risky and can quickly incur deep losses. Even experienced whales have posted losses while trying to snipe the most promising AI agents. There is also a crossover between ecosystems, where GRIFT and AVA give a boost to both Pump.fun and AI memes. AVA is also the hottest rising AI agent token, during a period of heightened competition. The AI space showed it can outperform in the short term, though the gains have been tested after Bitcoin (BTC) dipped under $94,000. With Ethereum (ETH) in the $3,200 range and Solana (SOL) under $200, the markets may break the 30-day trend. AI agents turn to the green AI agents retained a total valuation above $15B, with more than $2.4B in daily trading. The tokens of most agents are often shifting to the red, due to their low liquidity and profit-taking from early whales. However, AI tokens also proved resilient, often switching back to gains within hours. For Ethereum, the growth drive came from Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). The chain carried a wider selection of utility and task-specific AI agents. Solana, on the other hand, is more skewed toward personality agents, with AVA taking the lead. Solana AI agents shifted to the green, while competing for the biggest mindshare. | Source: Bubblescanner Solana AI agents aim for memetic appeal while building communities around their content and personalities. Agents like AI16Z and Eliza also have DeFi and utility features, while still focusing on their content and presentation. Base has already grown its own mix of utility and memetic agents. So far, only the top chains have built AI ecosystems, while BSC still has less than 20 agents. L2 chains like Arbitrum and Optimism are just starting out with the agentic trend. AI agents, however, are not simply displacing other projects and tokens. Just like the Web3, gaming, NFT, and other trends before that, older tokens provided the liquidity and infrastructure. The success of AI tokens hinges on the availability of DEX, lending, market makers, and an entire ecosystem capable of reacting quickly to new communities and trends. The AI agent space is yet to expand the real capabilities of agents, which currently focus on content and user engagement. For trading and on-chain activities, most of the tasks are still in the testing stage.

Speaking Wednesday in a Bloomberg Television interview , Gensler highlighted the ongoing lack of adequate disclosures and information digital asset firms provide to everyday investors. Gensler reflects on SEC tenure and shifts in crypto enforcement leadership Reflecting on his tenure, Gensler expressed pride in the SEC’s enforcement efforts in the crypto space, highlighting their steady consistency over the years. The former Goldman Sachs executive has been known for his aggressive enforcement actions against cryptocurrency entities. These efforts have targeted a wide spectrum, from fraudulent operators to major firms like Coinbase Global Inc. and proprietary trading firm DRW Holdings. Gensler announced in November his decision to step down as SEC chair on January 20, coinciding with President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to head the agency. Atkins anticipates adopting a more lenient approach toward the digital asset industry and reducing enforcement measures. In the interview, Gensler noted that his predecessor, Jay Clayton, initiated approximately 80 crypto-related enforcement cases during his leadership under the first Trump administration. Under Gensler, that number grew to about 100 cases. However, while Clayton’s focus centered on token issuers whose offerings were deemed securities, Gensler has prioritized enforcement against market intermediaries that bypass securities laws concerning registration and disclosure requirements. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC has experienced both victories and setbacks in court. Gensler has expressed skepticism toward the crypto industry Biden-appointed Gensler has vocally expressed skepticism toward crypto regulation. He came out forcefully against the FIT21 bill after it was passed in the House. The relationship between the crypto industry and Gensler has been contentious. The industry mostly views Gensler with skepticism and frustration. Many believe his strict enforcement approach and classifying most crypto assets as securities have stifled innovation and created legal uncertainty​. According to Gensler, crypto accounts for less than 1% of U.S. financial markets, yet it’s riddled with “scams.” I’ve never seen a field that is so wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals. Of these 10,000 to 15,000 projects, many of them will not survive. They’re like venture capital investments. They’re not going to survive. ~Gary Gensler Gensler expressed pride in their accomplishments but insisted there’s still work to be done.

Bullish Secures BaFin Licenses to Drive Expansion in Europe The approvals, granted on December 20, authorize Bullish DE to engage in crypto asset custody, proprietary trading, and principal brokerage. These licenses enable Bullish DE to expand its presence in Germany, capitalizing on the country’s increasing adoption of digital assets. We are proud to announce that #Bullish has secured licenses in Germany from BaFin, marking a significant step in strengthening our position within the EU. — Bullish (@Bullish) January 8, 2025 The new licenses were strategically obtained to align with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which took effect in December 2024. MiCA provides a unified regulatory framework for crypto businesses throughout the European Union, simplifying compliance processes across member states. Tom Farley, CEO of Bullish Group, said in a press statement , “Receiving BaFin’s approval underscores Bullish’s commitment to operating under the highest regulatory standards.” Bullish DE plans to focus on services designed for institutional and professional investors, leveraging its new licenses to enhance its offerings within the European market. In related developments, other companies have also secured BaFin approvals for their operations in Germany. On October 9, Frankfurt-based Tradias, the digital asset arm of Bankhaus Scheich, received a securities trading bank license .

Germany’s New Digital Finance Law Boosts Regulatory Framework for Crypto The BaFin approval for Bullish follows another key regulatory development: on December 18, the German Parliament (Bundestag) passed the Act on the Digitalization of Financial Markets (FinmadiG). This legislation aligns Germany with the European Commission’s Digital Finance Strategy and addresses critical areas such as crypto-assets, digital resilience, and money transfers. Germany's Bundestag passed the Act on the Digitalization of Financial Markets (FinmadiG) to align with upcoming EU crypto regulations, including MiCA. #MiCA #Germany #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/WWhadHLJPe — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 Rather than directly regulating crypto assets, the law strengthens oversight of companies in the digital finance space, focusing on exchanges and service providers. It seeks to prevent fraud and market manipulation, promoting transparency and accountability for a safer crypto environment. The FinmadiG law addresses three major EU regulations. The Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) , both effective December 30, 2024, establish a framework for crypto services across the EU and tighten regulations on fund transfer information to enhance transparency. The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) , which takes effect on January 17, 2025, strengthens cybersecurity requirements for financial institutions, including crypto providers.

The update, which will be rolled out in two phases, is scheduled for release during the first quarter of 2025. Kraken discussed Pectra’s impact on ETH holders, pointing out that it will enhance Ethereum’s scalability, UX (user experience), and security. With the Pectra split update, Ethereum will cater to a wide range of use cases and user needs, enabling Layer 2 solutions (L2s) to be more affordable and validators more flexible to manage. The preceding March 2024 Dencun update release introduced proto-danksharding to increase transaction speeds on the network. Derive’s Dawson projected that Ether could gain over 257% to hit $12K by the end of 2025 if Ethereum successfully implements the Pectra update. He added that a regulatory-friendly environment under Trump’s incoming administration could further support Ethereum’s growth. Dawson also believes that the growth of layer 2 solutions and enhanced interoperability could drive huge gains, especially for ETH holders. He, however, cautioned that Ether’s price could fall below $2K in a bearish case where spot ETH ETFs failed to attract institutional interest. Pectra is likely to make new Ether millionaires this year ⚙️ Phase 1 of Pectra is about to arrive! This update will include 19 fundamental EIPs and introduce key innovations like sponsored transactions, allowing others to cover fees for you. Additionally, it will enhance @ethereum 's scalability, efficiency, and usability 🙌 Check out… — Stakely (@Stakely_io) January 8, 2025 The Pectra update will bring huge changes, such as enhancing account abstraction, validator operations, and network performance. Pectra aims to improve experiences for Ethereum users and developers and set the stage for future scalability upgrades. The update is set to introduce 20 EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) that will address specific features and functionalities to streamline implementation. Pectra will be rolled out in two phases. The first phase (PectrA), comprising eight EIPs, is expected to be released during Q1 of 2025, while phase two (PectrB) will be available in 2026. Many elements in Pectra generate drawbacks at the code level, which could impact the network’s reliability, user trust, and ETH prices. The main feature of PectrA will allow users to find sponsors to cover their transaction costs, facilitating access to the network for those with low balances. EIP-7702 will eliminate the need to hold small ETH amounts to execute blockchain transactions. EIP-7251, on the other hand, will allow ETH stakers with 32 ETH or above to earn staking rewards. “This will make staking cheaper, leading more people to stake and thus decreasing staking rewards over time. For that reason, we’re extremely bullish about restaking. A lot of people will want to boost their staking rewards by also securing other networks.” -Gaia Regis, co-founder and CEO of Byzantine Key updates, such as increased validator stake limits and flexible staking withdrawals, will enhance network security and efficiency. Streamlined smart contract deployment will also be a crucial aspect of the Pectra update. Trump’s pro-crypto policies will be especially beneficial for ETH holders Saul Rejwan, managing partner at Masterkey, said that Ethereum and other major crypto sectors like DeFi and DePIN stood to benefit more from Trump’s presidency and a crypto-friendly U.S. SEC. He added that DeFi projects on Ethereum will thrive under Trump’s more favorable regulatory framework. Sectors like restaking needed a little regulatory push to attract institutional investors. Rejwan said he expected the new administration to lower barriers to entry and make it easier for early-stage crypto investors and resilient firms to innovate and thrive. Matt Houghan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, also expects Ethereum to boom in 2025 since the asset had three core things going for it. He pointed out that Ethereum sat at the center of the three biggest trends shaping crypto in 2025, including the rise of tokenization, stablecoins, and AI agents. Houghan asserted that Ethereum had dominant market share in the three areas. He said that ETH could break above its ATH of $4,878 to reach a new high of $7,000. According to Houghan, Washington’s new approach to crypto would unleash millions of entrepreneurs into crypto, and many of them would build apps on Ethereum and its L2s.

Per Busan Ilbo and Asia Kyungjae, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) said it would release more details after holding “discussions” with the Virtual Asset Committee.

(Source: MBCNEWS/YouTube/Screenshot) The FSC later responded by denying these reports , claiming that “nothing” had yet “been decided.” However, it now appears that the media reports were not as “groundless” as the FSC claimed. The regulator also said it wants to “protect” crypto “users,” and will help “improve” self-regulation in the sector. The FSC says it wants to “establish listing and delisting standards” for altcoins on domestic crypto exchanges. The body was speaking as crypto traders expressed growing fears of massive culls of meme coins and “kimchi coins” on domestic crypto exchange platforms. The FSC also said it wants to introduce new regulations to police the stablecoin sector. “There is a need to discuss how to create listing standards, what to do with stablecoins, and how to create rules of conduct for cryptoasset exchanges.

However, the media outlets noted that the FSC was largely “negative” on the matter of issuing Bitcoin spot ETF approvals. The Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo recently expressed a willingness to explore crypto ETF approval . In his New Year address, the Korea Financial Investment Association Chairman Seo Yu-seok spoke of turning the “digital asset market, including crypto ETFs,” into a “future growth engine.” “I will push for the legalization of token securities and cryptoasset ETFs to ensure that the digital asset market can become a driving force for the future growth of our capital market.” Korea Financial Investment Association Chairman Seo Yu-seok But FSC Director Kwon Dae-young said crypto ETF approval would be “a step too far.” He said that the government was “fully aware that changes are taking place globally.” North Korea released footage of the largest Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile launch into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan https://t.co/MLnxvj60OV pic.twitter.com/YD2J529cnO — Reuters (@Reuters) March 17, 2023 More Discussions Planned Seoul is currently “discussing the matter” with the Virtual Asset Committee, Kwon said.

This addition enables users to trade RLUSD on the platform together with other primary pairs, including USD, EUR, BTC, ETH, XRP, and USDT. The exchange added support for RLUSD on the Ethereum network, giving users a stable digital currency fully backed by the asset. RLUSD is intended to cater to both retail and institutional investors and offer a safe and efficient method of undertaking transactions in digital assets. RLUSD is denominated in US dollars and cash equivalents and is stable in liquidity. Additionally, Its compliance with certain legal procedures like the New York Trust Charter issuance is ideal for many financial users. RLUSD’s enterprise-grade features Ripple designed RLUSD for enterprise-grade applications. The stablecoin is intended for payments, tokenization, and DeFi, giving companies a reliable, blockchain-based means of conducting their operations. Leveraging Ripple’s experience in blockchain, RLUSD can be considered a reliable option for companies that want to use digital assets in traditional financial markets. Since the stablecoin is already integrated with the Ethereum network, it can be used in DeFi projects such as liquidity pools and decentralized exchanges. RLUSD availability has also been growing rapidly with Ripple’s efforts. As Cryptopolitan reported , Monica Long, the president of Ripple, stated that the company would soon announce more exchange listings. At the time of writing, RLUSD can be traded on the Archax, B2C2, Bitso, and Uphold exchanges, with future listings planned for Flowdesk and Zero Hash. Also, Ripple has partnered with Chainlink to make RLUSD available to the DeFi community. The collaboration was revealed on 7th January and will see Chainlink’s decentralized RLUSD price feeds integrated into the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. This partnership will help strengthen RLUSD within the DeFi ecosystem through the use of accurate and timely market data. This will be to increase reliability and address the issues of price manipulation and outages. RLUSD impressive growth The market adoption of RLUSD has picked up significantly, with more than 76% of the trading volume being recorded on a Bullish exchange, especially in the RLUSD/USDC and XRP/RLUSD pairs. At the same time, decentralized exchange Sologenic has a smaller share. The XRP/RLUSD pair on the platform has a 24-hour trading volume of $3.4 million, which is equal to 3.56%.

According to the analyst, a successful breakout of this bullish flag could result in a massive 50% price gain for XRP, bringing the cryptocurrency closer to its previous all-time high of $3.84, recorded during the 2021 bull run. XRP Price Targets $3.6 After Bullish Flag Breakout Over the past few weeks, the XRP price has formed a bullish flag pattern, indicating a potential for continued upward movement. According to crypto analyst Captain Faibik’s shared chart on X (formerly Twitter), XRP is preparing to break out of this bullish flag on the daily time frame chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk Of Supply Shock As ETF Issues Buy More BTC Than Was Produced In December A bullish flag is widely recognized as a continuation pattern. It forms when a cryptocurrency’s price is trading sideways or undergoing a correction and indicates the potential for a strong upward movement. On the analyst’s chart, XRP is testing the upper boundary of the bullish flag pattern, aiming to break above it and trigger its next price rally. Captain Faibik has predicted that if XRP successfully breaks out of this bullish flag and maintains a price above it, it could spark an impressive 50.22% rally. Currently trading at $2.2, If XRP can rally as much as 50% following its bullish flag breakout, its market price could jump significantly to $3.3. This projected target is just 16.36% away from breaching XRP’s $3.84 ATH, achieved during the previous bull run in 2021. Further solidifying his confidence in XRP’s future price trajectory, Captain Faibik’s recent prediction doubles down on former projections in earlier X posts, where the analyst forecasts a massive price increase to $3.66 for XRP. Elliott Waves To Push XRP Above $20 In another X post, a prominent crypto analyst identified as the “CryptoBull” predicted that the XRP price could soar above $20 later in this bull cycle. However, the analyst also projects that the cryptocurrency could reach a short-term target of $13 within the next few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000, What It Means For The Bull Market CryptoBull has based his optimistic XRP price projections on Elliott impulse waves, highlighting their impact on the cryptocurrency’s historical price movements. The analyst disclosed that Elliott impulse waves typically begin after a cryptocurrency experiences a significant price breakout. He further explained that in 2017, the five waves of the Elliott impulse wave cycle had triggered a price surge from $0.002 to $3.84, representing a staggering 70,000% increase. Based on this historical trend, CryptoBull projects that XRP could witness a similar bull rally. He forecasts that the five Elliott impulse waves could spark a 6,000% increase in the XRP price during this bull cycle, pushing it to new ATHs of $26.

This bill seeks to allow citizens to escape the existing financial systems as prices continue to soar. The bill, filed for the 60th legislative session on February 3, aims to let Oklahomans get paid in Bitcoin and accept it as a form of payment. He noted that Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency with a limited supply, which can enable Oklahomans to save their earnings and investments. “As Bitcoin continues to rise and the value of the dollar continues to be printed away in Washington, D.C., Oklahoma must act to protect our people.” Senator Deever Voluntary participation for businesses and workers SB325 emphasizes that using Bitcoin payment options will be completely optional for both employers and employees. The proposal allows business entities and employees to choose the payment they prefer. According to Senator Deevers, Bitcoin is establishing itself as an important part of the traditional financial system. He mentioned that former President Donald Trump endorsed Bitcoin during his campaign and at different conferences. “Bitcoin has arrived into the mainstream of our economy, and it’s an essential part of the financial future,” he said. Oklahoma, through SB325, is trying to position itself as one of the early adaptors of financial technology, benefiting its citizens. The legislation will be considered during the state’s legislative session starting on February 3. He noted, “ This legislation puts Oklahoma in a leadership role nationally, ensuring our state embraces the future of financial technology .” Cryptocurrency adoption across the U.S. Oklahoma’s proposed Bitcoin initiative is in line with other US cities and states that have integrated cryptocurrencies into public service delivery. In November 2024, Detroit said it would become the largest city in the United States to accept cryptocurrency payments for taxes starting in 2025. PayPal will oversee the conversion of the cryptocurrencies to US dollars before the money is deposited into city accounts. In September 2024, Louisiana was the first state to accept cryptocurrency for government services. The supported cryptocurrencies were Bitcoin, Bitcoin Lightning, and USD Coin. The State of Louisiana’s Department of Wildlife and Fisheries received the first cryptocurrency payment on September 17, 2024. In addition, in a post on X, Dennis Porter, co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, disclosed that the 14th state is gearing up to bring legislation for the creation of a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.’ This is after similar attempts in 13 states. This growth shows an increasing interest of U.S. states in adopting Bitcoin as a part of the future economy.

Now in consolidation, the market might face a potential breakout if ongoing acquisition from BTC whales translates into a short-term price rally. Bitcoin Whales Taking Advantage of Correction According to CryptoQuant data , large buying activity has resumed onchain after what it termed the biggest selloff of 2024. As reported earlier by Coingape, the BTC price fell suddenly after the US jobs and ISM Services Prices PMI came in strong. Despite this macro data, which indicated no rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, traders stayed cautious. Today, the Bitcoin price traded from a high of $97,258.32 to as low as $92,525.84. Noting the price outlook, CryptoQuant Analyst Cauê Oliveira said market whales waited patiently to accumulate just below the $95,000 level. After the biggest dump of 2024, whales are accumulating Bitcoin again “However, large players took advantage of the consolidation to open TWAP positions, patiently accumulating just below US$ 95K.” – By @caueconomy Full post https://t.co/yGOkuW0zo7 pic.twitter.com/9lqlHoWa4O — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 8, 2025 In his detailed analysis, Oliveira said that institutional investors dumped around 79,000 BTC over a week. This action triggered a 15% correction that the market is still not free from. He pointed out that large whales took advantage of the situation to open “TWAP Position” over the past 30 days. Institutional Investors Shielding the Market Per the CryptoQuant analyst, Bitcoin whales have bought more than 30,000 BTC units over the past month. He confirmed that institutional investors are the primary source behind the buying pressure for the recovery of BTC. The analyst pointed out that the retail demand for BTC has remained at its highest level in five years. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales or institutional interest remains high overall. Most institutional buyers include firms like MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms. In a recent report, MicroStrategy bought $22 billion BTC in 2024. Following its purchases, the firm recorded a BTC yield of 74.3%. If related acquisitions continue, there are projections that it can help BTC print new highs in the mid-term. The Shift to a Third Force While institutional investors formed the Bitcoin whales caucus that pushed the coin’s price to an all-time high of $108,000 , nation states are predicted to join soon. After President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, conversations about a strategic Bitcoin reserve are growing. During his campaign, Trump pledged to set up such a reserve once he entered office, and the industry now expects him to fulfill his promises. If the US makes this move, market experts predict that other nations will follow. In the long run, the impact on Bitcoin price might be profound.

Kobeissi Letter speculated that spot ETFs, unlike futures-based ETFs, provide investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin . It also pointed out that since spot ETFs started trading, Bitcoin funds have attracted $44 billion in cumulative inflows. According to Glassnode, more Bitcoin futures contracts are cash-margined than crypto-margined, indicating they are pegged on the US dollar, not cryptocurrencies.

He suggested that active and direct market participants are driving the surge rather than speculation. Lunde pointed out that inflows from futures-based ETFs such as ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) were also minimal and could not have led to the surge. The analyst provided a breakdown of open interest by cohort on the CME, pointing out that active and direct participants held over 85,000 BTC. Lunde highlighted that this amount was equal to what was held in March 2024. However, he pointed out that the 1x leveraged ETF declined throughout 2024 and held 31,752 BTC. Lunde also added that the 2x leveraged ETF has only recorded slight growth since March, indicating that leverage is no longer a growth catalyst in the current market. Bitcoin outperforms all other assets in 2024 According to Coinmarketcap, Bitcoin recorded an over 120% surge in 2024 amid developments in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Kobeissi Letter commented that BTC outperformed all other asset classes in 2024. Bloomberg also reported that BTC outperformed assets such as Cocoa, global equities, and gold in the past year. Coinmarketcap reported that in mid-December, BTC recorded an all-time high of $108,315 following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory. The surge was reportedly fueled by investor optimism since the presidential candidate had signaled that he would implement crypto-friendly policies once he assumed office. However, the price of digital assets eased after the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, announced that rate cuts would roll out slower than anticipated. The digital asset has since maintained its set wall between $99,700 and $100,000. However, as of the time of writing, BTC traded at $94,099, a 2% decline in 24 hours. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin clearing the $99,000 mark could cause large-scale liquidations, leading to a surge in spot price. Despite the market optimism, market players such as Peter Hughes, founder of Evolve Investing, warned investors against the volatility risks presented by Bitcoin. QCP Capital, in its note to its clients, also expressed its belief that the catalyst may come after institutions readjust asset allocation.

The clarification, released on January 8, 2025, addresses inaccuracies in Backpack’s January 7 press release, which suggested its involvement in asset recovery for former FTX EU customers. FTX Highlights Inaccuracy in Backpack’s FTX EU Acquisition Statements In a recent press release , FTX addressed statements made by Backpack entities regarding its purported acquisition of FTX EU. FTX stated that the January 7, 2025, Backpack announcement was made without FTX’s knowledge or involvement. According to the exchange, Backpack’s press release contain multiple inaccuracies that could mislead stakeholders. FTX emphasized that 100% of FTX EU share capital is still owned by FTX Europe AG, a subsidiary of FTX. While there was an earlier agreement to sell FTX EU to former insiders of FTX Europe as part of a settlement, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court overseeing the Chapter 11 process has not approved any transfer. The defunct exchange also confirmed that it was unaware of any indirect sale of FTX EU shares to Backpack before this week. Bankruptcy Court and Asset Recovery Process In addition, the defunct exchange clarified that Backpack has no role in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court-approved process for returning funds to creditors, including FTX EU’s former customers. The company reiterated that only FTX EU holds responsibility for determining and returning funds owed to its customers. The court’s Chapter 11 plan does not authorize the organization to make distributions to any creditors or former customers. The defunct exchange further stated that the amounts owed by FTX EU to its customers would be assessed solely by FTX EU following its sale, not by the exchange or the Bankruptcy Court. Therefore, the exchange disclaimed Backpack’s liability for repayments of EU customer funds. Furthermore, the defunct exchange expressed concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the information presented in Backpack’s materials. The report urged stakeholders to rely only on official FTX communications. Initial Distributions Under Bankruptcy Plan The defunct exchange also provided an update on its U.S. Bankruptcy Court-approved Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. The defunct exchange plan became effective on January 3, 2025, with the initial distribution record date set for the same day. Distributions to convenience class claimants are expected within 60 days, subject to regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, the exchange reaffirmed its commitment to adhering to the court’s processes and ensuring accurate communication with creditors. These developments come in light of recent media speculation that US President Joe Biden might pardon Sam Bankman-Fried , the founder of the defunct FTX Exchange. Biden’s recent pardon of his son has sparked further rumors that SBF could get the same treatment.

With this move, the platform can now offer more derivatives trading services in Latin America. With this license, Bitfinex plans to take advantage of El Salvador’s support for crypto to set up shop in the area. A Regulatory Game Changer? Bitfinex Derivatives is able to function inside El Salvador’s regulated framework, which was established by the Digital Assets Issuance Law, thanks to the DASP license. This law, which was put into effect in early 2023, was intended to draw in digital asset companies while maintaining legal clarity and transparency. For Bitfinex, this framework is a game-changer. Paolo Ardoino, Bitfinex’s CTO, described the license as a key milestone that enables the company to roll out innovative derivatives products to a broader audience. Bitfinex Derivatives has been awarded a Digital Asset Service Provider licence in El Salvador – a monumental step in our global expansion. The new licence supports El Salvador as a key digital asset financial centre.Discover more: https://t.co/vPGO01clhp pic.twitter.com/79hdbBHONX — Bitfinex (@bitfinex) January 7, 2025 El Salvador’s aggressive approach to cryptocurrencies has established the country as a hub for blockchain startups. Since accepting Bitcoin as legal cash in 2021, the country has established itself as a global leader in digital asset use. The addition of Bitfinex to the list of enterprises operating under the Digital Assets Issuance Law strengthens El Salvador’s status as a crypto-friendly destination. Latin America’s Cryptocurrency Boom The timing of Bitfinex is ideal. Latin America has experienced an increase in bitcoin utilization, driven by economic issues such as currency devaluation and financial volatility. A significant number of individuals in the region, especially the unbanked, are adopting digital assets to attain financial inclusion and stability. Bitfinex intends to capitalize on this growing demand by providing products such as perpetual contracts and other derivatives tailored to a variety of user demands. This strategic expansion is consistent with Bitfinex’s objective to provide cutting-edge digital asset solutions globally. By establishing a stronghold in El Salvador, the platform is well-positioned to serve the rapidly growing Latin American cryptocurrency market. What Does It Mean For The Industry? The action of Bitfinex highlights the need of well defined rules in encouraging creativity. Apart from providing operational certainty for the crypto market, the DASP license establishes a standard for other nations contemplating such systems. As El Salvador inspires the usage of bitcoin, its legislative environment might influence international norms for digital asset businesses. For Bitfinex, this is more than just a regional expansion; it is a declaration of intent to lead in the ever-changing cryptocurrency sector. With El Salvador as a launchpad, the company is ready to create new opportunities and establish benchmarks for the future of derivatives trading in the cryptocurrency market.

Analysts predict a possible increase in BDAG’s price to $1 this year, a potential 4,200% return for those joining before the current batch closes. These factors position BlockDAG at the forefront of our list of top crypto gainers , merging cutting-edge technology with immediate incentives. 2. Ethereum (ETH): The Pillar of DeFi Ethereum has transformed blockchain with its pioneering smart contracts, which are foundational to decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT markets. As the second most significant cryptocurrency, Ethereum is favored by developers and traders for its stability and potential for growth. However, challenges like scalability issues and high transaction fees have led some users to look for alternatives. Ethereum 2.0 aims to resolve these issues, though it has experienced delays. Still, Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem and its dominance in DeFi ensure it remains a critical asset in the cryptocurrency space. With a current price of $3,441, Ethereum is undeniably one of the top crypto gainers for 2025. 3. Ripple (XRP): Facilitator of Global Transactions Ripple has transformed cross-border payments by offering fast and economical transaction solutions. XRP’s effectiveness has drawn global financial institutions, placing it as a frontrunner in fintech. A recent legal triumph over the SEC has increased confidence, likely leading to expanded adoption. Although Ripple’s centralized model might draw some criticism, XRP’s practicality in improving international payments positions it as a preferred option among institutional traders. With a current price of $2.44 and innovative technology, XRP remains one of the top crypto gainers , especially for those interested in fintech advancements. 4. Chainlink (LINK): Decentralized Oracle Solutions Chainlink is essential for projects that require reliable oracles to link smart contracts with real-world data. Its decentralized network is crucial for DeFi applications, ensuring data accuracy and trust within blockchain operations. While its growth may be moderated by its dependency on smart contract adoption, Chainlink’s role in supporting blockchain infrastructure is vital. Continued innovations, such as hybrid smart contracts, enhance its utility and market position. Chainlink is projected to reach new all-time highs this year, solidifying its status among the top crypto gainers and as a vital component in the expansion of blockchain ecosystems. Choosing the Right Crypto for ROI Gains in 2025 Each of these cryptocurrencies offers distinct advantages. Ethereum appeals to those seeking a robust and tested ecosystem, while Ripple suits fintech enthusiasts with its efficiency in cross-border transactions. Chainlink caters to developers focused on infrastructure. BlockDAG, notable for its scalability, community incentives, and potential for a 4,200% return this year, is the most adaptable choice among the top crypto gainers . Combining immediate rewards with long-term growth potential, it stands out as the optimal choice for maximizing ROI. Investors should align their selections with their goals to fully capitalize on the opportunities best suited to their strategies.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 110,100 followers on the social media platform X that XRP may be gearing up for a new leg up based on its SuperTrend indicator. The SuperTrend indicator is a technical analysis tool that aims to identify potential entry and exit points based on an asset’s trend. Says Martinez, “The last time the SuperTrend indicator flipped bullish on the 12-hour chart, XRP went up 470%… It just flipped bullish again.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.28.

Next up is the top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), which the trader says is being gobbled up by deep-pocketed investors. “Whales bought 140 million Dogecoin DOGE in [24 hours]!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez also notes that traders are currently bearish on Dogecoin, suggesting that the meme token may be primed to go against the crowd. “Dogecoin DOGE weighted social sentiment is at -0.60, which means the crowd remains very pessimistic about its upside potential.

Binance Founder Downplays Bitcoin $100K Milestone With A Bold Remark,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/boring-binance-founder-downplays-bitcoin-100k-milestone-with-a-bold-remark/,"A former executive of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange expects that Bitcoin could soar higher than the $100,000 level. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao believes that the firstborn cryptocurrency is capable of hitting a higher price point, following its brief recovery to $100,000 on Tuesday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges Below $100K Despite Positive Coinbase Premium Signal – What’s Next? A “Boring” Level? Bitcoin embraced the new year on a positive note as the crypto recorded a recovery that catapulted it to reach the $100,000 mark. Zhao, who is also the founder of Binance, suggested that the top crypto asset can do better and surpass the $100k price point. “100k is boring, right?” Zhao said in a post, responding to Bitcoin recovery. Investors have seen Bitcoin reclaim its lost glory after hitting $100,000 after the digital asset slid down the key level on December 19, staying below $100,000 for quite some time before gaining momentum to propel it to this milestone level. 100k is boring, right? — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 7, 2025 Bitcoin Destined To Reach New Heights Zhao, popularly known as CZ, asserted that Bitcoin is far more capable of reaching a price point beyond $100k. Hence, the former crypto firm executive was not surprised with BTC making a comeback and surging in the last 24 hours. The ex-Binance CEO’s post on X sparked excitement among members of the cryptocurrency community as Zhao’s post suggests that BTC prices could go up. Last month, Bitwise executive Matt Hougan predicted that the bullish run for cryptocurrency would still gain momentum until 2025. Hougan expects that other top crypto assets would soar in price such with Bitcoin leading the charge. Hougan believes that BTC could reach as high as $200,000 before the end of 2025, claiming that inflows from the Bitcoin ETFs could fuel the demand from corporate entities. This, as a result, would increase their exposure to the premier crypto asset.

Although the former Binance CEO believes in Bitcoin moving past $100,000, Zhao did not provide a price prediction for the year. However, there were occasions that Zhao hinted that Bitcoin could be traded at $850,000 per coin.

The add-on incorporates third-party functionality within the web browser interface. While alerting the users, the exchange said that they hadn’t released any Firefox browser extensions and called on users who might have mistakenly downloaded the add-on to move any funds or digital assets in wallets connected to the malicious extension. OKX further contacted Firefox to remove the applications before they harm users. OKX also further advised users to avoid downloading OKX-specific software from third parties. Fraudulent browser plugins have been used to access sensitive data and often steal funds. Crypto criminals use the technique, also known as a phishing scam, to steal cryptocurrency. Certik reports that phishing was among the leading crypto scams in 2024. Cybercriminals are executing vicious phishing scams CertiK published Hack3d: The Web3 Security Report 2024, highlighting the most notorious cyber security threats to cryptocurrency in 2024. The report states that crypto investors lost over $1 billion in 296 phishing scams in 2024, accounting for a 21% YoY rise from 2023. In September 2024, McAfee discovered malware known as SpyAgent on Android phones. The malware appeared like a legitimate Android application but was a scam that had affected over 280 fraudulent applications. Using optical character recognition (OCR), SpyAgent scans images stored on Android’s memory and steals sensitive information, including cryptocurrency passcodes stored in the images. The researchers at McAfee also noted that the malware replicated through text message links easily lured users to download the fraudulent app. This approach made it easiest for scammers to bypass the security features on Google’s app store. Decentraland September X breach saw users scammed by phishing links On September 19, 2024, Decentraland lost control of its X social media page. Hackers compromised the 3D virtual reality metaverse on the Ethereum network. Cybercriminals use the platform to promote phishing links to followers. They advertised a fake MANA airdrop, which lured users to click the links. Anyone who clicked the link and connected their wallets saw their funds drained by the malware. There has been no reports of exact figures stating how many people lost their funds to the fake OKX malware as of this writing.

With recent movements across major cryptocurrencies, the focus is gradually shifting towards emerging platforms offering innovative solutions. Polkadot’s steady performance, coupled with SUI’s notable collaborations, has kept investors intrigued. But if one name creates ripples in the space, it’s Qubetics ($TICS). The platform’s presale phase is turning heads for the impressive numbers and the technology backing it. This article will cover the developments and updates of Qubetics, Polkadot, and SUI—three cryptos making waves as 2025 kicks off. How Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE Secures Its Spot Among the Best Cryptos to Invest in January 2025 Blockchain development often feels like navigating a maze of complex code and intricate systems. Qubetics ($TICS) disrupts this pattern with its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, designed to simplify blockchain application creation. What makes QubeQode IDE unique? Imagine crafting blockchain applications by simply dragging and dropping components. Need token management or user authentication? It’s all pre-built and ready to integrate seamlessly. Even for those without extensive coding experience, QubeQode’s form-based configuration allows users to set application logic through intuitive forms. For more advanced developers, the IDE includes a comprehensive code snippet library. This treasure trove of pre-written code covers common blockchain tasks, expediting development time and minimising errors. AI plays a crucial role here, too. Qubetics leverages AI to assist in smart contract generation, providing secure and efficient code based on user input. Code completion, error detection, and application optimisation further streamline the development process, making it accessible yet powerful. Adding to the buzz, Qubetics recently held its third AMA session , addressing community questions and hinting at innovations. For those on the lookout for the best cryptos to invest in January 2025, Qubetics is drawing serious attention. Polkadot – A Resilient Player in the Crypto Market Polkadot (DOT) has had its fair share of ups and downs. Initially sold at $0.29 during its ICO in October 2017, the project faced challenges post-launch. However, 2021 marked a turning point, with Polkadot reaching an all-time high of $55 in November. Fast forward to 2024, and DOT hit a peak of $11.8, although it currently trades at $7.71 in 2025. While not at its previous heights, Polkadot remains a solid contender in the blockchain ecosystem, driven by its interoperability features and continuous development. SUI – A Star in Blockchain Innovation SUI’s growth trajectory highlights its scalability and commitment to developer-friendly solutions. Partnering with industry giants like Franklin Templeton, Router Chain, and Google Cloud through ZettaBlock, SUI stands out in real-time data access and dApp development. Despite a brief downtime in November 2024, SUI’s Global Accelerator Program continues to drive ecosystem growth by providing funding and expertise. Trading at $4.25, SUI’s expanding market presence makes it an appealing investment. Qubetics Presale Surges – Making a Strong Case as One of the Best Cryptos to Invest in January 2025 The Qubetics presale isn’t just another token sale—it’s an event attracting thousands. Currently, in Phase 16, the presale offers a unique structure. Each week, the price increases by 10%, culminating in a 20% surge during the final phase. This mechanism fuels anticipation, with investors eager to lock in the current rate of $0.045 per token. To date, Qubetics has raised over $9 million, boasting 13,700+ holders and 407 million tokens sold. Let’s break it down: a $500 investment today would secure around 10,972.14 $TICS tokens. Should the token hit $10, that same investment would be worth approximately $109,721.36—an ROI of over 21,844%. And if $TICS climbs to $15? We’re looking at a potential value of $164,582.03, translating to an ROI exceeding 32,800%. With numbers like these, it’s no surprise analysts are eyeing Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to invest in January 2025 . Conclusion Diversification remains key. Polkadot and SUI present strong cases for long-term growth, but the spotlight is undoubtedly on Qubetics. With its innovative QubeQode IDE and impressive presale figures, Qubetics positions itself as a frontrunner for those seeking the best cryptos to invest in January 2025. The potential returns are significant, and as each presale phase pushes prices higher, now might be the perfect moment to secure $TICS tokens. Qubetics isn’t just another project—it’s shaping up to be a game-changer in blockchain development.

With outgoing CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam set to step down on inauguration day, the new appointee is expected to play a crucial role in shaping the regulatory framework for the growing digital asset market in the United States. CFTC Chair Candidates Interviewed by Trump Admin According to Fox Business , a number of candidates have been reportedly met with by Trump’s transition team for the CFTC chair position with at least six individuals in the running for the post. Current frontrunners for the CFTC position include Summer Mersinger, the CFTC Commissioner, and Brian Quintenz, the current head of crypto policy at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The two candidates are familiar with cryptocurrencies and have some experience in the regulation of the industry. Quintenz has experience in the development of crypto regulations as he served at the CFTC and worked with the former chair Chris Giancarlo to issue clearance for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. The fact that he is connected to Andreessen Horowitz is beneficial because its founder Marc Andreessen is one of Trump’s leading advisors on crypto and AI. Mersinger, who is a sitting commissioner at the CFTC, is also an influential policy maker in Washington D.C. She has been a champion for innovation while standing for the rights of consumers within the cryptocurrency industry. She has been applauded by the industry participants for her dissents on enforcement actions against decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. A Shift in Crypto Regulation Under Trump’s Administration The CFTC chair pick is particularly significant due to Donald Trump’s aspiration to make the US the leading country in cryptocurrency innovation. The current outgoing Biden administration, with the SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler , has adopted a more enforcement-oriented approach to crypto regulation. This approach upset the crypto industry that said that such an approach creates ambiguities and drives businesses away to other countries. On the other hand, President elect Donald Trump has indicated that he will pursue a less hostile approach to regulation. While on the campaign trail, he was endorsed by many crypto executives and vowed to reverse what he and others saw as excessive regulation. There are already appointments to key roles of crypto-supporters including Paul Atkins to be the head of the SEC and Scott Bessent as the head of Treasury. Therefore, the appointment of a CFTC Chair that is favorable to crypto would only strengthen this agenda. Mersinger and Quintenz have also been vocal about their disapproval of the current ‘regulation by enforcement’ regime. They have urged the CFTC to assume the mantle of leading regulator of digital assets, claiming that the agency is in a better position to promote innovation than the SEC. Outgoing CFTC Chair Behnam’s Final Push for Crypto Legislation Outgoing chairman of the CFTC, Rostin Behnam has emphasized the importance of the comprehensive regulation of cryptocurrencies before his exit. Speaking at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday for the last time, Behnam pointed out that the absence of a specific set of rules has left certain issues that require the attention of Congress. Behnam said, “My position remains the same, and I will support the CFTC to address this gap if Congress wishes it to do so even after I am no longer part of the Commission.” He also said that new laws could take from six to ten months, with agency rulemaking taking one more year. While serving at the CFTC, the commission brought enforcement action s against several crypto companies, including the defunct exchange FTX and Gemini Trust. Nevertheless, Behnam pointed out that the current legal framework is inadequate to deal with the issues emerging from digital assets and called on the legislators to focus on the development of dedicated crypto laws.

Partnerships with industry leaders have boosted its market visibility, while Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 has contributed to its positive momentum. Meanwhile, Raydium’s trading volume surged 60% in a week, reaching $16.58 billion. This activity, fueled by Solana-based meme coins, drove the RAY token’s price to $5.6, a 50% increase from December 2024 lows. In addition, the Web3Bay (3BAY) token presale continues to attract attention, raising $470,000 and selling over 127.5M 3BAY tokens in record time. Its decentralized E-Commerce ecosystem integrates blockchain and traditional payment systems, offering a solid mix of security and scalability. As early adopters await a 6,430% ROI post-launch, Web3Bay is reshaping digital commerce through blockchain-driven advancements. Render Network Rallies 22% with Major Partnerships Render Network experienced a significant resurgence in early 2025, with a 22% price increase in January. This rebound follows a tough end to 2024, where Render crypto saw a significant dip, largely influenced by Bitcoin’s fluctuations. As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 mark, Render’s price has benefitted from its upward momentum, rising from $6.60 to $8.69. The key to this recovery has been Render Network’s strategic partnerships with major platforms like Dropbox, Blender, and Maxon Redshift. These collaborations have enhanced Render’s market visibility and bolstered investor confidence, contributing to a growing sentiment in Render’s network. Strong on-chain activity and increasing market optimism position Render Network for continued growth. Raydium’s Trading Volume Surge Fuels Bullish Momentum Raydium’s trading volume has surged, driving the price of the RAY token to new highs. The token saw a 50% increase from its lowest point in December, reaching $5.6, as Raydium’s trading volume jumped by 60% to $16.58 billion in the past seven days. This spike in Raydium’s trading volume comes due to a strong performance by Solana meme coins, which have dominated the market. Raydium has outperformed other popular decentralized exchange tokens, with its market cap rising to $1.3 billion. The increase in Raydium’s trading volume reflects growing investor confidence, as the platform solidifies its position as the second-largest player in the DEX space.

At the same time, the Polkadot ecosystem is prospering, marked by significant strides such as a $210 million treasury and enhanced interoperability between networks. Moreover, BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan is enhancing its international presence, crucial for boosting presale activity. This alliance has elevated its presale to over $176.5 million, making BlockDAG (BDAG) a prime candidate for the best crypto for 2025. BNB Bullish Sentiment Builds as Prices Stay Above $700 BNB’s bullish sentiment is intensifying as Binance Coin stabilizes around the crucial $700 mark. After breaking out of a downward channel, the cryptocurrency is testing previous resistance as support, hinting at potential bullish trends. An immediate resistance at $728 is an important barrier; overcoming it may lead to higher Fibonacci levels and a fresh upward surge. The BNB bullish sentiment is also highlighted by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which, despite showing market uncertainty, points towards a potential decisive upward trend. Staying above $700 suggests more potential for an upward trajectory, whereas failing to overcome resistance could lead to a reevaluation of lower support levels at $684 and $671, possibly extending the correction period. Polkadot Ecosystem Achieves $210 Million Treasury The Polkadot ecosystem has exhibited impressive growth in 2024, with its Treasury reaching a new high of $210 million, or about 31 million DOT. This fiscal milestone emphasizes the ecosystem’s robustness, bolstered by Polkadot’s inflation mechanism to regenerate resources. Additionally, the ecosystem has seen a 300% increase in parachain transactions, with Kusama hitting a peak of 140,000 transactions per second during the “Spammening” event in December. The network has also rolled out three trustless bridges—Snowbridge, Polkadot-Kusama, and Hyperbridge—that improve cross-chain connections. Despite a 20% decrease in DOT prices in 2024, these achievements highlight the network’s ongoing dedication to innovation and broader adoption. BlockDAG and Inter Milan: Pioneering Global Crypto Reach Through Soccer BlockDAG’s collaboration with Inter Milan represents a significant advancement in global crypto adoption by uniting modern blockchain technology with the dynamic domain of one of soccer’s greatest teams. With a vast fanbase worldwide, Inter Milan provides BlockDAG an exceptional stage to display its pioneering technology. Showcasing at the famed San Siro Stadium during games offers unparalleled exposure, positioning BlockDAG as a familiar name not just in the blockchain community but among a global sports-loving audience as well. More than just enhancing visibility, this partnership fosters deep connections. Through BlockDAG’s blockchain, Inter Milan supporters can enjoy exclusive digital collectibles, unique content, and special experiences that enhance their connection with the team. Engagements that involve players and bespoke fan experiences strengthen this bond further. By integrating blockchain with sports, BlockDAG demonstrates how technology can revolutionize fan involvement, creating a community that feels more engaged than ever. Moreover, this collaboration has significantly driven the growth of BlockDAG’s coin. During its presale, the coin’s value increased by 2380%, from $0.001 in the first presale batch to $0.0248 by the 27th batch, accumulating over $176.5 million. With more than 17.7 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s presale has become the largest on the market. This impressive growth, spurred by the partnership’s global visibility, establishes BlockDAG as a formidable contender for the best crypto for 2025 and cements its position in the blockchain sector. Key Insights & Future Crypto Leader The enduring BNB bullish sentiment signals its potential for further advancement as it remains stable above crucial price points, reinforcing its stature in the crypto market. The Polkadot ecosystem continues to demonstrate growth and innovation, with a treasury valued at $210 million and achievements in interoperability that encourage consistent adoption. However, BlockDAG is presenting the most compelling argument as the best crypto for 2025 . Its unprecedented presale success and a 2380% increase in coin value from the first batch underscore its robust momentum, while the Inter Milan partnership boosts its global profile. With the coin’s value escalating swiftly, those delaying their purchase might miss out on BlockDAG’s significant expansion.

Solana (SOL) is on the rise, with analysts predicting it could hit $250 soon. Kaspa (KAS), known for its high-speed transactions, is also gaining traction with a target of $0.5. Meanwhile, a new player is set to dominate the presale market – Lightchain AI . Currently priced at $0.004875 in its presale, Lightchain AI has raised over $8.5 million and is emerging as a top contender for significant growth. Unlike Solana and Kaspa, which focus on blockchain speed and scalability, Lightchain AI combines blockchain with artificial intelligence, paving the way for widespread adoption and long-term success. Solana’s Incredible Rise and Path to $250 Solana has been a big part of the blockchain world, famous for its quick deal speeds and cheap costs. After going through some highs and lows last year, Solana is ͏back on path, with experts saying it might hit $250 soon because of rising interest from big companies and use in the DeFi and NFT areas. Solana’s wins are mostly due to its smart Proof of History way, which helps it grow fast without giving up its decentralization. Even with its clear future, Solana still runs into rivals from other blockchains. While it’s set for rise, its need on network crowding and deal holdups in times of high want might be a thing that holds back its chance to keep steady work over time. Kaspa’s Target of $0.5 Speed and Scalability in a Competitive Market Kaspa, a highly scalable Layer 1 blockchain, has been gaining traction due to its high throughput capabilities. With a target price of $0.5, Kaspa aims to provide instantaneous block confirmation through its blockDAG technology, enabling faster transactions compared to traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, despite its scalability, Kaspa still faces the challenge of wider adoption. Its technology is relatively new, and although speed is its key selling point, it will need a more robust use case and developer ecosystem to compete with other established platforms in the space. Nevertheless, Kaspa’s high-speed transactions and low fees make it an attractive option for developers and users seeking blockchain efficiency. Why Lightchain AI Has the Potential to Outperform Solana and Kaspa Lightchain AI presents several distinct advantages that position it to surpass both Solana and Kaspa in the coming years. As a pioneering platform, Lightchain AI (LCAI) integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, delivering innovative solutions across multiple industries. Its carefully designed tokenomics promote sustainability and fairness, with a total supply capped at 10 billion tokens, allocated strategically for presale, staking rewards, liquidity, marketing, team initiatives, and treasury management. The roadmap outlines a clear progression, from prototype development to global adoption, with the goal of revolutionizing decentralized AI applications. Lightchain AI’s use cases cover a broad spectrum, including healthcare, finance, supply chain management, and the creative economy, showcasing the platform’s adaptability in addressing real-world challenges. One standout feature is the Memecoin Launchpad, which enables creators to design, launch, and monetize meme-driven projects, fostering innovation within the ecosystem. By combining advanced AI capabilities with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI emerges as a transformative force in the digital landscape, offering the potential to reshape industries and drive significant advancements.

The broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing heightened indecision, with some fear creeping in as Bitcoin struggles to reclaim the pivotal $100,000 level. This hesitation has created ripple effects across altcoins, including Solana, which has seen its recent momentum stall. Related Reading: Ethereum Will Drop Before The Next Leg Up – Analyst Sets Target Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that $SOL/BTC could be a key pair to monitor in the coming weeks. Jelle suggests that Solana’s performance against Bitcoin may provide critical insights into its potential trajectory. While Solana remains a market favorite due to its robust ecosystem and innovative developments, its ability to reclaim strength relative to BTC will likely influence investor sentiment. As Solana continues to test key support levels, market participants are closely watching for signs of a breakout or further consolidation. The next few weeks could be decisive for Solana’s price action, setting the tone for its performance in the months ahead. Will Solana bounce back to reclaim its highs, or will market uncertainty push it lower? Investors are waiting for clear signals amid this period of flux. Solana Enters A Crucial Phase Solana is trading just above the critical $190 support level, a former supply zone that has flipped into demand. This level represents a key test for the asset as it seeks to solidify its bullish trajectory. Solana has been forming higher lows, a positive sign of strength, but it still needs to reclaim higher supply zones to confirm a sustained bullish trend. Top analyst Jelle recently shared his insights on X, emphasizing the importance of monitoring the SOL/BTC pair in the coming weeks. He noted that Solana is entering what appears to be a bullish phase, but its performance against Bitcoin will be a critical factor in determining its future direction. According to Jelle, Solana must reclaim the 0.0022 level against BTC to signal strength and confirm its bullish outlook. Should Solana fail to achieve this, Jelle indicated that he would consider reallocating some of his exposure back into Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Breakout Or Breakdown? The current market indecision, fueled by Bitcoin’s struggle to break above $100,000, has left many altcoins, including Solana, in a state of flux. A breakout above the 0.0022 level on the SOL/BTC chart would not only reinforce confidence in Solana’s bullish potential but also mark it as a strong contender in the ongoing market rally. Testing Demand At Key Levels Solana is currently trading at $196, navigating a critical demand zone between $193 and $200. This range serves as a key battleground for bulls and bears as Solana attempts to sustain its bullish trajectory. For bulls to regain control, the price must decisively break above the $200 level, invalidating bearish pressure and setting the stage for further gains. To solidify its bullish structure, Solana needs to reclaim the $222 mark. Achieving this would establish a higher high, reinforcing confidence among investors and signaling the continuation of its upward trend. However, failure to push above $200 could leave the price vulnerable to further downside pressure. Related Reading: Key Indicator Signals Buy On XRP 4-Hour Chart – Analyst Predicts A Price Rebound On the flip side, losing the $193 support level would likely trigger a deeper correction. This could result in Solana entering a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before attempting another breakout.

However, investors looking to make huge profits in the long term are shifting to fresh high-potential tokens. This explains why RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging DeFi altcoin, has pumped significantly during its presale. Why are Dogecoin (DOGE) investors migrating to RCO Finance (RCOF)? Read on to discover! Dogecoin Jumps 19% In A Week: More Growth In Store. Dogecoin has impressed meme coin enthusiasts over the past week after surging by double digits. On December 30, Dogecoin was changing hands at around $0.3214. After trading around this level for days, Dogecoin spiked on January 3, 2025. This surge came after Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $98,000 level. Specifically, Dogecoin traded as high as $0.3980 on January 4. However, day traders started taking profits, and Dogecoin pulled back slightly. By January 6, Dogecoin (DOGE) had stabilized at around $0.3843. This price means Dogecoin has gained 19% over the past week. However, analysts foresee Dogecoin pulling back as investors search for high-potential tokens to maximize gains in 2025. This explains why Dogecoin whales have poured $500,000 into RCO Finance (RCOF). RCO Finance Stuns Investors With Its Crypto AI Features While Dogecoin has recorded notable weekly gains, investors are flocking to RCO FInance because this DeFi platform boasts a vast asset offering. Specifically, RCO Finance supports over 120,000 assets spread across 12,500+ classes. These include crypto, decentralized derivatives, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). This offering simplifies portfolio diversification, explaining why RCO Finance is quickly gaining ground. Moreover, RCO Finance runs on AI and blockchain technology. This avant-garde infrastructure enables this burgeoning platform to support an array of modern trading tools. The most noteworthy tool in the RCO Finance ecosystem is its AI-powered robo advisor. This robo advisor has caught investors’ attention because it uses machine learning and advanced algorithms to offer free custom investment recommendations based on your risk tolerance and financial objectives. To achieve this, the robo advisor analyzes the market and gleans actionable data. With the obtained data the robo advisor easily helps you pinpoint the best time to buy or sell specific assets. This approach helps prevent the need to rely on emotions, thus increasing your chances of profitability while minimizing risk exposure. Moreover, the robo advisor can complete transactions on your behalf. This feature lets you take a break from hands-on investing. Additionally, it enables the robo advisor to adjust your portfolio with high-potential investments in real-time, boosting your chances of profitability. RCO Finance has also made waves in the crypto industry because it issues non-KYC debit cards, which simplify the spending of altcoins like Dogecoin. On top of this, RCO Finance supports non-KYC registration. This provision lowers the barriers to entry and helps you maintain anonymity. RCOF Gains Traction During Stage 4: Huge Returns In Store Dogecoin whales are also flocking to RCO Finance to purchase its native token, RCOF. RCOF has won over investors because it is a safe investment. It is worth noting that SolidProof, a leader in blockchain security, audited RCOF’s smart contract and verified that it meets the crypto industry’s safety standards. RCOF has also grown significantly despite being in its presale. As of January 6, RCOF has raised $10.58 million, making it one of the fastest-growing ICOs. Amazingly, this crypto AI token has achieved this funding milestone during Stage 4 of its presale. Investors can now purchase RCOF at $0.0778 and await huge returns as this altcoin moves toward its listing price of $0.4-$0.6. Moreover, analysts foresee RCOF jumping 43,019% in Q1 2025. By surging 43,019%, RCOF will have outshined Dogecoin’s 7,400% climb in 2021. This explains why you should seize this rare opportunity to join the RCOF presale!

As the market grows and evolves, it’s important to keep an eye on coins that are showing strong promise for the future. With 2025 fast approaching, investors are searching for the top coins to buy and hold this year, and it’s clear that several emerging and established coins are making waves. In this list, we’ll dive deep into six cryptocurrencies, including the promising Qubetics ($TICS), which stands out for its innovative approach to decentralisation and blockchain technology. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics is offering groundbreaking solutions to problems like scalability, interoperability, and blockchain development through its native tools and features. Let’s explore the latest developments of Qubetics alongside other high-potential projects like Near Protocol, XRP, Binance, Tron, and Toncoin. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) – Leading the Charge in Blockchain Innovation Qubetics ($TICS) has quickly emerged as one of the top coins to buy and hold this year due to its impressive presale performance and cutting-edge blockchain solutions. The project is currently in its 16th presale stage, having already sold more than 407 million tokens to over 13,700 holders, raising an impressive $9 million in total. With a price of $0.0455 per token in this stage, $TICS is seeing tremendous interest, and analysts predict a whopping 448% ROI by the end of the presale and up to a 32,816% ROI after the mainnet launch. Latest Developments in Qubetics Qubetics has made substantial progress with its focus on decentralised financial services, user-friendly applications, and interoperability. Its recent partnership with SWFT Blockchain is a clear indication that this project is focused on solving real-world issues, such as scalability, liquidity, and cross-chain communication. The ability to seamlessly interact across various blockchains is a feature that sets Qubetics apart and positions it as one of the top coins to buy and hold this year. Another major highlight is Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, which offers a secure way for users to manage their digital assets across multiple chains. With its user-friendly interface, this wallet is designed to give businesses, professionals, and individuals full control over their funds. Imagine a small business owner in Central Asia who needs to make cross-border payments without worrying about high fees. With Qubetics, this is not only possible but easy. QubeQode IDE: Empowering Developers Across the Globe A major standout feature of Qubetics is its QubeQode IDE (Integrated Development Environment). This powerful tool is designed to help developers create decentralised applications (dApps) in a fast, efficient, and scalable manner. A graphic designer from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, looking to develop a digital portfolio or NFT project can use QubeQode IDE to build their application without needing advanced blockchain knowledge. The platform’s seamless integration with Qubetics’ blockchain ensures that their projects are scalable and secure, making it a go-to solution for aspiring and professional developers alike. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics continues to innovate and gain attention, offering real-world solutions and a powerful toolkit for developers, businesses, and individuals. With the ongoing presale and exciting predictions for future growth, it’s no surprise that it’s earning a spot on the top coins to buy and hold this year. 2. Near Protocol (NEAR) – Bridging the Gap Between Blockchains Near Protocol is a decentralised application platform that aims to provide high scalability, low transaction fees, and user-friendly interfaces. The project focuses on enabling developers to build applications in a more efficient and accessible way, making it one of the top coins to buy and hold this year. Near Protocol’s ability to scale effectively while maintaining decentralisation has caught the attention of both developers and investors alike. Latest Developments in Near Protocol Recently, Near Protocol has seen a series of partnerships and upgrades aimed at improving its scalability and usability. One of the most important updates is its sharding architecture, which divides the blockchain into multiple segments, improving performance and reducing transaction costs. These improvements make Near Protocol a compelling option for developers, especially those in industries like gaming, NFTs, and DeFi. Why did this coin make it to this list? Near Protocol is one of the top coins to buy and hold this year due to its consistent improvements and growing ecosystem, making it a solid investment for the future. 3. XRP – Leading the Way in Cross-Border Payments XRP is one of the most recognised cryptocurrencies, and for good reason. Designed to facilitate fast and low-cost cross-border transactions, XRP has gained significant attention from major financial institutions and payment providers. It’s seen as a key player in the future of digital payments, making it one of the top coins to buy and hold this year. Latest Developments in XRP XRP continues to make headlines with its increasing adoption and strategic partnerships. The Ripple network, which uses XRP for cross-border transactions, has been integrating with numerous financial giants, including Santander and American Express. Furthermore, XRP’s ongoing battle with the SEC remains a pivotal point, and a positive outcome could send the price soaring. Why did this coin make it to this list? XRP’s real-world use case in the financial sector, combined with its increasing partnerships and adoption, makes it one of the top coins to buy and hold this year. 4. Binance Coin (BNB) – Dominating the Crypto Exchange Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) is more than just the native token of the Binance exchange. It’s a utility token that powers a wide range of activities within the Binance ecosystem, including paying fees, staking, and participating in token sales. Its consistent growth and utility make it one of the top coins to buy and hold this year. Latest Developments in Binance Coin BNB has seen consistent price appreciation, fuelled by Binance’s ever-growing market dominance and the expansion of its decentralised exchange, Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The Binance Smart Chain has become a hotbed for DeFi projects, and BNB continues to be used as gas for transactions within this ecosystem. This increasing demand for BNB further solidifies its position as one of the top coins to buy and hold this year. Why did this coin make it to this list? Binance Coin’s broad utility, strong performance, and backing by the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world make it a coin that can’t be overlooked when considering top coins to buy and hold this year. 5. Tron (TRX) – Powering Decentralised Web Applications Tron (TRX) has long been known for its ambitious goal of decentralising the web and providing a platform for decentralised applications (dApps).

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $157.81. ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $256.44 by 2031. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As the adoption of decentralized identities and Web3 technology continues to grow, ENS continues to position itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $32.45 Market Cap $1,153,113,307.64 Trading Volume $204,959,217.68 Circulating Supply 34,357,630.51 ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $34.00 24-h Low $32.00 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction (February 7) $105.40 (228.10%) Volatility (30-day Volatility) 37.45% 50-Day SMA $34.57 14-Day RSI 46.39 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $24.06 Ethereum Name Service price analysis: Bears remain in control of the market TL;DR Breakdown Ethereum Name Service’s price analysis shows a bearish trend. A breakout above $34.91 could renew bulls’ interest. The resistance for ENS is present at $37.11. The ENS price analysis for January 9 shows a recent decline, indicating bearish pressure after initial upsides. The resistance level is near $37.11, where selling pressure has been observed, while support is identified around $32.00, providing a potential rebound zone. The movement reflects a short-term downward trend, with traders watching for a breakout above resistance or further dips toward support to determine the next direction. Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart: Will ENS see renewed bullish momentum soon? The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) chart shows a bearish trend, with the current price of $32.51 trading below the 20-day SMA of $34.91, indicating weakened bullish momentum. Recent price corrections from highs above $48 in mid-December reflect profit-taking and high volatility. ENS to see renewed bullish momentum soon? The RSI at 43.02 suggests neutral to mildly oversold conditions. Another indicator, the MACD, shows a bearish crossover with a negative histogram, signaling limited buying momentum but hinting at a slowdown in selling pressure. A breakout above $34.91 could signal renewed bullish momentum, while a drop below $30 might lead to stronger support levels around $28. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis: ENS struggles as bear pressure intensifies The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) 4-hour chart shows the price struggling at $32.29, hovering just above the Chande Kroll Stop-long level of $32.00, which highlights bearish pressure. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.12 suggests sellers are slightly stronger, with limited buying activity in the market. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis Similarly, the Balance of Power at -0.11 points to bears having the upper hand, but not overwhelmingly so. To regain momentum, ENS needs to break above $37.11. Until then, the market remains under pressure, and further downsides or consolidation can be expected. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $41.00 SELL SMA 5 $40.43 SELL SMA 10 $35.64 SELL SMA 21 $35.75 SELL SMA 50 $34.57 SELL SMA 100 $25.97 BUY SMA 200 $24.06 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $37.23 SELL EMA 5 $38.56 SELL EMA 10 $39.68 SELL EMA 21 $38.12 SELL EMA 50 $31.90 BUY EMA 100 $26.87 BUY EMA 200 $23.50 BUY What to expect from ENS? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is currently under bearish pressure, with the price near the critical support level of $32.00. A drop below this could push the price toward $28, while a breakout above $37.11 could signal a bullish recovery. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will fully recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $124.93 by 2027. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending up to $250 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest.

The move, which came just days before President Joe Biden leaves office, is another piece of a larger strategy to control who gets to develop and use cutting-edge AI. According to a Bloomberg report , the plan purports to cut sales of AI chips used in data centers based on country and company. This is an effort to limit China and Russia’s access to advanced technology. Sources familiar with the issue said the goal is to prod AI growth in US-allied countries and force global companies to conform to American standards.

However, most countries would have limits on how much computing power they can bring in.

Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) has seen a massive 72% surge in trading volume, while Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is turning heads on Solana despite recent dips. Yet, the real excitement centres on BTFD Coin, whose innovative referral programme and growing Bulls Squad are creating buzz among crypto enthusiasts. Meme coins have always stood out for their ability to build loyal communities around fun and quirky concepts. From BTFD Coin’s bullish movement to the ancient prophecies of Goatseus Maximus and the rallying cry of “Peanut Forever,” these tokens prove there’s more to crypto than just numbers. BTFD Coin, however, is redefining the space with its referral programme, staking rewards, and engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, cementing its spot as one of the top new meme coins to join today . BTFD Coin: The Referral Programme That Rewards the Bulls What if earning crypto rewards was as simple as sharing a code? BTFD Coin’s referral programme is making waves in the crypto world, offering participants a chance to earn substantial rewards for inviting others to join the presale. Designed to benefit both referrers and referrals, this programme is quickly becoming one of the driving forces behind BTFD’s presale success. Here’s how it works: Once you connect your wallet on the BTFD buy page, you’ll receive a unique referral code. Share this code with your friends, family, or community members. When someone uses your code to make a purchase of $50 or more, they’ll receive an extra 10% in $BTFD tokens on top of their purchase. For you, every referral adds up—referrers who make it to the top 20 on the leaderboard by the end of the month receive 10% of the total raise amount in $BTFD tokens as a bonus. The competition resets monthly, running until the last day of the month at 6 pm UTC and restarting at 00:01 UTC on the 1st of the following month. It’s an exciting way to build the Bulls Squad while earning massive rewards. At its current price of $0.000142 in the 13th presale stage, the potential to stack $BTFD tokens is enormous. For example, if you refer someone who invests $1,000, you’d receive 10% of that in $BTFD tokens. By the time the token lists at $0.0006, those rewards could be worth significantly more. With over $5 million raised, 63 billion tokens sold, and 7,900 Bulls already onboard, BTFD Coin is proving to be one of the top new meme coins to join today. Its referral programme isn’t just about growing numbers; it’s about creating a thriving community where everyone benefits. Getting started is easy. Set up your wallet using MetaMask or Trust Wallet, connect to the BTFD buy page , and start sharing your referral code. With its bullish rewards, a vibrant community, and the added perks of staking and gameplay, BTFD Coin is setting a new standard for meme coins. The Bulls Squad is charging ahead—don’t miss your chance to join the movement. Goatseus Maximus: Prophecies of Growth Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) is no ordinary meme coin. Created by the enigmatic truth_terminal, it carries the weight of ancient meme prophecies while making waves in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space. Trading at $0.425, GOAT is down 17.18% in the last 24 hours but has seen a stunning 72% surge in trading volume, now at $174.2 million. This uptick in volume signals growing investor interest, especially as analysts predict a rise to $0.645 by February 2025. Longer-term projections are even more bullish, with a potential climb to $3.37 by 2030. While GOAT’s volatility warrants caution, its strong narrative and DeFi integration make it one of the top new meme coins to join today for investors looking to balance risk and reward. The community behind GOAT is just as unique as the token itself. Rooted in meme culture and powered by a blend of nostalgia and innovation, Goatseus Maximus offers more than just speculative gains—it’s a statement. If the trading volume continues its upward trajectory, GOAT could become a major player in the meme-inspired DeFi market.

The price recently dipped more than 5-6 percent, erasing the gains made in the last week. XRP could still experience some upward movement, though key levels are crucial for understanding whether the market sentiment is shifting. Key Levels to Watch XRP is currently in a consolidation phase , which could exist for a while. However, on a smaller time frame, this phase may be nearing its end. A final upward move could complete a larger 5th wave, potentially driving XRP to new all-time highs. The most recent Wave 4 bottomed in July 2023, with the market possibly entering the 5th wave upward. Resistance Zones (Long Term) Key resistance levels to monitor are the all-time high of $3.30 from December 2017. Above that, the next resistance points are $4.20 and $5.00. If XRP manages to reach a new high, a major correction could follow, similar to the previous Wave 2. This correction could be both deep and long, so caution is advised. Short-Term Market Structure On the smaller time frame, XRP is currently forming a triangle pattern, hinting at a market indecision. This typically precedes another upward move. A break above the $2.46 level would signal that a low has formed, potentially paving the way for new all-time highs. Current Support Levels Key support levels are between $2.29 and $2.40. If XRP falls below $1.96, it would signal a larger correction, though not necessarily a continuation of the triangle pattern. To keep the bullish outlook intact, XRP must hold above this green support zone. What’s Next for XRP? If XRP breaks above the last swing high at $2.46, it could signal the beginning of a move towards new highs. Until then, attention is focused on whether the price can hold at support and generate a strong reaction.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 03:48:04
