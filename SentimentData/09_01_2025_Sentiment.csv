With Remittix aiming to redefine the PayFi sector, its early funding phase has drawn significant attention from established meme coins. As the Dogecoin price stabilizes and PEPE faces competition, RTX joins the league of contenders in 2025. This article explores all three tokens for crypto enthusiasts looking for the next major breakout. Remittix: A PayFi Revolution In The Making The Remittix presale is gaining momentum as it captures the attention of early adopters and investors eager to ride the wave of the PayFi revolution. With its mission to transform cross-border payments by integrating blockchain technology and traditional financial systems, Remittix stands poised to redefine how money moves globally. What’s driving the hype? For one, the presale introduces a tiered token allocation system designed to reward early participation. Each block of tokens is sold at a fixed price, with subsequent blocks unlocking at higher price thresholds. This structure not only incentivizes early investments but also reflects confidence in the token’s long-term growth potential. The presale’s appeal is amplified by Remittix’s robust use cases. From enabling businesses to accept crypto payments via its Pay API to offering seamless fiat conversions for personal remittances, the platform addresses both niche and broad financial challenges. Investors are particularly drawn to its flat-fee structure, which eliminates hidden costs and ensures transparency—qualities that resonate in today’s evolving financial landscape. DOGE Faces Network Slowdown In 2025 The Dogecoin price has faced persistent selling pressure, with its price declining by 18% over the past month. The DOGE decline is partly attributed to reduced retail interest and stagnation in network activity. Technical indicators paint a bearish picture, with the RSI trending below 40, signaling weakened buying momentum. Furthermore, DOGE’s decline in active addresses and hodler’s balance support the bearish sentiment. DOGE has failed to sustain critical support at $0.065, leading analysts to eye the next support level at $0.050. With no major updates or collaborations, investor confidence in DOGE appears to be waning, potentially leading to further declines. Large Scale PEPE Dump Following Negative Netflows PEPE has seen a sharp 22% decline in its price over the past month, wiping out much of its prior gains. The coin’s poor performance is linked to decreasing transaction volumes and waning interest among speculative investors. Its RSI has slipped into oversold territory, but there’s no sign of a PEPE recovery as the MACD remains firmly negative. Adding to the challenges, PEPE has seen consistent negative netflow, suggesting large-scale dumping by early adopters. The coin is now trading dangerously close to a key support level of $0.000015. A breach of this level could trigger a cascading sell-off, pushing PEPE to test lower levels. Without strong use cases or renewed market interest, PEPE’s prospects for recovery remain dim. Conclusion As DOGE and PEPE face mounting challenges, the Remittix presale shines as a beacon for investors seeking growth in the PayFi sector. At just $0.0193, now is the perfect time to join the presale and secure a stake in a project poised to lead the financial revolution. Don’t wait—invest in Remittix today!

This follows Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s announcement of his resignation on January 7, in the wake of the abrupt departure of his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland. The Endorsement Musk shared a video of Poilievre discussing inflation and fiscal policy on X, captioning it, “Perfectly articulated.” As the Conservative Party leader, he is now widely seen as the frontrunner to succeed Trudeau, with Canada’s federal election scheduled for October 20, 2025. The video has gained a lot of attention, particularly from the cryptocurrency community, which has rallied behind him due to his pro-crypto stance and advocacy for innovation. The opposition leader has been a long-time supporter of Bitcoin, frequently appearing on digital asset podcasts and advocating for Canada to become the “blockchain capital of the world.” In his 2022 campaign, he made his backing of the flagship cryptocurrency clear by using it to pay for shawarma, a move reminiscent of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s purchase of burgers in New York’s PubKey bar, using BTC. A few weeks later, he donated $100 worth of Bitcoin to the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Additionally, he pledged to remove taxes on crypto donations if he became Prime Minister. The 45-year-old has also made several pro-crypto statements. On one occasion, he argued that “Canadians should have the freedom to use other forms of money, like Bitcoin,” criticizing the government for “ruining” the country’s fiat currency. Poilievre has also been an outspoken critic of Canada’s central bank. In April 2022, he attributed the North American nation’s record inflation to the institution’s controversial policies. He also said that alternatives like Bitcoin were essential in addressing Canada’s economic challenges. Further, a Reuters report from April last year showed that the 45-year-old voiced his support for legislation that would block the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the country. Poilievre’s Odds and Vancouver’s Bitcoin Moves Data from the prediction market Polymarket shows that Poilievre has an 89% chance of winning the upcoming election, far ahead of the next closest contender, Chrystia Freeland, who has just a 7% chance. In related news, on December 11, Vancouver’s City Council approved a motion put forward by Mayor Ken Sim, suggesting the city consider holding Bitcoin in reserve and accepting cryptocurrency payments for municipal services. Local media revealed that the proposal passed along party lines, with Sim and ABC Vancouver councilors in favor, while two Green councilors opposed it. Sim has also committed to donating $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in support of the initiative. “Bitcoin is the number one performing asset on the planet over the last 16 years, so to not even look at including it as a part of a diversified portfolio is, I think, reckless,” he said.

This page is going to be dedicated to the games that we can consider underrated in the gambling industry. As there are so many big games now that players can play, we understand that some players are unlikely to try new games that they may not like when they have games that they love. However, we think that going into these games with an open mind could help you find some new favorites. Bingo Bingo is a massive part of gambling and has been for decades now. However, with the recent technological advancements in the gambling industry, the popularity of bingo on online casinos has become an underrated part of the industry. Not only is playing online bingo as fun as it would be in the bingo halls, but it is also easier to play. Playing bingo in person requires you to find a bingo hall and be out while you play, however, playing online allows players to play online bingo wherever they want. As well as this, there are even more options available for bingo players who play online, with some games having higher winning potential or different themes entirely, the experience is crafted to give players whatever they want. As well as this, you have different types of bingo games, like slingo which we will get into later, that allows players to find the exact type of game they want at any time and in any place. Slingo Slot Games Now slingo is the hybrid of two of the most exciting casino games, bingo and slots, and offers layers of the perfect mix of both games. The positives we spoke about a minute ago, with players being able to play bingo at any time and in any place, remain true for when you play slingo slots but with even more variety available. The winning potential of slingo slots is higher than that of bingo games and with the nice blend of skill and luck, slingo slots are one of the most underrated games around. Baccarat Unlike with Bingo, baccarat is a game that you may have never even heard of despite being one of the best additions to the gambling industry ever. With it being overshadowed by poker and blackjack, baccarat hides in the shadows of these games and is waiting for new players. The reason why baccarat is so good is because the game itself is known for its simplicity and high winning potential which is the perfect blend you want for all your games. The game itself is easy to learn but hard to master, the game requires you to bet on whether you think the dealer or the player with a hand that is closer to nine. On the surface, it sounds easy and playing it is also as easy as it sounds. Although down the line there will be strategies that you can learn and tips that will help you win more , the game itself is easy to play and has a good winning potential despite the ease.

Lightchain AI, BlockDag Or Remittix?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/which-of-these-crypto-investments-will-likely-make-you-rich-in-2025-lightchain-ai-blockdag-or-remittix,"As the crypto industry progresses in 2025, creative ideas pushing the limit of technology are transforming various global sectors. With their innovative approaches to artificial intelligence, blockchain scalability, and crypto-fiat integration, three standouts—Litechain AI (LCAI), BlockDAG (BDAG), and Remittix (RTX)—are drawing investors in particular. Which of these initiatives, though, promises perhaps life-changing returns? Could it be BlockDAG's lightning-fast transaction speeds, Litechain AI's groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence consensus, or Remittix's seamless link between crypto and conventional finance? Read on to explore the particular advantages of these crypto projects. Lightchain AI Is Pioneering Inclusive Decentralized Intelligence By introducing Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a green consensus mechanism that focuses computational resources towards significant AI tasks, Lightchain AI is redefining the blockchain sector. PoI presents Lightchain AI as a sustainable substitute by lowering the environmental impact sometimes connected with blockchain activities. This breakthrough approach enables decentralized model training, allowing nodes to cooperate on creating worldwide artificial intelligence models without violating data privacy. Every node provides updates from local data that the network checks and combines into a single, shared model. Furthermore, Lightchain AI's decentralized inference marketplace lets users ask for AI-powered chores—such as data analysis or language translation—while nodes get the LCAI token for running these calculations. The current LCAI price in stage 11 is a tempting $0.004875 while the Lightchain AI presale is under progress. Significant rallies predicted by analysts this year already point to the LCAI token as a profitable investment. BlockDAG: Redefining Blockchain for a Sustainable Future By combining modern Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with a clear vision for scalability and sustainability, BlockDAG is redefining the crypto space. BlockDAG performs lightning-fast transaction speeds, processing thousands of transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization or security, unlike conventional blockchains. Its hybrid proof-of-work consensus system guarantees strong network integrity, and its sophisticated cryptography systems protect data against attacks. BlockDAG's EVM compatibility also enables smooth interaction with Ethereum's ecosystem, therefore enabling developers to use its low-code drag-and-drop tools to produce creative ideas. With this new platform, which promotes itself as a transforming agent, the BDAG token is among the top crypto coins to hold in 2025. Starting from just $0.0001 during the BlockDAGpresale, the BDAG price is expected to rise to $0.05 by the last presale stage. Having already raised more than $175 million, the BlockDAG presale highlights great investor trust. Remittix: Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance Seamlessly Remittix is redefining the way cryptocurrencies interface with existing financial systems, creating a seamless platform for fast crypto-to-cash conversions via bank transfers. Moreover, Remittix guarantees receivers remain ignorant that crypto was involved in the transaction with its creative technique, therefore establishing a clear and quick link between digital assets and traditional financial systems. By combining blockchain technology with current financial systems, this original solution exceeds rivals such as Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase in speed, security, and efficiency for cross-border payments. Positioned to profit from the $183 trillion worldwide banking sector, Remittixis becoming the best crypto investment choice for forward-looking investors. Meanwhile, Remittix provides an unmissable entrance point for investors ready to profit on the growing demand for crypto-fiat integration at a presale price of just $0.0193 per RTX token. Unlike many initiatives, Remittix lets all tokens be claimable merely five days after launch, therefore exempting presale buyers from vesting time. The RTX token is poised for further rallies as the financial industry adopts cryptocurrency solutions. Why Remittix Outshines Litechain AI and BlockDAG With innovative technologies that fit several sectors, Litechain AI, BlockDAG, and Remittixeach give interesting prospects as the crypto market gets ready for a bullish 2025. While BlockDAG advocates blockchain speed and scalability to hitherto unheard-of levels, LitechainAI pioneers AI-integrated decentralization. Remittix, however, stands out as the best crypto investment since it deftly closes the distance between cryptocurrencies and conventional banking, a market ready for explosive expansion in the coming years. The RTX coin presents a great chance for investors as the presale tokens are fast selling out because of the rising investor interest and limited token supply.

Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting dropped today, showing us a room full of officials who are uneasy about inflation and scratching their heads over what Trump’s policies on trade and immigration might mean for the economy. His name wasn’t directly mentioned—because, of course—but his incoming administration’s moves are all over the discussion. The Fed has been walking a tightrope since inflation started throwing tantrums. While recent data shows some signs of cooling, it’s not enough to make anyone at the Fed relax. Inflation slows, but not enough Total consumer price inflation, measured by the 12-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, was sitting at 2.3% in October, a drop from 3.0% in the same period last year. Core PCE inflation—stripping out the usual suspects like food and energy—was at 2.8%, down from 3.4% a year earlier. By November, estimates pointed to total PCE inflation at 2.5% and core inflation holding steady at 2.8%. Consumer price index (CPI) data told a similar story. In November, CPI inflation came in at 2.7%, with core CPI at 3.3%. Both figures are lower than they were in 2023, but they’re not low enough for anyone to throw a party. The Fed remains laser-focused on core inflation, which hasn’t cooled as much as expected, thanks to sticky categories like services. Labor market conditions are also changing, though only slightly. Average monthly payroll gains were slower in October and November compared to the third quarter, partly because of strikes and natural disasters. The unemployment rate inched up to 4.2% in November, with participation rates dipping as well. Still, wages didn’t flinch, holding steady with a 4% year-over-year increase in November. Economic growth holds steady, foreign markets stumble The US economy isn’t doing too badly—at least for now. GDP growth in the third quarter was solid, matching the pace of the second quarter. Consumer spending and private investments pushed the numbers up, but imports outpaced exports, creating a drag. In the fourth quarter, indicators showed that GDP growth stayed strong, with consumer and private spending leading the charge again. Meanwhile, imports dropped off in October, particularly capital goods. Overseas, it’s a bit complicated. The eurozone and Mexico saw growth in the third quarter, but by year’s end, momentum was running out of steam. Manufacturing slowed, and private consumption remained weak. China, meanwhile, struggled with low retail sales growth, weak domestic demand despite high-tech production in other parts of Asia staying hot, thanks to US demand. Inflation in advanced economies eased, thanks to earlier drops in energy prices, but services inflation refused to budge in some areas. Latin America, especially Brazil, faced a different beast, with rising inflation fueled by currency issues. Markets adjust to Fed signals Now let’s talk markets. Investors have been adjusting their expectations for rate cuts ever since the Fed started showing its cautious side. Treasury yields initially rose post-election but flattened out by the end of the period covered in the minutes. Near-term inflation expectations nudged higher, while long-term measures barely moved. Equity markets, on the other hand, were riding a wave of optimism. Stocks in cyclical sectors shot up, with investors betting on strong corporate profits. High-yield bond spreads narrowed, and the VIX—a gauge of stock market volatility—dropped to levels much lower than before the election. Bitcoin, though, remains below $100,000 after falling down yesterday. Internationally, things weren’t so rosy. Weak data from abroad and expectations of rate cuts from foreign central banks pulled bond yields down in advanced economies, boosting the dollar some more. Foreign equities underperformed US stocks, reflecting expectations of diverging economic growth between the US and the rest of the world. Central banks abroad were busy too. Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, and Mexico all cut rates during the period. Brazil, on the other hand, went rogue, hiking its rate by 100 basis points to fight inflation. Borrowing costs remain high, households feel the squeeze Despite some stability in short-term funding markets, borrowing costs in the US remained high across the board. Mortgage rates ticked down slightly but stayed historically elevated. Auto loans and credit card rates remained near record highs, although auto loan rates did see minor decreases. Corporate borrowers saw a bit of relief, with yields on investment-grade and speculative bonds dipping. Commercial real estate loans, after stalling in the third quarter, picked up slightly in October, but delinquencies in this sector continued to climb. Small businesses had it rough, facing tight credit conditions and weak loan originations. Households didn’t have it much better. While credit was generally available for those with strong credit scores, delinquencies on credit cards continued to rise. Federal Housing Administration mortgage delinquencies stayed above pre-pandemic levels, adding to the pressure on lower-income borrowers. The Fed will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed assets. However, officials are keeping a close eye on data and will make adjustments as necessary. They said, “The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-08 22:29:22

Trump’s Fury Over Interest Rates Signals Big Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-blast-trump-high-interest-rates/,"Bitcoin experts are buzzing as President-elect Donald Trump lashed out against current Federal Reserve policy, calling interest rates “far too high” despite persistent inflationary pressures. “We are inheriting a difficult situation from the outgoing administration,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago club, adding that officials seem to be “trying everything they can to make it more difficult” for his incoming team. The blunt remarks, coming fewer than two weeks before Trump’s inauguration, have stoked anticipation of a possible shift in US monetary policy—and raised speculation about a boost for Bitcoin and other risk assets in the new year. The 2017 Trump Playbook: Dollar “Too Strong”, Bitcoin Up? Although the economic and geopolitical landscape has changed since Trump’s first term, some market watchers see parallels to his 2017 rhetoric. Back then, he lambasted a US dollar that he deemed “too strong,” a stance that preceded a notable decline in the currency. The US Dollar Index (DXY) peaked near 104 in early January 2017 but began a downward trend that extended into early 2018, bottoming out around 98. Related Reading: Anticipating A ‘2025 Super Cycle’: Bitcoin Rallies With Trump’s Regulatory Reforms On The Horizon This sharp move in the dollar coincided with a broader risk-on environment, fueling rallies in equities as well as the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), drew a direct comparison on X. “The last time Trump said something was ‘too high,’ it was the dollar – back in January 2017, just days before his inauguration,” Bittel stated and recounted: “Here’s what he said: ‘Our companies can’t compete with them now because our currency is too strong. And it’s killing us.” Notably, last year, Trump also called recent strength a “tremendous burden on US businesses.” Bittel further argued: “Trump understands the impact of a strong dollar – and the same logic applies to high interest rates. They suppress exports, hurt corporate earnings, and slow economic growth.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Signal That Took Price From $69,000 To $108,000 Appears Again Speaking on the impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, Bittel concluded: “What happened next? Well, the dollar began a significant decline, setting the stage for one of the most pivotal macro moves we’ve seen in years – triggering a melt-up in risk assets. Déjà vu? I think so. Let’s see how it plays out.” Bittel is not the only expert speculating that the DXY may already have peaked, mirroring its 2017 topping pattern. Steve Donzé, Deputy CIO for Multi Asset at Pictet Asset Management Japan, shared a widely discussed chart on X, remarking “On time. Ready for pushback,” while overlaying recent DXY movements with the currency’s trajectory in early 2017. The chart suggests a similar pattern that could foreshadow renewed dollar weakness in the coming weeks. In a separate post, financial analyst Silver Surfer (@SilverSurfer_23) pointed to an uncanny timing overlap: “DXY topped on January 3rd, 2017—18 days before Trump’s Inauguration. DXY looks to have topped on January 2nd, 2025—19 days before Trump’s Inauguration.” He characterized the parallel as “crazy history repeating,” explaining that he sees a correlation between the path of the DXY before both inaugurations. Such analogies are fueling speculation that a repeat dollar slump could usher in an environment favoring risk assets. Should the dollar indeed enter a new downtrend—much like in 2017–2018—Bitcoin could ride a wave of renewed liquidity and speculative appetite. At press time, BTC traded at $94,950.

Simon’s Cat (CAT): From Meme to Marketing Genius Simon’s Cat is proof that meme coins can have claws. Launched just a few months back, CAT has surged in popularity thanks to its savvy marketing and an army of social media enthusiasts. With its roots in the viral animated series of the same name, this coin brings a touch of nostalgia and a hefty dose of charm to the crypto scene. But CAT isn’t just cute; it’s clever. The project has capitalised on its branding with a series of token burns, exchange listings, and airdrops that keep the community buzzing. One word: relatability. Everyone loves a cheeky cat, and Simon’s Cat taps into that universal appeal. But beyond the memes, CAT has plans to integrate into NFT marketplaces and offer exclusive content to holders. Imagine owning not just the coin but a piece of the brand itself—an exclusive NFT or a sneak peek at new episodes. Analysts predict Simon’s Cat could claw its way to a 50% price increase by the end of the quarter, making it one of the best new meme coins to invest in right now. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Satire Meets Serious Gains Non-Playable Coin, or NPC, started as a tongue-in-cheek jab at crypto culture but has quickly turned into a bona fide investment opportunity. Its name might scream “joke,” but this project is anything but. NPC’s innovative tokenomics and decentralised governance model have caught the attention of investors who know that meme coins often hide some serious tech under all the memes. NPC has built its brand on satire, but the real magic lies in its ecosystem. The coin is pegged to its own metaverse, where users can trade, play, and even create their own NPC avatars. It’s a meta twist on the crypto space that feels fresh and fun. NPC’s decentralised approach gives the community a real voice, from voting on project developments to deciding on token burns. This transparency has built a loyal following that sees NPC as more than a meme—it’s a statement. Conclusion: The Meme Coin Market’s Bright Future Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that BTFD Coin, Simon’s Cat, and Non-Playable Coin are leading the charge in the meme coin revolution.

With this in mind, a new altcoin, Remittix (RTC) , has become a hot topic among investors for its massive profit potential. Dubbed the “SHIB killer” and the best presale token of 2025, analysts project Remittix could offer up to 5,000% to early backers. Over 125 million RTX tokens have been sold, with over $2 million raised in funding in just a few weeks. Here’s why investors are backing Remittix to surpass Shiba Inu’s success. Remittix Redefines Cross-Border Transactions with Its Unique VIP Program Remittix (RTX) is taking a new approach to cross-border payments. Unlike competitors like Wise and Stripe, which mainly focus on fiat-to-fiat transactions, Remittix is building a platform that allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies instantly. These funds can then be sent to approved banks worldwide. The seamless process makes it nearly impossible for recipients to tell the transaction started as crypto. Plus, with Remittix’s flat fees and no hidden charges, the recipient gets what the user sends. Remittix has passed rigorous security audits by leading blockchain firms SolidProof and BlockSAFU, ensuring it’s safe and reliable. The team has also locked its liquidity pool and tokens for three years to build confidence further. This move prevents sudden sell-offs and stabilizes the project, proving its commitment to long-term growth and investor protection. The $RTX token is the backbone of the Remittix platform, driving key features like staking and governance. Investors can earn between 4% and 8% by staking their tokens. The VIP program offers tiered rewards for those aiming higher, with top-tier investors enjoying up to 18% APY and exclusive voting privileges. Presently in presale at $0.0193 per token, $RTX provides a distinctive opportunity for early investors. Industry experts forecast gains of up to 900% in presale and 4,500% post-launch. The increasing attention suggests Remittix might challenge industry titans like Shiba Inu in 2025. SHIB News: Whales Exit While Retail Investors Step In In the latest SHIB news, on-chain data shows a shift in investor behavior weighing on Shiba Inu. Wallets with 10 million to 100 million worth of SHIB tokens have dropped by 20%, andaddresses with $10,000 to $1M worth of SHIB dropped by 16-22%. This signals a major sell-off by larger investors, possibly due to fading confidence or profit-taking at current prices. On the contrary, smaller retail investors are investing more money into Shiba Inu's potential. Wallets with $1 to $1,000 worth of Shiba Inu have risen by 7.25%, reflecting an ongoing interest among everyday traders. While this shows that Shiba Inu still grabs attention, the market’s stability may be at risk as whales exit and smaller buyers take over. In other SHIB news, Shiba Inu’s trading volume is up 39%, offering some optimism. However, Shiba Inu must reclaim the $0.00002555 resistance level—where whales were active before—to spark a real recovery. Otherwise, the price might dip toward $0.00002200. A turnaround likely depends on stronger trading activity and renewed interest from larger players. For now, caution is key. Why Remittix Could Be the Next Shiba Inu Rival Shiba Inu took the crypto world by storm in 2021 but hasn't replicated that success since. Remittix's stated objective of transforming cross-border payments and the possible expansion of the $RTX token makes it a serious contender. A $100 investment in Remittix today has the potential to grow into $100,000, offering an incredible opportunity for early adopters.

He also emphasized its significance for innovative American companies seeking to trade on premier stock exchanges. “Exodus is thrilled to uplist on the NYSE American. It’s crucial that America’s innovative companies can trade on America’s premier stock exchanges. We expect this uplisting will raise Exodus’ corporate profile, while also enhancing liquidity for our current and future shareholders.” Richardson said . Exodus expressed its commitment to continue innovating within the cryptocurrency sector. The self-custodial wallet provider’s transition to a more prominent exchange will attract a broader investment base and increase its market visibility and shareholder value.

Table of Contents XYZ: The new meme coin heavyweight Ethereum IOTA Ethena POPCAT Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for a significant shift in 2025. Key digital assets are expected to rise above the rest, showing remarkable growth. This article uncovers the top five cryptocurrencies highlighted by ChatGPT to lead this upcoming surge. XYZ: The new meme coin heavyweight XYZVerse breaks the mold as the first all-sports meme token, blending the excitement of sports fandom with the viral appeal of meme culture. Its ecosystem goes beyond speculative hype, offering real-world applications like prediction markets, entertainment dApps, and community-driven rewards, making it a standout among meme coins and altcoins alike. Priced at $0.001333 in its presale phase, XYZVerse presents a significant opportunity for early investors. By the final stage of the presale, the token is projected to reach $0.1, a massive 7,402% increase. With the market poised for exponential growth, XYZVerse could become one of the most profitable digital assets of 2025. Backed by audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for major CEX and DEX listings, XYZVerse is built on a foundation of security and scalability. Its transformative approach of integrating sports and meme culture taps into a multi-billion-dollar industry, creating a robust platform with widespread appeal. While established names like Ethereum and XRP remain strong contenders, XYZVerse’s fresh approach and massive growth potential give it a unique edge. It represents the kind of forward-thinking project that could redefine meme coins and deliver substantial returns to early adopters. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for its potential 7,400% knockout. Ethereum Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that transformed the crypto world. Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, it introduced smart contracts, opening the door to a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps, including finance platforms and games. Based on past trends, predictions suggest ETH could reach $6,580.53, with a low of $2,700.31 in 2025. Looking ahead to 2030, these forecasts point to more potential growth. With its strong foundation and plans for improvement, ETH appears attractive in the current market. As more people embrace blockchain technology, Ethereum’s role could become even more significant. You might also like: $140M whale forecasts XRP at $9, XYZVerse to see 65,000% surge in 2025 IOTA IOTA is a new kind of technology that lets people and businesses exchange data and value in a safe and direct way. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, IOTA is built on the Tangle, which is like a web of connections. This unique design allows for fast and secure transactions without fees. IOTA also offers tools for creating apps, smart contracts, tokens, NFTs, and digital identities. With the IOTA 2.0 upgrade, the platform could make it stand out even further in the crowded crypto market. Compared to other coins, IOTA’s focus on secure and feeless transactions makes it attractive. In today’s market, where innovation is key, IOTA’s technology shows promise. Its collaboration with Shimmer and support for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts could help it gain more users and developers. Ethena Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum. It aims to create a crypto-native form of money that doesn’t depend on traditional banks. Imagine a digital dollar that’s secure, stable, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Alongside this, Ethena introduces the ‘Internet Bond’, a dollar-denominated savings instrument that’s available globally. This bond offers a new way to save and earn, all within the crypto ecosystem. By avoiding reliance on banks, Ethena addresses concerns about centralization. Compared to other stablecoins that are backed by reserves in banks, Ethena offers a decentralized alternative. With growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethena’s timing could be just right. Its ‘Internet Bond’ could also provide a compelling option for savers looking for returns without traditional financial intermediaries. You might also like: Hidden gem: XYZVerse takes the crown as the most promising new crypto POPCAT POPCAT is a meme token inspired by the viral Popcat meme from October 2020. The meme features two images of a cat named Oatmeal — one with its mouth closed and another edited to form an ‘O’ shape. This coin has no inherent value or financial expectations; it’s all about fun and entertainment. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown that internet culture can impact the crypto space. While POPCAT doesn’t bring new technology to the table, its charm lies in its connection to a beloved meme. In a market where trends can shift quickly and where community engagement matters, POPCAT might catch the eye of meme enthusiasts and crypto fans alike. Whether it becomes the next big thing or just a fleeting trend, POPCAT is certainly adding some feline fun to the crypto world. Conclusion ETH, IOTA, ENA, and POPCAT are promising, but XYZ, uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem, aims for 7,400% growth as the G.O.A.T. of memecoins.

This outlook is unfavorable for high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Liquidations in the Crypto Market Within 24 hours, $331 million worth of long positions were liquidated, with 131,979 traders affected. Ethereum (ETH) also slipped below $3,500, reflecting broader market distress. Bearish Technical Patterns Bitcoin broke below its upward channel, breaching the critical support at $97,204. The move has shifted momentum to the downside, with traders eyeing the $92,500 level as a potential demand zone. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Support and Resistance Levels Immediate support lies at $92,500, followed by a stronger zone at $91,947. On the upside, resistance is seen at $96,080, with additional hurdles at $98,856. Market Sentiment The RSI at 34.76 indicates oversold conditions, raising the possibility of a short-term rebound. However, sustained recovery depends on Bitcoin reclaiming $97,204 and breaking above resistance. Long-Term Outlook Despite near-term headwinds, Bitcoin’s fundamentals, including a $1.87 trillion market cap and limited supply of 21 million coins, remain strong. Analysts suggest monitoring demand levels near $92,000 for potential recovery. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin broke below critical support at $97,204, triggering bearish momentum. Economic data suggests fewer Fed rate cuts, weighing on high-risk assets. A bounce near $92,000 could form a double-bottom pattern, signaling potential recovery.

Their collaboration highlights the rising potential of 1Fuel, a project gaining attention for its innovative approach to blockchain solutions. With projections to become the best presale for 50x gains, 1Fuel is quickly becoming one of the hottest opportunities in the market, positioning itself as a game-changer in the crypto space. Virtuals Protocol trading volume surges despite recent decline Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) recently hit a record high of $5.14 , surging 55% after breaking out of an ascending channel. However, the momentum didn’t last long as bears took control, dragging its price down to $3. After some recovery, Virtuals Protocol is trading at $3.85 on CoinMarketCap, marking a 7% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite the decline, Virtuals Protocol's trading volume is up by 7%. This increase suggests ongoing market activity, though the outlook remains bearish. Investors are growing cautious as Virtuals Protocol struggles to maintain its previous highs. Many are now turning their attention to alternatives, including top low-cost crypto investments like 1Fuel, for potential profits. Arbitrum’s $190 Million investment in blockchain gaming amidst market setbacks 2024 was a game-changing year for Arbitrum (ARB). As one of the first intent-enabled chains, Arbitrum enhanced its interoperability and gained serious attention in the blockchain world. In 2024, Arbitrum surpassed Solana in on-chain activity, proving popular among users and developers. Today, in 2025, Arbitrum has already been hot because its DAO revealed plans to invest $190 million in blockchain gaming. Between 2025 and 2028, the DAO will support 100 gaming projects beginning this quarter to market the blockchain gaming system. Despite these changes, Arbitrum is trading for $0.906 after dropping 4% within the past day and losing 28% of its trading volume now at $390 million. Still, analysts see potential, forecasting $1 by Q1 and $5 by late 2025. With innovation, gaming, and its reputation as one of the top low-cost crypto investments, Arbitrum is capturing the attention of gamers and investors alike. 1Fuel: A game-changer in crypto with seamless transactions and high-staking rewards 1Fuel is shaking up the cryptocurrency world with its innovative features that simplify the process for users. One standout is its one-click cross-chain technology, which allows seamless transactions between blockchain networks. This removes the hassle of paying high fees or transferring funds between wallets, making it more user-friendly for everyday crypto traders. Privacy and security are at the core of 1Fuel. It includes a built-in privacy mixer and cold storage options, ensuring that users maintain full control over their assets while protecting against potential data breaches. These are especially crucial features in a business where privacy issues are prevalent. 1Fuel also features attractive staking rewards of up to 30% APR, making it a good option for passive income investors. The project also offers digital debit cards that consumers can pay daily for virtual and real money transactions. Having raised over $1 million in its presale round, 1Fuel is gaining serious attention.

Relief efforts are gaining momentum as local and international donors step in to provide much-needed aid.

According to The Giving Block’s Annual Industry Report on the State of Crypto Philanthropy , over $2 billion in cryptocurrency donations have been made as of January 2024. Pousty expressed hope that the Los Angeles Wildfires Emergency Response Fundraiser will mobilize similar contributions, stating, “Every contribution fuels the work of trusted organizations on the ground, bringing critical aid to those who need it most.” “Together, we can turn the collective strength of the crypto community into life-changing support for the residents of Los Angeles,” he added. Los Angeles Crypto Community Asks For Help While relief efforts are still ramping up, members of Los Angeles’ crypto community are calling for urgent assistance. Los Angeles-based crypto influencer “ Wendy O ” told Cryptonews that, “It’s absolutely tragic to see the damage from the fire and winds in Southern California occur.” Wendy O added that the LA wildfires impact all Americans. “It is true that homeowners insurance in California has been canceled for many – I dealt with this 2 years ago. Please show compassion to those impacted and help when you can,” she said. The palisades fire is now almost 12,000 acres. My heart is broken for my state and all impacted.

As Gensler’s term draws to a close, his tough stance on crypto regulation highlights his belief in the need for stricter oversight. His actions have shaped the current U.S. regulatory environment in ways that have sparked significant debate in the crypto community A Tough Stance on Crypto Regulation Since becoming SEC chair in 2021, Gary Gensler strongly believes that the cryptocurrency market needs stricter regulation. Speaking to Bloomberg TV recently, he argued that the market is “rife with bad actors.” He emphasized the need for better investor protection. His leadership has been defined by aggressive actions against some of the biggest names in the crypto world, like Coinbase and Ripple Labs . Under Gensler’s watch, the SEC filed nearly 100 enforcement actions related to cryptocurrencies, pushing companies to comply with securities laws. This came after his predecessor, Jay Clayton, filed 80 similar actions. Enforcing existing laws and ensuring crypto firms comply with them is a top priority for Gensler. Gary Gensler Faces Backlash Over Investor Protection Stance For Gensler, one of the key goals of the SEC is ensuring that everyday investors are given proper protections. He has repeatedly stated that most digital assets should be classified as securities. Also, crypto companies need to disclose more information to the public. In his view, the crypto market’s lack of transparency and regulation exposes regular investors to unnecessary risks. However, not everyone agrees with Gensler’s hardline stance. Critics argue that his aggressive approach has been destructive , stifling innovation in the crypto space. Many point out that the current legal framework does not fit well with the fast-moving world of digital assets. This makes it hard for companies to comply without facing legal challenges. Despite the backlash, Gensler has defended the SEC’s actions, arguing that protecting investors and maintaining market integrity is necessary. He sees regulation as a way to weed out bad actors and ensure that the remaining companies operate fairly. A New Era at the SEC: What’s Next for Crypto Regulation? As Gensler prepares to exit, the SEC is on the brink of a new chapter . President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to take over as the agency’s new head. Unlike Gensler, Atkins is likely to take a more balanced approach. Many expect his leadership to promote innovation in the crypto industry while ensuring proper oversight. Gensler remains proud of his achievements in bringing greater regulatory clarity to the crypto market. However, he noted that much work still needs to be done, especially as the digital asset landscape evolves rapidly.

38706325,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=640082,1736376900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38706325.jpeg,Terraform’s Do Kwon to go on criminal trial in early 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/terraforms-do-kwon-to-go-on-criminal-trial-in-early-2026/,"Do Kwon, founder of Terraform Labs, is officially heading to trial in January 2026. The charges? Criminal fraud tied to the $40 billion collapse of TerraUSD and Luna, two cryptocurrencies that turned the crypto market upside down in 2022. The trial, set to take place in New York, will be overseen by Judge Paul Engelmayer and is expected to stretch for four to eight weeks. Kwon’s legal saga has been anything but ordinary. His not-guilty plea last week caps a two-year extradition battle that saw both the United States and South Korea vying to prosecute him. After months on the run, hiding from authorities, and eventually getting arrested in Montenegro on unrelated charges, Kwon is now set to face U.S. prosecutors who are ready to hold him accountable for what they’re calling one of the largest fraud cases in crypto history. $40 billion lost, over a million affected Prosecutors claim Kwon’s actions wrecked lives—over a million of them, to be exact. Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel Gitner says that the number of victims includes individuals and organizations worldwide who invested in Terraform’s so-called decentralized financial ecosystem. His filing to the District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday said that determining the full extent of the damage is “challenging” due to the massive scale of transactions involving Terraform’s tokens, TerraUSD and Luna. “The Government estimates that the number of victims in this case exceeds hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities, and potentially totals more than one million,” Gitner wrote. Instead of reaching out to every affected person, the government plans to launch a public website to keep victims updated on the case, citing the impracticality of individual notifications. The charges against Kwon center on allegations that he deceived investors by marketing Terraform as a revolutionary decentralized platform. The system, which promised a blockchain-powered currency, payment network, stock market, and savings bank, was, according to prosecutors, built on lies. The indictment claims that Kwon and his team falsely portrayed Terraform as autonomous and governed by its users while maintaining tight, behind-the-scenes control. When TerraUSD and Luna imploded in May 2022, they wiped out $40 billion in market value. U.S. prosecutors accuse Kwon of orchestrating the collapse through “manipulative and deceptive” tactics that misled investors and left them with massive losses. After the Terra ecosystem collapsed, he vanished. For months, he evaded authorities until his arrest in Montenegro in 2023. Both South Korea and America filed criminal charges against him, kicking off a lengthy extradition battle. In December, Kwon was finally handed over to U.S. officials.

Celestia’s recent Ginger upgrade has doubled its data throughput, while Render Network’s partnerships are redefining decentralized GPU rendering, fueling exciting advancements across blockchain. With Render price hovering at $7.68 and popular crypto coins like Celestia focusing on scalability, Web3Bay , a presale standout, offers a fresh take on e-commerce that deserves attention. Blending cryptocurrency and traditional payments, Web3Bay bridges Web2 simplicity with Web3 innovation. Its presale offers participants governance rights and exponential potential, with token prices structured to deliver returns exceeding 6,000%. As Web3Bay positions itself as the future of e-commerce, early adopters stand to benefit from a secure, decentralized marketplace designed for the modern era. Why Web3Bay Could Be 2025’s E-Commerce Revolution Did you know that Web3Bay has already raised over $470,000 in its presale, selling more than 127.6 million tokens? Currently priced at $0.0039675 in the latest stage, the presale is structured to reward early participants with exponential growth potential. With a carefully planned price progression across 28 stages, Web3Bay offers over 6,000% ROI potential for those joining early, putting it ahead of many popular crypto coins. What sets Web3Bay apart is its vision of merging the familiar convenience of Web2 payment systems, such as PayPal (planned for future integration), with the decentralized power of Web3. This dual approach is designed to make blockchain-based shopping accessible to a wider audience. Beyond payments, Web3Bay aims to empower its community by granting 3BAY token holders governance rights in a decentralized marketplace—something traditional platforms can’t offer. Early adopters are not just securing tokens but also becoming stakeholders in what could redefine e-commerce. The presale’s unique structure and the platform’s roadmap, including decentralized storage and NFT integration, make Web3Bay an exciting opportunity in 2025’s blockchain landscape. For those looking to diversify their crypto holdings and tap into the future of decentralized commerce, Web3Bay stands as a strong contender among popular crypto coins. The question is: will you act before the presale stages move on? Render Price Trends: What’s Powering RNDR’s Growth? Render price currently sits at $7.68, reflecting its growing role in decentralized GPU rendering. Recent partnerships with Stability AI, OTOY, and Endeavor highlight Render Network’s vision of enabling next-gen AI models through blockchain-based computational power. Its transition from Ethereum to Solana has also improved efficiency and reduced transaction costs, further strengthening its appeal. With over 40 million frames rendered and a user base exceeding 200,000, the platform’s growth signals its potential as a key player in decentralized content creation. Community-approved upgrades are driving Render Network forward. Proposals like RNP-016, which improves node operator reliability, and RNP-017, which streamlines governance, reflect its focus on scalability and usability. As Render’s price gains traction, these innovations ensure its continued relevance in GPU rendering, keeping RNDR among the most exciting developments in blockchain technology for 2025. Celestia Upgrade: Driving Scalability and Growth for TIA The latest Celestia upgrade, known as the Ginger upgrade, has doubled the platform’s data throughput by reducing block times from 12 to 6 seconds. This enhancement positions Celestia as a leader in modular blockchain scalability, allowing developers to build custom chains with ease. Currently, TIA, its native token, is trading at $5.16, with a 24-hour volume of $207 million. This growth reflects rising interest in the platform’s innovative architecture, which decouples consensus from execution layers for increased efficiency. Beyond the Celestia upgrade, the project’s roadmap includes plans to scale block sizes to 1GB, supported by $100 million in funding secured last year. Features like enhanced data availability sampling and cross-chain compatibility make it a standout choice for developers. As TIA gains traction, Celestia continues to solidify its role in the blockchain space, offering unparalleled flexibility and performance. Summing Up With Render price at $7.68 and Celestia’s Ginger upgrade doubling its data throughput, both platforms continue to push boundaries in their respective niches. TIA’s current price of $5.16 and Render Network’s Solana migration reflect strong growth potential and innovation in blockchain technology. Web3Bay stands out as a transformative project in decentralized e-commerce. With its presale already raising over $470,000 and 3BAY tokens priced at $0.0039675, early participants can secure governance rights and benefit from potential returns exceeding 6,000%. As blockchain solutions seek to redefine their industries, Web3Bay’s focus on bridging Web2 and Web3 shopping experiences positions it as a compelling opportunity for 2025.

This activity underlines Toncoin’s escalating relevance in the crypto space. In parallel, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem has broadened with the debut of its NFT-centric Lap Dogs racing game, which underscores its commitment to immersive blockchain gaming and metaverse advancements. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) has introduced a Refer & Earn USDT system, positioning it as a prime candidate for the best long-term crypto opportunity. This program offers the uncapped earning potential, complementing its successful presale that has amassed over $176.5 million. BlockDAG’s strategy suggests considerable upside, making it attractive to both novices and veteran traders. Toncoin Whale Activity Surges to $8.75 Billion Toncoin whale activity has marked a substantial rise, with transaction volumes ballooning by 80% to reach $8.75 billion recently. This spike suggests that significant investors are actively accumulating or redistributing Toncoin, likely as a strategic move. Moreover, a 300% increase in the net flow of major holders over the past week further accentuates this dynamic. Throughout 2024, The Open Network (TON) has gained traction, witnessing significant growth in wallet creations and user engagement despite broader market volatility. The Toncoin whale activity serves as a testament to its growing market presence, with investors keenly observing for potential long-term benefits or strategic shifts. SHIB Ecosystem Unveils NFT Lap Dogs Racing Game The Shiba Inu ecosystem has launched Lap Dogs, a racing game that integrates Sheboshis and Shiboshis NFTs, pivotal to its gameplay. These digital characters offer unique attributes and customization options, enhancing player interaction. As a facet of the Shib Metaverse, Lap Dogs is set to redefine player engagement with NFTs. Recent advancements in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, like activating the Shibarium Metaverse land map and integrating Chainlink’s CCIP for enhanced multi-chain functionality, fortify its standing in blockchain gaming and metaverse development. While NFT integration continues to evolve, the expansion through Lap Dogs emphasizes Shiba Inu’s dedication to offering a dynamic and engaging platform for its community. BlockDAG’s Refer & Earn: Prime for Long-Term Gains! BlockDAG has enhanced its presale approach by launching a new Refer & Earn USDT system, providing significant cashback incentives to its buyers. Initially, participants receive a 6% cashback on purchases made through referrals, which increases to 10% for any additional transactions made within the same 24-hour period. Additionally, a steady 6% cashback is applied universally on all other purchases. This innovative referral system delivers instant USDT rewards without any restrictions on earnings, positioning it as highly rewarding within the marketplace. With over $176.5 million already raised and 17.7 billion BDAG coins distributed at a cost-effective price of $0.0248 per coin, the success of this presale highlights BlockDAG’s rapid growth and the strong potential for future gains. Having already provided early adopters with returns of 2,380%, BlockDAG is on a path that could see it exceed $600 million in funding—a testament to its reliability and potential for expansion. Looking ahead, BlockDAG combines affordability with community-centric rewards and scalability. These attributes, along with the attractive benefits of the referral program, make BlockDAG one of the best long-term crypto coins , offering significant opportunities for growth and continuous benefits. Market Dynamics: High Stakes in Long-Term Crypto As the first quarter unfolds, the crypto market reveals varied developments, from the surge in Toncoin whale activity to the expansion of the Shiba Inu ecosystem through its Lap Dogs NFT game. These events underscore the increasing importance of both established and nascent blockchain projects. Yet, BlockDAG’s pioneering Refer & Earn USDT system emerges as a key attraction for traders seeking lucrative rewards and the best long-term crypto opportunities. With immediate cashback of up to 10%, a robust $176.5 million presale, and a remarkable 2,380% ROI for early participants, BlockDAG is poised to lead in the evolution of enduring crypto projects. As its presale continues, BlockDAG remains the prime crypto opportunity to enrich a trader’s portfolio.

According to a new report by local news outlet Oost, an unnamed law student and professional soccer player from the Dutch city of Hegelo has been arrested and accused of defrauding investors and mishandling their funds. The report says that the man would invest money on behalf of his clients, who were his family, friends, fellow soccer players and others. However, he made risky crypto bets with their funds that went awry and he eventually ended up losing between $1.5 million and $4.5 million euros. The man was falsely known as a “crypto genius” by his peers who believed he had raked in massive profits from trading digital assets. After his financial mishap – in which he lost all of his own money as well – the man and his brother sent emails to their clients informing them of the loss. He then went into hiding after being harassed by a few of his victims, according to the report. The victims went on to hand over the evidence to police and after a months-long investigation, he was arrested and charged with fraud and embezzlement. He is further accused of taking on new clients despite his company being on the brink of collapse.

Data from Alphanomics shows that despite the accumulation of other tokens, they are still underperforming as attention shifted to the hottest trends. AI agent tokens are the best performers for the past 30 days of trading, marking the peak of a trend that only started at the end of 2024. The collection of AI agent tokens grew by 71.7% on average, driven by the top projects that gained the biggest share of attention. The sector lost around 5% of its valuation in the past 24 hours, though it retained its leading position. AI memes rallied by 44.4% in the past 30 days, retaining momentum from social media cults and their proximity to some of the AI agents. The pure AI narrative of utility and DePIN tokens expanded by 16.1% for the same time period. The third most active category of tokens was the Pump.fun ecosystem, gaining a total of 38% in the past month. Pump.fun tokens gained prominence for their organic origins, with some of the memes being selected for their wide adoption and lack of cabal ownership. Pump.fun is being used to launch AI agents, independent of other platforms like ELIZA or Virtuals Protocol, with most of the tokens having sufficient liquidity from their creators to move to Raydium. Those relatively new narratives diminished the hopes for a wide altcoin rally. The new narratives displaced a brief expansion for ‘ dinosaur coins ’ at the end of 2024. After that, the trend shifted to projects that could gain immediate social media appeal, while offering a functioning product. All of the three categories had outlier tokens, which drove the general trend. Most of the tokens in those categories remain risky and can quickly incur deep losses. Even experienced whales have posted losses while trying to snipe the most promising AI agents. There is also a crossover between ecosystems, where GRIFT and AVA give a boost to both Pump.fun and AI memes. AVA is also the hottest rising AI agent token, during a period of heightened competition. The AI space showed it can outperform in the short term, though the gains have been tested after Bitcoin (BTC) dipped under $94,000. With Ethereum (ETH) in the $3,200 range and Solana (SOL) under $200, the markets may break the 30-day trend. AI agents turn to the green AI agents retained a total valuation above $15B, with more than $2.4B in daily trading. The tokens of most agents are often shifting to the red, due to their low liquidity and profit-taking from early whales. However, AI tokens also proved resilient, often switching back to gains within hours. For Ethereum, the growth drive came from Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). The chain carried a wider selection of utility and task-specific AI agents. Solana, on the other hand, is more skewed toward personality agents, with AVA taking the lead. Solana AI agents shifted to the green, while competing for the biggest mindshare. | Source: Bubblescanner Solana AI agents aim for memetic appeal while building communities around their content and personalities. Agents like AI16Z and Eliza also have DeFi and utility features, while still focusing on their content and presentation. Base has already grown its own mix of utility and memetic agents. So far, only the top chains have built AI ecosystems, while BSC still has less than 20 agents. L2 chains like Arbitrum and Optimism are just starting out with the agentic trend. AI agents, however, are not simply displacing other projects and tokens. Just like the Web3, gaming, NFT, and other trends before that, older tokens provided the liquidity and infrastructure. The success of AI tokens hinges on the availability of DEX, lending, market makers, and an entire ecosystem capable of reacting quickly to new communities and trends. The AI agent space is yet to expand the real capabilities of agents, which currently focus on content and user engagement. For trading and on-chain activities, most of the tasks are still in the testing stage.

Speaking Wednesday in a Bloomberg Television interview , Gensler highlighted the ongoing lack of adequate disclosures and information digital asset firms provide to everyday investors. Gensler reflects on SEC tenure and shifts in crypto enforcement leadership Reflecting on his tenure, Gensler expressed pride in the SEC’s enforcement efforts in the crypto space, highlighting their steady consistency over the years. The former Goldman Sachs executive has been known for his aggressive enforcement actions against cryptocurrency entities. These efforts have targeted a wide spectrum, from fraudulent operators to major firms like Coinbase Global Inc. and proprietary trading firm DRW Holdings. Gensler announced in November his decision to step down as SEC chair on January 20, coinciding with President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to head the agency. Atkins anticipates adopting a more lenient approach toward the digital asset industry and reducing enforcement measures. In the interview, Gensler noted that his predecessor, Jay Clayton, initiated approximately 80 crypto-related enforcement cases during his leadership under the first Trump administration. Under Gensler, that number grew to about 100 cases. However, while Clayton’s focus centered on token issuers whose offerings were deemed securities, Gensler has prioritized enforcement against market intermediaries that bypass securities laws concerning registration and disclosure requirements. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC has experienced both victories and setbacks in court. Gensler has expressed skepticism toward the crypto industry Biden-appointed Gensler has vocally expressed skepticism toward crypto regulation. He came out forcefully against the FIT21 bill after it was passed in the House. The relationship between the crypto industry and Gensler has been contentious. The industry mostly views Gensler with skepticism and frustration. Many believe his strict enforcement approach and classifying most crypto assets as securities have stifled innovation and created legal uncertainty​. According to Gensler, crypto accounts for less than 1% of U.S. financial markets, yet it’s riddled with “scams.” I’ve never seen a field that is so wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals. Of these 10,000 to 15,000 projects, many of them will not survive. They’re like venture capital investments. They’re not going to survive. ~Gary Gensler Gensler expressed pride in their accomplishments but insisted there’s still work to be done.

Bullish Secures BaFin Licenses to Drive Expansion in Europe The approvals, granted on December 20, authorize Bullish DE to engage in crypto asset custody, proprietary trading, and principal brokerage. These licenses enable Bullish DE to expand its presence in Germany, capitalizing on the country’s increasing adoption of digital assets. We are proud to announce that #Bullish has secured licenses in Germany from BaFin, marking a significant step in strengthening our position within the EU. — Bullish (@Bullish) January 8, 2025 The new licenses were strategically obtained to align with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which took effect in December 2024. MiCA provides a unified regulatory framework for crypto businesses throughout the European Union, simplifying compliance processes across member states. Tom Farley, CEO of Bullish Group, said in a press statement , “Receiving BaFin’s approval underscores Bullish’s commitment to operating under the highest regulatory standards.” Bullish DE plans to focus on services designed for institutional and professional investors, leveraging its new licenses to enhance its offerings within the European market. In related developments, other companies have also secured BaFin approvals for their operations in Germany. On October 9, Frankfurt-based Tradias, the digital asset arm of Bankhaus Scheich, received a securities trading bank license .

Germany’s New Digital Finance Law Boosts Regulatory Framework for Crypto The BaFin approval for Bullish follows another key regulatory development: on December 18, the German Parliament (Bundestag) passed the Act on the Digitalization of Financial Markets (FinmadiG). This legislation aligns Germany with the European Commission’s Digital Finance Strategy and addresses critical areas such as crypto-assets, digital resilience, and money transfers. Germany's Bundestag passed the Act on the Digitalization of Financial Markets (FinmadiG) to align with upcoming EU crypto regulations, including MiCA. #MiCA #Germany #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/WWhadHLJPe — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 Rather than directly regulating crypto assets, the law strengthens oversight of companies in the digital finance space, focusing on exchanges and service providers. It seeks to prevent fraud and market manipulation, promoting transparency and accountability for a safer crypto environment. The FinmadiG law addresses three major EU regulations. The Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) , both effective December 30, 2024, establish a framework for crypto services across the EU and tighten regulations on fund transfer information to enhance transparency. The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) , which takes effect on January 17, 2025, strengthens cybersecurity requirements for financial institutions, including crypto providers.

The update, which will be rolled out in two phases, is scheduled for release during the first quarter of 2025. Kraken discussed Pectra’s impact on ETH holders, pointing out that it will enhance Ethereum’s scalability, UX (user experience), and security. With the Pectra split update, Ethereum will cater to a wide range of use cases and user needs, enabling Layer 2 solutions (L2s) to be more affordable and validators more flexible to manage. The preceding March 2024 Dencun update release introduced proto-danksharding to increase transaction speeds on the network. Derive’s Dawson projected that Ether could gain over 257% to hit $12K by the end of 2025 if Ethereum successfully implements the Pectra update. He added that a regulatory-friendly environment under Trump’s incoming administration could further support Ethereum’s growth. Dawson also believes that the growth of layer 2 solutions and enhanced interoperability could drive huge gains, especially for ETH holders. He, however, cautioned that Ether’s price could fall below $2K in a bearish case where spot ETH ETFs failed to attract institutional interest. Pectra is likely to make new Ether millionaires this year ⚙️ Phase 1 of Pectra is about to arrive! This update will include 19 fundamental EIPs and introduce key innovations like sponsored transactions, allowing others to cover fees for you. Additionally, it will enhance @ethereum 's scalability, efficiency, and usability 🙌 Check out… — Stakely (@Stakely_io) January 8, 2025 The Pectra update will bring huge changes, such as enhancing account abstraction, validator operations, and network performance. Pectra aims to improve experiences for Ethereum users and developers and set the stage for future scalability upgrades. The update is set to introduce 20 EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) that will address specific features and functionalities to streamline implementation. Pectra will be rolled out in two phases. The first phase (PectrA), comprising eight EIPs, is expected to be released during Q1 of 2025, while phase two (PectrB) will be available in 2026. Many elements in Pectra generate drawbacks at the code level, which could impact the network’s reliability, user trust, and ETH prices. The main feature of PectrA will allow users to find sponsors to cover their transaction costs, facilitating access to the network for those with low balances. EIP-7702 will eliminate the need to hold small ETH amounts to execute blockchain transactions. EIP-7251, on the other hand, will allow ETH stakers with 32 ETH or above to earn staking rewards. “This will make staking cheaper, leading more people to stake and thus decreasing staking rewards over time. For that reason, we’re extremely bullish about restaking. A lot of people will want to boost their staking rewards by also securing other networks.” -Gaia Regis, co-founder and CEO of Byzantine Key updates, such as increased validator stake limits and flexible staking withdrawals, will enhance network security and efficiency. Streamlined smart contract deployment will also be a crucial aspect of the Pectra update. Trump’s pro-crypto policies will be especially beneficial for ETH holders Saul Rejwan, managing partner at Masterkey, said that Ethereum and other major crypto sectors like DeFi and DePIN stood to benefit more from Trump’s presidency and a crypto-friendly U.S. SEC. He added that DeFi projects on Ethereum will thrive under Trump’s more favorable regulatory framework. Sectors like restaking needed a little regulatory push to attract institutional investors. Rejwan said he expected the new administration to lower barriers to entry and make it easier for early-stage crypto investors and resilient firms to innovate and thrive. Matt Houghan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, also expects Ethereum to boom in 2025 since the asset had three core things going for it. He pointed out that Ethereum sat at the center of the three biggest trends shaping crypto in 2025, including the rise of tokenization, stablecoins, and AI agents. Houghan asserted that Ethereum had dominant market share in the three areas. He said that ETH could break above its ATH of $4,878 to reach a new high of $7,000. According to Houghan, Washington’s new approach to crypto would unleash millions of entrepreneurs into crypto, and many of them would build apps on Ethereum and its L2s.

Per Busan Ilbo and Asia Kyungjae, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) said it would release more details after holding “discussions” with the Virtual Asset Committee.

(Source: MBCNEWS/YouTube/Screenshot) The FSC later responded by denying these reports , claiming that “nothing” had yet “been decided.” However, it now appears that the media reports were not as “groundless” as the FSC claimed. The regulator also said it wants to “protect” crypto “users,” and will help “improve” self-regulation in the sector. The FSC says it wants to “establish listing and delisting standards” for altcoins on domestic crypto exchanges. The body was speaking as crypto traders expressed growing fears of massive culls of meme coins and “kimchi coins” on domestic crypto exchange platforms. The FSC also said it wants to introduce new regulations to police the stablecoin sector. “There is a need to discuss how to create listing standards, what to do with stablecoins, and how to create rules of conduct for cryptoasset exchanges.

However, the media outlets noted that the FSC was largely “negative” on the matter of issuing Bitcoin spot ETF approvals. The Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo recently expressed a willingness to explore crypto ETF approval . In his New Year address, the Korea Financial Investment Association Chairman Seo Yu-seok spoke of turning the “digital asset market, including crypto ETFs,” into a “future growth engine.” “I will push for the legalization of token securities and cryptoasset ETFs to ensure that the digital asset market can become a driving force for the future growth of our capital market.” Korea Financial Investment Association Chairman Seo Yu-seok But FSC Director Kwon Dae-young said crypto ETF approval would be “a step too far.” He said that the government was “fully aware that changes are taking place globally.” North Korea released footage of the largest Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile launch into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan https://t.co/MLnxvj60OV pic.twitter.com/YD2J529cnO — Reuters (@Reuters) March 17, 2023 More Discussions Planned Seoul is currently “discussing the matter” with the Virtual Asset Committee, Kwon said.

This addition enables users to trade RLUSD on the platform together with other primary pairs, including USD, EUR, BTC, ETH, XRP, and USDT. The exchange added support for RLUSD on the Ethereum network, giving users a stable digital currency fully backed by the asset. RLUSD is intended to cater to both retail and institutional investors and offer a safe and efficient method of undertaking transactions in digital assets. RLUSD is denominated in US dollars and cash equivalents and is stable in liquidity. Additionally, Its compliance with certain legal procedures like the New York Trust Charter issuance is ideal for many financial users. RLUSD’s enterprise-grade features Ripple designed RLUSD for enterprise-grade applications. The stablecoin is intended for payments, tokenization, and DeFi, giving companies a reliable, blockchain-based means of conducting their operations. Leveraging Ripple’s experience in blockchain, RLUSD can be considered a reliable option for companies that want to use digital assets in traditional financial markets. Since the stablecoin is already integrated with the Ethereum network, it can be used in DeFi projects such as liquidity pools and decentralized exchanges. RLUSD availability has also been growing rapidly with Ripple’s efforts. As Cryptopolitan reported , Monica Long, the president of Ripple, stated that the company would soon announce more exchange listings. At the time of writing, RLUSD can be traded on the Archax, B2C2, Bitso, and Uphold exchanges, with future listings planned for Flowdesk and Zero Hash. Also, Ripple has partnered with Chainlink to make RLUSD available to the DeFi community. The collaboration was revealed on 7th January and will see Chainlink’s decentralized RLUSD price feeds integrated into the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. This partnership will help strengthen RLUSD within the DeFi ecosystem through the use of accurate and timely market data. This will be to increase reliability and address the issues of price manipulation and outages. RLUSD impressive growth The market adoption of RLUSD has picked up significantly, with more than 76% of the trading volume being recorded on a Bullish exchange, especially in the RLUSD/USDC and XRP/RLUSD pairs. At the same time, decentralized exchange Sologenic has a smaller share. The XRP/RLUSD pair on the platform has a 24-hour trading volume of $3.4 million, which is equal to 3.56%.

According to the analyst, a successful breakout of this bullish flag could result in a massive 50% price gain for XRP, bringing the cryptocurrency closer to its previous all-time high of $3.84, recorded during the 2021 bull run. XRP Price Targets $3.6 After Bullish Flag Breakout Over the past few weeks, the XRP price has formed a bullish flag pattern, indicating a potential for continued upward movement. According to crypto analyst Captain Faibik’s shared chart on X (formerly Twitter), XRP is preparing to break out of this bullish flag on the daily time frame chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk Of Supply Shock As ETF Issues Buy More BTC Than Was Produced In December A bullish flag is widely recognized as a continuation pattern. It forms when a cryptocurrency’s price is trading sideways or undergoing a correction and indicates the potential for a strong upward movement. On the analyst’s chart, XRP is testing the upper boundary of the bullish flag pattern, aiming to break above it and trigger its next price rally. Captain Faibik has predicted that if XRP successfully breaks out of this bullish flag and maintains a price above it, it could spark an impressive 50.22% rally. Currently trading at $2.2, If XRP can rally as much as 50% following its bullish flag breakout, its market price could jump significantly to $3.3. This projected target is just 16.36% away from breaching XRP’s $3.84 ATH, achieved during the previous bull run in 2021. Further solidifying his confidence in XRP’s future price trajectory, Captain Faibik’s recent prediction doubles down on former projections in earlier X posts, where the analyst forecasts a massive price increase to $3.66 for XRP. Elliott Waves To Push XRP Above $20 In another X post, a prominent crypto analyst identified as the “CryptoBull” predicted that the XRP price could soar above $20 later in this bull cycle. However, the analyst also projects that the cryptocurrency could reach a short-term target of $13 within the next few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000, What It Means For The Bull Market CryptoBull has based his optimistic XRP price projections on Elliott impulse waves, highlighting their impact on the cryptocurrency’s historical price movements. The analyst disclosed that Elliott impulse waves typically begin after a cryptocurrency experiences a significant price breakout. He further explained that in 2017, the five waves of the Elliott impulse wave cycle had triggered a price surge from $0.002 to $3.84, representing a staggering 70,000% increase. Based on this historical trend, CryptoBull projects that XRP could witness a similar bull rally. He forecasts that the five Elliott impulse waves could spark a 6,000% increase in the XRP price during this bull cycle, pushing it to new ATHs of $26.

This bill seeks to allow citizens to escape the existing financial systems as prices continue to soar. The bill, filed for the 60th legislative session on February 3, aims to let Oklahomans get paid in Bitcoin and accept it as a form of payment. He noted that Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency with a limited supply, which can enable Oklahomans to save their earnings and investments. “As Bitcoin continues to rise and the value of the dollar continues to be printed away in Washington, D.C., Oklahoma must act to protect our people.” Senator Deever Voluntary participation for businesses and workers SB325 emphasizes that using Bitcoin payment options will be completely optional for both employers and employees. The proposal allows business entities and employees to choose the payment they prefer. According to Senator Deevers, Bitcoin is establishing itself as an important part of the traditional financial system. He mentioned that former President Donald Trump endorsed Bitcoin during his campaign and at different conferences. “Bitcoin has arrived into the mainstream of our economy, and it’s an essential part of the financial future,” he said. Oklahoma, through SB325, is trying to position itself as one of the early adaptors of financial technology, benefiting its citizens. The legislation will be considered during the state’s legislative session starting on February 3. He noted, “ This legislation puts Oklahoma in a leadership role nationally, ensuring our state embraces the future of financial technology .” Cryptocurrency adoption across the U.S. Oklahoma’s proposed Bitcoin initiative is in line with other US cities and states that have integrated cryptocurrencies into public service delivery. In November 2024, Detroit said it would become the largest city in the United States to accept cryptocurrency payments for taxes starting in 2025. PayPal will oversee the conversion of the cryptocurrencies to US dollars before the money is deposited into city accounts. In September 2024, Louisiana was the first state to accept cryptocurrency for government services. The supported cryptocurrencies were Bitcoin, Bitcoin Lightning, and USD Coin. The State of Louisiana’s Department of Wildlife and Fisheries received the first cryptocurrency payment on September 17, 2024. In addition, in a post on X, Dennis Porter, co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, disclosed that the 14th state is gearing up to bring legislation for the creation of a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.’ This is after similar attempts in 13 states. This growth shows an increasing interest of U.S. states in adopting Bitcoin as a part of the future economy.

Now in consolidation, the market might face a potential breakout if ongoing acquisition from BTC whales translates into a short-term price rally. Bitcoin Whales Taking Advantage of Correction According to CryptoQuant data , large buying activity has resumed onchain after what it termed the biggest selloff of 2024. As reported earlier by Coingape, the BTC price fell suddenly after the US jobs and ISM Services Prices PMI came in strong. Despite this macro data, which indicated no rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, traders stayed cautious. Today, the Bitcoin price traded from a high of $97,258.32 to as low as $92,525.84. Noting the price outlook, CryptoQuant Analyst Cauê Oliveira said market whales waited patiently to accumulate just below the $95,000 level. After the biggest dump of 2024, whales are accumulating Bitcoin again “However, large players took advantage of the consolidation to open TWAP positions, patiently accumulating just below US$ 95K.” – By @caueconomy Full post https://t.co/yGOkuW0zo7 pic.twitter.com/9lqlHoWa4O — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 8, 2025 In his detailed analysis, Oliveira said that institutional investors dumped around 79,000 BTC over a week. This action triggered a 15% correction that the market is still not free from. He pointed out that large whales took advantage of the situation to open “TWAP Position” over the past 30 days. Institutional Investors Shielding the Market Per the CryptoQuant analyst, Bitcoin whales have bought more than 30,000 BTC units over the past month. He confirmed that institutional investors are the primary source behind the buying pressure for the recovery of BTC. The analyst pointed out that the retail demand for BTC has remained at its highest level in five years. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales or institutional interest remains high overall. Most institutional buyers include firms like MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms. In a recent report, MicroStrategy bought $22 billion BTC in 2024. Following its purchases, the firm recorded a BTC yield of 74.3%. If related acquisitions continue, there are projections that it can help BTC print new highs in the mid-term. The Shift to a Third Force While institutional investors formed the Bitcoin whales caucus that pushed the coin’s price to an all-time high of $108,000 , nation states are predicted to join soon. After President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, conversations about a strategic Bitcoin reserve are growing. During his campaign, Trump pledged to set up such a reserve once he entered office, and the industry now expects him to fulfill his promises. If the US makes this move, market experts predict that other nations will follow. In the long run, the impact on Bitcoin price might be profound.

Kobeissi Letter speculated that spot ETFs, unlike futures-based ETFs, provide investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin . It also pointed out that since spot ETFs started trading, Bitcoin funds have attracted $44 billion in cumulative inflows. According to Glassnode, more Bitcoin futures contracts are cash-margined than crypto-margined, indicating they are pegged on the US dollar, not cryptocurrencies.

He suggested that active and direct market participants are driving the surge rather than speculation. Lunde pointed out that inflows from futures-based ETFs such as ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) were also minimal and could not have led to the surge. The analyst provided a breakdown of open interest by cohort on the CME, pointing out that active and direct participants held over 85,000 BTC. Lunde highlighted that this amount was equal to what was held in March 2024. However, he pointed out that the 1x leveraged ETF declined throughout 2024 and held 31,752 BTC. Lunde also added that the 2x leveraged ETF has only recorded slight growth since March, indicating that leverage is no longer a growth catalyst in the current market. Bitcoin outperforms all other assets in 2024 According to Coinmarketcap, Bitcoin recorded an over 120% surge in 2024 amid developments in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Kobeissi Letter commented that BTC outperformed all other asset classes in 2024. Bloomberg also reported that BTC outperformed assets such as Cocoa, global equities, and gold in the past year. Coinmarketcap reported that in mid-December, BTC recorded an all-time high of $108,315 following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory. The surge was reportedly fueled by investor optimism since the presidential candidate had signaled that he would implement crypto-friendly policies once he assumed office. However, the price of digital assets eased after the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, announced that rate cuts would roll out slower than anticipated. The digital asset has since maintained its set wall between $99,700 and $100,000. However, as of the time of writing, BTC traded at $94,099, a 2% decline in 24 hours. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin clearing the $99,000 mark could cause large-scale liquidations, leading to a surge in spot price. Despite the market optimism, market players such as Peter Hughes, founder of Evolve Investing, warned investors against the volatility risks presented by Bitcoin. QCP Capital, in its note to its clients, also expressed its belief that the catalyst may come after institutions readjust asset allocation.

The clarification, released on January 8, 2025, addresses inaccuracies in Backpack’s January 7 press release, which suggested its involvement in asset recovery for former FTX EU customers. FTX Highlights Inaccuracy in Backpack’s FTX EU Acquisition Statements In a recent press release , FTX addressed statements made by Backpack entities regarding its purported acquisition of FTX EU. FTX stated that the January 7, 2025, Backpack announcement was made without FTX’s knowledge or involvement. According to the exchange, Backpack’s press release contain multiple inaccuracies that could mislead stakeholders. FTX emphasized that 100% of FTX EU share capital is still owned by FTX Europe AG, a subsidiary of FTX. While there was an earlier agreement to sell FTX EU to former insiders of FTX Europe as part of a settlement, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court overseeing the Chapter 11 process has not approved any transfer. The defunct exchange also confirmed that it was unaware of any indirect sale of FTX EU shares to Backpack before this week. Bankruptcy Court and Asset Recovery Process In addition, the defunct exchange clarified that Backpack has no role in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court-approved process for returning funds to creditors, including FTX EU’s former customers. The company reiterated that only FTX EU holds responsibility for determining and returning funds owed to its customers. The court’s Chapter 11 plan does not authorize the organization to make distributions to any creditors or former customers. The defunct exchange further stated that the amounts owed by FTX EU to its customers would be assessed solely by FTX EU following its sale, not by the exchange or the Bankruptcy Court. Therefore, the exchange disclaimed Backpack’s liability for repayments of EU customer funds. Furthermore, the defunct exchange expressed concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the information presented in Backpack’s materials. The report urged stakeholders to rely only on official FTX communications. Initial Distributions Under Bankruptcy Plan The defunct exchange also provided an update on its U.S. Bankruptcy Court-approved Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. The defunct exchange plan became effective on January 3, 2025, with the initial distribution record date set for the same day. Distributions to convenience class claimants are expected within 60 days, subject to regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, the exchange reaffirmed its commitment to adhering to the court’s processes and ensuring accurate communication with creditors. These developments come in light of recent media speculation that US President Joe Biden might pardon Sam Bankman-Fried , the founder of the defunct FTX Exchange. Biden’s recent pardon of his son has sparked further rumors that SBF could get the same treatment.

Leading coins like Ethereum, Ripple, and Chainlink hold significant positions in the market, while innovative newcomers like BlockDAG are redefining blockchain technology. Each coin presents unique advantages. For those aiming to enhance returns, this guide shines a spotlight on the top crypto gainers for 2025. From Chainlink’s infrastructure capabilities to BlockDAG’s growth prospects, these coins offer both potential and proven results in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): High Potential for Returns & Expanding Ecosystem BlockDAG (BDAG) has quickly become a significant player in the cryptocurrency sector, with a fundraising total of over $176.5 million and more than 17.7 billion coins distributed. With a current price of $0.0248 in presale batch 27, early supporters of BDAG have seen a 2380% surge in value, presenting a lucrative opportunity for those looking to maximize their gains. The network also features the BDAG400 bonus ending on 8th January, offering a 250% bonus for early purchases, alongside the Refer & Earn USDT program, which provides instant USDT cashback for both the referrer and buyer. This incentivized approach fosters broad participation and underscores BlockDAG’s commitment to its community. Leveraging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, BlockDAG achieves unprecedented scalability and decentralization. The roadmap includes a mainnet launch in 2025 and plans for listing on major exchanges, which will open up further liquidity and growth opportunities for participants. Analysts predict a possible increase in BDAG’s price to $1 this year, a potential 4,200% return for those joining before the current batch closes. These factors position BlockDAG at the forefront of our list of top crypto gainers , merging cutting-edge technology with immediate incentives. 2. Ethereum (ETH): The Pillar of DeFi Ethereum has transformed blockchain with its pioneering smart contracts, which are foundational to decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT markets. As the second most significant cryptocurrency, Ethereum is favored by developers and traders for its stability and potential for growth. However, challenges like scalability issues and high transaction fees have led some users to look for alternatives. Ethereum 2.0 aims to resolve these issues, though it has experienced delays. Still, Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem and its dominance in DeFi ensure it remains a critical asset in the cryptocurrency space. With a current price of $3,441, Ethereum is undeniably one of the top crypto gainers for 2025. 3. Ripple (XRP): Facilitator of Global Transactions Ripple has transformed cross-border payments by offering fast and economical transaction solutions. XRP’s effectiveness has drawn global financial institutions, placing it as a frontrunner in fintech. A recent legal triumph over the SEC has increased confidence, likely leading to expanded adoption. Although Ripple’s centralized model might draw some criticism, XRP’s practicality in improving international payments positions it as a preferred option among institutional traders. With a current price of $2.44 and innovative technology, XRP remains one of the top crypto gainers , especially for those interested in fintech advancements. 4. Chainlink (LINK): Decentralized Oracle Solutions Chainlink is essential for projects that require reliable oracles to link smart contracts with real-world data. Its decentralized network is crucial for DeFi applications, ensuring data accuracy and trust within blockchain operations. While its growth may be moderated by its dependency on smart contract adoption, Chainlink’s role in supporting blockchain infrastructure is vital. Continued innovations, such as hybrid smart contracts, enhance its utility and market position. Chainlink is projected to reach new all-time highs this year, solidifying its status among the top crypto gainers and as a vital component in the expansion of blockchain ecosystems. Choosing the Right Crypto for ROI Gains in 2025 Each of these cryptocurrencies offers distinct advantages. Ethereum appeals to those seeking a robust and tested ecosystem, while Ripple suits fintech enthusiasts with its efficiency in cross-border transactions. Chainlink caters to developers focused on infrastructure. BlockDAG, notable for its scalability, community incentives, and potential for a 4,200% return this year, is the most adaptable choice among the top crypto gainers . Combining immediate rewards with long-term growth potential, it stands out as the optimal choice for maximizing ROI. Investors should align their selections with their goals to fully capitalize on the opportunities best suited to their strategies.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 110,100 followers on the social media platform X that XRP may be gearing up for a new leg up based on its SuperTrend indicator. The SuperTrend indicator is a technical analysis tool that aims to identify potential entry and exit points based on an asset’s trend. Says Martinez, “The last time the SuperTrend indicator flipped bullish on the 12-hour chart, XRP went up 470%… It just flipped bullish again.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.28. Turning to Cardano, the trader thinks that ADA looks poised for a big rally after breaking out from a bullish continuation pattern on the daily chart. “Cardano ADA is breaking out of a bull pennant, targeting $3!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ADA is worth $0.99. Next up is the top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), which the trader says is being gobbled up by deep-pocketed investors. “Whales bought 140 million Dogecoin DOGE in [24 hours]!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez also notes that traders are currently bearish on Dogecoin, suggesting that the meme token may be primed to go against the crowd. “Dogecoin DOGE weighted social sentiment is at -0.60, which means the crowd remains very pessimistic about its upside potential. This might be a good time to be a contrarian!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.35.

Binance Founder Downplays Bitcoin $100K Milestone With A Bold Remark,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/boring-binance-founder-downplays-bitcoin-100k-milestone-with-a-bold-remark/,"A former executive of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange expects that Bitcoin could soar higher than the $100,000 level. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao believes that the firstborn cryptocurrency is capable of hitting a higher price point, following its brief recovery to $100,000 on Tuesday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges Below $100K Despite Positive Coinbase Premium Signal – What’s Next? A “Boring” Level? Bitcoin embraced the new year on a positive note as the crypto recorded a recovery that catapulted it to reach the $100,000 mark. Zhao, who is also the founder of Binance, suggested that the top crypto asset can do better and surpass the $100k price point. “100k is boring, right?” Zhao said in a post, responding to Bitcoin recovery. Investors have seen Bitcoin reclaim its lost glory after hitting $100,000 after the digital asset slid down the key level on December 19, staying below $100,000 for quite some time before gaining momentum to propel it to this milestone level. 100k is boring, right? — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 7, 2025 Bitcoin Destined To Reach New Heights Zhao, popularly known as CZ, asserted that Bitcoin is far more capable of reaching a price point beyond $100k. Hence, the former crypto firm executive was not surprised with BTC making a comeback and surging in the last 24 hours. The ex-Binance CEO’s post on X sparked excitement among members of the cryptocurrency community as Zhao’s post suggests that BTC prices could go up. Last month, Bitwise executive Matt Hougan predicted that the bullish run for cryptocurrency would still gain momentum until 2025. Hougan expects that other top crypto assets would soar in price such with Bitcoin leading the charge. Hougan believes that BTC could reach as high as $200,000 before the end of 2025, claiming that inflows from the Bitcoin ETFs could fuel the demand from corporate entities. This, as a result, would increase their exposure to the premier crypto asset. Related Reading: Less Than 1% Of Bitcoin Investors In Loss After BTC Reclaims $100,000 Positive Sentiment Continues Zhao has a positive outlook for cryptocurrencies, saying that 2025 would be a “send it’ year” for digital assets.

If you ever wondered why people tweet 4, it came from this tweet 2 years ago today. In hindsight, should’ve made “4” the “0”th point. 😂 2025 will be a “send it” year. https://t.co/6f27u0mYez — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 3, 2025 Other market analysts agree that digital assets would experience a surge in their prices in 2025, which would be driven by crypto adoption from institutional investors and national governments. Although the former Binance CEO believes in Bitcoin moving past $100,000, Zhao did not provide a price prediction for the year. However, there were occasions that Zhao hinted that Bitcoin could be traded at $850,000 per coin.

The add-on incorporates third-party functionality within the web browser interface. While alerting the users, the exchange said that they hadn’t released any Firefox browser extensions and called on users who might have mistakenly downloaded the add-on to move any funds or digital assets in wallets connected to the malicious extension. OKX further contacted Firefox to remove the applications before they harm users. OKX also further advised users to avoid downloading OKX-specific software from third parties. Fraudulent browser plugins have been used to access sensitive data and often steal funds. Crypto criminals use the technique, also known as a phishing scam, to steal cryptocurrency. Certik reports that phishing was among the leading crypto scams in 2024. Cybercriminals are executing vicious phishing scams CertiK published Hack3d: The Web3 Security Report 2024, highlighting the most notorious cyber security threats to cryptocurrency in 2024. The report states that crypto investors lost over $1 billion in 296 phishing scams in 2024, accounting for a 21% YoY rise from 2023. In September 2024, McAfee discovered malware known as SpyAgent on Android phones. The malware appeared like a legitimate Android application but was a scam that had affected over 280 fraudulent applications. Using optical character recognition (OCR), SpyAgent scans images stored on Android’s memory and steals sensitive information, including cryptocurrency passcodes stored in the images. The researchers at McAfee also noted that the malware replicated through text message links easily lured users to download the fraudulent app. This approach made it easiest for scammers to bypass the security features on Google’s app store. Decentraland September X breach saw users scammed by phishing links On September 19, 2024, Decentraland lost control of its X social media page. Hackers compromised the 3D virtual reality metaverse on the Ethereum network. Cybercriminals use the platform to promote phishing links to followers. They advertised a fake MANA airdrop, which lured users to click the links. Anyone who clicked the link and connected their wallets saw their funds drained by the malware. There has been no reports of exact figures stating how many people lost their funds to the fake OKX malware as of this writing.

With recent movements across major cryptocurrencies, the focus is gradually shifting towards emerging platforms offering innovative solutions. Polkadot’s steady performance, coupled with SUI’s notable collaborations, has kept investors intrigued. But if one name creates ripples in the space, it’s Qubetics ($TICS). The platform’s presale phase is turning heads for the impressive numbers and the technology backing it. This article will cover the developments and updates of Qubetics, Polkadot, and SUI—three cryptos making waves as 2025 kicks off. How Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE Secures Its Spot Among the Best Cryptos to Invest in January 2025 Blockchain development often feels like navigating a maze of complex code and intricate systems. Qubetics ($TICS) disrupts this pattern with its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, designed to simplify blockchain application creation. What makes QubeQode IDE unique? Imagine crafting blockchain applications by simply dragging and dropping components. Need token management or user authentication? It’s all pre-built and ready to integrate seamlessly. Even for those without extensive coding experience, QubeQode’s form-based configuration allows users to set application logic through intuitive forms. For more advanced developers, the IDE includes a comprehensive code snippet library. This treasure trove of pre-written code covers common blockchain tasks, expediting development time and minimising errors. AI plays a crucial role here, too. Qubetics leverages AI to assist in smart contract generation, providing secure and efficient code based on user input. Code completion, error detection, and application optimisation further streamline the development process, making it accessible yet powerful. Adding to the buzz, Qubetics recently held its third AMA session , addressing community questions and hinting at innovations. For those on the lookout for the best cryptos to invest in January 2025, Qubetics is drawing serious attention. Polkadot – A Resilient Player in the Crypto Market Polkadot (DOT) has had its fair share of ups and downs. Initially sold at $0.29 during its ICO in October 2017, the project faced challenges post-launch. However, 2021 marked a turning point, with Polkadot reaching an all-time high of $55 in November. Fast forward to 2024, and DOT hit a peak of $11.8, although it currently trades at $7.71 in 2025. While not at its previous heights, Polkadot remains a solid contender in the blockchain ecosystem, driven by its interoperability features and continuous development. SUI – A Star in Blockchain Innovation SUI’s growth trajectory highlights its scalability and commitment to developer-friendly solutions. Partnering with industry giants like Franklin Templeton, Router Chain, and Google Cloud through ZettaBlock, SUI stands out in real-time data access and dApp development. Despite a brief downtime in November 2024, SUI’s Global Accelerator Program continues to drive ecosystem growth by providing funding and expertise. Trading at $4.25, SUI’s expanding market presence makes it an appealing investment. Qubetics Presale Surges – Making a Strong Case as One of the Best Cryptos to Invest in January 2025 The Qubetics presale isn’t just another token sale—it’s an event attracting thousands. Currently, in Phase 16, the presale offers a unique structure. Each week, the price increases by 10%, culminating in a 20% surge during the final phase. This mechanism fuels anticipation, with investors eager to lock in the current rate of $0.045 per token. To date, Qubetics has raised over $9 million, boasting 13,700+ holders and 407 million tokens sold. Let’s break it down: a $500 investment today would secure around 10,972.14 $TICS tokens. Should the token hit $10, that same investment would be worth approximately $109,721.36—an ROI of over 21,844%. And if $TICS climbs to $15? We’re looking at a potential value of $164,582.03, translating to an ROI exceeding 32,800%. With numbers like these, it’s no surprise analysts are eyeing Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to invest in January 2025 . Conclusion Diversification remains key. Polkadot and SUI present strong cases for long-term growth, but the spotlight is undoubtedly on Qubetics. With its innovative QubeQode IDE and impressive presale figures, Qubetics positions itself as a frontrunner for those seeking the best cryptos to invest in January 2025. The potential returns are significant, and as each presale phase pushes prices higher, now might be the perfect moment to secure $TICS tokens. Qubetics isn’t just another project—it’s shaping up to be a game-changer in blockchain development.

With outgoing CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam set to step down on inauguration day, the new appointee is expected to play a crucial role in shaping the regulatory framework for the growing digital asset market in the United States. CFTC Chair Candidates Interviewed by Trump Admin According to Fox Business , a number of candidates have been reportedly met with by Trump’s transition team for the CFTC chair position with at least six individuals in the running for the post. Current frontrunners for the CFTC position include Summer Mersinger, the CFTC Commissioner, and Brian Quintenz, the current head of crypto policy at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The two candidates are familiar with cryptocurrencies and have some experience in the regulation of the industry. Quintenz has experience in the development of crypto regulations as he served at the CFTC and worked with the former chair Chris Giancarlo to issue clearance for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. The fact that he is connected to Andreessen Horowitz is beneficial because its founder Marc Andreessen is one of Trump’s leading advisors on crypto and AI. Mersinger, who is a sitting commissioner at the CFTC, is also an influential policy maker in Washington D.C. She has been a champion for innovation while standing for the rights of consumers within the cryptocurrency industry. She has been applauded by the industry participants for her dissents on enforcement actions against decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. A Shift in Crypto Regulation Under Trump’s Administration The CFTC chair pick is particularly significant due to Donald Trump’s aspiration to make the US the leading country in cryptocurrency innovation. The current outgoing Biden administration, with the SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler , has adopted a more enforcement-oriented approach to crypto regulation. This approach upset the crypto industry that said that such an approach creates ambiguities and drives businesses away to other countries. On the other hand, President elect Donald Trump has indicated that he will pursue a less hostile approach to regulation. While on the campaign trail, he was endorsed by many crypto executives and vowed to reverse what he and others saw as excessive regulation. There are already appointments to key roles of crypto-supporters including Paul Atkins to be the head of the SEC and Scott Bessent as the head of Treasury. Therefore, the appointment of a CFTC Chair that is favorable to crypto would only strengthen this agenda. Mersinger and Quintenz have also been vocal about their disapproval of the current ‘regulation by enforcement’ regime. They have urged the CFTC to assume the mantle of leading regulator of digital assets, claiming that the agency is in a better position to promote innovation than the SEC. Outgoing CFTC Chair Behnam’s Final Push for Crypto Legislation Outgoing chairman of the CFTC, Rostin Behnam has emphasized the importance of the comprehensive regulation of cryptocurrencies before his exit. Speaking at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday for the last time, Behnam pointed out that the absence of a specific set of rules has left certain issues that require the attention of Congress. Behnam said, “My position remains the same, and I will support the CFTC to address this gap if Congress wishes it to do so even after I am no longer part of the Commission.” He also said that new laws could take from six to ten months, with agency rulemaking taking one more year. While serving at the CFTC, the commission brought enforcement action s against several crypto companies, including the defunct exchange FTX and Gemini Trust. Nevertheless, Behnam pointed out that the current legal framework is inadequate to deal with the issues emerging from digital assets and called on the legislators to focus on the development of dedicated crypto laws.

Partnerships with industry leaders have boosted its market visibility, while Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 has contributed to its positive momentum. Meanwhile, Raydium’s trading volume surged 60% in a week, reaching $16.58 billion. This activity, fueled by Solana-based meme coins, drove the RAY token’s price to $5.6, a 50% increase from December 2024 lows. In addition, the Web3Bay (3BAY) token presale continues to attract attention, raising $470,000 and selling over 127.5M 3BAY tokens in record time. Its decentralized E-Commerce ecosystem integrates blockchain and traditional payment systems, offering a solid mix of security and scalability. As early adopters await a 6,430% ROI post-launch, Web3Bay is reshaping digital commerce through blockchain-driven advancements. Render Network Rallies 22% with Major Partnerships Render Network experienced a significant resurgence in early 2025, with a 22% price increase in January. This rebound follows a tough end to 2024, where Render crypto saw a significant dip, largely influenced by Bitcoin’s fluctuations. As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 mark, Render’s price has benefitted from its upward momentum, rising from $6.60 to $8.69. The key to this recovery has been Render Network’s strategic partnerships with major platforms like Dropbox, Blender, and Maxon Redshift. These collaborations have enhanced Render’s market visibility and bolstered investor confidence, contributing to a growing sentiment in Render’s network. Strong on-chain activity and increasing market optimism position Render Network for continued growth. Raydium’s Trading Volume Surge Fuels Bullish Momentum Raydium’s trading volume has surged, driving the price of the RAY token to new highs. The token saw a 50% increase from its lowest point in December, reaching $5.6, as Raydium’s trading volume jumped by 60% to $16.58 billion in the past seven days. This spike in Raydium’s trading volume comes due to a strong performance by Solana meme coins, which have dominated the market. Raydium has outperformed other popular decentralized exchange tokens, with its market cap rising to $1.3 billion. The increase in Raydium’s trading volume reflects growing investor confidence, as the platform solidifies its position as the second-largest player in the DEX space.

At the same time, the Polkadot ecosystem is prospering, marked by significant strides such as a $210 million treasury and enhanced interoperability between networks. Moreover, BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan is enhancing its international presence, crucial for boosting presale activity. This alliance has elevated its presale to over $176.5 million, making BlockDAG (BDAG) a prime candidate for the best crypto for 2025. BNB Bullish Sentiment Builds as Prices Stay Above $700 BNB’s bullish sentiment is intensifying as Binance Coin stabilizes around the crucial $700 mark. After breaking out of a downward channel, the cryptocurrency is testing previous resistance as support, hinting at potential bullish trends. An immediate resistance at $728 is an important barrier; overcoming it may lead to higher Fibonacci levels and a fresh upward surge. The BNB bullish sentiment is also highlighted by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which, despite showing market uncertainty, points towards a potential decisive upward trend. Staying above $700 suggests more potential for an upward trajectory, whereas failing to overcome resistance could lead to a reevaluation of lower support levels at $684 and $671, possibly extending the correction period. Polkadot Ecosystem Achieves $210 Million Treasury The Polkadot ecosystem has exhibited impressive growth in 2024, with its Treasury reaching a new high of $210 million, or about 31 million DOT. This fiscal milestone emphasizes the ecosystem’s robustness, bolstered by Polkadot’s inflation mechanism to regenerate resources. Additionally, the ecosystem has seen a 300% increase in parachain transactions, with Kusama hitting a peak of 140,000 transactions per second during the “Spammening” event in December. The network has also rolled out three trustless bridges—Snowbridge, Polkadot-Kusama, and Hyperbridge—that improve cross-chain connections. Despite a 20% decrease in DOT prices in 2024, these achievements highlight the network’s ongoing dedication to innovation and broader adoption. BlockDAG and Inter Milan: Pioneering Global Crypto Reach Through Soccer BlockDAG’s collaboration with Inter Milan represents a significant advancement in global crypto adoption by uniting modern blockchain technology with the dynamic domain of one of soccer’s greatest teams. With a vast fanbase worldwide, Inter Milan provides BlockDAG an exceptional stage to display its pioneering technology. Showcasing at the famed San Siro Stadium during games offers unparalleled exposure, positioning BlockDAG as a familiar name not just in the blockchain community but among a global sports-loving audience as well. More than just enhancing visibility, this partnership fosters deep connections. Through BlockDAG’s blockchain, Inter Milan supporters can enjoy exclusive digital collectibles, unique content, and special experiences that enhance their connection with the team. Engagements that involve players and bespoke fan experiences strengthen this bond further. By integrating blockchain with sports, BlockDAG demonstrates how technology can revolutionize fan involvement, creating a community that feels more engaged than ever. Moreover, this collaboration has significantly driven the growth of BlockDAG’s coin. During its presale, the coin’s value increased by 2380%, from $0.001 in the first presale batch to $0.0248 by the 27th batch, accumulating over $176.5 million. With more than 17.7 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s presale has become the largest on the market. This impressive growth, spurred by the partnership’s global visibility, establishes BlockDAG as a formidable contender for the best crypto for 2025 and cements its position in the blockchain sector. Key Insights & Future Crypto Leader The enduring BNB bullish sentiment signals its potential for further advancement as it remains stable above crucial price points, reinforcing its stature in the crypto market. The Polkadot ecosystem continues to demonstrate growth and innovation, with a treasury valued at $210 million and achievements in interoperability that encourage consistent adoption. However, BlockDAG is presenting the most compelling argument as the best crypto for 2025 . Its unprecedented presale success and a 2380% increase in coin value from the first batch underscore its robust momentum, while the Inter Milan partnership boosts its global profile. With the coin’s value escalating swiftly, those delaying their purchase might miss out on BlockDAG’s significant expansion.

Solana (SOL) is on the rise, with analysts predicting it could hit $250 soon. Kaspa (KAS), known for its high-speed transactions, is also gaining traction with a target of $0.5. Meanwhile, a new player is set to dominate the presale market – Lightchain AI . Currently priced at $0.004875 in its presale, Lightchain AI has raised over $8.5 million and is emerging as a top contender for significant growth. Unlike Solana and Kaspa, which focus on blockchain speed and scalability, Lightchain AI combines blockchain with artificial intelligence, paving the way for widespread adoption and long-term success. Solana’s Incredible Rise and Path to $250 Solana has been a big part of the blockchain world, famous for its quick deal speeds and cheap costs. After going through some highs and lows last year, Solana is ͏back on path, with experts saying it might hit $250 soon because of rising interest from big companies and use in the DeFi and NFT areas. Solana’s wins are mostly due to its smart Proof of History way, which helps it grow fast without giving up its decentralization. Even with its clear future, Solana still runs into rivals from other blockchains. While it’s set for rise, its need on network crowding and deal holdups in times of high want might be a thing that holds back its chance to keep steady work over time. Kaspa’s Target of $0.5 Speed and Scalability in a Competitive Market Kaspa, a highly scalable Layer 1 blockchain, has been gaining traction due to its high throughput capabilities. With a target price of $0.5, Kaspa aims to provide instantaneous block confirmation through its blockDAG technology, enabling faster transactions compared to traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, despite its scalability, Kaspa still faces the challenge of wider adoption. Its technology is relatively new, and although speed is its key selling point, it will need a more robust use case and developer ecosystem to compete with other established platforms in the space. Nevertheless, Kaspa’s high-speed transactions and low fees make it an attractive option for developers and users seeking blockchain efficiency.

38710391,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=672450,1736391638,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Solana Must Reclaim Momentum In The Coming Weeks – SOL/BTC Ratio At A Pivotal Point,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-must-reclaim-momentum-in-the-coming-weeks-sol-btc-ratio-at-a-pivotal-point/,"Solana is currently trading at $197, marking a 13% decline from the local high it achieved earlier this week. The broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing heightened indecision, with some fear creeping in as Bitcoin struggles to reclaim the pivotal $100,000 level. This hesitation has created ripple effects across altcoins, including Solana, which has seen its recent momentum stall. Related Reading: Ethereum Will Drop Before The Next Leg Up – Analyst Sets Target Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that $SOL/BTC could be a key pair to monitor in the coming weeks. Jelle suggests that Solana’s performance against Bitcoin may provide critical insights into its potential trajectory. While Solana remains a market favorite due to its robust ecosystem and innovative developments, its ability to reclaim strength relative to BTC will likely influence investor sentiment. As Solana continues to test key support levels, market participants are closely watching for signs of a breakout or further consolidation. The next few weeks could be decisive for Solana’s price action, setting the tone for its performance in the months ahead. Will Solana bounce back to reclaim its highs, or will market uncertainty push it lower? Investors are waiting for clear signals amid this period of flux. Solana Enters A Crucial Phase Solana is trading just above the critical $190 support level, a former supply zone that has flipped into demand. This level represents a key test for the asset as it seeks to solidify its bullish trajectory. Solana has been forming higher lows, a positive sign of strength, but it still needs to reclaim higher supply zones to confirm a sustained bullish trend. Top analyst Jelle recently shared his insights on X, emphasizing the importance of monitoring the SOL/BTC pair in the coming weeks. He noted that Solana is entering what appears to be a bullish phase, but its performance against Bitcoin will be a critical factor in determining its future direction. According to Jelle, Solana must reclaim the 0.0022 level against BTC to signal strength and confirm its bullish outlook. Should Solana fail to achieve this, Jelle indicated that he would consider reallocating some of his exposure back into Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Breakout Or Breakdown? The current market indecision, fueled by Bitcoin’s struggle to break above $100,000, has left many altcoins, including Solana, in a state of flux. A breakout above the 0.0022 level on the SOL/BTC chart would not only reinforce confidence in Solana’s bullish potential but also mark it as a strong contender in the ongoing market rally. Testing Demand At Key Levels Solana is currently trading at $196, navigating a critical demand zone between $193 and $200. This range serves as a key battleground for bulls and bears as Solana attempts to sustain its bullish trajectory. For bulls to regain control, the price must decisively break above the $200 level, invalidating bearish pressure and setting the stage for further gains. To solidify its bullish structure, Solana needs to reclaim the $222 mark. Achieving this would establish a higher high, reinforcing confidence among investors and signaling the continuation of its upward trend. However, failure to push above $200 could leave the price vulnerable to further downside pressure.

This could result in Solana entering a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before attempting another breakout.

However, investors looking to make huge profits in the long term are shifting to fresh high-potential tokens. This explains why RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging DeFi altcoin, has pumped significantly during its presale. Why are Dogecoin (DOGE) investors migrating to RCO Finance (RCOF)? Read on to discover! Dogecoin Jumps 19% In A Week: More Growth In Store. Dogecoin has impressed meme coin enthusiasts over the past week after surging by double digits. On December 30, Dogecoin was changing hands at around $0.3214. After trading around this level for days, Dogecoin spiked on January 3, 2025. This surge came after Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $98,000 level. Specifically, Dogecoin traded as high as $0.3980 on January 4. However, day traders started taking profits, and Dogecoin pulled back slightly. By January 6, Dogecoin (DOGE) had stabilized at around $0.3843. This price means Dogecoin has gained 19% over the past week. However, analysts foresee Dogecoin pulling back as investors search for high-potential tokens to maximize gains in 2025. This explains why Dogecoin whales have poured $500,000 into RCO Finance (RCOF). RCO Finance Stuns Investors With Its Crypto AI Features While Dogecoin has recorded notable weekly gains, investors are flocking to RCO FInance because this DeFi platform boasts a vast asset offering. Specifically, RCO Finance supports over 120,000 assets spread across 12,500+ classes. These include crypto, decentralized derivatives, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). This offering simplifies portfolio diversification, explaining why RCO Finance is quickly gaining ground. Moreover, RCO Finance runs on AI and blockchain technology. This avant-garde infrastructure enables this burgeoning platform to support an array of modern trading tools. The most noteworthy tool in the RCO Finance ecosystem is its AI-powered robo advisor. This robo advisor has caught investors’ attention because it uses machine learning and advanced algorithms to offer free custom investment recommendations based on your risk tolerance and financial objectives. To achieve this, the robo advisor analyzes the market and gleans actionable data. With the obtained data the robo advisor easily helps you pinpoint the best time to buy or sell specific assets. This approach helps prevent the need to rely on emotions, thus increasing your chances of profitability while minimizing risk exposure. Moreover, the robo advisor can complete transactions on your behalf. This feature lets you take a break from hands-on investing. Additionally, it enables the robo advisor to adjust your portfolio with high-potential investments in real-time, boosting your chances of profitability. RCO Finance has also made waves in the crypto industry because it issues non-KYC debit cards, which simplify the spending of altcoins like Dogecoin. On top of this, RCO Finance supports non-KYC registration. This provision lowers the barriers to entry and helps you maintain anonymity. RCOF Gains Traction During Stage 4: Huge Returns In Store Dogecoin whales are also flocking to RCO Finance to purchase its native token, RCOF. RCOF has won over investors because it is a safe investment. It is worth noting that SolidProof, a leader in blockchain security, audited RCOF’s smart contract and verified that it meets the crypto industry’s safety standards. RCOF has also grown significantly despite being in its presale. As of January 6, RCOF has raised $10.58 million, making it one of the fastest-growing ICOs. Amazingly, this crypto AI token has achieved this funding milestone during Stage 4 of its presale. Investors can now purchase RCOF at $0.0778 and await huge returns as this altcoin moves toward its listing price of $0.4-$0.6. Moreover, analysts foresee RCOF jumping 43,019% in Q1 2025. By surging 43,019%, RCOF will have outshined Dogecoin’s 7,400% climb in 2021. This explains why you should seize this rare opportunity to join the RCOF presale!

With 2025 fast approaching, investors are searching for the top coins to buy and hold this year, and it’s clear that several emerging and established coins are making waves.

Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics is offering groundbreaking solutions to problems like scalability, interoperability, and blockchain development through its native tools and features.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $157.81. ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $256.44 by 2031. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As the adoption of decentralized identities and Web3 technology continues to grow, ENS continues to position itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $32.45 Market Cap $1,153,113,307.64 Trading Volume $204,959,217.68 Circulating Supply 34,357,630.51 ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $34.00 24-h Low $32.00 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction (February 7) $105.40 (228.10%) Volatility (30-day Volatility) 37.45% 50-Day SMA $34.57 14-Day RSI 46.39 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $24.06 Ethereum Name Service price analysis: Bears remain in control of the market TL;DR Breakdown Ethereum Name Service’s price analysis shows a bearish trend. A breakout above $34.91 could renew bulls’ interest. The resistance for ENS is present at $37.11. The ENS price analysis for January 9 shows a recent decline, indicating bearish pressure after initial upsides. The resistance level is near $37.11, where selling pressure has been observed, while support is identified around $32.00, providing a potential rebound zone. The movement reflects a short-term downward trend, with traders watching for a breakout above resistance or further dips toward support to determine the next direction. Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart: Will ENS see renewed bullish momentum soon? The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) chart shows a bearish trend, with the current price of $32.51 trading below the 20-day SMA of $34.91, indicating weakened bullish momentum. Recent price corrections from highs above $48 in mid-December reflect profit-taking and high volatility. ENS to see renewed bullish momentum soon? The RSI at 43.02 suggests neutral to mildly oversold conditions. Another indicator, the MACD, shows a bearish crossover with a negative histogram, signaling limited buying momentum but hinting at a slowdown in selling pressure. A breakout above $34.91 could signal renewed bullish momentum, while a drop below $30 might lead to stronger support levels around $28. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis: ENS struggles as bear pressure intensifies The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) 4-hour chart shows the price struggling at $32.29, hovering just above the Chande Kroll Stop-long level of $32.00, which highlights bearish pressure. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.12 suggests sellers are slightly stronger, with limited buying activity in the market. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis Similarly, the Balance of Power at -0.11 points to bears having the upper hand, but not overwhelmingly so. To regain momentum, ENS needs to break above $37.11. Until then, the market remains under pressure, and further downsides or consolidation can be expected. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $41.00 SELL SMA 5 $40.43 SELL SMA 10 $35.64 SELL SMA 21 $35.75 SELL SMA 50 $34.57 SELL SMA 100 $25.97 BUY SMA 200 $24.06 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $37.23 SELL EMA 5 $38.56 SELL EMA 10 $39.68 SELL EMA 21 $38.12 SELL EMA 50 $31.90 BUY EMA 100 $26.87 BUY EMA 200 $23.50 BUY What to expect from ENS? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is currently under bearish pressure, with the price near the critical support level of $32.00. A drop below this could push the price toward $28, while a breakout above $37.11 could signal a bullish recovery. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will fully recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $124.93 by 2027. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending up to $250 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest.

The move, which came just days before President Joe Biden leaves office, is another piece of a larger strategy to control who gets to develop and use cutting-edge AI. According to a Bloomberg report , the plan purports to cut sales of AI chips used in data centers based on country and company. This is an effort to limit China and Russia’s access to advanced technology. Sources familiar with the issue said the goal is to prod AI growth in US-allied countries and force global companies to conform to American standards.

However, most countries would have limits on how much computing power they can bring in.

Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) has seen a massive 72% surge in trading volume, while Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is turning heads on Solana despite recent dips. Yet, the real excitement centres on BTFD Coin, whose innovative referral programme and growing Bulls Squad are creating buzz among crypto enthusiasts. Meme coins have always stood out for their ability to build loyal communities around fun and quirky concepts. From BTFD Coin’s bullish movement to the ancient prophecies of Goatseus Maximus and the rallying cry of “Peanut Forever,” these tokens prove there’s more to crypto than just numbers. BTFD Coin, however, is redefining the space with its referral programme, staking rewards, and engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, cementing its spot as one of the top new meme coins to join today . BTFD Coin: The Referral Programme That Rewards the Bulls What if earning crypto rewards was as simple as sharing a code? BTFD Coin’s referral programme is making waves in the crypto world, offering participants a chance to earn substantial rewards for inviting others to join the presale. Designed to benefit both referrers and referrals, this programme is quickly becoming one of the driving forces behind BTFD’s presale success. Here’s how it works: Once you connect your wallet on the BTFD buy page, you’ll receive a unique referral code. Share this code with your friends, family, or community members. When someone uses your code to make a purchase of $50 or more, they’ll receive an extra 10% in $BTFD tokens on top of their purchase. For you, every referral adds up—referrers who make it to the top 20 on the leaderboard by the end of the month receive 10% of the total raise amount in $BTFD tokens as a bonus. The competition resets monthly, running until the last day of the month at 6 pm UTC and restarting at 00:01 UTC on the 1st of the following month. It’s an exciting way to build the Bulls Squad while earning massive rewards. At its current price of $0.000142 in the 13th presale stage, the potential to stack $BTFD tokens is enormous. For example, if you refer someone who invests $1,000, you’d receive 10% of that in $BTFD tokens. By the time the token lists at $0.0006, those rewards could be worth significantly more. With over $5 million raised, 63 billion tokens sold, and 7,900 Bulls already onboard, BTFD Coin is proving to be one of the top new meme coins to join today. Its referral programme isn’t just about growing numbers; it’s about creating a thriving community where everyone benefits. Getting started is easy. Set up your wallet using MetaMask or Trust Wallet, connect to the BTFD buy page , and start sharing your referral code. With its bullish rewards, a vibrant community, and the added perks of staking and gameplay, BTFD Coin is setting a new standard for meme coins. The Bulls Squad is charging ahead—don’t miss your chance to join the movement. Goatseus Maximus: Prophecies of Growth Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) is no ordinary meme coin. Created by the enigmatic truth_terminal, it carries the weight of ancient meme prophecies while making waves in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space. Trading at $0.425, GOAT is down 17.18% in the last 24 hours but has seen a stunning 72% surge in trading volume, now at $174.2 million. This uptick in volume signals growing investor interest, especially as analysts predict a rise to $0.645 by February 2025. Longer-term projections are even more bullish, with a potential climb to $3.37 by 2030. While GOAT’s volatility warrants caution, its strong narrative and DeFi integration make it one of the top new meme coins to join today for investors looking to balance risk and reward. The community behind GOAT is just as unique as the token itself. Rooted in meme culture and powered by a blend of nostalgia and innovation, Goatseus Maximus offers more than just speculative gains—it’s a statement. If the trading volume continues its upward trajectory, GOAT could become a major player in the meme-inspired DeFi market. Peanut the Squirrel: Turning Volatility into Opportunity On the Solana network, Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is steadily building a loyal community. Although its price has dipped to $0.6051, with a 14.6% decline in the past 24 hours, PNUT’s trading volume has surged by 38.18%, indicating sustained interest from investors. The token’s charm lies in its whimsical branding and the viral #JusticeForPeanut campaign, which has ignited passion among supporters. The slogan “Peanut Forever” reflects the enduring appeal of meme coins like PNUT, resonating with its backers. Despite a 55.87% drop over the last month, many see this downturn as a prime opportunity to buy into the dip. Market experts suggest that PNUT’s potential hinges on maintaining momentum and deepening its presence within the growing Solana ecosystem. For short-term investors eager to ride the waves of volatility, Peanut the Squirrel is among the top new meme coins to join today, particularly for those drawn to its underdog narrative. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market continues to thrive on innovation and community spirit. Goatseus Maximus stands out for its rising trading volume and long-term potential, while Peanut the Squirrel’s Solana-based charm keeps it in the spotlight. However, the real winner here is BTFD Coin. With its referral programme, vibrant Bulls Squad, and growing presale success, it’s redefining what a meme coin can achieve. Don’t miss your chance to join this bull run— invest in BTFD Coin today and take advantage of its explosive growth potential.

The price recently dipped more than 5-6 percent, erasing the gains made in the last week. XRP could still experience some upward movement, though key levels are crucial for understanding whether the market sentiment is shifting. Key Levels to Watch XRP is currently in a consolidation phase , which could exist for a while. However, on a smaller time frame, this phase may be nearing its end. A final upward move could complete a larger 5th wave, potentially driving XRP to new all-time highs. The most recent Wave 4 bottomed in July 2023, with the market possibly entering the 5th wave upward. Resistance Zones (Long Term) Key resistance levels to monitor are the all-time high of $3.30 from December 2017. Above that, the next resistance points are $4.20 and $5.00. If XRP manages to reach a new high, a major correction could follow, similar to the previous Wave 2. This correction could be both deep and long, so caution is advised. Short-Term Market Structure On the smaller time frame, XRP is currently forming a triangle pattern, hinting at a market indecision. This typically precedes another upward move. A break above the $2.46 level would signal that a low has formed, potentially paving the way for new all-time highs. Current Support Levels Key support levels are between $2.29 and $2.40. If XRP falls below $1.96, it would signal a larger correction, though not necessarily a continuation of the triangle pattern. To keep the bullish outlook intact, XRP must hold above this green support zone. What’s Next for XRP? If XRP breaks above the last swing high at $2.46, it could signal the beginning of a move towards new highs. Until then, attention is focused on whether the price can hold at support and generate a strong reaction.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 03:48:04

Offering a blend of innovation and efficiency, it bridges the gap between DeFi (decentralized finance) and TradFi (traditional financial) systems. While the promise is vast, navigating its complexities is crucial for understanding its role in the broader financial ecosystem. The rise of crypto lending At its core, crypto lending allows borrowers to secure loans by providing cryptocurrency as collateral. This process is governed by smart contracts – self-executing programs on the blockchain that eliminate the need for intermediaries. Whether you’re an individual seeking a loan or an investor looking for returns, crypto lending offers a unique financial avenue. What sets decentralized platforms apart is their openness – anyone with crypto assets can participate, making financial services more accessible than ever. This trend is not just a fleeting moment in the evolution of blockchain. It represents a fundamental shift in how we perceive financial inclusivity and efficiency. So how does it work The mechanics of crypto lending are straightforward yet powerful. Borrowers provide collateral – often in the form of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) – to secure loans in stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. Lenders, on the other hand, earn interest on the assets they provide to the lending pool. Decentralized platforms rely on smart contracts to automate and secure transactions. These contracts ensure transparency, reduce operational costs and minimize risks associated with human error. In contrast, centralized crypto lending platforms operate similarly to traditional financial institutions, requiring a third party to manage transactions, which can introduce trust and custodial risks. Benefits versus challenges Crypto lending isn’t just about novelty – it’s solving real-world problems. Accessibility stands out as one of its most transformative aspects. In regions where traditional banking is limited or inaccessible, crypto lending provides an alternative. With just a digital wallet and internet access, individuals can bypass conventional barriers and secure loans. Transparency is another crucial advantage. Smart contracts bring an unprecedented level of clarity to the process. The terms are coded, immutable and accessible for review, which significantly reduces the likelihood of manipulation. For lenders, the allure often lies in the higher yields offered by crypto platforms compared to traditional savings accounts. These yields stem from the efficient allocation of resources and the global nature of the crypto market. However, crypto lending is not without its pitfalls. Market volatility is perhaps the most pressing issue. The inherently unstable nature of cryptocurrencies can erode the value of collateral, potentially triggering liquidation events for borrowers. Smart contracts, while innovative, are not immune to vulnerabilities. Bugs or exploitation of these contracts could lead to significant financial losses. Moreover, regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of complexity. The lack of consistent policies across jurisdictions leaves both lenders and borrowers exposed to sudden, potentially disruptive policy changes. The path to mainstream adoption For crypto lending to transition from niche to mainstream, several critical steps are needed. Regulatory clarity is at the forefront. A consistent regulatory framework can legitimize the sector, fostering trust and encouraging participation from institutional players. Improved user interfaces and educational initiatives are equally important. The complexity of DeFi platforms can be a barrier for many. Simplified platforms, coupled with robust educational efforts, can help demystify the process for everyday users. Finally, addressing risks through the development of insurance mechanisms and security upgrades will provide users with added confidence. These measures will mitigate potential losses, making the platforms more appealing to a broader audience. Final thoughts Crypto lending stands at the crossroads of innovation and practicality. It offers a glimpse into the future of finance, where access, transparency and efficiency are paramount. However, realizing its full potential requires overcoming significant challenges – regulatory clarity, improved security and user-friendly platforms – are just the beginning. As the financial world continues to evolve, crypto lending could be the key to a more inclusive and dynamic economic landscape. The journey may be complex, but the rewards are worth the effort.

Raredex is a blockchain-based platform on the Arbitrum network allows investors access to rare earth metals. Rare earth metals, needed for businesses ranging from developing technology to renewable energy, have traditionally been difficult for retail investors to access, hindered by the high entry costs — often above $10,000. Raredex solves this by enabling fractional ownership using blockchain-based tokenization, where each token represents one kilogram of physical metal. Louis O’Connor, chief executive officer of Raredex, highlighted the democratization potential, saying “Early adopters” will now be able to access an asset class that was “typically reserved for governments” or the “well-connected, wealthy” individuals, meaning that investors on a smaller scale can now enter the market, with far less capital required.

Raredex keeps its physical metals in a bank-grade vault operated by Tradium in Germany to access custody and availability. Investors can verify the provenance of their tokens because each one is tagged with extensive source-of-origin data. By employing blockchain technology, an unchangeable record of ownership is made, thus reducing the chances of fraud and increasing transparency. The launch of the platform comes at a time of increased interest in RWA tokenization. This update comes on the back of a larger trend to tokenize real-world assets . In 2023, RWAs class had grown by 700% , bringing $860 million in revenue. According to Boston Consulting Group and ADDX , RWAs are expected to be a $16 trillion market by 2030. The decentralized, tamper-proof nature of blockchain will increase transparency and trust, while fragmentation opens up new ways to access and invest in valuable assets.

This shows that Raredex working in the RWA category is poised for growth. Sourced from ADDX by crypto.news . Other similar initiatives are UBS Asset Management’s Ethereum-hosted tokenized investment fund and Archax’s $4.8 billion money market fund on the XRP Ledger . As there is rising demand for rare earth metals due to innovations in technology and clean energy, Raredex’s platform could be a model for a wider wave of commodity trading on the blockchain, thereby transforming the interaction of investors with physical assets.

It’s a play on the Texas techno king’s love for Dogecoin and an acronym that stands for Department of Government Efficiency . DOGE Aims to Whip Inflation Now We either fix this or go de facto bankrupt https://t.co/hmjpx6uBfd — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2024 The magnetic tech engineer has advised the once and future president Trump broadly on a number of matters relating to technology, business, and public policy. His ideas for more government efficiency could help cut back overspending in Washington, DC, slow the growth in the federal budget deficit, and help curb rising prices across the economy due to inflation. High deficits cause inflation as government spending gooses the velocity of money in the economy and drives up prices. Meanwhile, new dollars created by the Federal Reserve and loaned to banks to buy the government’s debt inflate the dollar and increase prices as well. One recent study by the Princeton University Department of Economics estimates US budget deficits in 2021 caused about 30% of the US dollar inflation in 2021-22. Rising prices as a result of big spending in Washington start in financial markets, then ripple through the economy until they push up prices at the gas pump and grocery checkout. New Headwind for Bitcoin’s Price, Musk Warns If dollar inflation is solved, the price in dollars to buy cryptocurrency will actually drop, other things being equal. What matters is the ratio of dollars to crypto. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 7, 2025 The effect is especially dramatic in crypto markets and shows up conspicuously in Bitcoin’s price and that of other major token pools, such as ETH, XRP, SOL, and DOGE. In fact, many cryptocurrency investors say they favor crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ripple, and Dogecoin as a shelter for their savings from dollar inflation. While not all experts agree that Bitcoin is a hedge for dollar inflation, over any four-year period, money held as BTC has markedly increased in buying power while the inflating greenback loses its purchasing power parity. But Musk warned in an X reply thread on Tuesday that if the D.O.G.E. office’s plans are successful, it will represent a headwind for Bitcoin’s price, not support for growth. That’s because lower deficits and less inflation will slow the increase in prices across the board, including in traditional financial markets like stocks and Internet financial instruments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s price corrected to a low of $94,600 on Wednesday after losing the $100,000 mark on Tuesday.

The flagship coin has experienced a significant decline in bullish momentum since mid-November. The upcoming second inauguration of pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President is likely to turn into a sell-the-news event amid heightened hype. Moreover, Bitcoin’s Futures Open Interest (OI), which is used to predict midterm expectations, has remained stagnant in the past two months. Midterm Expectations for Bitcoin Price Via MVRV Pricing Bands With the fear of Bitcoin price continuing in bearish sentiments in the coming days, possibly below $90k, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator has been suggesting a major rebound ahead. Currently, Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio is above the 1-year Moving Average (MA) of 2.18. Historically, Bitcoin price has spent around 5 percent of its trading days above the 3.2 MVRV ratio. Typically, Glassnode noted that the threshold for extreme euphoria is achieved after hitting above the 3.2 MVRV ratio. As such, if Bitcoin price were to reach the 3.2 MVRV ratio, which is associated with extreme euphoria, the corresponding value would be around $132k. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Fidelity Expects More Nation-States, Central Banks To Buy Bitcoin In 2025 , Market Picture Bitcoin price has continued to experience diminishing returns amid the ongoing mainstream adoption led by institutional investors.

The company used convertible note proceeds for share repurchases and covered calls, avoiding the trend of buying more Bitcoin with borrowed money. Despite strong sats/share growth, CleanSpark's stock performance lags Bitcoin's price, making it a better trading vehicle than a long-term investment. Back in October, I upgraded shares of CleanSpark ( CLSK ) from 'hold' to 'buy' after taking a more cautious outlook on the stock for most of 2024. CLSK was a high-flyer in 2023 after bottoming out in December 2022 during the depths of 'crypto winter.' Some of my earlier calls on CLSK in the low-single digits performed quite well in the first half of 2023. With nearly 9 months passed since the block reward halving last April and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) briefly surpassing the six-figure USD denominated price milestone, CleanSpark is one of the few Bitcoin mining stocks that remains a pure play on BTC. Data by YCharts Most of the other companies in the space have adopted high-performance computing as secondary business segments and the market has generally rewarded those names more in the last year as can be seen through the performances of stocks like Core Scientific ( CORZ ), IREN Ltd ( IREN ), and TeraWulf ( WULF ). Compared to other mining pure plays, CleanSpark has performed well having bested the returns observed in names like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and Marathon Holdings ( MARA ) over the last year. December Production During the month of December, CleanSpark mined 668 Bitcoin, second most of all public miners. This final month figure gave the company a total of 7,024 BTC mined during the full year for 2024. In the chart below, we can see that it has taken a constant ramp up exahash per second to generate similar amounts of BTC that were produced this time last year. CleanSpark, Author's Chart This is obviously a result of both the 50% reduction in the block reward subsidy as well as the growth in global hash rate. As mentioned, CleanSpark remains one of the few public mining stocks that is still fully dedicated to Bitcoin. At 18.8 BTC/EHS in December, CleanSpark is generally in-line with most of the public mining companies. The company continues to guide for 50 EH/s in the 2025 fiscal year. Convertible Notes On December 17th , CleanSpark announced the closing of a $650 million convertible note offering. Convertible notes have become quite trendy for Bitcoin-adjacent companies since it has worked so well for MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) over the last several months. The company's convertible notes pay zero percent and are due 2030. CleanSpark As part of the convertible note offering, CleanSpark has also entered into capped call transactions and repurchased 11.76 million shares of common for $145 million. This is a very interesting strategy because it is aimed at limiting the potential dilution of the stock through conversions from the offering. Per the press release: If the Company elects to settle the conversions of principal of the Convertible Notes in cash and to settle the remainder of any conversions in shares, and the conversions do not follow a notice of redemption or certain corporate events, the Company will not have to issue any additional shares (on a net basis, after accounting for the benefits of the capped call and the share repurchase), until the price of its Common Stock exceeds $33.67. Additionally, I find CleanSpark's convertible offering to be interesting because the company is bucking the sector trend and hasn't used the proceeds to simply buy more Bitcoin at the market rate. Rather, the $633.6 million in net proceeds from the offering, $90.4 million has been used to put on the covered calls and $145 million was used to repurchase CLSK shares. CleanSpark has $398.2 million remaining that it says it will use pay down its credit line with Coinbase ( COIN ), for capex, acquisitions, and corporate purposes. I actually like this approach more than just buying BTC with cash. CoinShares Per data compiled by CoinShares, CleanSpark has one of the lowest all-in costs to mine Bitcoin compared with the rest of the public market. In this bullish Bitcoin environment, it's easy to get excited about companies that raise capital through convertibles to buy more Bitcoin. It's it a bit more contrarian to raise capital through convertibles and not buy BTC. If CleanSpark's past corporate treasury management is any indication, the company might be best equipped to go against the grain and grow BTC through mining rather than debt-based purchases. BTC-Backing BTC Holdings (CleanSpark, Author's Chart) CleanSpark has exhibited a strong ability to grow the company's Bitcoin stack from 228 BTC at the end of 2022 to 9,952 BTC at the end of 2024. As I've mentioned about the publicly traded BTC miners multiple times, these companies have generally been able to grow capacity and capital through shareholder dilution. That has not necessarily boded well for shareholders long term but when looking at shares through a metric like sats per share, we can better assess if that dilution has been accretive to the company's BTC holdings: CleanSpark, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations CleanSpark has been able to grow sats/share over the last three years and has done so at a market-beating rate compared to the broader public mining stocks. Consider the year over year change in sats per share between CleanSpark and many of the other top miners in the industry: Sats/Share September 2023 September 2024 YoY CleanSpark 1,398 2,971 112.5% Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 217 435 100.1% MARA Holdings 6,530 8,804 34.8% HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) 2,016 2,194 8.8% Bitfarms ( BITF ) 253 253 0.0% Hut 8 ( HUT ) 10,524 9,739 -7.5% Riot Platforms 3,733 3,215 -13.9% Source: Company Filings, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations At 112.5%, CLSK shares have seen the largest growth in 'sat-backing' compared with other stocks. However, it should be noted that these numbers are only reflective of quarter-ended September 2024. We have broadly seen a large move toward convertible note issuance over the last several months from publicly traded Bitcoin-related companies. Also, it's important to point out that even before the rush to issue convertibles, CleanSpark's long term sats/share growth lags the price of BTC: End of Sept BTC Sats/Share BTC Price CLSK Price 2022 594 1,066 $19,425 $3.18 2024 8,049 2,971 $63,338 $9.34 % Change 1,255.1% 178.7% 226.1% 193.7% Source: Company Filings, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations In the table above, sats/share shows us that even though CleanSpark's HODL stack has had explosive growth, when adjusted for common shares outstanding the stock's BTC-backing lags the price of BTC - as does the price of the stock. Closing Summary The emergence of generative AI and HPC services as a potential secondary revenue stream has presented a ' fork in the road ' for Bitcoin mining companies; continue down the path of Bitcoin mining or pivot to the far more profitable HPC data center business? Based on the early reporting we're seeing from the companies that are actually generating revenue from HPC, there doesn't seem to be much of a question that HPC has better gross margins than mining today. However, that may not necessarily be the case long term. We've sort of seen this story before. Bitcoin Hashprice, 5yr history (HashRateIndex) Once upon a time, there was a rush to Bitcoin mining because the profit margin was so tremendous. Through HPC data centers, the allure of robust gross margins has led to yet another 'gold rush' though this one is attached to artificial intelligence and electrical infrastructure. Those fat margins could certainly prove to be temporary. In the event of a possible HPC data center bust, the companies that stick with Bitcoin mining could theoretically outperform those that chase HPC services. The ultimate question is does it make sense to buy miners over simply buying Bitcoin directly? History would suggest that even the mining companies that grow sats/share over time lag the price appreciation of BTC. Thus, I'm still of the view that CleanSpark is a terrific vehicle for trading but not necessarily a great a long term investment compared to Bitcoin. That said, I like CLSK more than most public miners fundamentally and have a position in the stock.",BTC-USD|CLSK,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-09 04:59:00

The price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh increase above the $700 resistance. BNB price is struggling to settle above the $700 pivot zone. The price is now trading below $700 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $695 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $680 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Holds Support After a downside correction, BNB price found support at $675. It is now recovering losses like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a move above the $685 level. The price was able to recover above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $745 swing high to the $674 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $695 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $700 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $700 level. The next resistance sits near the $710 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $745 swing high to the $674 low. A clear move above the $710 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $725. A close above the $725 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $740 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $750 level in the near term. Another Dip? If BNB fails to clear the $710 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $685 level. The next major support is near the $675 level. The main support sits at $650. If there is a downside break below the $650 support, the price could drop toward the $642 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $625 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone.

While he acknowledged that crypto is still a small part of the overall financial markets, he said that it’s full of bad actors and scams. Under his leadership, the SEC has filed about 100 enforcement actions in the past four years, compared to his predecessor Jay Clayton’s 80. Gensler believes that the crypto market is still struggling with fraud, with many projects acting like risky investments that may not survive. In an interview with Bloomberg , Gensler said, “In this field, it’s rife with bad actors.” He then broke down the crypto market into two parts, saying, “The public knows a lot about Bitcoin, which, depending on its market value, is two-thirds to 80% of the market value of crypto.” Gensler pointed out that there are “10,000 to 15,000 projects raising money from the public.” Many of these projects, he believes, are simply speculative investments, “hoping for a better future.” He explained, “I’ve been around finance for over four decades, and everything in the markets trades on a mixture of fundamentals and sentiment.” However, he added, “At any given time, I’ve never seen a field that’s so much wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals.” Gensler Says Crypto Projects ‘Won’t Survive’ He also warned, “Many of these 10,000 to 15,000 projects will not survive. They’re like venture capital investments. They’re not going to survive.” Gensler pointed to the existence of “small pump and dump schemes” that have caused problems in the industry. Reflecting on past events, he said, “We’ve lived through a few years where they became notorious, but they’re in jail now.” Despite the growing number of enforcement actions, Gensler thinks that the crypto market is still not complying with the rules. He sees his role as ensuring that the market works without fraud, manipulation, and misinformation. Gensler is set to resign on January 20 and Paul Atkins will serve as the SEC Chair next.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 05:11:36

With analysts predicting a bullish cycle for meme coins, now’s the time to jump in. Meme coins have evolved beyond mere internet jokes; they are now serious players in the world of alternative investments, offering high returns and community-driven momentum. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD), currently in Stage 13 of its presale for $0.000142. Known as the “Bulls Squad,” its passionate community is creating major buzz. With over $5 million raised and more than 63 billion BTFD coins sold, this project is set to redefine meme coin success. But that’s not all. We’ll also explore Bonk (BONK) and Pepe Coin (PEPE), established favourites that continue to dominate the meme coin frenzy. Let’s dive into why these are the top new meme coins to invest in this month. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Dip-Lover’s Dream BTFD Coin embodies the “ Buy the Dip ” ethos, offering a unique blend of presale profits, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, staking rewards, and community-driven power. It’s not just a coin; it’s a movement. At the heart of BTFD lies the dynamic Bulls Squad, a community of over 7,900 investors united by their passion for finding value where others see risk. The Bulls Squad embodies resilience, creativity, and teamwork, serving as the driving force behind BTFD’s success. With Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull leading the charge, this squad isn’t just a group—it’s a movement redefining what it means to invest in meme coins. The BTFD P2E game, launched on January 1, 2025, allows users to earn rewards while enjoying a fun and engaging experience. Unlike the beta version, which was just a teaser, the full version brings lucrative earning opportunities. Players can rack up in-game tokens and convert them to BTFD coins, enhancing their portfolios. Staking went live on December 2, offering a competitive 90% APY for investors. This makes holding BTFD a rewarding experience, turning passive holding into an active income stream. With a maximum coin supply of 173 billion and liquidity locked for three years, BTFD promises long-term stability. The presale is a goldmine for early investors. Starting at just $0.000004, the price has climbed to $0.000142 in Stage 13. At the end of the presale, the listing price will be $0.0006. Let’s break it down: if you invest $2,500 today, you’ll own 17,605,632 BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment will grow to $10,563—a remarkable 322% ROI.

It’s a no-brainer for anyone looking to capitalise on the meme coin craze. 2. Bonk (BONK): The Community-Driven Powerhouse Bonk is a community-first meme coin that has captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Known for its decentralised ethos, BONK thrives on its ability to rally people together, creating a vibrant and active community. One of Bonk’s standout features is its utility within the Solana ecosystem. It’s often used to reward community initiatives, adding a layer of utility that many meme coins lack. From NFT minting to liquidity provision, Bonk’s integration across Solana has cemented its position as a go-to alternative investment. Why Does Bonk Deserve a Spot on This List? Bonk’s unique blend of community power and utility within the Solana ecosystem makes it more than just a meme coin. It’s a symbol of what decentralised communities can achieve. 3. Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Legendary Meme Icon Pepe Coin pays homage to the internet’s beloved frog meme, but it’s much more than a nostalgic nod. With its deflationary model and strong community backing, PEPE has proven itself as a serious player in the meme coin market. What sets PEPE apart is its strategic tokenomics. The coin’s supply decreases over time through regular burns, ensuring scarcity and driving demand. Additionally, its liquidity pools and staking mechanisms make it an attractive choice among the top new meme coins to invest in this month. Why is Pepe Coin a Must-Have? Pepe Coin’s ability to blend humour with strategic financial incentives makes it a standout in the crowded meme coin space. It’s a perfect mix of fun and function. Final Thoughts: The Right Time is Now The meme coin market is hotter than ever, offering unparalleled opportunities for those willing to take the plunge. BTFD Coin reigns supreme with its innovative P2E game, high staking rewards, and thriving presale—truly a top new meme coin to invest in this month. Meanwhile, Bonk and Pepe Coin continue to shine as established favourites, each bringing unique value to the table. Time is of the essence. Don’t let this wave pass you by.

Meanwhile, Do Kwon faces a 2026 trial for fraud related to the Terra ecosystem collapse, with prosecutors seeking key evidence from his emails, devices, and trading records. Coinbase recently secured a partial legal victory with a court-approved appeal in its SEC case. FTX is still budding heads in the crypto space after it refuted claims by Backpack about acquiring its European arm. Avraham Eisenberg Sentencing Delayed Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, who was convicted of fraud and market manipulation related to an exploit of the Mango Markets decentralized exchange, is set to be sentenced on April 10. This decision follows a Jan. 7 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), where Judge Arun Subramanian granted a request from Eisenberg’s legal team to postpone the sentencing. Initially scheduled for Dec. 12 and later moved to Feb. 11, the delay was asked for due to the complexity of sentencing issues and the factual record of the case. The US prosecutor’s office did not object to the change. Eisenberg’s request to delay sentencing (Source: Courtlistener ) Eisenberg was arrested in December of 2022 after exploiting Mango Markets in October 2022 by draining over $100 million from the platform. While he returned approximately $67 million, he still kept more than $40 million after a governance vote by the community. Eisenberg has been in custody for nearly two years and could face up to 20 years in prison if sentenced to the maximum penalty, served consecutively. In addition to the criminal case, Eisenberg may also face civil enforcement actions from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These cases were stayed in March of 2023 and are expected to resume after the conclusion of his criminal proceedings. The SDNY prosecutors handling Eisenberg’s case have also pursued charges against other high-profile people in the crypto industry, including former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky. Kwon was recently extradited to the United States from Montenegro, and is scheduled to face trial in January 2026. Prosecutors Target Do Kwon’s Email and Social Media Prosecutors in the United States outlined their discovery plans in the criminal case against Do Kwon, including search warrants for his email and Twitter accounts. A Jan. 7 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York revealed that prosecutors anticipate uncovering “multiple terabytes of data” relevant to their case. The discovery includes search warrants for Kwon’s personal and business email accounts, his Twitter account, and four of his electronic devices, as well as trading records and materials from crypto exchanges. Kwon faces nine felony charges in the US for alleged fraud tied to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022, and was extradited from Montenegro on Dec. 31 after a year-long process involving competing requests from the US and South Korea. Prosecutors also revealed that recordings of Kwon, made without his knowledge and not directed by the government, may be included in the evidence for discovery. Some of these recordings were used in a prior SEC civil case against Kwon and Terraform Labs, which found both parties liable for fraud. Charges against Kwon (Source: Courtlistener ) In March of 2023, US prosecutors initially charged Kwon with eight counts, but later added a ninth count of money laundering conspiracy in a sealed superseding indictment in 2024. The money laundering charge is very similar to the case against Sam Bankman-Fried, who faced issues with charges added after his extradition from the Bahamas. Anticipating similar challenges, US prosecutors in Kwon’s case plan to ask for a waiver from Montenegro’s rule of specialty, which could potentially complicate the inclusion of the ninth charge. Kwon’s trial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 26, 2026, and he faces a potential lengthy prison sentence if convicted. Coinbase Wins Appeal in SEC Case Meanwhile, Coinbase achieved a small victory in its legal battle with the SEC after a federal judge granted an order for an interlocutory appeal. Judge Katherine Failla of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York approved Coinbase’s request to appeal an earlier decision denying its motion for judgment. All proceedings in the case have been stayed until the Second Circuit rules on the appeal. At the heart of the SEC’s case against Coinbase is the claim that certain transactions involving crypto assets qualify as investment contracts and therefore fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction as securities. Judge Failla acknowledged the possibility of reversal in her interpretation of investment contracts under the Howey test, due to conflicting rulings in other SEC cases against Ripple Labs and Terraform Labs. These cases led to varying interpretations of what constitutes a security, including a decision in the Ripple case stating that XRP token sales on exchanges were not securities . The SEC filed its enforcement action against Coinbase in June of 2023, and alleged that the exchange operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency since 2019. However, the SEC’s approach when it comes to regulating the crypto industry has drawn a lot of criticism from many in the sector, including claims that it has overstepped its authority under Chair Gary Gensler. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal , shared that he appreciates the court’s decision to grant the appeal. The company has also made it a priority to expose alleged government campaigns against crypto firms, like Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which targeted the debanking of crypto businesses. Coinbase has also been active in politics by contributing alongside Ripple to the political action committee Fairshake. This PAC spent over $90 million in the 2024 elections supporting pro-crypto candidates. FTX Denies Approval of Backpack’s FTX EU Acquisition Despite the sentencing of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried last year, the company still finds itself in trouble with the crypto industry. FTX recently refuted claims made by crypto exchange Backpack regarding its acquisition of FTX’s European arm, FTX EU. In a Jan. 8 statement, FTX clarified that the acquisition was not yet approved by the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and that Backpack’s announcements were made without the knowledge or involvement of FTX. The bankrupt exchange also clarified that Backpack was not authorized to distribute repayments to FTX creditors. Backpack was founded by Solana developer Armani Ferrante, and it announced on Jan. 7 that it acquired FTX EU as part of a court-approved bankruptcy process and pledged to begin creditor repayments by February. However, FTX disputed these claims by stating that any indirect transfer of FTX EU to Backpack had not been disclosed to the bankruptcy court or approved. The company also pointed out that it remains solely responsible for returning funds to its former customers. The FTX debtors previously reached an agreement to sell FTX EU to “certain former insiders” of FTX Europe as part of a court-supervised settlement. FTX said it was informed of an indirect sale to Backpack only recently and that no official authorization was granted for Backpack to handle creditor repayments. Backpack plans to leverage FTX EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (MiFID) II License to expand its European operations, but the company faced some challenges since its inception in 2022. The firm lost $14.5 million, or 88% of its operating funds, during FTX’s collapse but has continued limited operations with minimal funding. The exchange was initially funded by FTX and Jump Crypto. FTX’s reorganization plan took effect on Jan. 3, which allowed creditor repayments to start. Eligible customers, particularly those with claims under $50,000, will be part of an initial group to receive reimbursements within 60 days. Claims must be filed through the official website to qualify for repayment.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-09 05:25:11

In a post on X, Farina noted the rapid shift in market sentiment, stating that “a $10 XRP seems like a conservative price prediction” compared to just months ago when even a $2 forecast faced widespread skepticism. His remarks highlight the growing optimism about XRP’s potential in 2025, fueled by recent market performance and promising developments on the regulatory and political fronts. Suddenly, a $10 XRP seems like a conservative price prediction. Just a few months ago, calling for $2 would have been enough for people to try and tear down your reputation. How quickly the narrative shifts. 99% aren’t ready. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) January 6, 2025 XRP’s Recent Market Momentum XRP has experienced remarkable growth since late 2024, reaching levels not seen since 2018. The asset’s momentum has carried over into the new year. Despite a recent drop over the past 24 hours, the asset is still up over 10% in 2025, with its highest price this year over 22% higher than the end of 2024. At its current price of $2.29, it is still well above $2. As Farina noted, many analysts have shared predictions of $10 and more for the digital asset. They have attributed XRP’s rise to its breakthrough of key resistance levels which signals increased investor confidence, and major shifts in the U.S. political and regulatory landscape. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Developments Driving Optimism January 20, 2025, marks an important date for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. On this day, Donald Trump, the pro-crypto president-elect, will take office. Trump’s administration is expected to bring regulatory clarity to the industry, especially with the anticipated resignation of Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair. Trump’s nominee for SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, is considered a crypto-friendly figure, raising hopes for a more favorable approach to digital assets. The crypto community expects that the incoming administration may expedite the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC and potentially dismiss other ongoing lawsuits against similar blockchain firms. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed optimism about the year ahead, aligning with Farina’s positive outlook. According to Garlinghouse, 2025 could be transformative for XRP, as the company shifts focus to real-world utility and increasing momentum. As January 20 approaches, all eyes are on the incoming U.S. administration and its potential to redefine the crypto landscape. For XRP holders, the anticipation of a breakthrough year is stronger than ever.

While Thailand is piloting cryptocurrency payments in Phuket to modernize its tourism economy, institutional investors are once again accumulating Bitcoin after a significant price correction, reflecting renewed confidence in its long-term potential. Large Bitcoin Holders Resume Accumulation Amidst Post-Correction Recovery Bitcoin’s price trajectory has once again captured the spotlight as large-scale investors have resumed their accumulation of the cryptocurrency following a notable price correction late in 2024. After Bitcoin achieved an unprecedented six-figure milestone, its value experienced a sharp decline, spurring strategic buying activity among institutional investors. This trend signals a renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s potential for recovery and long-term growth. Cauê Oliveira, head of research at Blocktrends, revealed in a Jan. 8 post on CryptoQuant that institutional investors have purchased over 34,000 BTC, worth approximately $3.2 billion. This influx of buying pressure comes as Bitcoin begins to recover from its December plunge. Oliveira highlighted that the accumulation follows a significant sell-off by wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, which collectively dumped 79,000 BTC in the week after Dec. 21. This sell-off occurred shortly after Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $108,000 on Dec. 17, propelled by the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. However, the rapid price correction—approximately 15%—presented a buying opportunity for strategic investors. “Large players took advantage of the consolidation,” Oliveira explained, noting that institutional buyers executed trades in smaller increments to accumulate Bitcoin at prices below $95,000. The shift in Bitcoin’s seven-day balance change, which flipped positive after the late-December sell-off, suggests renewed buying momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $94,265, reflecting a modest 2.57% decline over the past day. This price movement aligns with broader market trends, as disappointing US jobs and economic data have dampened expectations of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts later in January. Despite these headwinds, analysts at Bitfinex are optimistic that the worst of the downward pressure on Bitcoin's price is behind us. In a Jan. 6 market note, Bitfinex analysts observed that sell-side liquidity in Bitcoin markets is “shrinking at a rapid pace,” suggesting that the cryptocurrency is entering a phase of stabilization and potential growth. Optimistic Projections for 2025 Looking ahead, several experts predict that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a historic rally in 2025. The anticipated inauguration of pro-crypto policies under incoming US President Donald Trump and growing nation-state adoption of Bitcoin are expected to provide strong tailwinds for the cryptocurrency market. Fidelity Digital Assets research analyst Matt Hogan echoed this sentiment in a Jan. 7 report, stating that “more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in Bitcoin.” This aligns with the views of Blockware analysts, who suggested last month that the establishment of a US Bitcoin reserve could significantly boost its price. In their projections, a worst-case scenario would see Bitcoin surpass $150,000, while a best-case scenario envisions a rise to over $400,000. The renewed interest in Bitcoin among institutional investors is underpinned by several key factors: Macroeconomic Shifts: With traditional monetary policies facing uncertainty, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive hedge against inflation and economic instability. Regulatory Clarity: The expectation of more transparent and supportive regulatory frameworks under a new US administration could further enhance Bitcoin’s appeal. Strategic Asset Allocation: As Hogan highlighted, institutional entities are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term strategic asset, complementing their broader portfolios. The recent resurgence of institutional Bitcoin accumulation marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency as it recovers from its late-2024 correction. With significant buying pressure from large holders and optimistic forecasts for the year ahead, Bitcoin’s role as a global financial asset continues to solidify. As nation-states and institutional players deepen their involvement, the stage is set for a potentially transformative year in Bitcoin’s history. Thailand to Pilot Cryptocurrency Payments in Phuket to Boost Tourism and Innovation In other Bitcoins news, Thailand is set to trial cryptocurrency payments in Phuket, one of its most popular tourist destinations, as part of a groundbreaking initiative aimed at offering foreign visitors an alternative payment method. The move, announced on Jan. 8 by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira, signifies a step forward in integrating digital currency into Thailand’s tourism-driven economy. Speaking at a seminar organized by the Marketing Association of Thailand, Chunhavajira emphasized that the pilot program will operate entirely within Thailand’s existing legal framework, requiring no amendments to current laws. This assurance seeks to allay concerns about regulatory overreach while highlighting the government’s commitment to fostering innovation within the bounds of legality. The deputy prime minister said that the program aims to make digital transactions more accessible in “tourism-focused cities” and to remain competitive to avoid missing out on business opportunities. The program will require foreign tourists to register Bitcoin (BTC) through a Thai exchange and verify their identities before using the cryptocurrency for purchases. A clearinghouse will then convert BTC transactions into Thai baht, ensuring smooth operations for both vendors and buyers. The trial is expected to enhance the tourism experience by providing a convenient and modern payment method, especially for tech-savvy travelers. The program is part of Thailand’s broader strategy to leverage digital innovation to boost its critical tourism sector, which has been recovering steadily following the pandemic. To demonstrate the program's effectiveness, Pichai referenced the situation of refugees from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, who could utilize BTC to buy real estate in Thailand rather than encountering difficulties in acquiring Thai baht. Thailand’s experimentation with cryptocurrencies in Phuket aligns with previous calls by prominent figures to advance the country’s digital asset landscape. In December 2024, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra urged the Thai government to adopt a proactive approach toward studying cryptocurrencies. Speaking at a lecture, Shinawatra advocated for sandbox experimentation to explore the potential of digital assets without immediately committing to large-scale adoption. He also raised concerns about the possible impact of incoming US President Donald Trump’s administration, particularly regarding trade tariffs and Trump’s controversial suggestion to use Bitcoin for settling US debt. Regulatory Evolution in Thailand’s Crypto Sector The pilot program comes at a time of significant regulatory developments in Thailand’s cryptocurrency market. Binance Thailand CEO Nirun Fuwattananukul highlighted these changes in an October 2024 opinion piece, where he discussed the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) move to expand fund investment opportunities in digital assets. According to Fuwattananukul, the proposed regulations are designed to create a “mature ecosystem where traditional finance and digital assets coexist.” The initiative, he noted, signals Thailand’s intent to move beyond merely legitimizing Bitcoin and toward fostering a dynamic and robust financial environment. The pilot program in Phuket is a strong indicator of Thailand’s ambition to position itself as a leader in digital finance and tourism innovation. By embracing cryptocurrencies, the country is taking a bold step toward attracting global tourists and investors who are increasingly comfortable with digital payments. If successful, the trial could pave the way for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies across Thailand’s other major tourist hubs, further solidifying the nation’s reputation as a forward-thinking destination. Moreover, it sets a precedent for other countries looking to integrate digital currencies into their economies without overhauling existing legal structures. Thailand’s move to pilot cryptocurrency payments in Phuket signals a progressive shift in its approach to digital finance and tourism. By leveraging Bitcoin’s global appeal, the initiative could enhance the country’s competitiveness, boost its tourism industry, and lay the groundwork for broader crypto adoption. As the pilot unfolds, it will be closely watched by both domestic stakeholders and the global cryptocurrency community, eager to see whether Thailand’s innovative gamble pays off.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-09 05:30:00

The crypto fall came after, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) was approved to sell 69,370 Bitcoin seized from the infamous Silk Road darknet marketplace. According to DB , the commercial value of crypto assets is approximately $6.5 billion, the Bitcoin stash has been at the center of a protracted legal battle. The court ruling on December 30 dismissed claims from Battle Born Investments, which had sought ownership through a bankruptcy estate and attempted to delay the sale. Why Sell Now? After a long legal tug-of-war, a federal judge finally gave the green light for the DOJ to cash in on the crypto. The DOJ justified the liquidation, citing concerns over Bitcoin’s price volatility and the potential risk of value loss if the assets were held for too long. A spokesperson confirmed the department’s intent to proceed with the sale in alignment with the court’s judgment. The U.S. Marshals Service is expected to manage the liquidation process, which could become one of history’s largest crypto asset sales. This decision comes after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal challenging the seizure last October. Battle Born also pursued a Freedom of Information Act request to uncover the identity of “Individual X,” who initially surrendered the Bitcoin, but that effort also failed. The news of selling the assets before Trump’s inauguration on January 20 is raising the eyebrows of crypto investors making the market a bit shaky. Crypto assets are already facing a downtrend due to the FOMC meeting. Crypto Reaction The market’s reaction to the news was immediate, with Bitcoin’s price dropping nearly 3%, from $95,000 to $93,800, before stabilizing around $94,300. Analysts suggest that such a significant liquidation could add downward pressure on the market, raising concerns about broader impacts on Bitcoin’s price stability. A crypto user known as DefiBanked hints at political motives behind the DOJ’s plan to sell 69,000 Bitcoin, suggesting the profits might be directed toward Ukraine. A move driven by Biden’s administration to suppress Bitcoin. The DOJ’s move underscores its focus on resolving high-profile crypto cases and recovering assets tied to illicit activities. While the government has yet to release an official statement, for the crypto world, it’s a reminder that even digital assets aren’t beyond the law’s reach. While the case outcome will set a precedent for future crypto cases, this government sell-off can also create a massive liquidity issue and many fear that it is a planned strategy by Biden to Stop Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plan. There is a buzz in the market that it is a planned move to drop Bitcoin prices as many analysts also think this is a trick to manipulate Bitcoin prices.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-09 05:45:08

This has led investors to question whether another BTC price crash under $90,000 is coming soon as the asset took a dip under $93,000 earlier today. US Govt Liquidates Silk Road Bitcoin on US DoJ Authorization As reported earlier by DB News , the US DOJ approved the government to sell 69,370 Bitcoins seized from the Silk Road darknet. DOJ cited Bitcoin price volatility as the reason for allowing the US govt to liquidate the assets. Hours after the reports, the balance in the US government wallet dropped to zero, from $6.7 billion on January 8, as per the data by Arkham Intelligence, Source: Arkham Intelligence Interestingly, the selloff comes just 10 days before Donald Trump took office at the White House on January 20. While the Trump team has been thinking about building strategic Bitcoin reserve , the Biden govt has made a hasty decision to liquidate Bitcoin. Source: DB News Interestingly, this decision from the federal judge comes soon after the new administration took charge of the office two weeks ago. The ruling, made on December 30, comes after the resolution of a prolonged ownership dispute with Battle Born Investments. The investment firm failed to get the ownership of BTC through a bankruptcy estate. Battle Born’s legal team has strongly criticized the decision, with their attorney characterizing it as “another egregious example of the DOJ’s abuse of the Civil Asset Forfeiture process.” They argue that the government employed “procedural trickery to make sure the facts are never heard.” BTC Price Correction Under $90,000 Soon? Following the rejection at the $100K level, the Bitcoin price is seeing strong selling pressure wiping off all the weekly gains. As of press time, the BTC price is trading 2.47% down at $93,915.9 with a market cap of $1.86 trillion. Furthermore, the BTC price is showing no strength in the derivatives market as the Bitcoin funding rates have dropped considerably. CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC noted: “In the recent Bitcoin rally, Funding Rates showed a sharp increase midway through the upward trend, suggesting a delayed influx of demand. However, after Bitcoin faced rejection at the $108K resistance, Funding Rates declined significantly”.

Users must do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. AI highlights SUI, TRON, and Rollblock as top Solana alternatives, with Rollblock’s GambleFi solutions leading the charge for Q1 2025 gains. Table of Contents Rollblock: A revolutionary platform with explosive potential SUI: Scaling blockchain to new heights TRON: The veteran blockchain that never slows down Conclusion Staying ahead of the curve is the key to successful crypto trading. Solana did numbers before falling 20% MoM post-US job data. The market fluctuations and FOMO had savvy analysts explore more potential profitable alternatives, and AI has done the heavy lifting. AI identified three top Solana alternatives to elevate user portfolio this quarter: SUI, TRON, and a new GambleFi underdog. Let’s explore what makes this trio the excellent gems for Q1 2025. Rollblock: A revolutionary platform with explosive potential Rollblock was the top pick for AI’s suggestions for Solana alternatives. This GambleFi ingenuity has proven to be so much more than the revolutionized iGaming solution. Importantly, it is built using provably fair gaming technology on the blockchain, ensuring everyone can verify that each bet is being overseen fairly and securely. Its income-generating feature adds to the allure. Users can earn passively by holding Rollblock, a rarity that made it even more attractive to AI. Also, holders can stake their tokens for an 18% APY yield. Rollblock’s presale proves just how much potential it holds. Selling at just $0.0445 and raising over $8.3 million to date. Its performance is remarkable, and that confirms its superior technical and market relevance.

The platform is positioned as a top choice for dApp developers who want reliability. SUI dedicated itself to usability and served different industries, such as gaming, finance, and social networking. This technical excellence has fueled SUI’s ecosystem growth. According to DeFiLlama, SUI’s TVL rode on the crest of this wave to a $2b ATH. The recent OKX Ventures investment in SUI’s Haedal Protocol has also fueled institutional interest. SUI is a technically rich product with a clear focus on being scalable, and it’s unsurprising it made AI’s picks. TRON: The veteran blockchain that never slows down Another alluring Solana alternative that made AI’s suggestions is TRON . TRON started as a decentralized content-sharing platform, expanded to DeFi and NFTs, and has solutions for the enterprise market. Because of its high throughput and low transaction costs, it is an attractive choice for users. TRON’s ecosystem continues to evolve, along with its strategic developments and partnerships. Recently, Bitget sealed a long-term partnership with TRON that included the acquisition of $10m TRX. This came weeks after Justin Sun hinted at an RLUSD launch on the network. Therefore, TRON is undoubtedly positioned to be one of the most important blockchain players to watch as the crypto market FOMO reaches a new peak. Conclusion Binance’s Fear and Greed Index reaching a weekly average of 70 signals growing FOMO, a time to get positioned for the next life-changing opportunity. However, SUI, TRON, and Rollblock present a golden opportunity for this. Although SUI and TRON have been impressive, Rollblock’s momentum has been extraordinary. Rollblock’s iGaming solutions and passive income allure present a compelling narrative for this quarter’s explosive run. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials.

Treasury yields have risen to 4.73%, their highest level since April 2024. Bitcoin’s price has dropped to $94,921, with altcoins also experiencing declines. Financial markets are getting tighter, with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and U.S. Treasury yields hitting new highs. The DXY is at 108.59, up 5.87% over the past year, while the 10-year Treasury yield is up to 4.73%, its highest point since April 2024. This is putting pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Why a Strong Dollar Hurts Crypto Higher Treasury yields make traditional financial instruments more attractive to investors. When bonds pay more, investors move their money away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Also, a strong U.S. dollar makes alternative investments like Bitcoin and altcoins less appealing because it’s a safer place to store value. Bitcoin’s price is down in the $94K range , a 3% drop.

This decline has sparked caution among investors, yet Dogecoin remains resilient, holding at a critical demand level. This zone could prove pivotal for the meme coin’s trajectory, as maintaining this support may lay the foundation for a fresh rally to new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Will Drop Before The Next Leg Up – Analyst Sets Target Top analyst CROW recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin’s potential to break above its multi-year trendline. According to CROW, such a breakout would be a game-changer, positioning Dogecoin for an aggressive rally. He suggests that $1 is only the first target in a series of upward movements that could redefine the market’s view of DOGE. The coming days will be crucial as Dogecoin battles between sustaining its current demand zone and the possibility of deeper corrections. With market sentiment split and broader crypto uncertainty, all eyes are on Dogecoin to see if it can capitalize on its strong demand and push through to reclaim its bullish narrative. Investors remain optimistic, awaiting confirmation of DOGE’s next big move in the ever-volatile cryptocurrency market. Dogecoin Prepares For A Breakout Dogecoin is holding strong at $0.34, a critical level that previously acted as supply but has now flipped into a robust demand zone. This price action highlights a significant shift in DOGE’s market dynamics, sparking optimism among investors. As the meme coin leader continues to set higher highs, the next target lies within higher supply zones, which could pave the way for further bullish momentum. Top analyst CROW recently shared a compelling technical analysis, emphasizing the monumental potential of Dogecoin. According to CROW, $1 is merely the first major milestone for DOGE as it emerges from the multi-year downtrend that began in 2021. Breaking free from this long-term bearish structure would not only solidify Dogecoin’s position as a market leader but also open the doors to price discovery, a phrase often associated with explosive gains. CROW’s analysis points out that Dogecoin’s chart is showing strong signs of accumulation, a critical phase in the market cycle that typically precedes massive rallies. If DOGE manages to reclaim the $1 level, it could trigger an influx of buying pressure, driving the price into uncharted territory. This potential shift underscores Dogecoin’s ability to capture market attention and maintain its place as a top-performing cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Solana Back Above Weekly & Monthly Support Levels – Analyst Expects New ATH With market sentiment cautiously optimistic and key technical indicators aligning, Dogecoin seems ready to embark on a new chapter of its journey. Investors are closely watching its movement around the $0.34 level, waiting for the breakout that could signal the start of an extraordinary rally. Price Action Showing Strength Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.34 after a clean breakdown from the $0.39 mark, a significant level of supply. Despite the recent decline, price action suggests strength as DOGE manages to hold its current level as a key demand zone. This resilience indicates that Dogecoin is positioned for a potential rebound if the broader market sentiment shifts positively. A market-wide recovery could set the stage for DOGE to challenge last year’s highs. The critical level to watch is $0.43—reclaiming and holding this mark would signal a massive bullish breakout. Such a move would likely draw significant buying pressure, propelling DOGE into a new phase of upward momentum and possibly price discovery. However, the downside risk remains. If Dogecoin fails to hold above the $0.33 level, selling pressure could intensify, leading to a deeper correction. Investors are keeping a close eye on these key levels as the market navigates through a period of uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Breakout Or Breakdown?

The swift reversal has left investors on edge as BTC now struggles to find stability around the $95K level. This critical support zone is pivotal in determining whether BTC can recover or face a deeper correction in the coming days. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared valuable insights on X, highlighting a concerning trend in Bitcoin’s network activity. According to Adler, the average weekly change in the number of active addresses on the Bitcoin network has dropped to extremely low values since crossing the $101K level. This metric, often a key indicator of market engagement, suggests waning momentum and a potential cooling in demand. With uncertainty dominating the market, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s ability to hold the $95K level and attract renewed buying pressure. Analysts warn that failing to establish support here could lead to further declines. However, if BTC manages to regain strength, the next push above $100K could mark a turning point in this volatile phase. The coming days will be critical in shaping BTC’s trajectory for the near term. Bitcoin Enters A Crucial Moment Bitcoin is navigating a critical phase after losing the $100K mark and dipping below the $98K level. This unexpected downturn has sparked concerns among investors and analysts, who are closely monitoring the $92K support level—a pivotal zone that could determine whether BTC reclaims its bullish momentum or extends its correction. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler recently shared insightful data on X, shedding light on the market’s current state. Adler highlighted that the average weekly change in the number of active addresses on the BTC network has dropped to extremely low values since crossing the $101K level. While this might seem bearish at first glance, Adler noted that this trend aligns with a bullish pattern when adjusted for volatility in the futures market. Historically, similar patterns have preceded significant rebounds, making the next few days critical for Bitcoin’s trajectory. The crypto community remains cautiously optimistic, as the broader market sentiment suggests the potential for a bullish run in the coming weeks. However, BTC must first establish a solid foundation above the $92K level to regain investor confidence. A successful rebound could pave the way for another attempt to break the psychological $100K mark, but failure to hold key support could signal further declines. Testing Crucial Demand Bitcoin is currently trading at $95,000 after experiencing a sharp 7% decline from the recent high of $102,300. This level is crucial for bulls to maintain strength and preserve the broader bullish structure that has defined Bitcoin’s price action in recent weeks. Holding above this zone is vital for setting the stage for a potential recovery and another attempt to reclaim the $100K mark. However, the market remains on edge as the $92K level emerges as the final line of defense. Losing this critical support could signal a significant shift in market sentiment, opening the door to a deeper correction toward the $85K level. Such a move would likely amplify bearish pressure, further testing investor confidence during this uncertain phase. Analysts emphasize that the current consolidation is a pivotal moment for BTC. If bulls manage to stabilize the price at $95K and regain momentum, the path to recovery could begin. Conversely, failure to hold the $92K mark would heighten the likelihood of prolonged consolidation or even a sharper downturn. The next few days will be decisive, with trading volumes and market sentiment playing key roles in determining Bitcoin’s direction.

Van Straten noted that government bond yields around the world have been rising in recent months, creating a challenging macroeconomic environment for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. The US 10-year Treasury yield, often considered a global benchmark, climbed to 4.70% as of today. That’s a significant increase of over 100 basis points since the Fed initiated its first rate cut in September. This trend is even more pronounced in the United Kingdom, where the 30-year Gilt yield hit 5.35% this week, its highest level since 1998. That represents a 105 basis point jump since the Fed’s policy change. Similar upward movements in bond yields have been seen in Germany, Italy and Japan. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield in particular rose to 1.18%, its highest level in nearly 15 years, despite historically low rates in the country. Related News: Experienced Analyst Assesses Bitcoin Price After the Decline: “It Should Never Fall Below This Level...” While these rising yields didn’t initially dampen the cryptocurrency rally, Bitcoin and other major digital assets reached record or multi-year highs in December before the market calmed down. Bitcoin, for example, is down more than 10% from its all-time high of $108,000 just three weeks ago, and several other major cryptocurrencies have seen steeper declines. One notable exception to this trend is China, where bond yields have fallen sharply amid growing deflationary concerns. According to The Kobeissi Letter, China is currently experiencing its longest period of deflation since 1999, a stark contrast to the inflation-driven yield increases seen elsewhere. *This is not investment advice.

For investors with an eye on sustainable long-term success, the viral cryptocurrency presale, 1FUEL is turning heads and winning over whales. Read on to find out why this secure crypto wallet is commanding investor attention and leading analysts to project early returns in excess of 500%, with 100x returns on public launch. 1FUEL’s incredible growth potential could outperform both Solana and Ethereum 1FUEL’s one-click, cross-train transactions – along with a laundry list of other privacy, security and user-friendly features – has cemented its potential for exponential growth. Those same features could well see it turning some very notable heads as Solana and Ethereum navigate expected corrections, likely to come down the pipeline in March. It’s no coincidence that 1FUEL’s viral cryptocurrency presale has already attracted whales from Solana and Ethereum. It has raced to more than $1,157,219 raised, with stage two 98% complete. When is the Solana and Ethereum correction likely to occur? According to experts such as Arthur Hayes (co-founder of BitMEX), coins like Solana and Ethereum are expected to hit the end of the bull run around March, amid a wider slowdown. Thereafter, a major correction is expected, which means Solana, Ethereum and others, including Bitcoin, could give up much of the ground they’ve gained since December. The correction could be triggered by several factors including wider market sentiment. While President Trump has signalled that he intends to be much more accommodating of crypto during his second term at the White House, it’s unlikely that he will make sweeping changes right away. The slower his more favourable legislation is, the more likely Solana and Ethereum will face a correction. One of the first orders of business for Trump will be renegotiating the debt ceiling to keep the government operational. Before the debt ceiling is raised, Solana, Ethereum and other coin prices will spike. Thereafter, a ‘dollar liquidity negative’ situation could throw a spanner in the works for bullish momentum, Hayes theorises . The key factors driving investor interest in 1FUEL 1FUEL is setting out to reimagine what the term ‘secure crypto wallet’ means in practice with an extensive list of advanced features, cleverly designed to combine extensive security and privacy safeguards with welcome ease of use. 1FUEL’s one-click, cross-chain technology heralds the beginning of an exciting new era for digital asset management. While existing platforms demand a certain degree of crypto literacy – effectively locking out millions of non-advanced users – 1FUEL is just the opposite. It does the heavy lifting behind the scenes, asking users to do nothing more than select their preferred token before it takes on the complexity of cross-chain transactions. 1FUEL’s AI-powered system handles everything, from navigating multiple exchanges to optimising transaction fees. There’s also an in-built privacy mixer and cold storage, which provides high degrees of protection while also remaining accessible. Additional privacy is assured by disposable temporary wallets, and a P2P exchange. Real and digital cards will provide accessibility and utility, setting 1FUEL up for widespread use.

Recent developments indicate that US states are keen to protect people from the threat of inflation. The Bitcoin Freedom Act introduced in the Oklahoma law-making house by Senator Dusty Deevers is the latest example. How much can this law impact the United States society? Let’s dive into the details! Ready? What is the Bitcoin Freedom Act? The act proposes that Oklahomans should be provided a chance to choose whether they want to receive their wages in Bitcoin or not. It also submits that businesses should be allowed to accept payments in Bitcoin. Why is the Bitcoin Freedom Act Significant? At the start of 2024, the US inflation rate stood at just 3.1%. In March, it touched a peak of 3.5%. Though in November it came down to 2.7%, it was far higher than the 1.2% inflation recorded in the same month in 2020. Growing inflation is one of the most serious threats the US economy is facing right now. Rising inflation means falling purchasing power. Bitcoin can save people from losing their purchasing power to inflation, as its total supply is fixed, and thus is unaffected by the threat of devaluation unlike traditional currencies. Oklahoma’s Leadership in Financial Innovation The introduction of the bill is likely to make a serious impact across the United States. The action has lifted the state to the celebrated position of innovation-friendly economies. It may encourage many to enter the world of financial innovation confidently. The Future of the Bitcoin Freedom Act The political stance against the cryptocurrency industry shifted when Republican candidate Donald Trump, who projected himself as a pro-crypto candidate, defeated Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who represented a crypto-skeptic regime, in the US presidential election. In the latest election, the Republican Party received a massive majority in Oklahoma, a US state that has emerged as a stronghold of Republicans, especially since 2011. The Bitcoin Freedom Act, also known as SB325, is expected to be discussed in the 60th legislative session of the 60th legislature. Reports say that the session will begin on February 3, 2025. In conclusion, the Bitcoin Freedom Act is more than legislation – it is a step toward financial empowerment and innovation.
