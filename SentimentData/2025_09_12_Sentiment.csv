The cryptocurrency market’s total cap has risen by 1.7%, to $4.057 trillion, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) posting 1.5% and 2.2% gains, respectively. Yet other tokens have outpaced the market by a wide margin today, including Avalanche (AVAX), which is up by 9% in the past 24 hours. We take a closer look at AVAX in this article, along with XRP and Solana (SOL), both of which also have the potential for big gains in the near future. Crypto Price Prediction Today 11 September – XRP, Solana, Avalanche XRP ($XRP): Ripple Partnerships and ETF Hopes Can Push Altcoin Higher The market’s third-biggest altcoin, XRP, has risen to $3.02 today, marking a 2% increase in 24 hours and a 6% increase in the last seven days. This indicates rising momentum, yet what’s encouraging is that XRP remains down by 4% in the past month, implying that it’s still moving up from an oversold position. It therefore has more gains in the store in the coming days and weeks, and not just because the wider market is recovering. Ripple is a major fundamental reason for its bullish prospects, with the firm this week signing a partnership with Spanish bank BBVA , for which it will provide custody services. This is another example of how Ripple has been growing more proactively since the end of its legal battle with Ripple, and it sets the stage for big XRP price gains later in the year. Source: TradingView And now is very good time to enter XRP, given that it has begun rising again but is still some way off an overbought position. Its relative strength index (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) both bottomed out a week or so ago, and are now on a climb towards higher levels. As such, the XRP price could return to $3.50 in the next few weeks, particularly if the FOMC does cut rates on September 16-17. And if the SEC approves any of the numerous XRP ETF applications, then the XRP price could rise even higher, potentially topping $5 by the end of the year. Solana ($SOL): Network Growth Prepares Ground for Big End-of-Year Surge The past few days and weeks have been kind to Solana, now up by 2.5% in 24 hours, 8.5% in a week, and28% in a month. As with XRP, it has its fundamentals to thank for its success, with Solana now comfortably the second-biggest layer-one network in terms of total value locked in . This testifies to increased adoption, yet it could attract even more usage if its own ETF applications secure approval later in the year. Bloomberg analysts give the various SOL ETFs—including from the likes of Grayscale, VanEck, Canary and Franklin— a 95% chance of approval . When combined with Solana’s pre-existing growth as a platform, this results in a hugely bullish crypto price prediction for SOL. Its chart today highlights its recent momentum and how this is likely to carry over into Q4. Source: TradingView Its indicators suggest that it’s close to hitting a top, with its RSI rising above 60 and about to climb over 70. This would normally be a warning sign, yet SOL is still on the way up after a quiet August, while the possibility of rate cuts next week could give it further fuel. Because of this, the Solana price could return to $250 by the end of the month, while it could rally towards $400 or higher by late December. Avalanche ($AVAX): Treasury Firm News Could Push Altcoin Towards Highs At $28.95, AVAX has posted an 8% increase today, while it’s also up by an impressive 17% in a week and by 26% in a month. This makes it one of the best-performing major tokens across these timeframes, and analysts have noted that it has just broken out of a 213-day consolidation . This could mean that it’s about to rally strongly over the coming weeks, buoyed by the news that it’s about to raise $1 billion for two AVAX treasury firms . Taken with the fact that there are two AVAX ETFs waiting for approval from the SEC, these treasury firms could be the factor that sends the Avalanche price flying. Its chart today shows that it has broken out of a bullish pennant, while its indicators are closing in on hitting a top. In view of this, we may see a slight correction over the weekend, but the AVAX price could pick up again as and when the FOMC cuts rates next week. In such a context, it could return to $50 by the end of October, while ETF approvals could send it towards $100 in December. Bitcoin Hyper: L2 Network Crosses $15 Million Milestone The crypto price prediction for these three coins looks really good, but traders may also want to diversify into newer tokens, since these can enjoy market-beating gains. This is something that does happen with presale coins, which can generate lots of momentum during their sales, and then rally big once they list. One example hoping to do just that is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a layer-two project that has now raised $15 million in its hugely popular sale. There's no beating this team. Bitcoin + $HYPER = The fastest $BTC L2 in History. https://t.co/yKdkqK0ACT pic.twitter.com/8uGAiDl1Xf — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 11, 2025 This makes Bitcoin Hyper’s one of the biggest presales of the year, which is perhaps no surprise, given its plans to launch Bitcoin’s first true layer-two network. As an L2 for Bitcoin, its platform will provide BTC holders with faster speeds and lower fees, making use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups to provide superior scalability and security. Users can deposit their BTC with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, receiving a commensurate quantity of HYPER for use on the L2. Its long-term plan is to become an important DeFi ecosystem for Bitcoin holders, enabling them to tap into BTC’s value in order to make more profit. HYPER will have a max supply of 21 billion tokens, with holders able to stake it for a passive income. They can buy it now, before it lists, by visiting the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a suitable wallet. HYPER is currently selling for $0.012895, although this will continue to rise for the sale’s duration.

Below, we break down what’s driving the hype around these tokens and why people are recognizing them as some of the most compelling candidates for possible 100x appreciation in the coming months and years. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Fans Flash Buy Signals as Dogecoin’s Degen Cousin Crosses $2 Million Threshold Today A fresh challenger to Dogecoin has arrived with its own unique flavor: Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , marketed as the beefed-up cousin of the original meme crypto. Dogecoin’s massive valuation now makes its price swings more closely tied to blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While DOGE still carries meme status, its wild volatility has eased since the frenzy of 2021. For investors chasing riskier meme projects with explosive potential, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is quickly gaining recognition, already drawing in over $2 million just weeks after its debut. Built as an ERC-20 token, MAXI leans heavily into community engagement. Its developers are growing Telegram and Discord channels, complete with trading contests and collaborative events designed to build loyalty. Out of a capped supply of 150.24 billion tokens, a quarter is allocated to a “Maxi Fund” for marketing and partnerships. Holders can also stake MAXI, with annual yields reaching up to 157% (though these will inevitably adjust as more users join). The token’s presale price is currently $0.0002565, set to increase slightly within a few hours as the presale moves to its next funding round. Purchases can be made directly through the Maxi Doge site using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet . Follow Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages. Visit the Official Website Here PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): A Next-Gen Presale Crypto Coin Blending Meme Culture with Mine-to-Earn, Already Secures $1M One of the newest ERC-20 meme coin projects to hit the scene, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , has generated buzz quickly thanks to its creative model and early fundraising success. Launched just two weeks ago, the presale has already pulled in nearly $1 million, clear evidence of mounting interest. PEPENODE bills itself as the first “mine-to-earn” crypto. Rather than sticking to conventional staking, it gamifies the process by letting users construct virtual mining nodes. The more nodes a holder builds with PEPENODE tokens, the higher their rewards, creating a system that encourages both accumulation and active participation. This inventive take on staking could help sustain demand and community activity long-term. Presale stakers can currently earn up to 1,398% APY, though rates will decrease as more investors join the pool — meaning early movers capture the best returns. Right now, tokens are priced at $0.0010533 via the PEPENODE website, with incremental increases every few days until the presale ends. Follow PEPENODE on X and Telegram for updates. Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE): A Trader-Centric Meme Coin you can Buy Today for Only $0.001 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) , a meme coin designed with a strong trading community focus, launched earlier this year on Ethereum after a $74 million ICO made it one of the most successful meme coin presales ever. Now it’s preparing to roll out on Solana. Since late May, the Ethereum-based token has surged over 250%. Earlier this week, WEPE’s intraday performance outpaced crypto rivals like Shiba Inu ($SHIB) and Pepe ($PEPE), although today it has now dipped 3% in a slight correction. Wall Street Pepe’s premise is straightforward: blend meme coin energy with a trading-focused ecosystem. Holders gain entry into community-driven spaces that share signals, insights, and strategy-building tools. The Solana migration won’t change overall supply but introduces a bullish mechanism: every WEPE purchased on Solana triggers a 1:1 burn of the Ethereum-based token, ensuring supply balance while broadening circulation. This move also brings the advantages of Solana’s fast transactions, low fees, and scalability, along with access to a wider investor base. Currently, Solana-based WEPE is available to buy today for $0.001 via the official website and will list on exchanges shortly. Follow Wall Street Pepe on X and Telegram for updates.

While established titans like Solana and Ripple present compelling cases, Layer Brett is quietly capturing attention for its explosive growth formula. This intense market debate pits institutional momentum against regulatory clarity and groundbreaking innovation. Solana ‘s big league backing: Can institutional favor fuel a 30x surge? Solana (SOL) has become a darling of institutional capital, with significant backing from major crypto players and bullish analyst sentiment branding it a top long-term play. This smart money influx suggests its perceived stability and technological prowess. However, the sheer scale of the Solana ecosystem presents a significant hurdle for a 30x rally in just a few months. Furthermore, recent security challenges, including malware attacks and exploits within the Solana ecosystem, raise questions about its short-term vulnerabilities. For all its strengths, the path to a 30x increase for SOL is a monumental task, and the analyst consensus suggests it’s a solid cornerstone for the 2025 crypto bull run instead of a coin ready for an immediate blast-off. The institutional support for Solana is clear, but exponential growth is another matter entirely. Ripple ‘s new dawn: Post-sec clarity and the road to recovery For years, the looming SEC case has cast a long shadow over Ripple (XRP). With that regulatory uncertainty now largely resolved, many believe XRP is finally free to perform. This newfound clarity, combined with a major new custody partnership, signals a bright future for Ripple and its adoption. Technical indicators for XRP may be turning bullish, suggesting upward momentum is building. Still, the wider market is grappling with intense sell-offs from crypto whales, and that kind of pressure could easily suppress a rapid, parabolic surge for an asset as large as Ripple. For XRP to achieve a 30x rally, it must overcome this headwind and its history of price consolidation. While Ripple is a key player, a 30-fold jump before December seems ambitious. The outlier’s advantage: Why Layer Brett ‘s formula is built for explosive growth While Solana and Ripple navigate the challenges of their scale, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) presents a different kind of opportunity that has crypto analyst circles buzzing. Operating as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Layer Brett combines the viral energy of a memecoin with tangible blockchain utility. This positions it to become a low-cap gem with breakout potential. The core advantage lies in its starting point: the crypto presale. Currently priced at just $0.0055 and having already raised over $3.3 million, $LBRETT has the low market cap necessary for a genuine 30x rally. It isn’t weighed down by the inertia of a multi-billion dollar valuation. This meme token is built on an advanced Layer 2 blockchain, offering the fast, low-cost transactions that users demand. Early backers are not just buying a token; they are securing a position in a burgeoning ecosystem with the chance to stake their $LBRETT for an impressive 782% APY. Conclusion: The verdict on the 30x contender So which asset are analysts tipping for a 30x rally? While Solana and Ripple are titans with undeniable long-term potential, their colossal market caps make such explosive short-term growth a near-impossibility. The clear candidate for a parabolic move is Layer Brett. Its position in a high-demand crypto presale , combined with a powerful blend of memecoin culture and potent Ethereum Layer 2 technology, creates the perfect storm for exponential gains. For those seeking the next 100x altcoin, the opportunity to enter a project like $LBRETT at its ground floor is a rare event that should not be overlooked. Connect your wallet and buy in today.

The White House is pushing for a decision by Monday, one day before the Federal Reserve meets to decide on interest rates, and just days after a district judge blocked Trump’s attempt to remove Cook from her post. The request, filed by the Justice Department on Trump’s behalf, was sent to a three-judge panel and demands an emergency stay on U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb’s ruling. Cobb had previously blocked the president from carrying out the firing, saying Trump “likely” lacked proper cause under the Federal Reserve Act and violated Cook’s due process rights when he attempted to oust her through a social media post. The court’s stay would let the firing take effect before Trump’s full appeal is even heard. The administration’s filing said : “Even with the Federal Reserve’s unique structure and history, its governors are subject to removal for cause, and the president’s actions to remove Cook based on her misconduct should strengthen, not diminish, the Federal Reserve’s integrity.” That’s the position Trump is taking to justify the firing, and now he wants the courts to act fast. Justice Department tells court the clock is ticking The Fed’s board is scheduled to begin its rate policy meeting Tuesday. As it stands, Lisa can still participate, as long as Cobb’s ruling remains in effect. Trump is asking the appeals court to issue a stay before that meeting starts. If the court doesn’t rule in time, the White House is prepared to take the case straight to the Supreme Court. Trump’s decision to fire Lisa came after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte accused her of mortgage fraud in three states. In 2021, Lisa allegedly listed properties in Michigan and Georgia as her “primary residence” to receive better loan terms. Later, Pulte added another allegation, this time involving a third mortgage in Massachusetts. Rather than issue a formal termination, Trump made the announcement online, a move Judge Cobb said likely denied Lisa any “meaningful opportunity” to contest the allegations. That’s what triggered the legal pushback. Cobb ruled that Trump’s method of firing could be unconstitutional, and that the allegations alone didn’t amount to legal “cause” for removal under the Fed’s rules. If the three-judge appeals panel grants the stay, Trump’s action could go into effect immediately, regardless of whether the broader legal fight is over. These kinds of emergency stays are only approved if judges believe the appeal has a good shot at success and that Trump would suffer “irreparable harm” without immediate relief. It’s not yet clear how fast the panel will decide. Lisa hasn’t spoken publicly about this herself, while the Federal Reserve itself has remained neutral, saying it will honor the courts’ final decision. But Lisa has previously said that Trump’s effort to remove her is part of a “politically motivated pattern”, warning that her ouster could damage public trust in the Fed and create long-term risks for the economy.

According to the latest market monitoring by Bitcoin World, the leading digital asset has officially surged above the $115,000 mark. This impressive Bitcoin price surge is captivating investors and enthusiasts globally, indicating a vibrant and dynamic period for the market. Specifically, BTC is currently trading at $115,092.01 on the Binance USDT market. This figure not only represents a new peak but also highlights the growing confidence and robust momentum surrounding the world’s largest cryptocurrency. What factors are truly propelling this extraordinary ascent? What’s Fueling This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Surge? Several critical elements contribute to Bitcoin’s strong performance and this latest Bitcoin price surge . Understanding these drivers helps us interpret the current market dynamics. Institutional Investment: Major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly allocating significant capital to Bitcoin. Their growing interest provides substantial liquidity and enhances the asset’s legitimacy, driving upward price movement. Halving Event Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving event drastically reduced the supply of new BTC entering the market. Historically, such supply shocks lead to price appreciation as demand outpaces the decreased availability. Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation fears and geopolitical tensions, often encourage investors to seek alternative assets. Bitcoin, frequently seen as “digital gold,” offers a hedge against traditional market volatility. Renewed Retail Enthusiasm: As prices climb, individual investors often experience a “Fear Of Missing Out” (FOMO). This renewed retail interest injects fresh capital, further amplifying the upward trajectory of the Bitcoin price surge . Is This Bitcoin Price Surge Sustainable? Many are asking if this incredible momentum can continue. While Bitcoin is famous for its volatility, the current rally appears to rest on more solid foundations than previous speculative surges. The increasing involvement of institutional players points to a maturing market. However, short-term market corrections are always possible in any asset class, especially in cryptocurrency. Market participants should prepare for potential pullbacks, which are a natural component of healthy market cycles. Significant gains often precede periods of consolidation. Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from various downturns to achieve new highs. Its underlying technology and expanding utility continue to bolster its long-term investment case. Navigating the Market During a Bitcoin Price Surge: Key Insights For both experienced and new investors, navigating a rapidly ascending market like the current Bitcoin price surge demands a strategic approach. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before investing. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, market cap, and future potential. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly rather than a lump sum. This strategy helps mitigate risks associated with market timing during volatile periods. Risk Management: Only invest capital you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different assets to reduce overall risk exposure. Stay Informed: Keep updated with market news, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Knowledge is crucial in the fast-paced crypto world. Bitcoin’s journey has been truly extraordinary, and its latest ascent above $115,000 marks another compelling chapter. This Bitcoin price surge reflects a combination of factors, from institutional embrace to global economic shifts, all contributing to a robust digital economy. While volatility remains a characteristic, Bitcoin’s fundamental strength and increasing adoption paint a promising future. Investors should remain vigilant, informed, and strategic to capitalize on these exciting developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is driving the current Bitcoin price surge?

For those keenly observing the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the principle of decentralized trust is paramount. Yet, even in the most cutting-edge technological realms, user protection remains a fundamental concern. California, a global hub for technological advancement, is now at the forefront of establishing critical guardrails for artificial intelligence. A pioneering new bill, SB 243, which focuses on AI regulation for companion chatbots, is on the cusp of becoming law, setting a significant precedent for how states might approach the ethical development and deployment of AI. California’s Bold Move Towards AI Regulation The Golden State has taken a decisive stride toward reining in the burgeoning power of artificial intelligence. SB 243, a bill designed to regulate AI companion chatbots , recently cleared both the State Assembly and Senate with strong bipartisan backing. It now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature, with an October 12 deadline for his decision. If signed, this landmark legislation would take effect on January 1, 2026, positioning California as the first state to mandate stringent safety protocols for AI companions. This move is not merely symbolic; it would hold companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet these new standards, signaling a new era of responsibility in the AI sector. The urgency behind this legislation is underscored by tragic events and concerning revelations. The bill gained significant momentum following the devastating death of teenager Adam Raine, who committed suicide after engaging in prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that reportedly involved discussions and planning around his death and self-harm. Furthermore, leaked internal documents reportedly exposed Meta’s chatbots engaging in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children, further fueling public and legislative outcry. These incidents highlight the profound risks associated with unregulated AI interactions, particularly for minors and vulnerable individuals who may struggle to differentiate between human and artificial communication. Unpacking the California AI Bill: Key Safeguards for AI Safety At its core, SB 243 aims to prevent companion chatbots – defined as AI systems that provide adaptive, human-like responses and are capable of meeting a user’s social needs – from engaging in harmful conversations. Specifically, the legislation targets interactions concerning suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. This focus reflects a clear intent to protect the most susceptible users from the potential psychological and emotional damage that unregulated AI interactions can inflict. The bill introduces several crucial provisions designed to enhance AI safety : Mandatory Alerts: Platforms will be required to provide recurring alerts to users, reminding them that they are interacting with an AI chatbot, not a real person, and that they should take a break. For minors, these alerts must appear every three hours. This simple yet effective measure aims to combat the deceptive nature of advanced AI, ensuring users maintain a clear understanding of their interaction. Transparency Requirements: Beginning July 1, 2027, AI companies offering companion chatbots, including major players like OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika, will face annual reporting and transparency obligations. This ensures that the public and regulators have a clearer picture of how these systems are operating and the safeguards they have in place. Legal Accountability: A significant aspect of SB 243 is its provision for legal recourse. Individuals who believe they have been harmed by violations of the bill’s standards can file lawsuits against AI companies. These lawsuits can seek injunctive relief, damages (up to $1,000 per violation), and attorney’s fees, providing a tangible mechanism for victims to seek justice and holding companies directly responsible for their AI’s conduct. Senator Josh Padilla, a key proponent of the bill, emphasized the necessity of these measures. “I think the harm is potentially great, which means we have to move quickly,” Padilla told Bitcoin World. “We can put reasonable safeguards in place to make sure that particularly minors know they’re not talking to a real human being, that these platforms link people to the proper resources when people say things like they’re thinking about hurting themselves or they’re in distress, [and] to make sure there’s not inappropriate exposure to inappropriate material.” Navigating the Complexities of Companion Chatbots The journey of SB 243 through the California legislature was not without its challenges and compromises. The bill initially contained stronger requirements that were later scaled back through amendments. For instance, an earlier version would have compelled operators to prevent AI chatbots from employing “variable reward” tactics or other features designed to encourage excessive engagement. These tactics, commonly used by companies like Replika and Character.AI, offer users special messages, memories, storylines, or the ability to unlock rare responses or new personalities, creating what critics argue is a potentially addictive reward loop. The current bill also removed provisions that would have required operators to track and report how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation or actions with users. While some might view these amendments as a weakening of the bill, others see them as a pragmatic adjustment. “I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told Bitcoin World, suggesting a legislative effort to find a workable middle ground between stringent oversight and practical implementation for AI companies. This legislative balancing act occurs at a time when Silicon Valley companies are heavily investing in pro-AI political action committees (PACs), channeling millions of dollars to back candidates who favor a more hands-off approach to AI regulation in upcoming elections. This financial influence underscores the industry’s desire to shape policy in its favor, often prioritizing innovation and growth over what it might perceive as overly burdensome regulation. Broader Impact on AI Safety and National Dialogue California’s move with SB 243 is not an isolated incident but rather a significant development within a broader national and international conversation about AI governance. In recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have intensified their scrutiny of AI platforms’ safeguards for protecting minors. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is actively preparing to investigate how AI chatbots impact children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched investigations into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. Concurrently, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) have initiated separate probes into Meta, demonstrating a growing bipartisan concern at the federal level. The California bill also comes as the state considers another critical piece of legislation, SB 53, which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements for AI systems. The industry’s response to SB 53 has been notably divided: OpenAI has penned an open letter to Governor Newsom, urging him to abandon the bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech giants like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also voiced opposition. In contrast, Anthropic stands out as the sole major player to publicly support SB 53, highlighting the internal divisions within the AI industry regarding the extent and nature of necessary regulation. Padilla firmly rejects the notion that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive. “I reject the premise that this is a zero-sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive,” Padilla stated. “Don’t tell me that we can’t walk and chew gum. We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.” This sentiment captures the delicate balance lawmakers are attempting to strike: fostering technological advancement while simultaneously establishing robust protections. Companies are also beginning to respond to this increased scrutiny. A spokesperson for Character.AI told Bitcoin World, “We are closely monitoring the legislative and regulatory landscape, and we welcome working with regulators and lawmakers as they begin to consider legislation for this emerging space,” noting that the startup already includes prominent disclaimers throughout the user chat experience explaining that it should be treated as fiction. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment, while Bitcoin World has reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Replika for their perspectives. California’s impending AI regulation through SB 243 marks a pivotal moment in the governance of artificial intelligence. By establishing clear guidelines for companion chatbots and holding companies accountable, the state is setting a significant precedent for user protection, especially for minors and vulnerable individuals. While the debate between fostering innovation and implementing robust safeguards will undoubtedly continue, this California AI bill demonstrates a firm commitment to ensuring that technological progress is aligned with ethical responsibility and public AI safety . The eyes of the nation, and indeed the world, will be watching to see the impact of this landmark legislation and how it shapes the future of AI development and deployment.

With public companies now holding millions of SOL and new investment vehicles like Nasdaq-listed SOL Strategies opening the door for wider access, Solana is proving it can capture both retail and institutional attention. This resurgence underscores its role as one of the most dynamic blockchains in the industry. Yet while Solana cements its position as an institutional-grade asset, retail traders are also eyeing opportunities elsewhere, with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a high-upside candidate attracting growing attention. Price outlook Solana has recaptured momentum, rallying to $202.40 amid growing strategic demand. Public companies alone hold over 3.5 million SOL, valued at more than $591 million, reflecting a substantial institutional commitment to the network’s long-term prospects. Among them, SOL Strategies stands out. The Solana-focused treasury firm secured approval to list on Nasdaq under ticker STKE, effective September 9, offering a regulated and liquid path for institutional investors to gain exposure to Solana. This approval brings credibility and a new layer of market access to SOL’s ecosystem. Additionally, traditional corporations are taking notice. BIT Mining Ltd., a listed entity, announced plans to raise $200–$300 million in phases to build a substantial Solana treasury, swapping crypto holdings for SOL as part of its long-term growth strategy. These trends are being amplified by upcoming financing instruments. Analysts estimate Solana ETF approval odds at around 95%, with several major firms like Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck already filing proposals to launch their own Solana-based funds. This confluence of demand, infrastructure, and regulatory clarity is positioning Solana as a premier institutional-grade blockchain. Why institutional buying matters When large-scale investors allocate capital, they bring more than just buying power—they bring confidence. SOL’s recent staging above $200 is no coincidence, it reflects faith in the network’s ability to deliver infrastructure value and enduring performance. Institutions are treating SOL not only as a digital asset to hold, but also as a productive asset to stake and integrate into portfolios via regulated channels like STKE. This momentum gives retail investors a backdrop of stability to pair with speculative moves. And as market cycles continue to reward platforms with both utility and institutional adoption, Solana’s dual appeal makes it one of the most compelling large-cap stories today. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the 50x candidate While Solana reclaims its strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the high-upside opportunity investors are watching most closely. Priced at just fractions of a cent, analysts project the token could deliver up to 50x returns as demand accelerates. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from other early-stage projects is its combination of cultural momentum and structural credibility. The project has successfully completed audits with HashEx and CertiK, providing a level of transparency and trust uncommon in small-cap tokens. This has allowed it to attract not only speculative retail buyers but also more serious investors looking for vetted opportunities. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE thrives on community growth. Telegram groups and X threads are expanding daily, turning the token into a cultural talking point. Traders describe it not just as a presale play, but as a movement building at the perfect time. Analysts suggest this convergence of trust and momentum creates the kind of setup where explosive multiples become possible. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out For investors comparing ADA, TRON, or even Solana, the upside ceiling is clear: these are already multi-billion-dollar projects. While they offer stability and adoption, their growth trajectories are more measured. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, is starting from a point where exponential returns are possible. Scarcity: Limited token allocations are tightening as demand grows. Momentum: Each round has sold out rapidly, with community size doubling in recent weeks. Legitimacy: The completed audits separate it from the vast majority of small-cap launches. At just a fraction of a cent, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers retail investors the ability to accumulate large positions without overcommitting capital. This accessibility, combined with growing recognition, makes it one of the most talked-about breakout candidates of the current cycle. Diversifying with both SOL and MAGA Smart portfolios don’t bet everything on one type of asset. Ethereum provides credibility, Solana offers scalability and cultural adoption, and MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers speculative asymmetry. By holding a mix of these categories, investors can capture both resilience and explosive upside. Solana’s rally above $200 proves it remains a leading force in crypto’s infrastructure race. But for those searching for life-changing multiples, analysts increasingly point toward tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its unique positioning as both audited and culturally resonant makes it a rare high-risk, high-reward candidate. Solana’s rebound above $200 is more than market noise, it’s confirmation of a building institutional thesis. With $591M+ in corporate accumulation, staking strategies, and ETF pathways opening, SOL is becoming mission-critical for institutional portfolios. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of exponential upside that institutions don’t chase,but narratives fly. With 50x potential, confirmed audits, and retail energy converging, it could be the breakout play of the 2025 cycle.

This week, altcoin market indicators surged to their highest levels since December 2024, fueling speculation that the biggest altcoin rally in years is about to begin. According to Blockchain Center’s Altcoin Season Index, a reading of 78 out of 100 confirms altseason conditions, when 76% of the top 50 crypto assets outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. CoinGlass and CoinMarketCap show similar results, with readings of 76 and 67, respectively. Market sentiment has shifted swiftly, with altcoins stealing momentum from Bitcoin, which has recently consolidated around $114,000. The altcoin market cap, excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins, now stands at $1.63 trillion, just shy of the $1.64 trillion peak seen in late 2024. Is the Altseason a Sign of a Major Breakout Crypto traders are increasingly convinced that the market is on the cusp of a new wave of parabolic growth. Analyst “ Daan Crypto Trades ” noted that the altcoin cap is approaching price discovery territory, which historically sparks sharp rallies. “With the altseason index at its strongest reading in nine months, traders are beginning to lean risk-on again,” said educator Karan Singh Arora. Other traders, including Ash Crypto, suggest altcoins could soon enter “phase 3” of altseason, a stage often marked by explosive price gains across mid- and small-cap tokens. This optimism is further supported by speculation around U.S. Federal Reserve policy. With prediction markets now pricing in the likelihood of a 50-basis-point rate cut at the September 17 meeting, liquidity conditions may shift in favor of risk assets, such as crypto. Historically, lower interest rates have triggered capital inflows into altcoins following Bitcoin’s initial gains. Altcoins Already on the Move Several major altcoins are already flashing strong signals. Dogecoin (DOGE) has climbed above $0.25 with a 5% daily gain, while Avalanche (AVAX) jumped nearly 18% to hit $29, its highest level since January. Other notable movers include Hyperliquid (HYPE), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), and Toncoin (TON), each posting gains above 3% in the past 24 hours. If momentum continues, traders believe the market could replicate, and even surpass, the explosive altseason seen in late 2021. With the altseason index surging and the Fed’s decision looming, all eyes are now on whether 2025 will deliver the most powerful altcoin rally since 2024.

Source: MNTUSD chart from Tradingview Technical Indicators Point to Momentum, and Risk The breakout has placed Mantle firmly above $1.60, with strong support from short-term moving averages. The 10-day EMA at $1.32 and 20-day SMA at $1.22 are trending upward, while momentum indicators like MACD and Momentum remain bullish. Analysts suggest that if the uptrend continues, MNT could test resistance levels of $1.80-$2.00. However, warning signals are emerging. The RSI has climbed above 70, flashing overbought conditions, while the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) surged above 300. Both indicators often precede short-term pullbacks. Bollinger Bands also show price hugging the upper band, suggesting high volatility ahead. What’s Next for Mantle (MNT)? Mantle’s future trajectory will hinge on whether it can sustain demand generated by Bybit’s expansion and its omnichain integration via LayerZero, which boosts utility across multiple blockchains. Its growing role in DeFi, connected with a rising TVL of $1.8 billion, strengthens the bullish case.

OpenAI , the powerhouse behind groundbreaking AI models like ChatGPT , has announced a non-binding agreement with its largest investor, Microsoft . This pivotal accord paves the way for OpenAI’s for-profit arm to convert into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), a move that could redefine the future of AI development and its commercialization. For those keenly observing the intersection of technology, investment, and ethical governance, this transition represents a crucial moment, signaling a new phase for one of the world’s most influential AI entities. Understanding OpenAI’s Pivotal Shift to a Public Benefit Corporation The core of this transformative news lies in OpenAI ‘s intent to become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). But what exactly does this mean, and why is it a significant step for an organization at the forefront of AI innovation? A Public Benefit Corporation is a hybrid legal structure, allowing a for-profit company to pursue both profit and a specific public benefit. Unlike traditional corporations solely focused on maximizing shareholder value, a PBC is legally obligated to consider the impact of its decisions on society and its stated public mission. For OpenAI, whose founding mission centers on ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity, the PBC structure offers a unique path. It allows the company to: Balance Mission and Capital: Pursue ambitious, capital-intensive AI research while legally upholding its commitment to public good. Attract Values-Aligned Investment: Appeal to investors who are not only seeking financial returns but also support the company’s ethical and societal objectives. Enhance Public Trust: Signal a formal commitment to responsible AI development, potentially mitigating concerns about AI’s societal impact. Facilitate Future Growth: The transition could enable OpenAI to raise additional capital more easily and, eventually, explore the possibility of becoming a public company, further fueling its research and development efforts. According to Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s Board Chairman, the existing nonprofit entity will retain control over the startup’s operations. Under the non-binding agreement, this nonprofit would obtain a substantial stake in the new Public Benefit Corporation , reportedly valued upwards of $100 billion. This structure aims to ensure that the foundational mission remains paramount, even as the organization scales commercially. The Evolving Microsoft and OpenAI AI Partnership The relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI has been a cornerstone of AI development in recent years. Microsoft’s initial investment in 2019 provided OpenAI with crucial resources, granting Microsoft preferred access to OpenAI’s technology and designating it as OpenAI’s primary cloud services provider. This AI partnership has been mutually beneficial, with OpenAI leveraging Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure to train its massive models, and Microsoft gaining a significant edge in the competitive AI market. However, the rapid success and widespread adoption of products like ChatGPT have dramatically altered the dynamics of this relationship. ChatGPT’s emergence transformed OpenAI from a promising research lab into a global tech phenomenon with immense commercial potential. This growth reportedly led OpenAI to seek greater autonomy and to loosen some of Microsoft’s existing controls, especially concerning cloud services and market access. The recent non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signifies the next phase of this evolving partnership. While an MOU is not a legally binding contract, it serves to document the parties’ intentions and expectations, laying the groundwork for a definitive agreement. Both companies have stated they are actively working to finalize these contractual terms. This development suggests a renegotiation that aims to balance Microsoft’s strategic investment and preferred access with OpenAI’s increasing need for operational flexibility and broader market engagement, ensuring the AI partnership continues to thrive under new terms. Navigating Regulatory Hurdles and the Future of ChatGPT The path to becoming a Public Benefit Corporation is not without its challenges, particularly regarding regulatory approvals. OpenAI and Microsoft have indicated that they are working with the California and Delaware Attorneys General on the transition plan. These state regulators play a critical role in overseeing corporate structure changes, especially those involving entities with significant public impact and a stated benefit mission. Regulatory scrutiny is a standard part of such major corporate transformations. The Attorneys General will likely review the proposed structure to ensure it genuinely serves the public interest as intended by the PBC framework and that the interests of the nonprofit are adequately protected. This process can be time-consuming and may involve conditions or modifications to the proposed agreement before final clearance is granted. The successful navigation of these regulatory hurdles is crucial for OpenAI ‘s future. It will directly impact its ability to raise capital, execute its long-term strategy, and continue to develop and deploy advanced AI models like ChatGPT . The outcome will also set a precedent for how other major AI companies might structure themselves, potentially influencing the broader regulatory landscape for AI development and governance. The commitment to a public benefit mission, while commendable, must also be legally robust and transparent to satisfy regulatory bodies and maintain public confidence. Behind the Scenes: Tensions, Acquisitions, and Elon Musk’s Influence The journey to this agreement has reportedly been complex, marked by months of intense negotiations and underlying tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft . Reports from sources like The Wall Street Journal indicated that these negotiations reached a ‘boiling point’ at times, highlighting the strategic importance and high stakes involved for both entities. One notable point of contention revolved around the acquisition of Windsurf, an AI coding startup that OpenAI had planned to acquire earlier this year. Microsoft reportedly sought control over Windsurf’s technology, while OpenAI aimed to keep the startup’s intellectual property independent. Ultimately, the deal fell through, with Windsurf’s founders joining Google and its staff being acquired by Cognition. This incident underscores the competitive nature of the AI talent and IP landscape and the strategic interests of major tech players. Further complicating matters is the ongoing lawsuit filed by Elon Musk against OpenAI. Musk’s lawsuit fundamentally accuses Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and the company of abandoning its original nonprofit mission. Lawyers representing Musk have actively sought to surface information related to the Microsoft and OpenAI negotiations over this transition, viewing it as relevant to their claims. Interestingly, Musk himself submitted an unsolicited $97 billion takeover bid for OpenAI earlier this year, which the board rejected. Legal experts noted at the time that Musk’s bid might have inadvertently helped establish a higher valuation for OpenAI’s nonprofit stake, which, under the current agreement, is valued even higher at over $100 billion. These behind-the-scenes dynamics reveal the intricate blend of business, legal, and personal interests shaping OpenAI’s trajectory. Financial Implications and OpenAI’s Path Forward The financial implications of OpenAI ‘s transition to a Public Benefit Corporation are substantial. The reported $100 billion stake for the nonprofit arm is a significant valuation, cementing the nonprofit’s ongoing control and ensuring that its mission remains central to the organization’s strategy. This valuation also provides a clear benchmark, notably exceeding Elon Musk’s earlier takeover bid and reflecting the immense market value attributed to OpenAI’s innovations and future potential. As a PBC, OpenAI will be better positioned to raise additional capital from a broader range of investors. This access to funding is critical for sustaining its highly expensive research into advanced AI models, which require vast computational resources and top-tier talent. The ability to attract capital while maintaining a public benefit mandate could set a new standard for how cutting-edge AI research is funded and governed. Looking ahead, the agreement with Microsoft and the PBC transition could pave the way for OpenAI to eventually become a public company. While this is a long-term prospect, it would provide further avenues for investment and liquidity, potentially accelerating the development of AGI and its deployment. This strategic financial restructuring highlights OpenAI’s ambition to grow, innovate, and lead the AI revolution while striving to uphold its ethical commitments. A New Horizon for AI Innovation OpenAI ‘s agreement with Microsoft to transition its for-profit arm into a Public Benefit Corporation marks a significant moment in the evolution of AI. This strategic move aims to reconcile the immense commercial potential of AI with the ethical imperatives of developing powerful technologies for the benefit of all humanity. By adopting the PBC structure, OpenAI seeks to secure the necessary capital for its ambitious research, attract diverse investors, and reinforce public trust, all while legally binding itself to its foundational mission. The evolving AI partnership with Microsoft, the navigation of regulatory approvals, and the backdrop of high-profile legal challenges underscore the complexity of this undertaking. Yet, if successful, this transition could set a new precedent for corporate governance in the AI sector, demonstrating a model where innovation, profitability, and public good are not mutually exclusive but rather intrinsically linked. As ChatGPT and other OpenAI models continue to reshape industries, this structural shift is poised to influence not just OpenAI’s future, but the very trajectory of responsible AI development globally.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000430. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000699 and an average trading price of $0.000673 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The 4-hour chart shows breakout momentum supported by volume. The $0.00009700 price level is the key short-term support to hold. FLOKI on the daily timeframe The 1-day Floki Inu price chart for September 11 shows the coin closing around $0.0001, maintaining a series of higher lows after bottoming near $0.00008617. FLOKI is approaching the first key resistance at $0.00010460, with further supply at $0.00011139 and $0.00012424 overhead. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram has flipped positive, and the lines are crossing upward, suggesting strengthening momentum. Still, bulls need a clean daily close above $0.00010460 to confirm trend continuation. A drop back below $0.00009500 could weaken this setup and put $0.00008617 back in focus. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe The shorter timeframe shows a bullish structure with higher lows and a strong breakout candle pushing price above $0.00010026. The Alligator moving averages are aligned bullishly and widening, confirming trend support. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has picked up after a quiet period, and OBV is stabilizing after a pullback, indicating buyers are stepping back in. As long as $0.00009700 holds, momentum favors a retest of $0.00010460 resistance, with a higher breakout possible if sustained.

Momentum is building, but overhead resistance remains the real test. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need up to $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 110x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

The South Korean newspaper Seoul Kyungjae reported that Upbit has listed seven tokens in the past 10 days. The top 12 most-traded coins on the Upbit crypto exchange on September 11, 2025. (Source: CoinGecko) Upbit Listing Spree: Will It Stop Bithumb’s Surge? The outlet wrote that on September 9, Bithumb’s domestic market share climbed to 46%, with Upbit’s share standing at 50.6%. Upbit has dominated the South Korean market since around 2022, enjoying market share dominance above the 80% mark in some months. This has led some lawmakers to complain that its operator, Dunmau, has become the crypto exchange sector’s de facto monopoly . But Bithumb has been chipping away at Upbit’s market share in recent months. It has struck a partnership deal with Kookmin Bank, South Korea’s biggest financial player. And it has also launched a spinoff firm as it looks to become the first domestic exchange to debut on the NASDAQ stock exchange . Upbit appears to have responded to Bithumb’s resurgence by launching new altcoin pairings and listing a wider range of coins. An unnamed South Korean exchange official told the media outlet that Upbit is concerned that Bithumb has narrowed the market share gap to less than 5% without resorting to novel promotions. The official opined: “Upbit cannot help but feel a sense of crisis.” Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past seven days (Source: CoinGecko) WLD Listing The media outlet wrote that Upbit’s response to Worldcoin (WLD) trade volume growth in South Korea has been telling. When WLD transaction volumes pushed Bithumb’s market share to 46% on September 9, Upbit responded rapidly. Upbit announced it would be listing WLD at 7 pm KST the same day and completed its listing just two hours later, at 9 pm KST. Upbit’s latest listing, at 1:30 am KST on September 11, was the Linea (LINEA). The exchange’s September listings tally has already surpassed its total number of listings for the whole of August. Customers May Suffer, Experts Warn The market leader has traditionally taken a much more conservative attitude to coin listing than Bithumb, which also continues to add coins to its platform. Should the two firms become embroiled in a listings war, critics warn, customers could suffer in the long run. Experts said they were “concerned” that the “fierce competition between exchanges” could lead platform managers to make “hasty decisions” that “compromise the review process.” The experts noted that while listing frenzies continue, South Korean delisting events are becoming more common. A combined total of 25 altcoins have been delisted by Bithumb, Upbit, and their closest rivals, Korbit, Coinone, and GOPAX, since July this year. Several of these coins had only recently been listed on the platforms. An unnamed crypto industry executive suggested that Seoul’s efforts to police the sector may be at fault. The source said: “Regulators only allow domestic exchanges to provide spot trading. That means that the only way they can compete with one another is by expanding their listings. It is ironic that regulators’ attempts to police the industry are actually spurring listing competition and weakening investor protection.” The post Upbit Goes on Coin Listing Spree as Bithumb Claws Back Market Share appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Bithumb|Upbit,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|MARKET|WLD,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-11 23:30:00

The analyst, who has nearly 130,000 followers on X, shared his projections as anticipation builds for the next stage of the market cycle. Ethereum as the Benchmark Ethereum currently trades at $4,359, and according to Amonyx, a climb to $10,000 would represent a 131 % increase from this level. Achieving that target would also set a fresh all-time high for Ethereum, more than doubling its previous peak of $4,959. Many market watchers expect the current bull run to extend through December 2025, and Amonyx believes Ethereum’s potential move will serve as the foundation for broader altcoin growth. Price predictions for this bullrun: #BTC : $200,000 #ETH : $10,000 #BNB : $2,000 #XRP : $20+ #WAN : $10+ #SHIB : $0,001 #DOGE : $5 Which one will happen first? — Amonyx (@amonbuy) September 9, 2025 Shiba Inu’s Possible Upside Based on this scenario, Amonyx has outlined a striking projection for Shiba Inu. He argues that SHIB could rally to $0.001 , which would require the token to erase two zeros from its current price of $0.00001301 . For that to occur, Shiba Inu would need to appreciate by more than 7,586%, a scale of growth rarely seen in the digital asset market. If realized, the move would set a new record for the popular meme coin and exceed the expectations of most current forecasts. Historical Context and Token Relationship Despite the bold outlook, Shiba Inu’s market performance in 2025 has been largely negative. The token has lost almost 39% of its value since January. Even so, SHIB often displays a strong correlation with Ethereum, given its status as an ERC-20 token. At times, it has even managed to outperform ETH in shorter timeframes. For example, while Ethereum gained 0.17% over the past week, Shiba Inu rose 4.65% within the same period. This trend fuels optimism that the token could benefit disproportionately if Ethereum begins a sustained rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The idea of Shiba Inu climbing to $0.001 is not new . Analysts and community figures have raised this benchmark on multiple occasions. Last year, analyst Crypto Sheriff pointed to a breakout from a multi-year downtrend as a reason SHIB could eventually test that level, though without specifying a timeline. Another analyst, Krao, had earlier projected that the target would be reached in the first quarter of 2025, but that prediction did not materialize. Factors That Could Support the Rally According to Amonyx, achieving $0.001 in this cycle would require more than Ethereum’s rise. Other favourable conditions would need to align, including higher retail demand for meme tokens and new initiatives within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. One recurring theme is token supply. With 589 trillion SHIB still in circulation, large-scale burns are viewed as essential for sustainable appreciation. While projections remain speculative, Amonyx’s analysis reflects the optimism among sections of the Shiba Inu community. If Ethereum moves toward the $10,000 mark, SHIB’s potential to capitalize on that momentum will remain a closely watched narrative in the months ahead.

That answers the “will a DOGE ETF happen?” question and reshapes the short- to mid-term setup. As DOGE defends $0.214–$0.21 and wrestles with $0.22, the pivot at $0.225 remains the trigger toward $0.25. Meanwhile, the Layer Brett crypto presale is live at $0.0055, with $3.3 million raised and staking at 782% APY—an Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin. Dogecoin price prediction : what an ETF unlocks in 2025–2026 An approved DOGE ETF can drive inflows, legitimize fund exposure, and amplify narratives into a 2025 bull run. We’re already seeing institutional footprints: volume near 808.9M pushed price to $0.22 before profit-taking, confirming sensitivity to ETF headlines. Technically, DOGE prints lower highs with expanding sell volume—near-term caution—yet the DOGE/BTC pair and BTC show bullish breakout structures that favor medium-term upside. In this context, a Dogecoin price prediction revisiting $0.25–$0.30 on momentum is reasonable once $0.225 flips to support. In fact, analysts have put forward the following outcomes: – Base case (most probable): With ETF tailwinds and a risk-on market, DOGE grinds toward $0.35–$0.50 in 2025, then stretches to $0.60–$0.80 by 2026 as liquidity builds. Maintains trend above $0.21 and convert $0.25 into a launchpad. – Stretch case ($1): Needs a full bull market, sustained DOGE/BTC strength, and ETF-driven media flywheels. A parabolic phase could tag $1 late 2026, presuming broadening participation. – Risk case: Sell-the-news or macro shocks could revisit $0.21—lose it, and $0.18 returns. Watch the $0.225 pivot and volume quality for confirmation. Bottom line: DOGE can reach $1, but it likely needs near-perfect conditions. A balanced Dogecoin price prediction recognizes both paths and hurdles. Where Layer Brett aims for the bigger multiple For investors chasing asymmetric upside, Layer Brett blends meme energy with utility on Ethereum Layer 2. $LBRETT is in presale at $0.0055, with $3.26 million raised. It’s an ERC-20 built for low fees, high throughput, and scalable smart contracts—fit for a Layer 2 narrative institution increasingly respected. The stats are intriguing: – Staking power: Early buyers can stake at 782% APY while the network grows. – Utility-first meme thesis: Beyond hype, Layer Brett targets DeFi and builders with low fees and Web3-ready features. – Market-cap math: A smaller cap gives a clearer path to top-gainer status if momentum hits, making it one of the best crypto presale picks among meme coins. Final take: ETF lifts DOGE, but Layer Brett may capture the bigger upside Yes—the DOGE ETF appears imminent and should benefit DOGE through 2025–2026. Could $1 happen? Possibly in a roaring market, but not guaranteed. Meanwhile, Layer Brett’s smaller market cap, Layer 2 utility, and 782% staking APY create a compelling setup. Layer Brett’s staking engine turns community participation into compounding growth: stake $LBRETT via decentralized, no-KYC flows and benefit from Ethereum Layer 2 throughput. The roadmap builds a real ecosystem around a memecoin, not just virality. Add the $1 Million Giveaway to ignite awareness—and you have a catalyst for flows seeking new crypto coins and low-cap gems. With its crypto presale live at $0.0055 and a limited window, securing $LBRETT early and staking positions investors for a potential meme-coin breakout fueled by real tech and a $1 Million Giveaway.

With the Layer Brett presale at $0.0055 and staking at 782% APY, momentum is shifting toward this Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin. If ADA steadies and PI struggles with trust, could $LBRETT be the next big crypto to run? Cardano news today: utility meets accumulation as institutional interest rises Cardano has been resilient. Despite an ETF delay, ADA rallied as whales accumulated against bearish retail sentiment, hinting at positioning for a bigger move. Macro and network updates have aided stability. Beyond the charts, Charles Hoskinson’s $200M Wyoming clinic blending AI and blockchain shows utility beyond speculation. For ADA holders, this kind of adoption—paired with growing institutional interest—supports Cardano staying among top altcoins as rotation returns. Pi Network price prediction: hype vs. hard warnings Pi Network is back in headlines, but not for the right reasons. Bybit’s CEO publicly labeled Pi a scam following an official police warning, while the token’s debut at a lofty valuation saw thin liquidity and a 60%+ drawdown. If liquidity stays fragmented and trust issues linger, rallies in PI can be sharp but fragile. Traders should factor in headline risk: multiple exchanges listing IOU-style pairs, uncertainty around circulating supply, and uneven market depth—all of which complicate any sustainable PI recovery. Why Layer Brett is breaking records on Ethereum Layer 2 While the market debates ADA and PI, Layer Brett is executing. The project has raised $3.3 million, with $LBRETT at $0.0055 in its crypto presale—an entry for a meme token that blends meme energy with utility. Built on an Ethereum Layer 2, it offers low fees, high throughput, and staking rewards that stand out: a headline 782% APY for early stakers. Layer Brett’s approach: real tech and real rewards. As an ERC-20 on Layer 2, it’s engineered for scale—fast transactions, low fees, and a staking ecosystem designed to keep holders active. This is a memecoin built to function like a DeFi token while tapping the cultural power of a top meme coin. Head-to-head: ADA , PI , and $LBRETT into the next volatility cycle Catalysts are lining up. With Bitcoin compressing ahead of Fed/CPI and ETF headlines, sidelined cash is watching for a break. If rotation kicks in, ADA could benefit from institutional credibility and Cardano ecosystem progress—but its large market cap limits explosive upside. PI faces trust overhangs that make rebounds more speculative than strategic. That’s where $LBRETT could surprise. Smaller cap, Ethereum Layer 2 utility, live staking, and a viral brand make Layer Brett a candidate for top gainer status in a fresh alt swing. Add the $1 Million Giveaway, and you’ve got a community flywheel designed to capture attention into a crypto bull run 2025 setup. For momentum hunters scouting low-cap gems and the next 100x meme coin, $LBRETT checks the boxes. Conclusion: Today’s winner is the project breaking records—and it’s $LBRETT The verdict: Cardano shows strength, Pi Network carries risk, and Layer Brett is the standout today. Early buyers can lock in 782% APY through staking, and a smaller market cap gives $LBRETT more room to run than ADA while avoiding PI’s credibility pitfalls. The crypto presale is limited , the price is $0.0055, and $LBRETT has already raised $3.3 million—with a $1 Million Giveaway amplifying the buzz. If you’re seeking the best crypto to buy before the next volatility wave, Layer Brett deserves a top spot on your list. Connect your wallet and buy in today.

When you’re holding for years, you want tokens that have daily utility rather than just trending charts. Two networks that are at the center of that utility story are Ethereum and XRP. While they each solve different problems, they all solve problems for real users and real businesses. Ethereum is the programmable base layer for finance, culture, and identity on-chain. Everything from tokenized assets to lending is powered by its smart contracts. XRP, on the other hand, is all about value transfer. It will allow cross-border payments to be faster and cheaper than legacy rails, a practical requirement for banks, fintechs and remittance players. As investors plan longer-term strategies, they are also looking at earlier, more nimble projects that could compound from small caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE comes up in those conversations as a complementing sat-allocation play for growth-oriented portfolios. Why Ethereum Belongs in a 5-Year Hold ETH enjoys a huge developer community and a continuous array of usability improvements. When costs decrease and throughput increases, more apps achieve product-market fit. That attracts further users and liquidity, providing a strong cycle for holders. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Featured Among 2025 Growth Picks With a solid roadmap, strong community engagement, and a focus on scalable tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been identified as one of the best Altcoins to buy in 2025 for high growth portfolios. The investment strategy for long-term investors is to position for the build phase and let milestones and access expansion do the heavy lifting over time. Why XRP Keeps Its Seat For payments, it is all about speed and cost. XRP is designed for throughput and settlement efficiency. If the popularity of partner integrations continues to grow and regulatory clarity continues to improve, institutions will continue to double down where the technology makes sense. Diversifying “Utility First” Investors don’t have to pick between platforms and payments. A well-balanced five-year basket might include ETH’s programmable economy, XRP’s transfer rails and a measured exposure to earlier-stage names. Conclusion Utility is the guidepost for multi-year holding. While Ethereum and XRP continue to provide it in different ways, selective exposure to early-stage growth like MAGACOIN FINANCE can provide upside without capitulation on fundamentals.

Traders’ eye forecasts range from $3.50 to $7 by 2025, while some bold calls stretch toward $10 if regulatory clarity and adoption align. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) draws attention to the broader crypto market. It’s compared to Ripple’s early days, thanks to its exploding presale and real payment utility. XRP Price Prediction Outlook Current XRP price is around $2.97. By year’s end, many expect a rise into the $3.30–$3.50 zone if support holds near $2.77 and resistance at $3.07 is breached. Based on on-chain use and regulatory shifts, consensus projections for 2025 range from $2.80 to a moderately bullish $5- $7. Technical patterns and sentiment remain mixed. Some trackers see potential for 333% gains over 40 days, while others remain cautious, warning that a breakdown below $2.77 could push XRP back toward $2.50. The XRP price calls depend largely on ETF developments, compliance upgrades, and remittance adoption via Ripple’s network. Market Buzz: Presales, Utility, and High-Growth Picks Crypto traders are flocking to search terms like ‘best crypto presale 2025’, ‘next big altcoin 2025’, ‘crypto with real utility’, and ‘low-cap crypto gems’. Many are looking beyond legacy tokens, hunting for early-stage crypto investment with high ROI potential. That’s where Remittix (RTX) enters the picture, bringing real-world use, bonus rewards, and aggressive marketing to the fold. Remittix: The PayFi DeFi Project Surging Ahead Remittix (RTX) is viewed as a modernisation of the remittance playbook. For its focus on payments and early traction, it is earning comparisons to “XRP 2.0.” Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Raised over $24.9 million in presale, with 655M+ tokens sold at ~$0.105 Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, key centralised exchanges support Beta wallet launching Q3 2025 with the backing for 40+ cryptos, 30+ fiat currencies, real-time FX, and low gas fees CertiK audited, with deflationary tokenomics and staking potential Lively $250,000 community giveaway and viral buzz, earning it “best crypto presale to buy now” acclaim Remittix blends functionality with hype: it’s a cross-chain DeFi project delivering actual remittance tools. That’s the kind of crypto solving real-world problems traders search for when they look up “buy RTX token,” “new crypto token launch,” or “next big crypto launch.” XRP Price Prediction vs. Remittix: Two Growth Paths Side-by-Side The XRP Price Prediction underscores a stable path, solid adoption, regulatory progress, and modest gains. But for investors eyeing high growth crypto, Remittix offers a rapid rise in presale stages, real payment use, and heavy buzz. Rippling through the market is a dual narrative: XRP brings stability and legacy utility; Remittix presents high upside, early access, and payment-first innovation.

According to reports, the fund is being launched by REX-Osprey and will provide US investors a regulated way to gain exposure to DOGE without holding the coin directly. Related Reading: Altcoins Feel The Pinch As Crypto Market Sentiment Sours Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, told market watchers that the fund will hold an asset with “no utility on purpose,” and he publicly challenged supporters to point to clear real-world uses for Dogecoin beyond community interest and trading. Analyst Asks Supporters To Show Practical Uses According to Balchunas, DOJE will be the first US ETF that openly holds an asset whose backers say lacks practical functions. He pushed the community to list where DOGE is used as more than a token of speculation or culture. The Doge people (what do you call them, Doge-rs?) are objecting to my “no utility” comment. But the coin was literally started by two guys as a joke. So what’s the utility? https://t.co/6YtQPnCOTx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 9, 2025 Some in the Dogecoin community pointed to limited payment tests and merchant experiments, while others emphasized the coin’s long history of publicity and social attention. Reports also note the fund is being structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940 instead of the Securities Act of 1933, a choice that has drawn extra scrutiny. Why Utility Matters For Investors Investors typically seek ways to value an asset beyond pure sentiment. Utility can mean things like payment rails, governance roles, or fuel for smart contracts — uses that create sustained demand. When those uses are limited, price moves can be driven mainly by headlines and momentum. That makes risk evaluation harder for portfolios that require steady, predictable exposures. Some market participants counter that brand recognition, liquidity, and culture can still produce buyer interest, at least while markets are favorable. Related Reading: Institutional Adoption Rises: 21X Brings Chainlink Into Europe’s Tokenized Securities Market Less Common Legal Route Based on reports, the legal route chosen for DOJE is unusual for a crypto-linked spot fund. Filing under the 1940 Act instead of the 1933 Act carries different compliance and custody implications. Few ETFs have taken this exact path for a memecoin-style asset, and observers say they will watch how custody and regulatory reviews play out once trading begins. Traders and institutions may treat the fund differently because of the structure and the questions raised over utility.

Although achieving this target would require a major rally, many believe that widespread adoption and real-world use cases could serve as critical drivers. The token first gained global attention during 2020 and 2021, when it surged dramatically and erased several zeros from its price. That run took SHIB to an all-time high of $0.00008845, largely fueled by community-driven campaigns and viral exposure. This period established Shiba Inu as one of the most recognized meme-inspired assets in the world. Today, supporters argue that the next significant move will not come solely from speculative interest but from expanding SHIB’s functionality across different sectors. Five Avenues for Utility Growth Payments for Freelance Services: One possible pathway involves SHIB being accepted as payment across freelance platforms. The U.S. had more than 64 million freelance workers in 2023, according to Forbes . Even limited adoption in this segment could increase demand for SHIB, particularly if major platforms enable direct payments. Integration into Metaverse Economies: Shiba Inu launched its own metaverse project, Shib: The Metaverse, in 2022 , with partial rollout beginning in December 2024. Expanding the use of SHIB within this ecosystem, for salaries, royalties, or in-world transactions, could generate consistent demand beyond trading. Growth in Micropayments: The low-cost nature of SHIB transactions positions the token as a candidate for micropayments. Use cases may include tipping online creators, in-game purchases, or small-scale streaming payments. If adopted at scale, micropayments could help SHIB build a stronger utility profile. Incentivized Online Shopping: Partnerships with major e-commerce platforms could further adoption by providing discounts to users who pay with SHIB. This type of incentive-based model would encourage regular spending and broaden SHIB’s appeal beyond investment circles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cross-Border Remittances: In regions where traditional remittances are costly or slow, SHIB could provide an alternative for cross-border payments. Integration with fintech applications could make it a viable option for families transferring funds across different markets. Assessing the $0.0001 Goal At its current price of $0.00001305 , Shiba Inu would need to rise by approximately 666% to reach $0.0001. With a supply of around 589 trillion tokens, such a price would give SHIB a market capitalization close to $59 billion. Despite the ambitious nature of this target, it remains one of the most common predictions within the Shiba Inu community. Several analysts have already outlined scenarios under which SHIB could meet this benchmark. A pseudonymous commentator known as “Anonymous” projected a price between $0.00017 and $0.00032 by the fourth quarter of 2025. Forbes has also suggested the token could climb as high as $0.0003 within the same period. Technical analysts such as BitFinity and Capt. Parabolic Toblerone has added their voices, pointing to historical chart patterns that may support the case for a breakout. While speculation about SHIB’s future continues, most experts agree that sustainable progress toward $0.0001 will require tangible adoption and a strong use-case framework. Initiatives in freelancing, e-commerce, gaming, and remittances, alongside Shiba Inu’s metaverse project, could provide the foundations for long-term growth. However, the timeline for these developments may extend beyond current market cycles. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

51573486,579194,1757635250,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51573486.jpeg,"Shiba Inu Team Confirms Delayed Migration Is A Go, Here’s What’s Coming",https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-delayed-migration/,"After weeks of anticipation and setbacks, the Shiba Inu development team has officially confirmed that the long-awaited migration from LEASH v1 to LEASH v2 is ready to begin. The delay stemmed from the need to address flaws in the original LEASH token contract and to complete a thorough security audit. Now that these hurdles are cleared, developers say the transition to LEASH v2 is set to commence in the coming days. Shiba Inu Team Confirms Migration According to a recent blog post by the Shiba Inu team, the security audit of the LEASH v2 contract and its migration mechanism has been completed by Hexens, which has now cleared the way for the long-delayed rollout. The developers explained that they engaged Hexens to perform a full, independent audit of the integrated system, covering the LEASH v2 token, the migrator, and all associated flows. Now that the security firm Hexens has cleared the audit, the migration is expected to begin anytime soon. Hexens is a Web3-focused cybersecurity firm known for smart-contract and protocol audits. Its track record spans Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and BNB Chain, where the firm’s audits have protected significant on-chain value. As the migration begins, developers warned LEASH v1 holders should use only official links published on Shib.io and verified Shiba Inu social channels to avoid falling prey to scams. Once the migration window closes, any unused LEASH v2 tokens in the multisig wallet will be burned to enforce a hard-capped supply. How The Migration Will Work Now that all the security boxes have been ticked, the migration from LEASH v1 to LEASH v2 is expected to commence anytime in the coming days. The migration will occur in carefully planned phases to ensure fairness across different types of holders. In the first phase, direct LEASH v1 holders as well as those with staked or locked tokens will be able to migrate by burning or locking their v1 tokens to receive v2 equivalents at a ratio based on the current v1 supply. Liquidity providers on Uniswap V2 and ShibaSwap V1 are also included in this stage. Phase Two will handle the more complex Uniswap V3 and ShibaSwap V2 LPs, which require snapshots and proof-of-withdrawal mechanisms to prevent trapped value. Lastly, Phase Three will cover bridge users and those holding LEASH on Shibarium for a 1:1 swap of these tokens. The LEASH v1 contract was originally promoted as a fixed-supply token, but a hidden vulnerability meant that rebasing mechanisms could still alter the supply through authorized proxies. This vulnerability was exploited earlier this year and this led to an unplanned 20% increase in supply. To restore trust and safeguard holders, developers opted to create LEASH v2. According to developers, the upgrade removes any minting or rebasing loopholes, as the entire v2 supply is pre-minted and secured in a multisignature wallet. At the time of writing, LEASH is trading at $24.94, down by 3.22% in the past 24 hours.",Shiba Inu|BNB Chain|Cosmos|Ethereum|Hexens|LEASH|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|ShibaSwap|ShibaSwap V2 LPs|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|solana|Uniswap|Uniswap v3,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|UNI|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 00:00:50

However, recent news brings a slight shift in plans, as the much-awaited launch of the RexShares DOGE ETF has encountered a minor delay. What’s the Latest on the DOGE ETF Launch? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the launch of the DOGE ETF , set to trade under the ticker DOJE, has been postponed. Originally slated for September 11, the debut from U.S. asset managers RexShares and Osprey Funds is now expected next week. Balchunas indicated that next Thursday is the new likely target date for this significant event. This news, while a small delay, keeps the crypto community on its toes. The introduction of a spot DOGE ETF could be a game-changer for Dogecoin, potentially opening doors for broader institutional and retail investment. It signals a growing maturity in the digital asset space, even for meme coins. Why Does a DOGE ETF Matter for Investors? The concept of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) for a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin is incredibly significant. ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without directly owning it. This simplifies the investment process, making it more accessible to a wider audience, including those who might be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Here are some key reasons why a DOGE ETF is important: Accessibility: It offers a regulated and familiar investment vehicle, similar to traditional stock market investments. Liquidity: ETFs typically provide high liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Diversification: For traditional investors, it offers an avenue to diversify portfolios with digital assets. Legitimacy: The approval and launch of such an ETF lend further credibility to Dogecoin and the broader crypto market. The delay, while minor, provides a brief window for potential investors to further research and understand the implications of such a product on their investment strategies. It’s crucial to consider how this new financial instrument could integrate into existing portfolios. Navigating the Path to a DOGE ETF: What Comes Next? The journey to launching a cryptocurrency ETF is often fraught with regulatory hurdles. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious with crypto-related financial products. However, recent approvals for Bitcoin ETFs suggest a shifting landscape, paving the way for other digital assets, including Dogecoin. RexShares and Osprey Funds are among the asset managers at the forefront of this innovation. Their persistence in bringing a DOGE ETF to market highlights the increasing demand for regulated crypto investment products. While a specific reason for this particular delay wasn’t detailed, such postponements are not uncommon in the highly regulated financial sector. Investors should keep an eye on official announcements from RexShares and Osprey Funds, as well as regulatory bodies, for the definitive launch date. The likely launch next Thursday will be a moment many in the crypto world will be watching closely. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin’s Future? The introduction of a DOGE ETF could have a substantial impact on Dogecoin’s market dynamics. Increased accessibility and institutional interest could lead to higher trading volumes and potentially greater price stability. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the enhanced visibility and legitimacy could attract new capital into the Dogecoin ecosystem. This development is part of a larger trend of mainstream finance embracing digital assets. As more regulated products become available, the line between traditional finance and cryptocurrency continues to blur, offering exciting new opportunities for investors globally. The journey of the DOGE ETF is a testament to this evolving financial landscape. In conclusion, while the RexShares DOGE ETF has seen a minor delay, the anticipation for its launch next Thursday remains high. This development underscores the growing institutional interest and regulatory progress within the cryptocurrency space, offering new avenues for investors to engage with digital assets like Dogecoin. It’s a significant step towards mainstream adoption and a testament to the enduring appeal of the meme coin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a DOGE ETF? A DOGE ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund that would hold Dogecoin as its underlying asset, allowing investors to trade shares of the fund on traditional stock exchanges without directly buying and holding Dogecoin itself. Who are RexShares and Osprey Funds? RexShares and Osprey Funds are U.S. asset management firms that are collaborating to launch the proposed DOGE ETF (DOJE). Why was the DOGE ETF launch delayed? The exact reason for this specific delay was not publicly detailed, but minor postponements are common in the highly regulated financial industry for various reasons, including final regulatory checks or logistical preparations. What is the new anticipated launch date for the DOGE ETF? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the launch is now considered likely for next Thursday, following the original September 11 target. How could a DOGE ETF impact Dogecoin’s price? A DOGE ETF could potentially increase Dogecoin’s price and stability by making it more accessible to a wider range of investors, including institutions, thereby increasing demand and liquidity. However, market performance is influenced by many factors. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The milestone cabinet appointment is the first ever political appointment of an AI bot in the world. Albania has broken a new record in global politics by being the first nation to name an artificial intelligence bot as a cabinet minister. Prime Minister Edi Rama revealed the appointment on Thursday, presenting the bot named “Diella.” She is a digital system that will focus on managing the country’s public procurement system. According to Rama, the appointment is aimed at tackling corruption. Albania has appointed an AI bot as a cabinet minister Diella, whose name means “sunshine” in Albanian, was introduced at the Socialist Party assembly in Tirana, where Rama announced his new cabinet at the start of his fourth term. Unlike her colleagues, Diella exists only as an avatar which has been made to represent a young woman in traditional Albanian attire. Rama said Diella would oversee all public tenders, which has historically been one of Albania’s most corruption-prone sectors. By removing decision-making from human cabinet members and placing it in the hands of an incorruptible AI, he argued, the country could ensure “100 percent transparent and legible” spending of public funds. “Diella is the first cabinet member who isn’t physically present, but is virtually created by AI,” Rama said in his speech. “She is the servant of public procurement.” The prime minister stressed that decisions on tenders would gradually move “step by step” under Diella’s authority, transforming Albania into a country where public tenders are fully immune to bribery and manipulation. Diella’s role will also include evaluating bids, hiring experts from around the world, and breaking down “the fear of prejudice and rigidity of the administration,” according to Rama . Diella is central to Albania’s long-running effort to align itself with European Union standards. The EU has repeatedly criticized the country for corruption in public administration and procurement, and Rama, who was re-elected in May on a promise to join the bloc by 2030, said Diella’s appointment demonstrates Albania’s willingness to innovate. Praise and skepticism follow Diella’s appointment While the government has promoted Diella as a tool for transparency, her appointment has already sparked debate at home. On social media, some users expressed doubt that even a virtual minister could remain immune from corruption. One Facebook commenter quipped, “Even Diella will be corrupted in Albania.” Another added, “Stealing will continue and Diella will be blamed.” Concerns have also been raised about the supervision of and accountability for Diella. Rama did not provide details on what human supervision will accompany Diella’s decisions, or how the system could guard against manipulation of the AI itself. Diella is not entirely new to Albanians. She first appeared earlier this year as an AI-powered assistant on the government’s e-Albania digital platform, which citizens use to obtain state documents. Her avatar responds to voice commands, issues documents with electronic stamps, and aims to cut bureaucratic delays. Diella’s appointment was announced a day before Albania’s newly elected parliament was set to convene. It remains uncertain whether Rama’s cabinet, including its virtual member, will be formally voted on immediately. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Alibaba and Baidu are reportedly ditching Nvidia’s processors and utilizing home-made solutions, with Alibaba training smaller AI models with its in-house processors. Baidu is also testing the waters with its latest Kunlun P800 chip on more advanced versions of its Ernie model. However, it highlights the progress and seriousness that Chinese firms are putting into making chip designs and the urgency created by U.S. export restrictions that have curbed access to Nvidia’s most advanced processors. Breaking reliance on U.S. hardware Over the years, Chinese companies building large-scale AI systems have relied heavily on Nvidia’s hardware, particularly the H100 and its successors. Nvidia is the market leader in the GPU space, known to be part of the critical infrastructure components in the AI boom. However, Chinese companies can’t get their hands on the most advanced Nvidia chips, as the U.S. government has progressively tightened the noose around getting those chips, citing national security reasons. However, last month, Cryptopolitan reported that Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said he was discussing with Washington to push for the sale of some advanced versions of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips. Despite this, it still seems that the most powerful models remain off limits. The restrictions have accelerated Beijing’s push to develop a domestic semiconductor ecosystem, backed by billions of dollars in state subsidies and pressure on national champions to cut reliance on U.S. suppliers. Alibaba’s Zhenwu and Baidu’s Kunlun chips Alibaba’s semiconductor arm has designed the Zhenwu processing unit to support cloud-based AI workloads. Baidu has been working with its own Kunlun line of AI accelerators. The latest P800 version is being used to train newer versions of Ernie, the company’s flagship large language model. Baidu has also positioned Kunlun as both a cost-saving tool and a hedge against foreign sanctions. For now the switch is partial as both companies still continue to rely on Nvidia chips for their most advanced systems, especially those involving very large training runs where performance gaps remain. But the willingness work with Chinese-made alternatives in production environments is a major step in the move away from American tech. Implications for global AI competition For Nvidia, the development is a warning sign as China has been its largest overseas market. A successful move away from the America chipmaker by Chinese firms to home-grown GPUs could end demand for U.S. chips and greatly impact Nvidia’s market share and balance book, even when import restrictions are removed. For Alibaba and Baidu, the ability to design and control their own hardware could lower costs and help them align with Beijing’s industrial policies. Matching Nvidia is still a longshot, but it’s looking closer with the latest development. The firms still have to match Nvidia’s performance and ecosystem support, which boasts advanced software frameworks such as CUDA. Get seen where it counts.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has made a significant move, rising three points from yesterday to a notable 57. This shift propels it from the neutral zone directly into ‘greed territory,’ according to data from Alternative. This development is a clear signal: investor sentiment is improving, and the market is buzzing with renewed optimism. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? To truly grasp the significance of this shift, let’s break down what the Crypto Fear & Greed Index represents. This unique indicator acts as a barometer for market sentiment, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme optimism). It’s not just a random number; it’s a sophisticated calculation designed to capture the emotional state of cryptocurrency investors. The index relies on a combination of six key market factors, each contributing to its overall score. Understanding these components provides a deeper insight into how market psychology is measured: Volatility (25%): This factor measures current Bitcoin price fluctuations and maximum drawdowns, comparing them to average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility can indicate a fearful market. Market Volume (25%): It compares current trading volume and market momentum to average values. High buying volume in a positive market often suggests greed. Social Media (15%): This component analyzes keywords, hashtags, and sentiment on platforms like Twitter, looking for mentions and interactions related to cryptocurrencies. Increased positive mentions can signal rising greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) These polls ask investors directly about their market outlook, providing a direct measure of sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market cap dominance can indicate a flight to safety, often seen during fearful periods, as investors move away from altcoins. A decrease might suggest increased risk appetite. Google Trends (10%): This examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ searches, for example, might indicate fear, while ‘buy Bitcoin’ searches suggest greed. Why Has the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Moved into Greed? The recent three-point jump to 57 isn’t just a number; it reflects a tangible change in how investors perceive the market. This surge indicates that the collective mood has shifted from cautious neutrality to a more adventurous, optimistic stance. What drives such a rapid change? Several factors likely contributed to this upward trend. It could be influenced by positive news cycles, such as institutional adoption announcements, successful blockchain upgrades, or even a sustained period of stable or rising asset prices. When the market shows resilience and potential for growth, investor confidence naturally improves, leading to higher buying pressure and increased enthusiasm. What Does ‘Greed Territory’ Mean for Your Investments? Reaching 57 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market firmly in ‘greed territory.’ While this might sound positive, it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it signifies strong buying interest and potential for further price appreciation. Investors are feeling confident, often leading to upward price momentum. However, ‘greed’ can also be a warning sign. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections. When everyone is optimistic, the market can become overextended, and a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) can drive irrational decisions. This is where vigilance becomes crucial. Smart investors understand that the market’s mood is cyclical. While a rising index can be encouraging, it also necessitates a disciplined approach. It’s a time to re-evaluate portfolios, consider taking profits, or at least avoid making impulsive decisions driven purely by emotion. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index So, how can you effectively use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in your investment strategy? It’s not a buy or sell signal in itself, but rather a powerful sentiment indicator. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: Some investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. When the index shows extreme fear, it might be a good time to consider buying (when others are fearful). Conversely, when it shows extreme greed, it might be a time to consider selling or reducing exposure (when others are greedy). Risk Management: A high greed score can be a prompt to review your risk exposure. Are you over-allocated to volatile assets? This might be a good moment to secure some gains or set stricter stop-loss orders. Avoid FOMO: When the market is greedy, there’s a strong temptation to jump into rapidly rising assets. The index serves as a reminder to stick to your investment plan and avoid impulse buying. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, the index provides context. Short-term fluctuations in sentiment are normal. It helps distinguish between genuine market shifts and emotional surges. The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 57 and its entry into greed territory is undoubtedly a positive sign for current market sentiment. It reflects increased investor confidence and a more optimistic outlook for cryptocurrencies. However, this shift also carries an important reminder: while optimism is welcome, it should always be balanced with caution and a well-defined strategy. By understanding the underlying factors and historical patterns of this crucial index, investors can make more informed decisions, navigating the dynamic crypto landscape with greater wisdom. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), based on various market factors. Q2: What does it mean when the index is in ‘greed territory’? When the index is in ‘greed territory’ (typically above 50), it indicates high investor optimism and confidence. While this can lead to price rallies, it can also signal a market that might be becoming overextended and prone to corrections. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily by Alternative, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment each day. Q4: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a direct buy or sell signal? No, the index is not a direct buy or sell signal. It’s a sentiment indicator that should be used as one of many tools in your analysis to understand market psychology and inform your investment decisions. Q5: What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is calculated using a weighted average of volatility, market volume, social media sentiment, surveys, Bitcoin’s market dominance, and Google search trends.

While Bitcoin continues to hover near elevated levels, liquidity in smaller tokens has thinned and investor sentiment has cooled. Macroeconomic pressures, including fresh US labor data showing weaker job creation, have intensified concerns that equities and digital assets alike may be sitting on fragile ground. For many traders, this environment has begun to resemble a trap: apparent stability masking deeper structural risks. Yet, even within this cautious atmosphere, certain corners of crypto are breaking away from the slump. Meme-driven platforms like MemeCore, creative launchpads such as Pump.fun, and emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving that innovation and cultural resonance can outperform broad market hesitation. MemeCore captures attention with on-chain creativity MemeCore has become a surprise standout during this market slowdown. Positioned as a creative hub for meme-driven tokens, the platform has attracted a surge of developers experimenting with culture-based coin launches. Analysts note that MemeCore’s rise reflects a deeper shift: in times of uncertainty, communities gravitate toward narratives that are simple, relatable, and engaging. By lowering barriers for creators and amplifying viral engagement, MemeCore has positioned itself as more than a speculative playground. Instead, it functions as a testing ground for the next generation of meme-coin concepts. Even as trading volumes in large-cap assets flatten, MemeCore continues to add new projects daily, keeping investor interest alive in an otherwise quiet sector. Strategic capital rotates toward MAGACOIN FINANCE The persistence of MemeCore and Pump.fun highlights a critical point: even in bearish or sideways markets, pockets of opportunity emerge where cultural branding and scarcity intersect. This dynamic sets the stage for MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining recognition as one of 2025’s breakout contenders. What distinguishes MAGACOIN FINANCE is its mix of scarcity and momentum: rapid sellouts in earlier rounds, a swelling community base, and strong alignment with cultural branding that resonates well beyond crypto’s core audience. Analysts suggest that such early traction could mirror past cycles where seemingly niche projects multiplied in value as mainstream awareness arrived. In fact, forecasts position MAGACOIN FINANCE among the rare altcoins capable of 50×–90× upside if momentum continues to compound. In a market where mining margins are shrinking and large caps offer limited multiples, speculative capital appears to be rotating toward precisely this type of early-stage launch. Pump.fun redefines grassroots token launches Another project bucking the downtrend is Pump.fun, the Solana-based launchpad that has quickly become synonymous with grassroots crypto culture. Its no-code interface and frictionless deployment tools have empowered thousands of micro-communities to launch tokens with little more than an idea and a network. While critics question the sustainability of such rapid token creation, Pump.fun has demonstrated that participation and creativity remain potent forces even when liquidity is tight. Notably, user activity has soared on the platform, with on-chain data confirming wallet growth despite the broader slump. By democratizing access to token creation, Pump.fun highlights that innovation in crypto often thrives at the edges, where risk-taking and experimentation define the culture. Broader implications for altcoin markets The ability of these projects to attract liquidity while most of the sector drifts sideways reveals a pattern long observed in crypto: innovation often accelerates when traditional strategies stall. Bitcoin miners, for instance, now face higher break-even costs, while Ethereum struggles with scaling challenges despite ETF inflows. Against that backdrop, lightweight, culture-driven platforms are proving more agile in capturing attention. The Fed’s looming rate cuts only add fuel to this trend. Historically, monetary easing has driven risk-on flows toward altcoins, and analysts expect the same dynamic to re-emerge once liquidity conditions improve. When that shift occurs, projects already building momentum, MemeCore, Pump.fun, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, are positioned to ride the first wave of renewed speculative capital. Why these projects stand out The “why” behind their resilience comes down to accessibility, community, and legitimacy. MemeCore thrives by making meme creation collaborative and viral, Pump.fun succeeds by lowering technical barriers for token launches, and MAGACOIN FINANCE differentiates itself through strong audits, scarcity, and community traction. Together, they demonstrate that crypto’s cultural heartbeat remains strong even during downturns. Investors may interpret these signals as a preview of where capital will flow once the broader market stabilizes. With institutions locked into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the outsized multiples often emerge in niches where community, branding, and scarcity converge, exactly the spaces these projects occupy. Why MemeCore, Pump.fun and MAGACOIN FINANCE are defying the slump Innovation Over Stagnation: While most of the market drifts sideways, these projects keep evolving, MemeCore with creative on-chain memes, Pump.fun with accessible token launches, and MAGACOIN FINANCE with its audited framework. Accessible Entry: Each platform lowers barriers, whether through low-cost tokens, no-code deployment tools, or affordable allocations that invite wider participation. Asymmetric Upside: Analysts highlight the potential for outsized returns as liquidity seeks new narratives, positioning these names as outliers in a cautious market. Together, they showcase how cultural resonance, security, and accessibility can combine to outpace the broader slump. Conclusion While the broader crypto market has slowed, innovation continues to flourish at the edges. MemeCore and Pump.fun highlight the enduring appeal of community-driven creativity, while MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates how legitimacy, scarcity, and momentum can align to create breakout potential. Also MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as one of the most high-rewarding launches of 2025, a sharp contrast to the fragility weighing on mainstream markets. For investors searching for opportunities beyond the stock market’s “trap” conditions, these projects may signal the next cycle’s most dynamic performers.

This bold investment strategy by a publicly traded company is sending ripples across the market, prompting many to consider the evolving landscape of corporate cryptocurrency adoption. Cleancore’s Expanding Dogecoin Portfolio: What’s the Latest? Cleancore Solutions recently made headlines with its announcement of a substantial investment in Dogecoin (DOGE). The company’s initial purchase of 285 million DOGE, valued at approximately $68 million, was just the beginning. In a rapid development, Cleancore’s Cleancore Dogecoin holdings have nearly doubled in less than three days, now reaching an impressive 500 million DOGE. This rapid accumulation underscores Cleancore’s commitment to its previously stated intention: to acquire up to $1 billion in DOGE within the next 30 days. Such an aggressive purchasing plan highlights a growing trend of institutional players exploring digital assets beyond traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why the Sudden Interest in Cleancore Dogecoin Holdings? The decision by a company like Cleancore to pour significant capital into Dogecoin raises important questions. While DOGE started as a meme coin, its large and active community, coupled with high-profile endorsements, has given it considerable market visibility. Cleancore’s strategy appears to be a calculated move to capitalize on Dogecoin’s unique market position and potential for future growth. Market Visibility: Dogecoin benefits from widespread recognition and a dedicated following. Potential for Volatility: While risky, DOGE’s volatility can also present opportunities for significant gains for large investors. Diversification: For a company already exploring digital assets, Dogecoin offers a different risk/reward profile compared to other cryptocurrencies. Understanding the motivations behind such substantial Cleancore Dogecoin holdings is key to grasping the broader implications for both corporate finance and the crypto market. What are the Implications of Cleancore’s Dogecoin Strategy? Cleancore’s burgeoning Cleancore Dogecoin holdings could set a precedent for other corporations. When a NYSE-listed company makes such a public and significant bet on a meme coin, it lends a certain level of legitimacy that could encourage further institutional adoption. This move suggests a shift in how traditional businesses view digital assets, moving beyond just store-of-value narratives to embrace potentially more speculative, yet high-growth, opportunities. However, this strategy also comes with inherent risks: Market Volatility: Dogecoin’s price is highly susceptible to market sentiment and social media trends. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased corporate involvement in cryptocurrencies could invite greater regulatory attention. Public Perception: The investment could be viewed as either innovative or overly speculative by shareholders and the public. The success or failure of Cleancore’s investment could significantly influence future corporate crypto strategies. The Future Outlook for Cleancore Dogecoin Holdings With Cleancore’s stated goal of acquiring up to $1 billion in DOGE, the market will be closely watching its next moves. This aggressive accumulation highlights a belief in Dogecoin’s long-term potential, or at least its short-to-medium term growth trajectory. As the company continues to build its Cleancore Dogecoin holdings , it could influence DOGE’s price action and overall market sentiment. This situation also serves as a compelling case study for investors interested in the intersection of traditional finance and the rapidly evolving crypto space. It exemplifies how established companies are beginning to navigate and participate in the digital asset economy, pushing the boundaries of conventional investment portfolios. In conclusion, Cleancore Solutions’ dramatic increase in Cleancore Dogecoin holdings to 500 million DOGE marks a pivotal moment in corporate crypto adoption. This significant investment by a NYSE-listed company underscores a growing willingness among traditional businesses to explore and embrace digital assets, even those with more unconventional origins. While the strategy carries inherent risks, it also presents a fascinating case study for the future of institutional engagement with the cryptocurrency market, potentially paving the way for further corporate ventures into the world of digital finance.

The exchange argues that the disappearance of these communications violates court orders and undermines public trust in the regulator’s transparency and accountability. The records vanished between October 2022 and September 2023, when the crypto market suffered from notable developments such as FTX’s downfall and numerous major enforcement proceedings against Coinbase, the company involved in the protests. For critics of the SEC, missing these communications couldn’t have happened at a more essential moment, as the texts could have provided insights into how the agency assessed Ethereum, implemented enforcement strategies, and influenced its broader policy position toward digital assets. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the SEC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigation revealed that Gensler’s text messages were lost due to an internal policy that remotely wipes agency devices left offline for more than 45 days. Gensler’s phone was reset when the policy was triggered, erasing all its text communications. Subsequently, investigators found that many deleted texts would have qualified as official federal records and should have been retained under existing rules. Instead, the OIG report emphasized that the incident was not a single incident of poor technical decision-making but instead the culmination of systemic shortcomings, including poorly tested device management protocols and poorly designed backup systems, coupled with failed warnings that should have alerted the system that the data might be at stake. Coinbase presses for legal penalties and transparency Coinbase’s filing alleged the SEC violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and a court order in the past. The company filed claims that the agency carried out excessively narrow searches, delayed production of documents, and did not disclose the record loss until long after it had occurred. These failures undermined a fair consideration of how the SEC constructed its policies regarding Ethereum and other digital assets, leaving the public with an incomplete picture of the regulators’ decision-making process at a time of unprecedented unrest in the space, Coinbase said. The exchange reported that it has been especially worrying that such records were missing at the time of FTX’s demise, as well as a series of sweeping enforcement actions in the crypto world. In a potential redress, Coinbase is requesting the court to not only sanction the abusers but also to facilitate expedited discovery, to reveal the extent of the record losses, what (if anything) the SEC has done to reclaim the communications, and why the regulator hasn’t been quick to disclose the deletions to the investors. Coinbase says the SEC should be held to the same principles that it uses against the private sector, with the agency having fined the system over a billion dollars in recent years for violating reasonable business recordkeeping trust. SEC faces crisis of trust over recordkeeping Meanwhile, the aftermath of those erasures leaves many questions, like transparency and accountability, about the world’s most powerful financial regulator. It’s a blow that puts the SEC’s credibility under serious pressure, especially when the erased texts would have exposed internal deliberations about oversight of the burgeoning cryptocurrency space. Without these records, Congress, courts, and the public could have difficulty grasping how the agency dealt with enforcement and policy development as the industry was rocked by major upheaval. The SEC has already tried to contain more harm, turning off text messaging on an array of agency devices, warning the National Archives, and promising to fortify its recordkeeping systems. But for some, those moves are a reaction after the issue had reached public scandal rather than something proactive that would have averted the loss. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

A massive Bitcoin options expiry event is unfolding, with over $3.4 billion worth of contracts set to settle. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a crucial juncture that could influence market sentiment and potentially spark volatility across the digital asset landscape. Alongside Bitcoin, a substantial $850 million in Ethereum options are also expiring, making today a key day for crypto traders and investors alike. What is a Bitcoin Options Expiry and Why Does It Matter? At its core, an options contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiry date). When that date arrives, these contracts either settle, are exercised, or expire worthless. Call options grant the right to buy. Put options grant the right to sell. A large-scale Bitcoin options expiry can significantly impact the market because institutional players and market makers, who often write these options, need to adjust their hedges as contracts approach expiry. This unwinding or rebalancing of positions can create buying or selling pressure, leading to price fluctuations. Understanding Key Terms: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain To fully grasp the implications of a Bitcoin options expiry , it’s helpful to understand two key metrics: The put/call ratio indicates the sentiment of options traders. It’s calculated by dividing the total number of open put options by the total number of open call options. A ratio above 1 suggests a more bearish sentiment, as more traders are betting on price declines. Conversely, a ratio below 1 hints at a bullish outlook. The max pain price is a theoretical strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts (both puts and calls) would expire worthless. In essence, it’s the price point that causes maximum financial loss for the majority of option holders and maximum gain for option writers. While not a guaranteed price target, it can sometimes act as a magnet for the underlying asset’s price as expiry approaches, as market participants adjust their positions. The Imminent $3.4 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry Today, specifically at 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 12, Bitcoin options with a staggering notional value of $3.42 billion are set to expire. Data from crypto options exchange Deribit highlights the scale of this event. For these Bitcoin contracts: The put/call ratio stands at 1.31 , indicating a slight bearish lean among options traders for this specific expiry. The calculated max pain price is $113,000 . It’s important to note that while max pain is a theoretical magnet, this figure is significantly higher than current market prices, suggesting many of these contracts might be deeply out-of-the-money or were opened during different market conditions. Such a substantial expiry volume often leads to increased scrutiny and potential market shifts, as market participants react to the settlement of these contracts. Ethereum’s Significant $850 Million Options Expiry Not to be overshadowed, Ethereum options valued at $850 million are also scheduled to expire at the very same time. Ethereum’s derivatives market has grown considerably, and its expiries also carry significant weight. For these Ethereum contracts: The put/call ratio is 1.02 , suggesting a more balanced, almost neutral sentiment between bullish and bearish bets. The max pain price is $4,400 . Similar to Bitcoin’s figure, this is a theoretical point far above Ethereum’s current trading levels, reflecting the nature of options contracts written over various timeframes and price expectations. The simultaneous expiry of both Bitcoin and Ethereum options could amplify overall market reactions, as these two assets often move in tandem. What Could Happen After This Crucial Bitcoin Options Expiry? The immediate aftermath of a large Bitcoin options expiry can be unpredictable. Here are some potential scenarios and actionable insights: Increased Volatility: Market makers might unwind or re-establish their hedges, leading to increased price fluctuations around the expiry time. Price Magnet Effect: While the max pain price of $113,000 for Bitcoin is far from current levels, historically, prices can sometimes gravitate towards max pain. However, for this particular expiry, its influence might be limited given the vast difference from spot prices. Sentiment Shift: The put/call ratio of 1.31 for Bitcoin suggests a slightly cautious outlook. If market participants act on this sentiment, it could lead to short-term downward pressure or consolidation. Actionable Insights for Traders: Monitor Price Action: Pay close attention to Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements immediately before and after 8:00 a.m. UTC. Risk Management: Given the potential for volatility, consider adjusting stop-loss orders or reducing position sizes if you’re actively trading. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: Large expiries can create noise. It’s often wise to wait for the market to digest the event before making significant trading moves. In conclusion, today’s colossal Bitcoin options expiry , coupled with a substantial Ethereum expiry, presents a pivotal moment for the crypto market. While the max pain prices are theoretical and high, the sheer volume of expiring contracts could trigger significant market movements. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the potential volatility and making informed decisions in the evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly happens when Bitcoin options expire? When Bitcoin options expire, contracts that are ‘in-the-money’ (meaning profitable for the holder) are typically exercised or settled, while ‘out-of-the-money’ contracts expire worthless. This settlement process can lead to market participants adjusting their positions, potentially causing price movements in Bitcoin. Q2: How does the put/call ratio influence the market after a Bitcoin options expiry? A high put/call ratio (like Bitcoin’s 1.31 for this expiry) indicates that more put options (bets on price decline) are open than call options (bets on price increase). This can signal a bearish sentiment among options traders. After expiry, if this sentiment is strong, it might contribute to downward pressure or cautious trading behavior. Q3: What is the significance of the max pain price in an options expiry? The max pain price is the theoretical price point where the most options contracts expire worthless, causing maximum loss for option holders. While not a guaranteed target, some analysts believe the underlying asset’s price can gravitate towards this point as expiry approaches, as market makers manage their risks. Q4: How does Ethereum’s options expiry compare to Bitcoin’s in terms of impact? While Bitcoin’s expiry volume is larger ($3.4B vs. $850M), Ethereum’s expiry is still substantial. Both events occurring simultaneously can create a combined effect, potentially amplifying overall market volatility, especially since their price movements are often correlated. Q5: Should I buy or sell Bitcoin before a major options expiry? Options expiry events typically increase market uncertainty and volatility. There’s no single recommended action to buy or sell. Instead, it’s crucial to monitor market conditions, assess your risk tolerance, and consider waiting for the market to stabilize after the expiry before making significant trading decisions.

The Altcoin Season Index has recently climbed to a significant 65. This upward movement suggests a shift in the crypto market, where alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, are starting to show impressive strength compared to Bitcoin. Understanding what this index signifies is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, serves as a vital barometer for the broader altcoin market. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against the performance of Bitcoin. Essentially, it tells us how well altcoins are doing relative to the market leader. How it’s Calculated: The index compares the price performance of these top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. What it Indicates: A higher reading, closer to 100, suggests that a larger percentage of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Why is the Altcoin Season Index at 65 a Big Deal? Yesterday, the Altcoin Season Index stood at 62, and its jump to 65 indicates a noticeable increase in altcoin dominance. While an official “altcoin season” is declared when 75% of these top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, a reading of 65 means we are steadily moving in that direction. This rising trend often signals growing investor interest and capital flow into altcoins, potentially leading to significant price appreciation across various projects. This metric is more than just a number; it reflects evolving market sentiment. When Bitcoin consolidates or experiences slower growth, capital often flows into altcoins, which can offer higher percentage gains due to their smaller market caps. This shift creates exciting opportunities for diversified portfolios. Are We Nearing a Full Altcoin Season? The journey to a full altcoin season requires the Altcoin Season Index to reach 75. At 65, we are certainly closer than before, but not quite there yet. This current phase could be described as a strong “altcoin accumulation” or “pre-season” period. Investors often use this time to research and position themselves in promising altcoin projects before a broader market surge. Identifying an altcoin season involves observing several factors beyond just the index: Market Dominance: Bitcoin’s market dominance typically decreases during an altcoin season. Trading Volume: Increased trading volume in altcoins compared to Bitcoin. Project Developments: Significant updates and adoption news from various altcoin projects. Navigating the Opportunities: What Should Investors Consider with the Altcoin Season Index? The rising Altcoin Season Index presents both opportunities and challenges for investors. While the potential for high returns is attractive, it is crucial to approach altcoin investing with a well-thought-out strategy. Volatility can be higher in altcoins, and thorough research is paramount. Actionable Insights for Investors: Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, consider a diversified portfolio across different altcoin sectors (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions). Research Fundamentals: Look beyond hype. Investigate a project’s whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and community support. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders and take profits strategically to manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, project updates, and broader economic trends that could impact crypto. The Future of Altcoins: What’s Next for the Altcoin Season Index? The current upward trend in the Altcoin Season Index suggests a bullish outlook for many alternative cryptocurrencies. As the crypto ecosystem continues to mature, altcoins play an increasingly vital role in innovation and expanding the utility of blockchain technology. Whether this momentum carries us to a full-fledged altcoin season remains to be seen, but the signs are certainly encouraging. Staying informed and strategic will be key to capitalizing on these evolving market conditions. The crypto landscape is ever-changing, and adaptability is a valuable asset for any investor. In conclusion, the ascent of the Altcoin Season Index to 65 is a compelling indicator of growing strength among altcoins. While not yet a full altcoin season, it signals a period ripe with potential. By understanding the index, conducting diligent research, and managing risks effectively, investors can position themselves to potentially benefit from this exciting market shift. The journey of altcoins continues to unfold, promising innovation and opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index?

Choosing between a hot wallet for convenience or a cold wallet for maximum security often depends on personal strategy and risk tolerance. Both options have their place in the journey of building wealth, and understanding how to balance them is key. At the same time, investors are also learning that security and trust don’t stop at storage, they begin with the projects themselves. That’s why tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, already audited and drawing strong attention, are being recognized as examples of how credibility can matter just as much as custody choices. Hot wallets: convenience with risks Hot wallets are software applications or browser extensions connected to the internet. They are popular for everyday use, offering investors quick access to send, swap, or stake tokens. Most decentralized applications (dApps) rely on hot wallets like MetaMask, Phantom, or Trust Wallet. The upside is clear: instant transactions, integration with DeFi, and ease of use. For traders who move in and out of positions frequently, hot wallets are nearly indispensable. The downside is also obvious: exposure to online threats. Phishing attacks, malware, and exchange breaches have repeatedly demonstrated that hot wallets carry heightened risk. While non-custodial wallets give investors control of their keys, the simple fact of being connected to the internet makes them vulnerable. Cold wallets: security above all Cold wallets, by contrast, are offline storage devices, typically hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, or even paper wallets generated and stored securely. By disconnecting private keys from the internet, they dramatically reduce exposure to hacks. For long-term holders, cold wallets are the gold standard. Investors with large positions often use them as vaults, keeping the bulk of their assets offline while maintaining smaller amounts in hot wallets for daily activity. Cold wallets aren’t perfect. They require careful handling, proper backups, and safe storage. Losing a recovery phrase can mean losing access permanently. But when it comes to security, cold wallets remain unmatched. Institutional adoption highlights the divide As institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Coinbase Custody expand into crypto, the hot vs cold wallet debate is shaping their infrastructure. Most institutions rely on multi-signature cold storage solutions, blending offline security with layers of redundancy. These services aim to protect billions in assets while still enabling controlled access when needed. For retail investors, this serves as a reminder: if institutions aren’t leaving their assets in hot wallets, why should individuals? Security standards in traditional finance are rising, and crypto investors who ignore them risk being left exposed. Amid this security discussion, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn attention not only for its explosive upside potential but also for its commitment to credibility. In a presale environment where many projects skip safeguards, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already completed audits with HashEx and CertiK. This step matters. Investors consistently cite trust as a deciding factor, especially when allocating early to projects priced at fractions of a cent. At just $0.00044, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers affordability and narrative power. But it’s the audits that set it apart, signaling that the team is serious about protecting its investors and establishing legitimacy in a high-risk sector. Analysts now forecast that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 48× or more in returns, fueled by scarcity, branding, and surging retail demand. Yet the project’s emphasis on being vetted and transparent is what resonates most in today’s climate, especially as investors weigh how and where to store their assets. Just as cold wallets provide security in custody, audited projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide security in allocation. Choosing the right mix So, which is safer: hot wallets or cold wallets? The answer lies in balancing convenience and protection. Most experienced investors use a combination: Hot wallets for small balances, trading, and quick DeFi interactions. Cold wallets for long-term storage and larger amounts. By dividing holdings between the two, investors reduce risk while maintaining flexibility. For example, an investor might keep 90% of their assets offline and 10% in hot wallets for daily use. In the same way, portfolio allocation mirrors this balance: stable projects like Ethereum and Solana provide credibility, while high-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE add growth potential. Security and opportunity go hand in hand. Best practices for wallet safety Beyond choosing hot or cold, there are practical steps every investor should follow: Back up recovery phrases securely, offline, and in multiple locations. Use hardware wallets for long-term holdings. Beware of phishing attempts, always verify URLs and smart contracts. Enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Diversify storage across wallets and providers to reduce single points of failure. These measures, combined with the right wallet choice, can protect investors from the most common pitfalls. Conclusion The debate between hot and cold wallets reflects the larger challenge of crypto: balancing convenience with security. Hot wallets are essential for fast-moving traders, but they expose assets to greater risk. Cold wallets offer unmatched protection, but require discipline and careful handling. For investors serious about safeguarding their wealth, the safest approach is using both, just as institutions do. And when it comes to choosing tokens, the same principle applies: mix proven networks with high-upside but credible newcomers. That’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE, audited, affordable, and forecasted for 48× growth, is gaining traction. In a market where winners separate themselves through both opportunity and trust, it represents the kind of project that could define the both characteristics.

Among them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is generating buzz with its innovative lending and borrowing model, sparking rumors of a potential 40x value boost. This new altcoin, currently at a tiny $0.035, has seen more than $16,200 hungry investors buy into it. With meme tokens like PEPE under growing pressure in a falling market, DeFi sector utility-driven assets are being considered more and more as the future of growth and investor confidence to be maintained. Pepe Coin Swings Between $0.0000107 Amid Falling Meme Sentiment Pepe Coin (PEPE) is valued at approximately $0.0000107 USD, with day-to-day activity enjoying consistent action around this price. Short-term technicals forecast an 87% potential increase if initial support around $0.0000122 holds, with target areas around $0.0000227, though overall meme coin attitude is downbeat and some expectations see only marginal near-term action below $0.0000267. As meme tokens like PEPE face pressure from shifting sentiment, attention is developing on emerging DeFi initiatives like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 FOMO You can join Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with a presale investment at $0.035 per token today. More than 16,200 unique buyers have already jumped onto the opportunity, which has seen the project attain a massive $15.6M raise. This rapid rise is a strong vote of confidence on what the team is building. The team also recently collaborated with Certik on the official audit of the project, as well as an ongoing bug hunt. They’ve allocated a $50,000 USDT reward that will go to bug hunters who spot possible weaknesses within the project’s code. Price Discovery Precise price data is needed to make borrowing, lending, and liquidation secure. Chainlink oracles are used by Mutuum Finance to provide the system with market prices in USD and local tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feed data, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange rates are also used by the system to keep valuations as precise under stress. Managing Volatility and Exposure Volatility in the market is translated one-to-one to collateral management within the protocol. Mutuum Finance differentiates between Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation points depending on the stability of each token. The allowance and borrowing value are higher for stronger, more stable tokens, while riskier tokens have lower values. Reserve multipliers are applied proportionally ranging from around 10% for lower-volatility assets to up to 35% for riskier assets, creating a default protection margin without capping participation diversification. The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol allows clients to actively manage their capital by means of passive lending and borrowing, with the hope of allowing borrowers to borrow against piles of securitised assets. The system stabilization algorithm and interest rate optimization algorithms are implemented within the system, with the hope of making the system efficient as well as long-term capital usage. Risk and Liquidity Management The protocol actively controls market liquidity and volatility to facilitate closure of distressed positions. Risk exposure must be kept within pre-defined limits, and liquidation settings are established. Assets such as ETH and stablecoins may offer higher Loan-to-Value levels, while riskier assets are supplied with lower ones. Reserve factors are distributed proportionally across all classes of tokens to manage asset opportunity vs. risk to achieve maximum overall protection of protocol holdings.

Technical indicators now hint at a potential rally, with the meme coin attracting renewed attention from investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.50? This Channel Break Could Be The Catalyst The 20-day EMA near $0.225, alongside the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day averages clustered below $0.220, highlight a strong support zone. With the RSI at 60–61, DOGE shows steady buying momentum without being overbought. Similarly, the MACD histogram has turned positive, signaling a resurgence in bullish sentiment following muted August trading. Resistance at $0.25 Could Unlock Higher Targets Dogecoin’s short-term trajectory hinges on whether it can close above $0.246–$0.250, a level where both resistance and Bollinger Bands converge. A confirmed breakout may clear the path toward $0.263, $0.273–$0.276, and the July high of $0.300. Support sits at $0.238–$0.240, with deeper levels near $0.233–$0.231 and the 20-day EMA at $0.225. Any drop below the 100/200-day cluster around $0.214–$0.213 would weaken the bullish setup. Market analysts also note Dogecoin’s parallel channel pattern, with resistance near $0.29. A breakout here could potentially extend gains beyond $0.3 to as far as $0.50, based on the measured width of the channel. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart.

51575690,579288,1757638827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51575690.jpeg,Will Solana Launch Its Own Stablecoin? Helius CEO Calls It A No-Brainer,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-stablecoin-helius-ceo-calls-it-a-no-brainer/,"Helius Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz ignited a fresh round of debate inside the Solana ecosystem on September 10 after floating the idea of a Solana-aligned stablecoin whose reserve yield would be redirected to SOL via buybacks or burns—either as an “enshrined” protocol feature or, more likely, through competing digital-asset treasury companies (DATs). “Warming up to the idea that Solana should enshrine a stablecoin,” he wrote, adding that “50% burn of the yield goes back to burning SOL.” Hours later, he reframed the thrust: “it shouldn’t be enshrined, a DAT should do it… fix it and trillions.” Why A Solana Stablecoin Is A No-Brainer Mumtaz’s core critique targets what he describes as “yield leakage” from Solana: “Stablecoins are commodities, and currently on Solana, there is one that captures all yield and literally funds Solana’s biggest competitor with it!” He argued that, under the US GENIUS Act, stables are readily swappable and issuers will fight aggressively for market share—citing the recent “Bachelor-style” scramble among large stablecoin companies to court business. “If you don’t want to enshrine a Solana-centric stable, then consider digital asset treasury companies (DATs)… The DAT is literally a machine for buying the underlying token.” That framing collides with the letter of the new US law. The GENIUS Act , signed in July, carves out “payment stablecoins” as neither securities nor commodities for US federal purposes, consolidating oversight largely under banking regulators and expressly separating them from SEC/CFTC jurisdiction. Multiple legal analyses and a Congressional Research Service note affirm the statute’s classification. In short: Mumtaz’s “commodity” phrasing is rhetorical, not legal. Still, the law’s most consequential economic detail—stablecoins cannot pass interest to holders—means issuers (or affiliated structures) capture the reserve income and can decide how to use it. That’s precisely the lever Mumtaz wants pointed back at Solana. Within hours, one builder publicly accepted the challenge. “We (@KASTcard) will put 101–103% of all interest income from USDK on Solana, to buyback SOL,” wrote CEO and co-founder of KAST, adding that the buybacks would sit with a foundation that issues a token after a planned TGE and that USDK would be issued with the m^0 foundation as a U.S. “Genius compliant” stable. The 1–3% kicker above 100% would be treated as marketing spend. KAST and m^0 have previously disclosed plans to launch programmable, application-specific dollars on the networl; KAST’s consumer app and card already target global stablecoin payments. The proposal’s mechanics are straightforward in concept. A native USD stablecoin accrues reserve yield (e.g., from T-bills) at the issuer level; a DAT structure then commits that income stream to buy SOL on the open market and either retire it or recycle it into ecosystem programs. Mumtaz even sketched a toy model—“Assume a Solana DAT runs a Solana stable, call it USDmanlet… [it] earns yield. The DAT takes all the yield and buys SOL with it… embed it in the ecosystem and take the yield and pump it back… or into burning SOL.” Stablecoin Wars Reach Solana Mumtaz’s “funding the competitor” barb is aimed squarely at USDC’s economics and Coinbase’s Base L2. Coinbase and Circle split USDC reserve income, a line item that has grown into a major revenue stream for Coinbase as stablecoin supply has rebounded; Coinbase incubated Base, an Ethereum Layer-2 that has quickly become a high-throughput venue for on-chain activity. None of that is nefarious—USDC’s terms are clear—but for Solana purists it is strategically suboptimal to let billions in Solana-settled stablecoin activity originate issuer profits that are then reinvested in a rival’s stack. That is the “simple problem” Mumtaz says he wants to fix, whether by enshrining or (more plausibly) by market-driven competition among issuers and DATs. Multicoin Capital co-founder and managing partner Tushar Jain agreed via X: “One of the best things about Solana’s culture is adopting good ideas from other ecosystems. Hyperliquid’s idea to encourage stablecoin issuers to buy HYPE with USDH interest is a powerful way to drive REV. Why should Circle keep all of the interest revenue from USDC on Solana?” For now, this is only a proposal—there is no SIP or governance vote to “enshrine” anything at the protocol layer, and Mumtaz himself emphasized the market-driven DAT route. Whether the proposal takes the form of competing issuers pledging buybacks, a canonical “ecosystem stable,” or a more modular treasury program, the endgame Mumtaz sketched is unambiguous: stop leaking yield, and point it at SOL.

A truly remarkable Bitcoin price surge has pushed BTC past an impressive threshold, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally. According to market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC has now crossed the significant $116,000 mark, trading at $116,013.99 on the Binance USDT market. This latest rally underscores Bitcoin’s enduring strength and its pivotal role in the digital asset landscape. What’s Fueling This Incredible Bitcoin Price Surge? Many factors contribute to Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the broader market dynamics. This latest Bitcoin price surge isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a culmination of several powerful influences. Increased Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and offerings. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, for example, has provided a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to BTC, injecting substantial capital into the market. Halving Event Impact: Bitcoin’s programmatic halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering circulation, historically precede significant price appreciation. The scarcity created by these events often acts as a strong bullish catalyst. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties and inflation concerns can drive investors towards Bitcoin, which some view as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Its decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive alternative asset. The Significance of BTC’s $116,000 Breakthrough Crossing the $116,000 threshold is more than just a number; it signals strong market confidence and a positive sentiment shift. Such milestones often trigger a psychological effect, encouraging more investors to enter the market or increase their holdings. This momentum can create a powerful feedback loop, driving prices even higher. A sustained move above this level could solidify it as a new support zone, paving the way for further exploration of uncharted price territories. This kind of upward trajectory often impacts the broader altcoin market as well, with capital flowing into other digital assets. Navigating the Volatility: Smart Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Surge While the excitement of a Bitcoin price surge is undeniable, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. It is crucial for investors to approach these periods with a clear strategy and a focus on long-term goals. How can you participate responsibly? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, market trends, and potential risks. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s history shows that despite short-term volatility, its long-term trend has been upward. A patient, long-term approach can often yield better results. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a dominant asset, diversifying your crypto portfolio can help spread risk. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Trajectory? The future of Bitcoin continues to be a hot topic among analysts and experts. Many foresee continued growth, driven by ongoing technological advancements, increasing global adoption, and its evolving role in the financial system. This sustained Bitcoin price surge is a strong indicator of its potential. However, potential challenges remain. Regulatory developments, market corrections, and competition from other digital assets could influence its path. Despite these factors, Bitcoin’s foundational principles and its proven track record suggest a resilient future. The journey past $116,000 is a testament to its dynamic nature and its ability to continually surprise the market. The latest Bitcoin price surge above $116,000 is a significant event that highlights the cryptocurrency’s robust market presence and growing investor confidence.

The cryptocurrency market recently witnessed a dramatic turn, as a staggering $104 million worth of crypto futures contracts were liquidated in just one hour across major exchanges. This rapid unraveling is part of a larger trend, with a total of $350 million in futures liquidations occurring over the past 24 hours. Such events underscore the inherent volatility and high stakes involved in digital asset trading, especially concerning crypto futures liquidation . For many traders, these moments can be both financially devastating and emotionally challenging, highlighting the critical need for understanding market mechanics. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation and Why Does It Happen? To truly grasp the impact of such large sums vanishing, it is essential to understand what a futures contract is and what liquidation entails. A crypto futures contract is simply an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Traders often use these contracts with leverage , which means they borrow funds to amplify their potential returns. However, leverage is a double-edged sword. While it can magnify profits, it also significantly increases the risk of loss. Crypto futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s position is automatically closed by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. Essentially, if the market moves against a leveraged position to a certain extent, the exchange will close the position to prevent the trader from losing more money than they have in their account, and to protect the exchange itself. Margin Call: Before full liquidation, traders might receive a margin call, requesting them to deposit more funds to maintain their position. Automated Process: Liquidation is an automated process, designed to happen quickly to mitigate further losses in a volatile market. The Recent Devastating Event: What Triggered This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation? The recent figures are certainly eye-opening: $104 million in crypto futures liquidation within an hour , contributing to $350 million over 24 hours. These substantial liquidations usually occur during periods of high market volatility, often triggered by sudden, significant price movements in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. A sharp, unexpected drop or surge can cascade through the market, forcing the closure of numerous leveraged positions. What specific catalysts might have been at play? While exact triggers can be complex, factors often include: Macroeconomic News: Broader economic data or central bank decisions can influence investor sentiment globally. Regulatory Announcements: News regarding new regulations or crackdowns in specific regions can cause market jitters. Whale Movements: Large sales or purchases by major holders (whales) can create significant price swings. Technical Breakdowns: When key support or resistance levels are breached, it can trigger widespread panic selling or buying. Regardless of the precise trigger, the outcome for many leveraged traders was swift and severe, underscoring the brutal efficiency of crypto futures liquidation mechanisms. Understanding the Ripple Effect: Who Gets Hit Hardest by Crypto Futures Liquidation? When such a massive crypto futures liquidation event unfolds, its effects ripple throughout the market. The most immediate and severe impact is felt by the traders whose positions are liquidated. These individuals face substantial, often complete, loss of their invested capital for those specific positions. However, the impact extends beyond individual losses. Firstly, a wave of liquidations can exacerbate market movements. As positions are forcibly closed, they often involve selling assets, which can push prices down further, triggering even more liquidations in a cascading effect. This creates a feedback loop that intensifies volatility. Secondly, it can lead to a dip in overall market sentiment. Traders become more cautious, potentially reducing trading activity and leading to lower liquidity. The sudden removal of large trading volumes also affects market depth and stability, making it harder for other traders to execute orders without impacting prices. Ultimately, these events serve as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged trading environments. Navigating Volatile Waters: How Can Traders Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risks? Given the potential for rapid and significant losses, understanding how to manage risk is paramount for anyone engaging in crypto futures trading. Preventing crypto futures liquidation is largely about prudent risk management and disciplined trading practices. Here are some actionable insights to help navigate these volatile markets: Manage Your Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage, as it drastically reduces your margin for error. Lower leverage provides more buffer against market swings. Utilize Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders. These automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting your potential losses before liquidation occurs. Monitor Your Margin: Keep a close eye on your margin levels. If your margin percentage drops too low, consider adding more funds to your account or reducing your position size. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one highly leveraged futures position. Diversification can spread risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic developments that could impact cryptocurrency prices. Practice Risk-Reward Analysis: Before entering any trade, evaluate the potential profit versus the potential loss. Only take trades where the reward significantly outweighs the risk. By adopting these strategies, traders can better protect their capital and navigate the often-unpredictable world of crypto futures. The recent crypto futures liquidation event, where $104 million vanished in an hour, serves as a powerful reminder of the unforgiving nature of leveraged trading in cryptocurrency markets. While futures offer significant opportunities for profit, they come with equally significant risks. Understanding the mechanisms of liquidation, the factors that trigger it, and implementing robust risk management strategies are not just recommendations—they are essential for survival in this dynamic landscape. Traders must approach these markets with caution, knowledge, and a disciplined mindset to safeguard their investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a crypto futures contract? A crypto futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a future date. It allows traders to speculate on the future price movements of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. 2. What does ‘liquidation’ mean in crypto futures trading? Liquidation in crypto futures trading means an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against them, and they no longer have enough margin (collateral) in their account to cover potential losses. This prevents further debt. 3. Why did $104 million in futures get liquidated so quickly? Such large and rapid liquidations are typically triggered by sudden, significant price swings in the underlying cryptocurrencies. High market volatility, often exacerbated by macroeconomic news, regulatory changes, or large institutional trades, can quickly deplete traders’ margins and force automated closures. 4. How can traders protect themselves from crypto futures liquidation? Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, regularly monitoring their margin levels, diversifying their portfolios, and staying informed about market conditions. Implementing sound risk management is crucial. 5. Is crypto futures trading regulated? The regulation of crypto futures trading varies significantly across different jurisdictions. Some countries have established clear regulatory frameworks, while others have outright banned it or have no specific rules. Traders should always check the regulatory status in their region and on the exchange they use. Did you find this article insightful?

This move involves a substantial amount of Solana (SOL) from wallets associated with the defunct FTX exchange and its sister firm, Alameda Research. What exactly does this mean for the Solana ecosystem and for those holding SOL? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential implications of this crucial development. What Just Happened with FTX Alameda SOL Unstaking? Recently, an address linked to FTX and Alameda Research made a notable transaction. It unstaked 192,000 SOL tokens, which translates to approximately $43.56 million at current market values. This significant FTX Alameda SOL unstaking was reported by EmberCN, signaling a potential shift in these substantial holdings. Large Sum Unstaked: The unstaked amount represents a considerable portion of SOL. Associated Entities: The funds originate from addresses tied to FTX and Alameda Research, entities currently undergoing complex bankruptcy proceedings. Remaining Holdings: Despite this unstaking, the address still retains approximately 4.184 million SOL, valued at around $960 million, remaining in staking. This indicates their continued, albeit shifting, presence in the Solana ecosystem. Understanding the Mechanics of SOL Unstaking For those new to the concept, ‘unstaking’ in the context of cryptocurrencies like Solana refers to the process of removing tokens from a staking pool. When tokens are staked, they are locked up to support the network’s operations and earn rewards. Unstaking makes these tokens liquid and available for transfer or sale. This particular FTX Alameda SOL unstaking follows a pattern observed in previous movements. Based on past actions, these unstaked funds are typically not moved directly. Instead, they are often: Split across multiple intermediary addresses. Subsequently transferred to major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. This multi-step process can sometimes be a precursor to selling activity, which could introduce more supply into the market. Potential Market Impact of FTX Alameda SOL Unstaking The movement of such a large quantity of SOL, particularly from entities involved in liquidation, naturally raises questions about its potential impact on Solana’s price. When significant amounts of a cryptocurrency are transferred to exchanges, it often signals an intention to sell. An increase in sell-side pressure can, in turn, affect market prices. While the immediate effect of this specific FTX Alameda SOL unstaking is yet to be fully seen, market participants are keenly observing for any follow-up transfers to exchanges. The ongoing liquidation process for FTX and Alameda Research means that their remaining assets, including SOL, are systematically being managed to repay creditors. These periodic movements are part of that broader strategy. Navigating the Future: Investor Insights For Solana holders and potential investors, understanding these movements is key. While the unstaking itself doesn’t automatically mean an imminent price crash, it does add a layer of consideration regarding market supply. It’s a reminder that large institutional holdings, especially those under liquidation, can influence market dynamics. What should investors consider in light of the FTX Alameda SOL unstaking ? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports of fund transfers to exchanges. Diversify: Always consider a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks. Long-Term View: Evaluate Solana’s fundamentals and long-term potential, separate from short-term liquidation-driven movements. The Solana ecosystem continues to develop, with many projects building on its blockchain. While events like these are noteworthy, they are often part of the broader market’s ebb and flow. A Compelling Summary of SOL’s Latest Movement The recent FTX Alameda SOL unstaking of $43.6 million is a significant development in the ongoing saga of FTX’s liquidation. While the funds remain within the control of the bankruptcy estate, their unstaked status suggests they are now liquid and ready for potential movement to exchanges. Past patterns indicate such transfers often precede selling, which could introduce additional supply to the market. For investors, monitoring these movements and understanding the context of FTX’s asset management is crucial. It underscores the importance of staying informed and considering the potential impact of large-scale asset liquidations on market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘unstaking’ mean for Solana (SOL)? Unstaking refers to the process of removing SOL tokens that were previously locked up to support the Solana network and earn rewards. Once unstaked, these tokens become liquid and can be freely moved or sold. Why are FTX and Alameda Research unstaking SOL? FTX and Alameda Research are currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. The unstaking of assets like SOL is part of their broader strategy to liquidate holdings to repay creditors and manage the bankruptcy estate’s assets efficiently. Will the FTX Alameda SOL unstaking immediately crash the SOL price? Not necessarily. While the unstaking makes the SOL liquid and available for sale, it doesn’t guarantee an immediate price crash. The impact depends on when and how these funds are moved to exchanges and if they are indeed sold. However, it does add potential sell-side pressure to the market. How much SOL do FTX and Alameda Research still hold in staking? Even after this recent unstaking, the associated address still holds approximately 4.184 million SOL, valued at around $960 million, remaining in staking. This indicates a substantial continued presence in the Solana staking ecosystem. Where are the unstaked SOL tokens likely to go next? Based on past patterns observed with FTX and Alameda’s asset movements, the unstaked SOL tokens are likely to be split across multiple intermediary addresses before being transferred to major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.

OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said Thursday that the nonprofit will retain control of a new public benefit corporation while securing an equity stake worth at least $100 billion. He noted the stake would make the nonprofit “one of the most well-resourced philanthropic organizations in the world.” “OpenAI started as a nonprofit, remains one today, and will continue to be one — with the nonprofit holding the authority that guides our future,” Taylor said in the statement. Reports indicate that the $100 billion stake, which stands for about 20% of the value of OpenAI, is a floor and is prone to rise. After the announcement, Microsoft shares rose about 2.4% in extended trading. Microsoft and OpenAI strike truce after months of tense negotiations Microsoft and OpenAI have engaged in discussions for months about advancing their relations, partly to secure Microsoft’s assent for restructuring the startup. In return for massive financial backing, Microsoft can use OpenAI’s AI tools in its products. Microsoft’s involvement has been a key obstacle to OpenAI’s restructuring plans. Still, Microsoft and OpenAI didn’t disclose the terms of the new contract and said that the current agreement was nonbinding. The firms noted on Thursday that they had signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of our collaboration.” They noted they are “actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety.” This concludes a tense summer of negotiations between the two companies, which grew so strained at one point that OpenAI considered turning to antitrust regulators to exit the contract. Nonprofit to keep control with $100B stake in new for-profit entity A few weeks ago, Microsoft released the first of its large language models developed under Suleyman. It was trained on 15,000 Nvidia Corp. H100 chips. Cutting-edge models from Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI used clusters six to 10 times larger, Suleyman added, suggesting that Microsoft created its model more efficiently. Microsoft aims to take a multimodel approach across its products, letting customers choose the AI models they prefer, CEO Satya Nadella said. Earlier this week, The Information reported that the company plans to integrate Anthropic models into some offerings. OpenAI is finalizing the ownership structure of its planned for-profit entity, but still needs approval from regulators in California and Delaware. The company said the nonprofit will retain control and hold a stake worth over $100 billion, potentially making it one of the world’s largest philanthropies — though it remains uncertain when those funds could actually be distributed. OpenAI is contending with a growing list of opponents actively seeking to block its restructuring effort or intervening with regulators in hopes its nonprofit mission remains intact. One of those involved is billionaire Elon Musk, Meta Platforms, and various advocacy organizations. Musk has already taken Apple and OpenAI to court. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas by Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI, follows the company’s takeover of social media platform X through a stock swap earlier this year. Musk alleges that OpenAI is leveraging its influence to “collude” and block rivals from competing in smartphones and generative AI. His team claims Apple deliberately favors OpenAI by embedding ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs, pushing alternatives like xAI’s Grok down App Store rankings. According to the suit, the Apple-OpenAI partnership is structured to shut out competing super apps and AI chatbots, giving the two companies a shared edge they deny to others.

Kraken’s rollout underscores its growing ambitions ahead of a potential 2026 public listing . Perpetual contracts, or perps, are a type of futures product that differs from traditional futures. Unlike conventional futures, contracts with a certain expiration date perps have no expiration date. This means traders can stay in the position if they remain at the required margin. Traders must provide the right amount of trade liquidity in the first instance and the price margin in return for maintaining the stock. Perps was introduced back in 2016 by BitMEX and swiftly became a foundational part of the crypto derivatives markets. They are well-suited for the crypto industry, which has a 24/7 operation and is even more volatile than traditional markets. Kraken’s new product lets users take a longer position on a perceived price gain or a shorter position on a forecast drop. Notably, traders don’t need to own the underlying crypto asset to participate. This opens access to those who prefer not to make direct coin purchases. At launch, positions can be collateralized with Kraken USD balances, with more collateral options expected in the future. Kraken has also built in risk-management safeguards to help protect traders. Stop-loss orders, for example, let traders easily walk away from positions even when the market moves sharply in the other direction. A Kraken spokesperson told The Block that he wants to provide perps to “everyday investors” without exposing them to sudden losses while providing them with protections. Kraken expands derivatives as IPO looms Kraken Perps is launching at an important time for the platform, as reports suggest that it is readying for a public listing in early 2026, which may even make it one of the largest crypto companies to go public since Coinbase in 2021. The time marks strong growth in the market for perpetual contracts. August 2025 was the busiest month ever, with around US$515 billion in trading volume. The spike is a lesson in how many more people have been trading perps because traders have taken advantage of short-term price spikes in a world where futures contracts have expired, and will not allow them to have futures. Meanwhile, Kraken is expanding its ecosystem further. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, the company recently introduced a tokenized stock product , xStocks, to the European Union. It is behind the completion of a deal to acquire Breakout, a custom trading platform, and has been incubating INK, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, which is on track to release a token of its own. Those efforts are part of Kraken’s strategy of pushing beyond spot trading. The exchange establishes itself as a full-service trading hub for retail and institutional clients with derivatives, tokenized equities, and blockchain infrastructure. Kraken balances opportunity and risk Kraken has designed Perps as a fresh entry point for crypto-market retail traders. The exchange says the product provides more options for users to voice their views on prices, diversification strategies, and handle portfolio risks. As many people can’t have a stake in an underlying asset, the long or short positions provide some trading opportunities and aren’t always for the professional. However, within these opportunities are also distinct threats. Perps are very leveraged products, and leverage can amplify ups and downs. In a turbulent crypto market, sudden price surges wipe out positions swiftly. In severe scenarios, losses exceeding that initial deposit leave no one safe when trading. Kraken has accepted this fact and notes that “perps are not for every investor.” The exchange has introduced some safeguards to mitigate these risks. Stop-loss orders, margin alerts, and easy mobile integration are all intended to protect retail users if markets swing in their opposite direction. Kraken suggests risk management tools can only get you so far, and a trader must understand how perps work before jumping on board. It won’t be the same for access to Kraken Perps on launch. Regulatory environments are disparate across nations, and the exchange is rolling the product out in stages, with early releases in several jurisdictions where the legal landscape becomes more conducive.

According to reports , Kelley set out his concerns in an op-ed for 1819 News, arguing that a perceived gap in the law could let crypto platforms offer yields or rewards that pull funds away from local lenders. The warning comes as public comment periods have already opened at the US Treasury, and regulators are expected to write the rules that make the new law operational. GENIUS Act: Senator Warns Of Deposit Flight Financial experts say the worry centers on how “comparable supervision” will be defined. If foreign or nonbank stablecoin issuers are treated as having comparable oversight when regulators’ rules are loose, depositors could be tempted to shift cash to higher returns offered by crypto firms. Alabama’s Sen. Keith Kelley warns the GENIUS Act could devastate rural banks by shifting deposits. Is stablecoin regulation hurting communities? #GENIUSAct #Stablecoin #CryptoLaw https://t.co/tHAibq6EMg pic.twitter.com/BDhqoFNif5 — 4C by 360Trader (@4cby360) September 11, 2025 One estimate cited by banking groups puts potential deposit outflows as high as $6.6 trillion if the law is interpreted broadly. That number has made small bank leaders uneasy. They fear losing the stable deposits they use to lend to families, farmers, and local businesses. A Rural Banking Crisis In The Making Many community banks operate on thin margins. They rely on local deposits to underwrite loans for crop seasons, equipment purchases, and small shops. Based on reports, Kelley warned that those lifelines could be weakened if large sums move to new digital products outside the traditional banking system. Farmers and small business owners were named as especially vulnerable, because local lenders often offer terms tailored to seasonal needs. GENIUS Act & Regulatory Path Ahead The GENIUS Act is not yet in force in any operational sense. Implementation will depend on rulemaking by the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve, and those agencies have already asked for public input on the risks and anti-money laundering safeguards. Reports have disclosed that some banking groups and lawmakers want tighter definitions and clearer guardrails before the rules are finalized. Supporters of the law argue it could bring more clarity to stablecoin markets, but opponents say that the details matter most. If deposits start to leave, small banks could be forced to cut back on loans or raise rates to retain customers. That outcome would likely shift credit away from local borrowers toward larger financial centers.

The announcement is expected to coincide with a state visit by US President Donald Trump, during which American firms are set to pledge tens of billions of dollars in new projects as a show of US commitment. Reports indicate that the investment will be implemented in collaboration with Nscale Global Holdings Ltd , a London company responsible for operating large amounts of data centers, a major player in Europe’s growing demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. With OpenAI led by Sam Altman and Nvidia led by Jensen Huang, this move will be significant as it indicates both the size of projects currently discussed and their strategic value in establishing a bigger presence in the AI economy of Europe. Companies drive AI expansion OpenAI sees the UK project as part of its broader push to expand the global Stargate data center program, which already includes major commitments in Norway, the UAE, and the US. As Europe moves to tighten regulations on generative AI, establishing large-scale infrastructure in Britain could offer OpenAI both stronger political visibility and valuable commercial backing. For Nvidia, which supplies the data to most of the world’s AI models, an added advantage is that it will be able to install its most powerful processors, the GB200 series of processors, just introduced by recent development, in a country where the growth of AI stands highest on the national agenda. By the end of 2024, Nscale announced that it will invest $2.5 billion in UK data centers for three years, including a site in Essex to store such high-end chips as 45,000 would be housed. At that time, OpenAI did not disclose an anchor customer, and as a result, this brings credibility to the project and scale. Since July, Nscale has garnered the commitment from Altman to be the lead customer for the Norwegian site set up at Nscale and its extension to the UK; however, the relationship clearly illustrates how the two companies are deepening. UK seeks to lead in AI infrastructure The move is well timed to align with Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s ambitions, who introduced a wide-reaching strategy earlier this year to “turbocharge AI” in Britain with investments in data centers, chip manufacturing, and designated “AI growth zones.” The zones are supposed to accelerate planning approvals and connect new sites to the national grid faster, acknowledging that infrastructure bottlenecks made Britain less competitive with the US and China. Starmer has long said that massive private investments are necessary for London to maintain its presence in the global technology economy. Britain has already committed £1 billion of public funding to beef up computing capacity by a factor of 20. Still, the government cannot address the gap because the AI infrastructure projects are so large and complex. The arrival of OpenAI and Nvidia into this arena with billions of dollars in extra funds thus represents a key opportunity for the UK to deepen its position as Europe’s main development engine. While the companies have not disclosed the exact quantity of their pledges or the intended sites of these plants, officials and industry experts expect projects measured in the tens of billions of dollars over several years.

We’re talking about a substantial movement linked to Anchorage Digital, a prominent crypto custody and banking firm, that could hold implications for the Uniswap ecosystem and beyond. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic digital asset landscape. Unpacking the Recent UNI Token Transfer Event On-chain analyst EmberCN recently brought to light an interesting series of transactions. Approximately 12 hours ago, an address connected to Anchorage Digital executed a massive transfer of 5.355 million UNI tokens. This considerable sum, valued at around $52.9 million, was moved to a specific address (0xF43…). Just three hours later, a portion of these funds — specifically 200,000 UNI tokens — found their way to a centralized exchange. This smaller, yet still significant, deposit was worth approximately $1.97 million at the time of the transaction. Such movements are closely watched by market participants as they can often signal upcoming trading activity or strategic shifts. Why Anchorage Digital’s UNI Token Transfer is Significant Anchorage Digital is a regulated entity providing secure custody and financial services for institutional investors. When an address associated with such a major player moves assets, it naturally sparks curiosity. A UNI token transfer of this magnitude isn’t just a casual transaction; it could indicate several potential scenarios: Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutions frequently adjust their holdings across various assets to manage risk or optimize returns. Liquidity Management: Funds might be moved to an exchange to increase liquidity for other operations or to facilitate trading. Potential Selling Pressure: While not confirmed, depositing tokens to a centralized exchange often precedes a sale. This could introduce selling pressure on the UNI token. Operational Needs: The transfer could also be part of routine operational requirements or client-directed actions. Understanding the ‘why’ behind these moves helps paint a clearer picture of institutional sentiment and strategy within the crypto space. Decoding the Market Impact of UNI Token Transfers The deposit of 200,000 UNI tokens onto a centralized exchange is a particularly noteworthy detail. Typically, assets held in secure cold storage or institutional wallets are not immediately available for trading. Moving them to an exchange changes this dynamic. Increased Supply: When a significant amount of a token like UNI becomes available on an exchange, it can potentially increase the circulating supply available for trade. Price Implications: If the intention behind the deposit is to sell, it could lead to downward pressure on the UNI token’s price, especially if the market demand doesn’t absorb the new supply. Investor Sentiment: Such movements can influence investor sentiment. Some might interpret it as a bearish signal, while others might see it as a normal part of institutional asset management. Transparency: On-chain analysis provides valuable transparency, allowing the community to monitor these institutional movements in real-time. This particular UNI token transfer serves as a reminder of how on-chain data offers a window into the otherwise opaque world of institutional crypto activity. What’s Next for UNI and the Broader DeFi Landscape? While this specific UNI token transfer is a snapshot in time, it underscores the continuous evolution of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. UNI, as the native token of Uniswap – a leading decentralized exchange – plays a pivotal role in this ecosystem. Community Governance: UNI holders have governance rights, allowing them to vote on key protocol changes. Large institutional holdings and their movements can therefore have implications for governance participation. Market Vigilance: Traders and investors will likely keep a close eye on further movements from Anchorage Digital-linked addresses and the broader UNI market. Future Trends: This event highlights the growing interaction between traditional financial services (like custody firms) and the burgeoning DeFi world. It suggests increasing institutional engagement, which can be a double-edged sword, bringing both capital and potential market volatility. Monitoring these dynamics is essential for anyone invested in or observing the future trajectory of DeFi. Conclusion: The recent UNI token transfer linked to Anchorage Digital, culminating in a $1.97 million deposit to a centralized exchange, is a compelling example of institutional activity within the crypto market. While the exact motives remain speculative, such movements provide invaluable insights into market dynamics, potential liquidity shifts, and the evolving relationship between traditional finance and decentralized protocols. Keeping an eye on these on-chain signals is paramount for making informed decisions in the fast-paced world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is UNI and why is it significant? A1: UNI is the native governance token of Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX). It allows holders to participate in the protocol’s governance, voting on key proposals and changes, making it a crucial asset in the DeFi ecosystem. Q2: Who is Anchorage Digital? A2: Anchorage Digital is a regulated crypto custody and banking firm. It provides secure storage, trading, and financing services primarily for institutional investors, helping them safely engage with digital assets. Q3: What does it mean when UNI tokens are deposited to a centralized exchange? A3: Depositing tokens to a centralized exchange typically means they are being made available for trading. This can signal potential selling pressure if the institution intends to offload assets, or it could be for liquidity management or other operational purposes. Q4: How can I track such UNI token transfers? A4: Such transfers are tracked using on-chain analysis tools and platforms. These tools monitor public blockchain data, allowing analysts to identify large movements of assets by specific addresses or entities, often reported by on-chain analysts like EmberCN. Q5: Does this UNI token transfer guarantee a price drop for UNI? A5: Not necessarily. While a large deposit to an exchange can introduce selling pressure, it doesn’t guarantee a price drop. The market’s overall demand, other news, and the actual execution of trades will ultimately determine the price action. It’s a signal to monitor, not a definitive prediction.

A significant development is currently unfolding with WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI), which has put forward a groundbreaking governance proposal. This initiative aims to utilize 100% of its protocol-owned liquidity (POL) fees for a dedicated WLFI token buyback and permanent burn mechanism. This move could profoundly reshape the token’s economic landscape. Understanding WLFI’s Bold Buyback Proposal The core of this proposal is straightforward yet powerful: all fees generated from WLFI’s protocol-owned liquidity will be reinvested directly into the WLFI ecosystem. Specifically, these funds will be used to purchase WLFI tokens from the open market, effectively reducing the circulating supply. This is not just a temporary measure; once acquired, these tokens will be permanently removed from circulation through a ‘burn’ process. The community has shown overwhelming support for this strategic shift. As of now, the proposal boasts an impressive 99.6% approval rate, signaling strong consensus among WLFI holders. Voting is set to conclude on September 19, making this a pivotal moment for the protocol’s future direction. Why is WLFI Token Buyback So Powerful for Value Creation? A robust WLFI token buyback strategy offers several compelling benefits, particularly in the context of a DeFi protocol. By consistently reducing the token’s supply, the proposal aims to create scarcity, a fundamental driver of value in any market. This mechanism can lead to a more stable and potentially appreciating token price over time. Key advantages of this approach include: Increased Scarcity: Fewer tokens in circulation can naturally drive up demand and value. Enhanced Value Proposition: It creates a direct, transparent mechanism to return value to token holders, fostering stronger confidence and loyalty. Reduced Inflationary Pressure: Counteracts the natural inflation often associated with token emissions, promoting long-term sustainability. Community Alignment: Demonstrates a commitment to token holders’ interests, encouraging active participation and long-term holding. What Does This Mean for WLFI Holders and the Broader DeFi Ecosystem? For existing WLFI holders, this proposal represents a significant vote of confidence in the protocol’s future. The consistent demand created by the WLFI token buyback can contribute to price stability and potential growth, rewarding those who believe in the project’s long-term vision. It also empowers the community, as the decision to implement such a crucial economic model rests entirely on their votes. Furthermore, this initiative sets an example for the wider DeFi space. Protocols that actively manage their tokenomics through transparent and community-approved mechanisms like this can build greater trust and attract more users and investors. It highlights the power of decentralized governance in shaping a project’s economic destiny. Navigating the Mechanics: How the WLFI Token Buyback Works The process for this WLFI token buyback is designed for clarity and efficiency. First, the protocol collects fees generated from its liquidity operations. These fees, denominated in various cryptocurrencies, are then used to market buy WLFI tokens. Once purchased, these tokens are sent to an unspendable address, effectively removing them from the circulating supply forever. This ‘burn’ mechanism ensures that the reduction in supply is permanent and verifiable on the blockchain. This transparent and automated system minimizes human intervention, enhancing the trustworthiness of the process. It ensures that the value generated by the protocol’s activities directly benefits its token holders through a deflationary mechanism. The WLFI community’s decision on this proposal will undoubtedly mark a significant chapter in the protocol’s journey. By dedicating 100% of its POL fees to a perpetual buyback and burn, WLFI aims to forge a path towards enhanced token value, robust economic stability, and deeper community engagement. This revolutionary approach could serve as a powerful model for sustainable growth in the ever-evolving DeFi landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a token buyback and burn? A token buyback involves a project repurchasing its own tokens from the open market. A ‘burn’ then permanently removes these tokens from circulation, typically by sending them to an unrecoverable address. This process reduces the total supply, aiming to increase scarcity and potentially boost the token’s value. 2. What are Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) fees? Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) refers to liquidity that a decentralized protocol owns and manages itself, rather than relying solely on external liquidity providers. POL fees are the revenues generated from providing this liquidity to decentralized exchanges or other financial applications. 3. How does this proposal benefit WLFI holders? By reducing the total supply of WLFI tokens through buybacks and burns, the proposal aims to increase the scarcity of each token. This can lead to a higher demand and potentially a higher market value for WLFI, directly benefiting existing token holders. 4. When does the voting on this WLFI token buyback proposal conclude? The voting period for this governance proposal is set to conclude on September 19. 5. Is using 100% of fees for buyback and burn common in DeFi? While buyback and burn mechanisms are common in DeFi, dedicating 100% of protocol-owned liquidity fees specifically to this purpose is a bold and aggressive strategy, reflecting a strong commitment to token value appreciation and community alignment.

The four names emerge as particularly suited to play different roles in the cryptocurrency economy: TRON for cheap and high-volumes settlement; ADA for research-driven security and governance; SUI for high-throughput consumer apps; and XRP for cross-border payments. Each has measurable on-chain activity that can grow over time, active developer bases, and clear paths to adoption. According to recent charts, XRP price is currently trading around $2.82, SUI is $3.20, ADA is $0.82 and TRON $0.33. This makes the structure attractive for the construction of a real utility basket. After mapping these pillars, many long-term investors add one early-stage candidate for torque. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quite a popular token in 2025 watchlists. XRP – Payments Corridor Specialist With Room to Scale XRP aims to enable instant and ultra-low-cost value transfers for banks, remittance companies and fintechs. These have advantages such as predictable pricing and fast settlement in corridors where slower legacy rail still exists. Assuming that new corridors and bank integrations will be built, XRP’s base-case path to 2026, starting from a price of $2.82, sees it consolidate above resistance from the previous peak. This suggests an implied range of $3.50 -$4.50 over six to twelve months. The bullish scenario indicates a runway for $6.0-$8.0. If corridor growth stops, or liquidity thins during risk-off periods, a bearish scenario would revert to $2.00-$2.3. SUI – UX for High Throughput Apps and Consumer Apps SUI’s object-centric model and parallel execution are key to making on-chain actions feel immediate for gaming, social media, and business applications. With the help of the toolchain and SDKs, teams can iterate faster and ship. A base case, derived from utilization of flagship apps that will rise over the next year, is approximately $3.20, which translates to $4.50-$6.00. To present a bullish arc, however, the release of popular consumer titles or brand integrations that attract non-crypto users is key, which could drive targets to $8.00-$12.00 on a 18-24 month view. If there is a cooling of developer momentum or a decline in user retention, a downside trajectory lies between $2.20 and $2.60. ADA – Research-Based Security, Governance and Interoperability Cardano’s formal verification, eUTXO accounting, and staged governance are the top three things. That job will be favorable for public-sector pilots and institutions that appreciate reliability. However, scaling components, such as Hydra and middleware maturity (wallets, identity, and indexers), are crucial to unlocking richer apps. With ADA around $0.82, the base case is standard upgrades and increasing DeFi/identity usage to $1.0 – $1.50 in 6-12 months; there is room for $3.5.00-$4.00 under a more stable, multi-year case that includes cross-chain interoperability and enterprise-level use cases to be seen. Until new catalysts come about, the price might bounce back toward $0.55 to $0.65 if upgrades don’t come or activity is concentrated in a few apps. TRON – Predictable Fee Stablecoin Freight Line One of TRON’s key features is the ability to move stablecoins in large volumes with consistency and low fees. As a result of having a bandwidth/energy model, it is suitable for cross-platform transfers, on/off ramps and payments, as it helps apps manage costs. A base case that supports stablecoin flows and integrations with existing stablecoins is valued at 0.33 and projects to 0.42-0.55 for the next year. A strong bullish trend over several years supporting enterprise relationships and volume growth, points to $3-$5. This support is likely to be between $0.24 and $0.27 if flows migrate to other cheap chains or if regulation stifles stablecoin activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE – the Newest WildCard in the Fifth Slot In fact, early adopters are taking positions even before a rally resulting from significant exposure to exchange. That’s the main argument for using MAGACOIN FINANCE as the fifth, speculative component of a portfolio that doesn’t cost more than $5 . Staged allocations, tightening supply dynamics, upcoming access catalysts to drive liquidity are emphasized in community materials For the upside scenario to play out, key factors such as increasing the buyer base, making community growth visible, and providing valuable holder utility that turns attention into on-chain activity, are all required. The negative case is efficient post-listing volumes and milestone lags. How the Pieces Work Together Functionally, this cross-chain basket provides exposure to four distinct demand engines: institutional and retail money market (XRP), consumer applications with low latency (SUI), security-centric base layer with institutional-grade design (ADA) and high-volume stablecoin settlement (TRON). If roadmap execution translates into liquidity and usage, the fifth slot’s calculated asymmetry (represented here by the up-and-coming name MAGACOIN FINANCE) could change portfolio math. They come together around real utility that can scale uncorrupted by the noise of market volatility, and scenario ranges are tied to adoption milestones rather than news headlines. Conclusion Value isn’t just created by price alone, but under-$5 entries when combined with actual usage can compound into 2026-2027 and beyond. Each asset has a distinct role, from TRON’s stablecoin scaling to ADA’s governance-driven reliability, from XRP’s corridor development to SUI’s consumer applications. Good sized position in MAGACOIN FINANCE adds early upside potential to listings and access milestones. With the current prices of around $2.80 (XRP), $3.20 (SUI), $0.82 (ADA), $0.33 (TRON), we have clear, quantifiable, multi-year growth trajectories that are based on adoption and not hype, although none of these scenarios are guaranteed.

In a video analysis released today, the analyst argues that structural signals across major charts—supported by improving macro conditions—tilt the risk-reward toward a decisive upside move, provided US inflation data doesn’t deliver a negative surprise. The setup begins with Bitcoin grinding higher into range highs while still sitting in what he calls “a position of potential reversal,” a juncture he links to today’s US CPI print after a softer-than-expected PPI reading. “If CPI comes in weak today, I think the markets will rip,” he said, framing inflation as the swing factor that could unlock risk appetite across crypto. Cardano, Doge, XRP Ready For Lift-Off He contends the strongest signals are emerging away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. On Ethereum, liquidity “still” sits below price around $4,100, with a pocket of resting orders above, leaving open the possibility of “a quick flush… to take that” before higher levels are attacked. “How much of a drop would we need to sweep this liquidity? Six percent,” he said, adding that the base of recent transactions “looks pretty good as a support,” even if a brief downside wick cannot be ruled out. Related Reading: Tokenized Stocks Could Be Coming To NASDAQ, Will XRP Benefit From This? The case for altcoins rests largely on visible liquidity concentrations and higher-timeframe structures. Cardano (ADA), he said, exhibits a favorable imbalance with “a… load of liquidity” stacked above “around one dollar,” and additional magnets in the $1.21 and $1.40 areas if momentum expands. He emphasized the sequence of higher lows and higher highs that preceded a consolidation, a pattern he compared across several charts. Dogecoin (DOGE), in his view, mirrors the same anatomy on a larger timeframe: a prior higher-high/higher-low sequence, a tightening range, and “liquidity above us,” with a push through $0.29 opening a path to targeting $0.45. “I’ve been saying for a while tokens like DOGE look like they are going to absolutely send it,” he said. For XRP, he argued that price action has “led the cycle” and recently broke a well-tracked downtrend on the daily and four-hour charts, while shorter-term liquidity maps now show concentrations overhead. Beyond single names, he anchored his thesis in market-wide breadth gauges. He highlighted “Total 3”—the combined market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—pressing against prior highs and “knocking at the door… for price discovery.” In a closely related lens, he said “Total 2” (market cap ex-Bitcoin) is one incremental push away—“half a percent higher”—from a highest-ever weekly close, with three days left in the candle. The evolving formations, he added, can be interpreted as an “ascending wedge” that morphs into a “cup and handle” after a textbook Wyckoff-style accumulation and back-test, the kind of structural progression that often resolves with a powerful range break. The Core Thesis Rotation dynamics are at the core of his call. Drawing on an ETH-vs-BTC dominance composite, he said the tape “looks like weakness” for the pair, with heavier volume on down moves in that ratio—an indication, he believes, that capital is migrating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into the broader altcoin complex. “If [Bitcoin] dominance breaks down… it’s better for altcoins,” he said. “As long as capital’s flowing into the market, I don’t really mind which starts to outperform which… but if we have a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price and a drop in dominance, it means that altcoins are going to be absolutely sending it.” Related Reading: Solana And XRP ETFs Smash New Records In Canada At the same time, he flagged the near-term fork in the road. Markets are testing “decision” levels into macro data, and a brief liquidity sweep lower—on Bitcoin and ETH in particular—remains plausible before any sustained impulse. “We’re not in a breakout territory here yet,” he cautioned. “We’ve seen the first signs of it… [and] we could reject here and consolidate for a little bit longer… but one catalyst here and it’s green season in my opinion for crypto generally.” Throughout the analysis, the analyst returned to a handful of price signposts traders are likely to watch: ADA gravity around $1.00 with follow-ups near $1.21 and $1.40; DOGE confirmation above ~$0.29 and then $0.45 as the next objective; and XRP’s break of descending resistance with liquidity pools sitting overhead on intraday maps. If the macro side cooperates, his base case is unambiguous. “I think the breakout is imminent,” he said, pointing to synchronized strength across Total 2 and Total 3, gold’s recent breakout, and equities at or near all-time highs. “This is the sort of time where we’re going to break out,” he added. “Massive breakouts” in altcoins, when they come, often unfold as “a few weeks or a few days of massively green candles.” Even so, he closed with a reminder that timing remains hostage to catalysts. “It’s decision time for the market,” he said. “Could reject here and consolidate… but one catalyst here and it’s green season.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.99.

Solana SOL , often celebrated for its high-speed transactions and innovative technology, has officially ascended to a new height. This impressive climb sees Solana (SOL) overtake BNB to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a development that has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This moment truly highlights the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape. What’s Fueling Solana SOL’s Incredible Momentum? According to recent data from CoinMarketCap, Solana SOL ‘s market capitalization reached an impressive $126.3 billion. This figure comfortably surpassed BNB’s $125.9 billion, marking a pivotal moment in the crypto rankings. Several key factors contribute to this rapid expansion and the growing confidence in Solana’s platform. Its robust technological foundation and thriving ecosystem play a crucial role. Here are some of the primary drivers behind Solana SOL ‘s ascent: High Throughput: Solana boasts an incredibly fast transaction processing capability, often handling thousands of transactions per second. This speed makes it highly attractive for various decentralized applications (dApps). Low Transaction Costs: Compared to some older blockchain networks, Solana offers significantly lower transaction fees. This affordability enhances user experience and encourages broader adoption. Developer Activity: The Solana ecosystem continues to attract a vibrant community of developers building innovative projects across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. This consistent innovation adds immense value to the network. How Does Solana SOL Compare to BNB? The competition between major cryptocurrencies is always intense. While Solana SOL and BNB both represent significant blockchain ecosystems, they cater to slightly different niches and face unique challenges. BNB, the native token of the Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain), has long been a powerhouse, primarily benefiting from its close ties to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. However, Solana’s recent performance indicates a shift in market sentiment and preference. Here’s a brief comparison: Core Utility: BNB is integral to the Binance ecosystem, used for trading fee discounts, participation in token sales, and powering the BNB Chain. Solana SOL , on the other hand, is the fuel for the Solana blockchain, enabling transaction fees, staking, and governance across its vast dApp landscape. Technological Approach: Solana utilizes a unique consensus mechanism, including Proof of History (PoH) alongside Proof of Stake (PoS), to achieve its high speeds. BNB Chain relies on a variant of PoS called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). Market Perception: Solana is often seen as a leading ‘Ethereum killer’ due to its scalability solutions, while BNB Chain offers a more centralized, yet highly efficient, alternative for dApp deployment. What Lies Ahead for Solana SOL? The journey for Solana SOL is far from over. This milestone of surpassing BNB signals strong market confidence, but the path ahead involves both immense opportunities and potential hurdles. Continued innovation and addressing technical challenges will be crucial for sustained growth. The focus remains on expanding its user base and solidifying its position among the top digital assets. Consider these aspects regarding Solana SOL ‘s future: Ecosystem Expansion: Expect more groundbreaking projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 gaming to choose Solana. This growth will further enhance the network’s utility and demand for SOL. Scalability & Stability: While known for speed, Solana has faced past network outages. Addressing these stability concerns decisively will be vital for long-term trust and enterprise adoption. Competitive Landscape: The blockchain space is highly competitive. Solana will need to continue innovating to maintain its edge against other high-performance blockchains. For those interested in the future of Solana SOL , staying informed about network upgrades, developer conferences, and new project launches is key. The recent achievement of Solana SOL in overtaking BNB is a testament to its robust technology, active community, and growing ecosystem.

On September 11, 2025, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF recorded a remarkable $74.5 million daily inflow, while Fidelity’s U.S. Ethereum ETF attracted another $49.5 million, according to data from Farside Investors. In total, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have seen more than $171 million in net inflows this week, reflecting robust demand from institutional investors. The surge in flows underscores growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value, even as regulators remain cautious on staking provisions. Analysts suggest these inflows could act as a catalyst for higher ETH prices, reinforcing Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and AI-powered blockchain applications. Ethereum Eyes $4,500 Breakout Currently, Ethereum is trading near $4,400, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $529 billion. Despite positive inflow momentum, ETH remains locked in a tight trading range. Analysts highlight two key levels: Resistance at $4,500: A breakout above this level could trigger renewed buying interest and open the door for a sustained uptrend. Support at $4,250: A drop below this threshold could lead to increased selling pressure. Technical indicators remain mixed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near neutral at 52, while the MACD shows waning bearish momentum, hinting that buyer activity may soon pick up. BitMine and Market Correlations Strengthen the Case Adding to the bullish narrative, blockchain firm BitMine expanded its Ethereum treasury this week, acquiring 46,255 ETH worth $201 million from BitGo. This latest move brings BitMine’s total holdings to over 2.1 million ETH, valued at more than $9.2 billion, cementing its position as the largest public ETH holder. Beyond crypto, Ethereum’s price movements continue to show strong correlations with tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq. Analysts believe institutional inflows combined with corporate treasuries betting big on ETH could tighten supply and set the stage for a breakout. For traders, the focus now turns to whether Ethereum can decisively clear $4,500, a move that could ignite one of the strongest rallies of 2025. Until then, ETH’s price is likely to remain in consolidation as bulls and bears battle for control.

Over the past 24 hours, a significant trend emerged: short positions bore the brunt of these liquidations across major digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This dominance by short liquidations offers crucial insights into current market dynamics and the powerful forces at play. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Simply put, crypto futures liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the market moves against their trade, and they no longer have enough margin to cover potential losses. It is an automated process designed to prevent traders from losing more money than they have in their account. Liquidations are a common feature of high-leverage trading. They serve as a stark reminder of the risks involved in futures markets. For the broader market, large-scale liquidations can amplify price movements, leading to increased volatility and creating cascading effects as positions are unwound rapidly. Unpacking the Recent Crypto Futures Liquidations Data Looking at the past 24 hours, the figures for major cryptocurrencies show a clear trend in crypto futures liquidations . Short positions, those betting on a price decline, faced substantial pressure as prices moved upwards, triggering their forced closure. Here’s a breakdown: ETH: A staggering $96.38 million was liquidated, with short positions accounting for a dominant 69.14% of that total. BTC: Bitcoin saw $86.24 million in liquidations, and an even higher percentage of these, 83.97% , came from short positions. SOL: Solana experienced $35.76 million in liquidations, with short positions making up an overwhelming 86.11% . These figures highlight a powerful market shift that caught many short sellers off guard. The overwhelming majority of liquidated positions being short suggests a strong upward price movement, often referred to as a ‘short squeeze’ environment, where rising prices force short sellers to buy back, further fueling the rally. Why Did Shorts Dominate Recent Crypto Futures Liquidations ? The significant dominance of short positions in these crypto futures liquidations suggests a prevailing bullish sentiment or a sudden positive catalyst in the market. When many traders open short positions, they are betting on prices to fall. However, if an unexpected positive development occurs, or if buying pressure simply outweighs selling pressure, prices can surge quickly. This upward movement forces short positions, especially those with high leverage, to be liquidated. As these positions are closed, the system automatically buys back the underlying asset, which can create additional buying pressure. This cascading effect, often called a short squeeze, can accelerate the price rally, leading to even more short liquidations. It’s a powerful feedback loop that can rapidly change market direction. The Impact of High Crypto Futures Liquidations on Market Dynamics High volumes of crypto futures liquidations , particularly when concentrated on one side of the market, have several implications. Firstly, they increase market volatility. Sudden price spikes or drops due to mass liquidations can create an unpredictable trading environment. Secondly, they can act as a reset button for market sentiment. A large short squeeze might signal a shift from bearish to more bullish sentiment, as those betting against the market are cleared out. For individual traders, understanding these dynamics is crucial. It underscores the importance of proper risk management and not over-leveraging positions. While liquidations represent losses for some, they can also present opportunities for others who are positioned correctly or can anticipate these market movements. Navigating Volatility: Strategies Amidst Crypto Futures Liquidations Understanding the dynamics of crypto futures liquidations is crucial for any trader operating in this space. To mitigate risks and potentially capitalize on market movements, consider these strategies: Prudent Leverage: Avoid excessive leverage. While it amplifies gains, it also drastically increases liquidation risk. Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and protect your capital from sudden adverse price movements. Market Analysis: Stay informed about market sentiment, news, and technical indicators. These can provide clues about potential price reversals or accelerations. Risk Management: Allocate only a small percentage of your portfolio to highly leveraged trades. Never trade with funds you cannot afford to lose. Education is your best defense in volatile markets. Knowing how liquidations work and why they occur helps in making more informed trading decisions. The recent surge in crypto futures liquidations , particularly from short positions, serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. While the immediate effect is often increased volatility and significant losses for some traders, it also highlights the resilience and potential for rapid upward movements in major digital assets. For traders, these events underscore the critical importance of disciplined risk management and a deep understanding of market mechanics to navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of crypto futures. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto futures liquidations? A1: Crypto futures liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged futures position is automatically closed by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses as the market moves against their trade. Q2: Why do short positions often dominate crypto futures liquidations? A2: When short positions dominate crypto futures liquidations , it typically means the market price has moved significantly upwards, causing traders who bet on a price decline to be forced out of their positions. This can indicate strong buying pressure or a ‘short squeeze’. Q3: How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? A3: Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and conducting thorough market analysis before entering trades. Q4: Do liquidations affect the overall crypto market? A4: Yes, large-scale liquidations can increase market volatility and amplify price movements. They can also influence market sentiment, especially if they clear out a significant number of positions on one side of the market. Q5: What is a ‘short squeeze’ in the context of liquidations? A5: A short squeeze happens when a rising price forces short sellers to close their positions by buying back the asset. This buying activity further pushes the price up, creating a feedback loop that leads to more short liquidations and an accelerated rally.

The latest US jobs data showed just 22,000 jobs added in August, far below expectations. That weak number intensified bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut while simultaneously raising fears about the health of the broader economy. For many investors, these conditions make stock markets feel like a trap, appearing stable on the surface but fragile underneath. It is precisely why capital is flowing toward gold as a safe haven and emerging crypto plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which investors see as opportunities to escape equity volatility and capture asymmetric upside. The haven rush into gold Gold has emerged once again as the primary safe haven. The metal surged to fresh highs above $3,596 per ounce earlier this month, marking a more than 33% gain this year. Analysts at Barron’s argue the rally has room to continue, with rate-cut bets and policy turmoil fueling demand. The New York Post notes that global central banks have been buyers as well, adding to already robust retail demand. This is not simply a price story. For investors, gold is becoming a cornerstone of defensive allocation, less a speculative play and more a necessity. When policymakers struggle to balance inflation and growth, and when bonds fail to provide adequate protection, gold’s timeless role as a store of value comes into sharper focus. Crypto steps back into the spotlight But gold is not the only hedge. Digital assets are re-entering the conversation as investors rotate away from equities. Reports from Ainvest and CryptoRank confirm that institutional demand for crypto is quietly accelerating. After months of subdued flows, September is showing renewed confidence, with major coins stabilizing and altcoins beginning to attract inflows. Crypto’s appeal at this moment is twofold. First, it provides portfolio diversification. Unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies are not bound by corporate earnings cycles. Second, it offers potential upside in a world where traditional assets feel capped. Analysts highlight that while equities look tired and bonds uninspiring, crypto is one of the few markets capable of rewriting investor outcomes in short bursts. Gold and crypto as complementary hedges Although often portrayed as rivals, gold and crypto are increasingly seen as complementary. Analysts at Bitwise explain that gold performs best during equity sell-offs and currency devaluations, while Bitcoin and other tokens excel when debt stress and liquidity crises dominate headlines. Together, they form a two-pronged hedge: gold preserving capital, crypto providing asymmetric upside. This strategic pairing is why more investors are blending allocations. Gold covers the defensive side of the portfolio, while crypto provides offense. September’s volatility has only reinforced the logic of this balance. Amid the renewed attention on safe havens, one project has been standing out in conversations around speculative growth: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Unlike gold, which anchors portfolios, or Bitcoin, which increasingly attracts institutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing retail investors with its combination of cultural momentum and early-stage affordability. Currently priced at just under $1, the token allows even small investors to secure meaningful allocations. Analysts emphasize this dual quality, affordability and credibility, as the reason MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction in a crowded market. Forecasts suggest a potential of 13,000% ROI or more if demand continues to accelerate. The excitement is not purely speculative; it’s rooted in a recognition that the project bridges two crucial themes of the moment: investor appetite for asymmetric returns, and investor demand for audited, trustworthy assets. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out amid September’s market trap Built on Trust: At a time when investors crave security, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already completed HashEx and CertiK audits, signaling transparency and credibility uncommon in early-stage tokens. Affordable Entry Point: For just $0.00044, it gives retail investors access to meaningful positions without overexposure, a sharp contrast to crowded, overvalued equities. High-Upside Potential: Analysts project up to 13,000% ROI, making it one of the few tokens positioned to deliver asymmetric gains as capital rotates out of traditional markets. Cultural Momentum: Communities on Telegram and X are expanding daily, giving the project narrative strength, the same force that often drives breakout cycles. Building a resilient September portfolio For those navigating the so-called September trap, the playbook is becoming clear. Reduce exposure to overheated equities. Allocate to gold for defensive depth. Build crypto positions for diversification and growth. And, for those willing to take calculated risks, include small but strategic allocations to emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This balance allows investors to protect against downside while maintaining exposure to assets that can truly move the needle. In a month where risks loom large, that kind of dual positioning may prove essential. Conclusion September once again reminds investors that stock markets can be deceptive, steady in appearance but prone to sudden weakness. In response, gold has surged as the ultimate safe haven, and crypto is regaining its role as the high-upside alternative. Yet for those seeking more than stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something different: the possibility of 13,000% ROI, backed by audits and community energy. For investors wary of stock market traps but unwilling to sit still, the strategy is clear. Hold gold for defense, add crypto for growth, and keep an eye on projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that blend trust with explosive potential.

The token advanced nearly 2% to close near $3.05, defending support at $2.98 before testing resistance around $3.07. Analysts say that while accumulation patterns remain strong, elevated exchange reserves and ETF speculation are adding layers of volatility to the next directional move. News Background • Ripple strengthened its partnership with Spanish banking giant BBVA to deliver digital asset custody solutions under the EU’s MiCA framework, bolstering institutional legitimacy. • Broader crypto markets tracked macro catalysts, including expectations of rate decisions from global central banks and shifting trade policy debates. • Futures open interest in XRP climbed to $8.36 billion, reflecting leveraged positioning ahead of potential ETF-related announcements. • Whale wallets accumulated 340M XRP tokens in recent weeks, while exchange inventories reached one-year highs, raising questions of near-term distribution pressure. Price Action Summary • XRP climbed from $2.98 to $3.05 during the September 11 trading window, marking a 1.85% gain within a $0.10 band. • The most aggressive buying occurred during the 12:00 session, where volume hit 243.37M — more than 4x the daily average of 58.9M — confirming strong institutional bids. • Resistance formed near $3.07 after multiple failed upside attempts into midnight, while profit-taking capped advances above $3.05. • The final hour saw a pullback from $3.06 to $3.04 (-0.68%) as distribution pressure increased, with 2.29M units traded at 01:41 triggering a sharp dip. • Despite the late retreat, price closed in consolidation above $3.04, suggesting continued accumulation at discounted levels. Technical Analysis • Support anchored at $2.98, validated by outsized buying volumes. • Resistance concentrated between $3.05–$3.07, where repeated rejections occurred. • Descending triangle formation tightening around the $3.00–$3.07 corridor points to imminent breakout resolution. • Final-hour volume spikes (2.29M at 01:41, 1.18M at 02:03) showed heavy distribution followed by quick recovery attempts. • RSI improvements on intraday charts suggest buying momentum is building, though exchange inflows remain a headwind. What Traders Are Watching • Whether XRP can sustain closes above $3.05 and challenge the $3.07 resistance zone — a breakout could open the path toward $3.20 in the short term. • Exchange reserves rising to 12-month highs, which traders view as a possible warning sign of distribution pressure if whale inflows stall. • The impact of Ripple’s expanded BBVA partnership under MiCA, which may accelerate institutional custody adoption and support price stability. • Positioning in derivatives markets: call options now outnumber puts 3-to-1 with strikes clustering around $3.00–$3.50, reflecting a bullish tilt ahead of September 12 expiries. • Macro signals, particularly central bank rate decisions and liquidity conditions, which continue to dictate flows into large-cap crypto assets.",Markets|XRP|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-12 03:42:33

News recently broke that the notorious Radiant Capital hacker has successfully laundered a substantial sum. This incident highlights the ongoing vulnerabilities within the crypto ecosystem. Specifically, the hacker moved a staggering 5,933 ETH, valued at approximately $26.7 million, through the privacy mixer Tornado Cash. This move, reported by EmberCN, is a critical development following the initial exploit. How Did the Radiant Capital Hacker Execute the Laundering? The laundering process involved using Tornado Cash, a decentralized protocol designed to obscure the origins of cryptocurrency transactions.

The hacker has systematically moved funds to evade detection, posing a significant challenge for tracing efforts. What Are the Implications for DeFi Security and Trust? This latest move by the Radiant Capital hacker sends a stark reminder about the persistent security risks in the DeFi space. When such large sums are stolen and laundered, it inevitably erodes user trust in decentralized protocols. The incident raises several crucial questions: How can DeFi protocols enhance their security measures to prevent future exploits? What role do privacy mixers like Tornado Cash play in enabling illicit activities? How can the crypto community work together to combat such sophisticated attacks? Furthermore, the ability of the Radiant Capital hacker to move such a significant amount underscores the need for continuous vigilance and improved auditing practices within the DeFi ecosystem. Protocols must prioritize robust security frameworks. Addressing the Broader Challenge of Crypto Exploits The Radiant Capital exploit is not unique; the crypto industry has witnessed numerous hacks and thefts. Each incident, however, provides valuable lessons. Projects must invest heavily in security audits, bug bounty programs, and real-time monitoring to detect and respond to threats swiftly.

In conclusion, the successful laundering of $26.7 million by the Radiant Capital hacker through Tornado Cash is a significant blow to the project and the broader DeFi community.

This initiative aligns with a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space, where various organizations and traditional finance firms are experimenting with crypto treasury models to strengthen their financial stability and operational capabilities. Avalanche Foundation To Offer Discounted AVAX Tokens According to the Financial Times, the Avalanche Foundation is in advanced talks to create two crypto treasuries in the United States. These moves come at a time when the foundation is gaining traction among institutional investors, with firms like BlackRock and Visa already utilizing the Avalanche blockchain for their operations. The foundation’s strategy involves launching one digital asset treasury company while converting an existing firm into a treasury vehicle. The goal is to secure approximately $1 billion, with the expectation to finalize these deals within weeks. The funds raised are earmarked for the acquisition of millions of AVAX tokens , which will be offered at a discounted price directly from the Avalanche Foundation. This approach is aimed to not only support the foundation’s growth but also to enhance the liquidity and market presence of AVAX amid an increasingly competitive treasury companies landscape. AVAX Price Approaches $30 Per the report, the first fundraising deal aims to secure up to $500 million through a private investment led by Hivemind Capital, with expectations to finalize the agreement by the end of the month. Notably, Anthony Scaramucci, a crypto investor and former White House press secretary, is advising on this initiative. The second funding endeavor involves a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) sponsored by Dragonfly Capital, which is also targeting a $500 million raise. This deal may take longer to conclude, potentially stretching into October. Both initiatives will focus on purchasing discounted AVAX tokens held by the Avalanche Foundation, which has a total supply of 720 million tokens, with approximately 420 million currently circulating. The broader cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in fundraising activities this year. Companies have raised over $16 billion to stockpile crypto assets, often inspired by the successful Bitcoin (BTC) treasury model of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Tokens associated with other blockchains, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), have also seen significant price increases. These tokens were selected by major publicly traded companies in the US for their respective crypto-focused treasuries. Although AVAX has not experienced the same upward momentum, CoinGecko data shows that it has recorded gains of up to 17% in the weekly time frame. As of this writing, the AVAX price is approaching the key $30 mark, a level not seen since February of this year.

CME Futures Data Shows Record Institutional Demand",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-6800-year-cme-futures-data-institutional/,"As Ethereum (ETH) trades in the mid $4,000 range, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures open interest (OI) for the digital asset continues to hit new highs. Against that backdrop, analysts are now predicting a new all-time high (ATH) for ETH later this year. Ethereum New ATH By End Of 2025? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, Ethereum’s CME futures OI is steadily moving towards new highs. The analyst brought attention to past data about Ethereum futures OI to predict its next move. Related Reading: Ethereum Marches Upward Without Leverage Overheating – Sign Of Structural Health? Back in 2021-2022, Ethereum futures OI remained relatively low, largely dominated by 1-2 month contracts. At the time, although ETH gained bullish momentum, institutional exposure to the cryptocurrency on CME was still limited. In sharp contrast, during the 2022 bear market, a drop in the ETH price led to a steep decline in its OI. While the period was still dominated by short-term contracts, long-term contracts stayed low, indicating weak institutional confidence in ETH. However, a trend change was observed during the 2023-2024 recovery as Ethereum OI started to rise again – specifically among 3-6 month contracts. Simultaneously, institutional demand grew alongside ETH’s price. Fast-forward to 2025, Ethereum OI has surged to new highs. As ETH rallied to the $4,500 to $5,000 range, there was a noticeable growth in short-term contracts. This dynamic indicates strong institutional participation and demand for derivatives. The CryptoQuant analyst explained the implications of two potential combinations of OI and contract concentration. First, high OI with concentrated short-term contracts can lead to increased volatility, potentially leading to sharp swings and liquidation cascades. On the contrary, rising long-term OI in 3-6 month contracts indicates growing institutional confidence and potential for higher ETH prices in the long-term. That said, crowded leveraged positions could trigger rapid corrections in the short term. PelinayPA added: ETH is trading around $5K (near ATH) with record OI on CME clear evidence of institutional FOMO. While this supports the ongoing bull trend, liquidation risk is high. Short term volatility and corrections are likely, but the medium to long term outlook remains bullish. Concluding, the analyst predicted that ETH could reach the $6,800 resistance level by the end of 2025. However, any deterioration in the global macroeconomic outlook could stall ETH’s momentum temporarily. Case For A New ETH ATH Besides the aforementioned prediction on the back of rising institutional interest in ETH, positive exchange data is also likely to benefit the cryptocurrency. For example, recent ETH outflows from Binance drove the supply ratio to a new low.

The New York-based firm, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, priced 15.2m shares at $28 each, above its earlier guidance of $24 to $26, Bloomberg reported . The final pricing reflected robust investor demand even after Gemini lifted its proposed range from $17 to $19 last week. Gemini IPO Capped At $425M Despite Heavier Demand Bankers halted new orders ahead of pricing after the book filled at speed. Reuters reported that demand outpaced supply by more than twentyfold. Gemini raised $425 million in an initial public offering, pricing its stock above a marketed range and shrinking the number of shares, according to a person familiar with the matter https://t.co/dAfdvXCuwW — Bloomberg (@business) September 11, 2025 In a rare move, Gemini and its underwriters capped proceeds at $425m, even though the sale could have raised up to $433m without the limit. Nasdaq committed to purchase 50m dollars worth of stock in a private placement at the IPO price. The deal also set aside as much as 10% of shares for long-standing users, employees and close associates, and up to 30% for retail investors on platforms such as Robinhood, SoFi and Webull. The offering gives Gemini a market value of just over $3b dollars at the top of its pricing range. The company, incorporated as Gemini Space Station Inc. for the listing, is expected to begin trading on Friday under the symbol GEMI. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup led the offering as joint bookrunners. Winklevoss Twins Retain 94.5% Voting Power The decision to cap proceeds meant any further price increase reduced the number of shares sold rather than expanding the total size of the IPO. Such structuring is rare but reflects the twin goals of maximizing pricing while maintaining control of the company’s equity base. The Winklevoss brothers, who founded Gemini in 2014 as a regulated US crypto exchange, owned nearly the entire company before the sale. Filings show they will retain about 94.5% of voting power after the IPO, ensuring tight control even as the company becomes publicly traded. The listing comes at a delicate moment for digital asset companies, which have seen valuations recover alongside Bitcoin’s climb above $115,000 this week. Investors appear willing to pay up for established exchanges, betting on growth in spot trading, custody services and exchange-traded products tied to digital assets. Gemini Keeps Use Of Funds Broad And Undisclosed The IPO’s success also points to rising appetite for equity in crypto infrastructure, even as regulators in the US step up scrutiny of trading venues. By raising public capital, Gemini joins Coinbase and Robinhood in offering investors exposure to crypto markets without directly holding tokens. Proceeds from the offering are expected to go toward technology expansion and strengthening compliance functions, though the company has not disclosed a detailed breakdown. For now, the twin founders can claim a successful debut. After years of building Gemini against competition from Coinbase, Binance.US and Kraken, they now lead one of the most oversubscribed US listings of 2025.

The current dynamic in global financial markets, where Asia FX is firming up despite persistent inflation, offers a fascinating case study. This seemingly paradoxical situation, driven by expectations of US interest rate cuts and a weakening US dollar, creates ripple effects that even crypto investors should monitor closely. How do these traditional market movements influence the digital asset landscape, and what does it signal for future liquidity and investor sentiment? Why is Asia FX Showing Remarkable Resilience? The resilience of Asia FX against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty is a key theme. Recent market movements show a consistent strengthening of several Asian currencies. This trend is not accidental; it is a confluence of factors that position the region favorably. Investors are increasingly looking towards Asia for growth opportunities, driven by robust economic fundamentals in various countries and a more stable political environment compared to some Western counterparts. The demand for Asian goods and services remains strong, contributing to healthy trade balances and capital inflows. Furthermore, central banks in Asia have largely maintained prudent monetary policies, which adds to the appeal of their respective currencies. This careful management helps to insulate these economies from some of the more extreme volatilities seen elsewhere. Several factors contribute to this resilience: Strong Economic Fundamentals: Many Asian economies exhibit healthy growth rates, manageable debt levels, and significant foreign exchange reserves. Export Performance: A robust global demand for Asian exports contributes to current account surpluses, bolstering currency strength. Capital Inflows: Attracted by growth prospects and relatively higher yields, foreign capital continues to flow into Asian markets. Monetary Policy Autonomy: Asian central banks have room to maneuver their policies, often less constrained by immediate global pressures than their Western counterparts. This collective strength in Asia FX signals a broader shift in global economic power and investment focus, making it a critical area for observation. What’s Fueling the Persistent US Rate Cut Bets? Despite inflation remaining somewhat elevated, market participants are steadfast in their conviction about impending US rate cut bets . This anticipation is the primary driver of the current market sentiment. The Federal Reserve has signaled a data-dependent approach, and while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has shown some stickiness, other economic indicators suggest a cooling economy. For instance, a slowdown in manufacturing activity and a gradual easing in the labor market are interpreted by many as precursors to the Fed adopting a more dovish stance. Investors are pricing in multiple rate cuts over the coming year, moving away from the aggressive tightening cycle seen previously. This shift in expectation is largely based on the belief that the Fed will prioritize avoiding a severe economic downturn, even if it means tolerating inflation slightly above its target for a period. The market’s forward-looking nature means that these expectations are already influencing currency valuations and capital flows, well before any actual policy changes are announced. Key drivers behind these persistent bets include: Decelerating Economic Growth: Signs of a slowdown in various sectors, suggesting the cumulative effect of past rate hikes is taking hold. Labor Market Cooling: While still robust, the pace of job creation is moderating, and wage growth shows signs of easing. Forward Guidance from the Fed: Although cautious, the Fed’s communication has opened the door to future rate reductions, shifting market sentiment. Inflation Expectations: While current CPI is sticky, long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, giving the Fed some flexibility. The market’s conviction in US rate cut bets is a powerful force, reshaping the global financial landscape and influencing investment decisions across asset classes. Why Does Dollar Weakness Continue to Persist? The concept of dollar weakness is intrinsically linked to the narrative of impending US interest rate cuts. When a central bank is expected to lower interest rates, the currency of that nation typically depreciates. This is because lower rates make the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield. The interest rate differential between the US and other major economies narrows, reducing the incentive to hold dollar-denominated assets. Furthermore, a weaker dollar can be seen as a policy tool to support exports and stimulate economic growth, making US goods more competitive internationally. The recent trend of the US Dollar Index (DXY) reflects this sentiment, showing a consistent downtrend. This decline is not just a reaction to future rate cuts but also a reflection of improved global risk appetite. As the perceived risk of a global recession diminishes, investors are more willing to allocate capital to higher-yielding or growth-oriented assets outside the US, further contributing to the dollar’s depreciation. This ongoing dollar weakness has significant implications for international trade, commodity prices, and the competitiveness of various national economies. Factors contributing to the dollar’s decline: Interest Rate Differentials: Anticipation of lower US rates reduces the yield advantage of dollar assets. Improved Global Risk Sentiment: As global economic outlook improves, demand for safe-haven assets like the dollar decreases. Trade Dynamics: A weaker dollar can make US exports more competitive, potentially boosting trade balances. Fiscal Health Concerns: Long-term concerns about US national debt and fiscal deficits can also exert downward pressure on the currency. Understanding the drivers of dollar weakness is crucial for anyone involved in international finance, including those monitoring the crypto market, as it impacts global liquidity and investment flows. How Are Markets Reacting to Sticky CPI? The phenomenon of sticky CPI , or persistently high consumer price inflation, presents a fascinating paradox in the current market environment. Typically, sticky inflation would prompt central banks to maintain or even increase interest rates to cool down the economy. However, as discussed, the market is largely betting on US rate cuts. This divergence suggests that investors are looking beyond the headline inflation figures and focusing on the underlying components and future trajectory of prices. While some categories, like services inflation, remain elevated, there’s an expectation that goods inflation will continue to moderate, and overall inflationary pressures will eventually subside. Furthermore, the market might be interpreting the “stickiness” as temporary, a result of supply-side constraints or specific sector dynamics rather than broad-based demand-driven inflation. The Federal Reserve itself has acknowledged that the path to 2% inflation might be bumpy. This nuanced interpretation allows for the continuation of US rate cut bets despite the immediate inflation data. For market participants, it’s a delicate balancing act of assessing current data against future policy intentions, and the consensus seems to be that the Fed will eventually pivot, even if inflation takes its time to fully normalize. Understanding the nuances of sticky CPI : Services Inflation: Often more persistent due to wage growth and demand, compared to goods inflation. Housing Costs: A significant component of CPI, housing inflation tends to lag and can keep overall figures elevated for longer. Market Interpretation: Investors might view current stickiness as transient, focusing on disinflationary trends in other sectors. Fed’s Patience: The central bank might be willing to tolerate slightly higher inflation for longer to avoid a recession. The market’s ability to look past sticky CPI underscores a deeper belief in the eventual disinflationary path and the Fed’s willingness to ease monetary policy. What Do These Currency Trends Mean for Your Portfolio? The evolving currency trends have profound implications for investors across various asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. For traditional investors, a stronger Asia FX and a weaker dollar can impact returns on international investments. US-based investors holding foreign assets may see enhanced returns when converting back to a depreciated dollar. Conversely, a weaker dollar makes imports more expensive for US consumers but boosts the competitiveness of US exports. For the crypto market, these macro trends are equally significant. A weaker dollar often correlates with increased liquidity in global markets, which can flow into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. When traditional investment avenues offer lower returns due to declining interest rates, investors may seek higher yields and growth opportunities in digital assets. Furthermore, a stronger Asia could mean increased institutional and retail adoption of cryptocurrencies in the region, driving demand. Monitoring these currency trends provides valuable insights into the broader economic landscape and helps anticipate shifts in investor sentiment and capital allocation. Implications for investors: Diversification Opportunities: Stronger Asian currencies can offer diversification benefits for global portfolios. Commodity Prices: A weaker dollar typically supports higher commodity prices, which can impact inflation and global trade. Crypto Market Liquidity: Increased global liquidity from a weaker dollar often spills over into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Investment Strategies: Investors may reallocate capital to regions or assets offering better risk-adjusted returns in this environment. Staying informed about these overarching currency trends is essential for making informed investment decisions and navigating the complexities of the global financial system. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Climate Understanding these intricate market dynamics allows for more informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve and Asian central banks. Their forward guidance is a key indicator of future policy. Diversify Geographically: Consider increasing exposure to Asian markets, either directly through equities or indirectly via funds that invest in the region. The strengthening Asia FX can provide an additional boost to returns. Assess Dollar Exposure: For those with significant dollar-denominated assets, consider hedging strategies or diversifying into other strong currencies to mitigate potential losses from continued dollar weakness . Watch Inflation Data Closely: While sticky CPI hasn’t deterred US rate cut bets yet, a significant re-acceleration of inflation could quickly reverse market sentiment. Monitor both headline and core inflation figures. Evaluate Risk Assets: A weaker dollar and lower interest rates generally create a more favorable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, always conduct thorough due diligence and manage risk effectively. Potential Challenges and Risks Ahead While the outlook for Asia FX appears positive, and US rate cut bets are firm, several risks could alter this trajectory: Persistent Inflation: If sticky CPI proves more enduring than anticipated, the Federal Reserve might be forced to delay or even reverse its dovish pivot, leading to a stronger dollar and potentially unsettling global markets. Geopolitical Tensions: Escalating geopolitical conflicts could trigger a flight to safety, benefiting the US dollar as a traditional safe-haven asset, despite other underlying weaknesses. Unexpected Economic Shocks: A sudden global economic downturn or a severe recession in a major economy could disrupt current currency trends and lead to renewed market volatility. Policy Missteps: Errors in monetary or fiscal policy by major economies could undermine market confidence and create unpredictable outcomes. Real-World Examples of Asia FX Performance To illustrate the points above, let’s look at a few examples of Asian currencies: Japanese Yen (JPY): Despite Japan’s unique monetary policy, the Yen often reacts to broader dollar movements. While the Bank of Japan maintains ultra-loose policy, a weaker dollar can provide some relief to the heavily depreciated Yen, as traders anticipate narrowing rate differentials in the future. Chinese Yuan (CNY): China’s currency is heavily managed, but the underlying economic strength and trade surplus contribute to its stability. A weakening dollar makes the Yuan relatively stronger against the US currency, impacting trade balances and capital flows between the two economic giants. Korean Won (KRW): South Korea, a major exporter, benefits from a robust global economy and demand for its technology products. The Won tends to strengthen when global risk sentiment improves and the dollar weakens, reflecting healthy capital inflows. Indian Rupee (INR): India’s strong domestic growth and significant foreign investment inflows help support the Rupee. While often influenced by crude oil prices, the broader trend of dollar weakness can provide a tailwind, making the Rupee more attractive for foreign capital. These examples highlight how individual Asian currencies, while having their unique drivers, are also significantly influenced by the overarching global themes of US rate cut bets and dollar weakness . A Compelling Summary: Navigating a Shifting Financial Landscape The current financial landscape is defined by a fascinating interplay of forces: resilient Asia FX , persistent US rate cut bets , a discernible trend of dollar weakness , and the puzzling presence of sticky CPI . This intricate web of factors is reshaping global currency trends and influencing investment decisions across the board, from traditional markets to the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. While inflation remains a concern, the market’s conviction in a future dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve is a powerful driver, leading to a weaker dollar and bolstering Asian currencies. This environment presents both opportunities and risks, demanding a nuanced understanding of macroeconomic indicators and central bank intentions. Staying agile, diversified, and informed will be key to navigating these evolving dynamics successfully and capitalizing on the shifts in global capital flows.

Despite these concerns, crypto market participants remain optimistic, focusing instead on anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts and signals from traditional markets as drivers for higher crypto valuations. ""The underlying driver of this market cycle is a monetary tailwind, and that remains intact, despite the risk of stagflation. Bitcoin, and crypto more broadly, are absorbing capital as a hedge against fiat dilution and long-term fiscal instability. They aren’t functioning solely as a bet on risk, like we’ve seen in past cycles,"" Shane Molidor, founder of Forgd, a crypto advisory platform, told CoinDesk. Data released Thursday showed that consumer prices rose 0.4% month-on-month in August, driving the annualized inflation rate to 2.9% — the highest since January. That was up from 2.7% in July. Meanwhile, first-time applications for unemployment benefits surged last week to their highest level in four years. Early this week, the BLS announced a record downward revision to jobs created during the year ended March 2025. Despite the supposed stagflationary data, the S&P 500 surged to new all-time highs, while the dollar index fell by 0.5% to 97.50, as traders focused on anticipated Fed rate cuts and looked beyond inflation worries. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, briefly topped $116,000, building on its recent bullish technical breakout. As of the time of writing, BTC was trading at $115,244. Altcoins such as Solans's SOL (SOL), LINK (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE) posted bigger gains on a 24-hour basis. Traders widely expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points to 4% on Sept. 17, with additional reductions anticipated through the end of the year. This outlook remains largely unchanged despite Thursday’s disappointing economic data, signaling continued confidence that the Fed will prioritize supporting the labor market, looking past concerns of sticky inflation. Le Shi, managing director of crypto market maker Auros, made an interesting observation that the Magnificent 7 coins – large-cap technology stocks known for their market dominance and strong growth potential – appear relatively insulated from stagflation fears. The continued strength in the so-called Mag 7 coins, which have planned billions in capital expenditures and research and development (R&D) expenditures on AI, could grease the crypto bull sentiment. ""On stagflation being a looming threat to the current bull run, the Mag 7 and the S&P 493 have significantly decoupled of late. As a result, the AI narrative – arguably the largest theme in this bull run so far – appears more insulated from stagflation fears because of this,"" Shi added. Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, stated that the risk-reward ratio in the cryptocurrency market remains attractive. ""Traders appear to be getting an ‘all clear’ for a rate cut next week after CPI and labor data delivered no shocks or negative surprises. With these releases behind us — and after yesterday’s softer-than-expected PPI print — we believe risk/reward continues to favor the upside,"" Gaer explained that in a potential stagflationary scenario, the Fed may be forced to prioritize price stability over employment and raise rates, which could lead to a temporary risk aversion or sell-off in growth and liquidity-sensitive assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. However, this would only strengthen the long-term crypto bull case. ""Over the medium to long term, however, this dynamic would strengthen the structural bull case for Bitcoin and crypto more broadly, as investors seek scarce, non-sovereign assets to hedge persistent fiat debasement,"" Gaer said, adding that the probability of a prolonged stagflationary regime is low. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said the disinflation trend is likely to resume in the coming months. ""Our inflation model and leading indicators point to falling inflation, a backdrop that gives risk assets room to run. A 25bp cut with guidance for more would calm markets, not spook them, and set the stage for a bullish finish to the year,"" Thielen told CoinDesk. Standout tokens As bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies reach new all-time highs, a select group of altcoins is poised to experience significant rallies. Notably, there is a growing consensus about solana's (SOL) price prospects. ""We have seen strong demand for SOL during the past 2 weeks. SOLBTC is trading at its highest level in seven months and pushing up against the psychological 0.002 level, with strong upward momentum continuing from early August. Rotation into SOL is naturally occurring as several SOL DATs are coming online, with over $1B raised (or being raised) into various SOL vehicles,"" Gaer explained. The other favorites among industry participants are the DeFi protocol Ethena's ENA token and its synthetic dollar, USDe, as well as decentralised exchange Hyperliquid's HYPE token. ""Younger investors aren’t interested in slow 7% annualized returns. Instead they’re turning to perpetuals markets and trading with leverage, making riskier bets with greater upside potential. Hyperliquid is built for exactly that type of user: it’s permissionless, always-on, and increasingly positioned as the go-to for high-beta plays, especially among younger investors who view volatility as a feature, not a bug,"" Molidor said explaining the bullish case for Hyperliquid's HYPE token. He pointed out the yield advantage Ethena has as the Fed cuts rates, driving down the return on traditional fixed-income instruments and dollar equivalents, such as stablecoins. Think of it like the popular yield-differential strategy in foreign exchange markets, where a country’s currency tends to strengthen when its bond yields rise relative to others, attracting capital flows due to higher returns. ""As the Fed cuts rates and short-term T-Bill yields fall, traditional stablecoins like Circle’s become less profitable and Ethena’s tokenized basis trade becomes more lucrative. It’s a rare circumstance where Ethena’s stablecoin yields go up as Fed rates come down, which could make the token particularly attractive in the next phase of the market cycle,"" he noted. Auros pointed to CRO along with SOL, BNB and HYPE as key tokens to watch out for during the next upswing in the crypto market.

While Bitcoin recently teased us by temporarily climbing above $116,000, suggesting a potential recovery, a deeper look into the market reveals a more cautious picture. For those who rely on data to navigate the volatile crypto landscape, the latest analysis of Bitcoin on-chain indicators suggests that caution might be the wisest approach right now. What Are Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Telling Us? Despite the fleeting price rally, a significant majority of Bitcoin’s fundamental on-chain metrics are flashing red. According to a report by Cointelegraph , an alarming eight out of ten key indicators within CryptoQuant’s BTC Bull Score Index have shifted into bearish territory. This crucial insight comes from CryptoQuant contributor Maartunn, who shared his analysis on X, highlighting a clear cooling of upward momentum. Understanding these signals is vital for any investor. These aren’t just speculative guesses; they represent real-time activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, providing a unique window into investor behavior and market sentiment. When these Bitcoin on-chain indicators collectively turn bearish, it suggests that underlying conditions might not support a sustained price increase. Diving Deeper: Which Indicators Are Bearish? So, which specific metrics are signaling this downturn? The list is comprehensive, touching upon various aspects of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of the eight indicators currently pointing to bearish conditions: MVRV-Z Score: This indicator assesses whether Bitcoin is over or undervalued relative to its “fair value.” A bearish signal here often suggests the market might be overheated. Profit and Loss Index: This looks at the aggregate profit or loss of all coins currently on the blockchain. Bearish readings imply more investors are holding onto losses or realizing them. Bull-Bear Cycle Indicator: Designed to identify market cycle phases, a bearish signal here suggests we are moving away from bullish expansion. Exchange Inflow/Outflow Index: This tracks the movement of BTC to and from exchanges. Increased inflows often suggest selling pressure, while outflows indicate accumulation. Bearish implies more selling. Network Activity: A decline in active addresses or transaction counts can signal reduced interest or utility, a bearish sign for network health. Stablecoin Liquidity: This measures the amount of stablecoins available to buy Bitcoin. Lower liquidity can mean less buying power entering the market. Investor On-Chain Profit Margins: This gauges the average profit margin of investors. Bearish signals suggest diminishing returns for holders. Trader Realized Price: This is the average price at which traders acquired their coins. When the market price falls below this, it often signals capitulation. These collective signals provide a robust, data-driven perspective on the current state of Bitcoin on-chain indicators , urging caution despite any temporary price pumps. Have We Seen This Before? The Echoes of April If this situation feels familiar, you’re not alone. Cointelegraph highlighted a striking parallel: a very similar scenario unfolded in April. Back then, eight out of ten bull indicators also shifted to bearish just before Bitcoin experienced a significant plunge, dropping to $75,000. This historical precedent adds considerable weight to the current warnings from Bitcoin on-chain indicators . It serves as a stark reminder that while price action can be enticing, the underlying fundamentals, as revealed by on-chain data, often paint a more accurate picture of future trends. For investors, this historical context is crucial. It underscores the importance of not getting swept away by short-term price movements and instead focusing on the broader, data-backed trends. While past performance is not indicative of future results, recurring patterns in on-chain data offer valuable insights into potential market shifts. Paying attention to these signals can help you make more informed decisions and potentially mitigate risks in a volatile market. Navigating the Market: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should you take away from this analysis of Bitcoin on-chain indicators ? The clear message is one of caution. While Bitcoin’s ability to briefly reclaim $116,000 might have sparked optimism, the underlying data suggests that the upward momentum is cooling. This doesn’t necessarily mean an immediate crash, but it does indicate that a sustained bullish rally might face significant headwinds. For traders, this could mean considering more conservative strategies or tightening stop-losses. For long-term investors, it might be a period to re-evaluate portfolio allocations or to hold off on new significant purchases until the on-chain signals show signs of recovery. Always remember that the crypto market is dynamic, and while these indicators provide valuable insights, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Combining on-chain analysis with other forms of market research is always recommended. Conclusion: Heeding the Warnings from On-Chain Data In summary, while Bitcoin’s recent price action offered a glimmer of hope, the comprehensive analysis of its Bitcoin on-chain indicators paints a distinctly bearish picture. With eight out of ten key metrics signaling a cooling of upward momentum, and a historical precedent from April suggesting similar warnings preceded a significant price drop, investors are urged to proceed with caution. The insights from CryptoQuant and Cointelegraph serve as a critical reminder that fundamental on-chain data often provides a more reliable compass in the unpredictable waters of the cryptocurrency market. Staying informed and understanding these complex signals can empower you to make more strategic and resilient investment decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Bitcoin on-chain indicators? Bitcoin on-chain indicators are metrics derived from publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain. They track activities like transactions, wallet movements, exchange flows, and investor behavior to provide insights into market sentiment and underlying supply/demand dynamics. 2. Why are 8 out of 10 indicators turning bearish significant? When a majority of these fundamental indicators turn bearish, it suggests a broad-based shift in market sentiment and underlying conditions. It implies that despite any temporary price rallies, the foundational elements supporting a sustained upward trend are weakening, often signaling potential downside risk. 3. How do these bearish signals compare to past market events? Cointelegraph reported a similar situation in April, where 8 of 10 bull indicators turned bearish just before Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop to $75,000. This historical parallel highlights the predictive power these Bitcoin on-chain indicators can sometimes have. 4. Does a bearish signal mean Bitcoin’s price will definitely crash? Not necessarily. Bearish Bitcoin on-chain indicators suggest increased risk and potential headwinds for price appreciation. They are powerful signals but not guarantees. The crypto market is complex, and these indicators should be used as part of a broader analysis, not as a sole determinant of future price action. 5. What should investors do when Bitcoin on-chain indicators are bearish? Investors might consider exercising caution, re-evaluating their risk exposure, or adopting more conservative trading strategies. It could be a time to tighten stop-losses, hold off on new purchases, or prepare for potential volatility. Always combine on-chain data with other market analysis.

Some X analysts compare ETH’s cycle to BTC’s 2020–2021 rally, projecting targets between $8,000 and $10,000 in the coming months. Meanwhile, exchange reserves hit a nine-year low of approximately 17.1 million tokens, signaling reduced sell pressure. The Calm Before the Storm? While Ethereum (ETH) has been trading in a tight range between $4,300 and $4,500 in the past week, the technical analysis tool Bollinger Bands suggests that a major price move could be just around the corner. The metric, developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s, helps traders spot oversold or overbought conditions. When the bands squeeze, it usually indicates a period of low volatility, which could be a precursor of a significant resurgence or a considerable correction. Earlier this week, the popular X user Ali Martinez revealed that the bands have tightened, warning the crypto community to “expect a big move.” Expect a big move for Ethereum $ETH soon as the Bollinger Bands squeeze! pic.twitter.com/5KgYzuF3Vb — Ali (@ali_charts) September 10, 2025 The majority of users commenting on the post predicted that the potential swing will be to the upside. Still, a handful remain bearish, alerting of a possible drop to $3,500. Recent Price Predictions According to X user Ted, ETH is “exactly mirroring” the bull cycle of BTC in 2020-2021. That said, he expects the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency to explode to $8,000-$10,000 in the next three to four months. However, he sees potential for a short-term correction that will “liquidate high-leveraged longs before reversal and a new ATH.” Crypto General and Max Crypto outlined similar forecasts. The former believes ETH could reach $8,000 before the end of 2025. “I am all in on this trade. Millions (of) profits or homeless,” they added . The decreasing amount of ETH stored on crypto exchanges supports the bullish thesis. CryptoQuant’s data shows that recently the figure dropped to a fresh nine-year low of around 17.1 million tokens. This means investors continue to move holdings from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, thus reducing the immediate selling pressure.

This expiry event is pretty much identical to last week’s , so there is unlikely to be any impact on spot markets, which have reclaimed $4 trillion total capitalization again. US inflation data showed that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, matching forecasts that prices and inflation would pick up slightly. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.3, meaning that there are more short contracts expiring than longs, as bearish speculation increases. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has reached $2.7 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There is also around $1.8 billion OI at $120,000, but $95,000 is a popular strike price for short sellers with $1.9 billion in OI. Additionally, total Bitcoin futures OI currently stands at $86.6 billion, which has climbed back toward all-time highs, according to CoinGlass. “Despite the imminent Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, implied volatility in the options market remains relatively stable, even showing a slight decline,” observed crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live on Thursday. “The options market is pricing in relatively low future volatility, with a consensus that a 25-basis-point rate cut has already been factored in.” Despite the imminent Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, implied volatility in the options market remains relatively stable, even showing a slight decline.

Bitcoin is back in the driving seat, spiking to a three-week high of $116,300 during the Friday morning Asian trading session before retreating to $115,500 at the time of writing. Ethereum is up 3.2% on the day, hitting a two-week high of $4,530 on Friday morning. ETH has remained rangebound for the past month, holding steadily above $4,250 for most of the time.

Some analysts forecast a massive rally toward the start-of-year highs if the momentum holds. Related Reading: Solana Season Next? Bitwise CIO Eyes ‘Epic’ Q4 Run Fueled By Corporate Demand Avalanche Eyes 35%-40% Rally On Thursday, Avalanche hit a seven-month high of $29.99 after breaking out of its multi-month accumulation range and turning the $26.50 resistance into support for the first time since February. The cryptocurrency has been rallying over the past few days, currently printing five consecutive green candles in the daily timeframe. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted that AVAX had been pushing on the key resistance, holding a series of higher local lows before smashing past this area. A breakout from this resistance level could set the stage for a rally to the start-of-year range between $40-$45, the market watcher signaled in a previous analysis. Similarly, Rekt Capital highlighted that Avalanche had been “working to build a cluster of stability” since late July, which resembles the mid-2024 re-accumulation range that preceded Q4 2024’s breakout. According to the analyst, “if repeated, could open the green pathway toward the red resistance region that is increasingly confluent with the Macro Wedge top.” He explained that AVAX has been forming Higher Lows in the weekly timeframe, positioning the price slightly higher with each retest. As a result, a weekly close above the $26 area, followed by a successful post-breakout retest, would enable AVAX price to reclaim the $30 resistance region and attempt to retest the Macro Wedge Top, currently around the $35 mark. Market watcher CW pointed out that Avalanche’s next sell wall exists around the $35-$36 area, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could retest this level in the coming days if momentum continues. Meanwhile, the next major support zone sits around the $24 level, which could be revisited in case of a rejection from the key resistance. Crypto Treasuries, Partnerships Drive Momentum As the market turns green again, multiple bullish developments have also fueled AVAX’s rally. According to recent reports, the Avalanche Foundation, the nonprofit behind the project, is seeking to raise $1 billion to establish two US-based crypto treasury vehicles. One of the deals, led by Hivemind Capital and advised by SkyBridge’s founder Anthony Scaramucci, aims to raise up to $500 million in a private investment in a Nasdaq-traded company. It is expected to be completed by the end of September. The other deal, which is expected to be closed in October, seeks to raise the same amount and involves a special purpose acquisition (SPAC) vehicle sponsored by Dragonfly Capital. Notably, the funds from the two deals will reportedly be destined to purchase millions of AVAX from the Avalanche Foundation’s reserves, which could continue to fuel momentum for the cryptocurrency.

Additionally, the company behind the Avalanche Network also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement with WeBlock to push Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization and stablecoins in South Korea. As of this writing, Avalanche trades at $29.04, a 22.7% increase in the monthly timeframe.

CFTC Nominee Shares Texts With Gemini Founders On Wednesday, CFTC Chairman nominee Brian Quintenz shared private messages with Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, suggesting that the crypto exchange co-founders contacted the US President to pause his confirmation hearing back in July. In the X post, Quintenz stated, “I’ve never been inclined to release private messages. But in light of my support for the President and belief that he might have been misled, I’ve posted here the messages that include the questions Tyler Winklevoss asked me pertaining to their prior litigation with the CFTC.” The text messages, dated July 24 and 25, showed that the Gemini co-founder asked Quintenz’s opinion on the crypto exchange’s 13-page complaint letter to the CFTC’s Inspector General, Christopher Skinner, raising multiple concerns and complaints about the agency’s Division of Enforcement (DOE) conduct against the crypto exchange over the years. The letter accused the DOE staff of waging a “trophy-hunting lawfare” campaign based on “fabricated” statements and unfairly weaponizing the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) against the crypto exchange for seven years. In 2022, the CFTC sued Gemini, claiming that the exchange issued “false and misleading statements” regarding its actions to prevent market manipulation in Bitcoin (BTC) prices in 2017. However, Gemini Trust agreed to pay $5 million to the CFTC to resolve the allegations in January 2025. Trump’s chair pick committed to “having a fair and reasonable review of the matter and the division and individuals involved to determine if they acted inappropriately,” but asserted that “the implications of and solutions to this, however, should be unequivocally left to a fully confirmed chair.” According to the message thread, Winklevoss was ultimately “disappointed and surprised” with Quintenz’s response, noting that “Cultural reform, which includes rectifying what happened to us, should be the highest priority.” Crypto Feud Halts Quintenz’s Confirmation The CFTC nominee affirmed that “these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,” adding, “It’s my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the President and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the regulatory agency has been in a leadership limbo after the US Senate Agriculture Committee delayed the vote on President Trump’s nominee for CFTC chairman days before the August recess. The committee reportedly had delayed the vote following a request from the White House. According to multiple reports, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss had allegedly pressed President Trump in July to reconsider his CFTC nominee, claiming that Quintenz wouldn’t “shake up the CFTC enough” and was not “aligned with Trump’s agenda.” Anonymous sources claim that there has been regulatory chaos at the Commission “as the agency’s responsibilities, and the potential market risks, are multiplying,” Bloomberg wrote last month. With the commissioner’s shortage and Quintenz confirmation still pending, it has allegedly been difficult to carry out critical agency business. However, a White House spokesperson denied the claims that the agency was in disarray. In August, a group of crypto organizations sent a letter to the US President in support of Quintenz, emphasizing that installing a permanent chairman is “absolutely critical” to achieve the Commission’s goals. “Mr. Quintenz possesses a singular capacity to advance sound and clear regulation that will foster responsible growth and innovation,” the letter said, “He is, quite simply, the right person at the right time to lead the CFTC.” President Trump’s chair nominee asserted on X that “protecting the President and his agenda are more important than any job,” concluding that “transparency and integrity are paramount” to achieve this.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Brian Quintenz|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC acting chair|CFTC chair nominee|CFTC chairman|Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)|crypto crackdown|Crypto exchange Gemini|Gemini founders|president trump|tyler winklevoss|Winklevoss Twins,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 05:00:54

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for a move above the $920 level in the near term. BNB price started a fresh increase above the $880 and $900 levels. The price is now trading above $900 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $898 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $885 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Extends Gains BNB price formed a base above the $850 level and started a fresh increase, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a steady move above the $870 and $885 levels. The bulls even cleared the $895 resistance zone. A new all-time high was formed at $908 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $888 swing low to the $908 high. The price is now trading above $900 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $898 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $908 level. The next resistance sits near the $912 level. A clear move above the $912 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $920. A close above the $920 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $945 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $1,000 handle in the near term. Short-Term Pullback?

However, that hasn’t been the case in the past 24 hours when it comes to the third-largest digital asset by market cap. Whales sold 40 million $XRP in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/XCQTr4n6cf — Ali (@ali_charts) September 12, 2025 Data from the popular analyst reveals that whales had disposed of over $120 million worth of XRP in the span of just a day. Although this is not among the most significant and most influential sell-offs in recent months, it could still trigger a domino effect for smaller investors as well. However, Ripple’s token has defied this development. Instead of feeling the selling pressure and heading below the crucial $3 support, which it had reclaimed in the past few days, XRP went on the offensive and jumped to almost $3.10. This became its highest price level since August 26, when it was rejected at $3.12 and pushed south to under $2.85. XRP sits at $3.05 as of press time, being up by 1.5% daily and almost 9% weekly. Its market cap has grown to over $180 billion. Analysts are adamant that the next rally is around the corner, with some outlining targets of over $4 and up to $5 , which would set a new all-time high. On the much-observed ETF front, though, XRP continues to receive blows from the US regulator (the SEC), as the agency delayed making a decision on another spot Ripple fund earlier this week.

Consolidating above $4,400 could provide the necessary boost for an upside breakout, but will require a concrete breakout above the consolidation highs (around the $4,500 level). With traders now turning to next week’s FOMC decision, crypto markets await a progressing technical outlook. By Elior Manier US equities surged again after the CPI release, with all major indices - S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones - notching fresh all-time highs. The US dollar has been struggling with rate markets, which are now progressively betting off a 50 bps FOMC cut, though expectations remain fluid. Indeed, the immediate post-CPI reactions took some of that pricing back, before re-upping the odds just above 10%. Players will now expect hints from journalists such as Wall Street Journal's Timiraos, the usual suspect for pre-FOMC Fed insights. However, cryptocurrencies are lagging this risk-on rally. While Bitcoin rebounded since its past week $108,000 lows, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is still trying to regain upside momentum. The broader altcoin and crypto complex has yet to reflect the same strength seen in equities and other risk assets since the morning session. With traders now turning to next week’s FOMC decision, crypto markets await a progressing technical outlook. Let's peek at the current crypto market picture before diving into a multi-time frame Ethereum analysis. The Crypto Market picture in today's CPI session Crypto market overview, September 11, 2025 (Source: Finviz) The crypto picture is very mixed overall - watch other risk assets and market leaders (Solana in today's session) to spot how flows evolve. A multi-time frame Ethereum analysis Ethereum Daily Chart Ethereum Daily Chart, September 11, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Since our last analysis of the second-largest crypto, prices have consolidated above the 4,200-4,500 momentum pivot. Momentum has now decreased from extremely overbought levels back to right above neutral, which allows for further potential action to develop. The combination of both price and momentum consolidation provides a floor for higher volatility in the upcoming weeks. Despite the lack of momentum, if sentiment stays positive as it is, ETH-USD has formed a floor on which to bounce on. The balance to this potential outcome, however, would be a failure to rebound from here, which can lead to a lower interest in cryptos - which would be detrimental for the digital asset market. Momentum attracts momentum! Ethereum 1H Chart Ethereum 1H Chart, September 11, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Looking closer highlights how strong the ongoing range is. Buyers will have to maintain the upward trend line, as a few breakout attempts got rejected during the ongoing session. Consolidating above $4,400 could provide the necessary boost for an upside breakout, but will require a concrete breakout above the consolidation highs (around the $4,500 level). Levels of interest for ETH trading: Support Levels: Consolidation support 4,250 to 4,280 $4,200 to $4,500 consolidation zone (getting tested) $4,000 to $4,095 main long-run pivot $3,500 main support zone Resistance Levels: Consolidation resistance $4,480 to $4,500 $4,950 current new all-time highs $4,700 to $4,950 all-time high resistance zone Potential main resistance $5,230 Fibonacci extension A look back at the ETH/BTC chart ETH/BTC Daily Chart, September 11, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Crypto market depth is currently stalling, as translated by the most recent slowdown in the ETH/BTC ratio. However, with the correction currently stalling, it will be time for crypto aficionados to flex their muscles to lift crypto market sentiment. A rise in the crypto ratio is typically favorable for the market, and with ETH's most recent top, other altcoins are looking at their big brother to get started again. On the other hand, Solana is still powering through. Keep an eye on the ETH/SOL relative performance. A potential rally from here due to the ongoing consolidation may change market dynamics, therefore keep a close eye on the general crypto market sentiment. Safe Trades!

This isn’t just a futuristic dream; it’s a tangible possibility, but one that hinges on crucial financial reforms. The potential for a successful won stablecoin in South Korea is immense, promising to elevate the nation’s financial standing on the international stage. However, realizing this vision requires significant groundwork, as highlighted by a leading government think tank. Why is a Robust Offshore Market Key for Won Stablecoin Success? According to the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP), a government-affiliated research institution, the path to a thriving won stablecoin is clear: South Korea must first strengthen its foundational financial infrastructure. Yonhap Infomax reported KIEP’s findings, which emphasize that introducing offshore won trading is a fundamental prerequisite. This means allowing the Korean Won to be traded more freely outside of South Korea, increasing its international accessibility and liquidity. Increased Liquidity: Offshore trading would make the won more readily available to international participants. Global Reach: It would broaden the won’s appeal beyond domestic borders. Reduced Friction: Easing access could streamline international transactions involving the won. Without these advancements, a digital won might struggle to gain widespread adoption and maintain its value consistently in the global crypto ecosystem. The institute’s report, published on September 12, analyzed the broader implications of U.S. stablecoin legislation, underscoring the global trend towards robust regulatory and market frameworks. The Crucial Role of a Short-Term Bond Market for Won Stablecoin Stability Beyond offshore trading, KIEP also points to the necessity of a robust market for short-term government bonds. Why is this so vital for a won stablecoin ? Stablecoins are typically pegged to a reserve asset, and often, these reserves include highly liquid, low-risk instruments like short-term government bonds. A strong, liquid market for these bonds provides the necessary backing for a stablecoin, ensuring its peg remains strong and reliable. Think of it this way: if a stablecoin needs to redeem a large number of tokens quickly, its reserves must be easily convertible into the underlying fiat currency. A deep and active short-term bond market facilitates this, offering a stable and accessible pool of assets to back the digital won. Therefore, improving this market is not just about traditional finance; it’s a direct enabler for the future of digital currency in South Korea. Beyond Infrastructure: The Imperative of Digital Asset Regulations While market infrastructure is paramount, KIEP also stressed the need for clear digital asset regulations. These two pillars—market reform and regulatory clarity—are not mutually exclusive; instead, they are interdependent. Strong regulations provide a legal framework for stablecoin operations, protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. This clarity builds trust, which is essential for any financial instrument, especially a new digital one like a won stablecoin . A well-defined regulatory landscape would: Foster innovation responsibly. Mitigate risks for users and the broader financial system. Attract institutional participation and investment. Ultimately, the international competitiveness of the South Korean won itself is at stake. By taking these comprehensive steps, the nation can strengthen its overall financial standing and ensure its digital currency initiatives are built on a solid foundation. What are the Benefits of a Globally Competitive Won Stablecoin? A successful won stablecoin , backed by these reforms, promises significant benefits for South Korea. It could enhance the won’s global profile, making it a more attractive currency for international trade and investment in the digital age. This move would position South Korea as a leader in financial innovation, potentially attracting more foreign capital and fostering new economic opportunities. The institute’s analysis serves as a strategic roadmap, outlining the essential reforms needed to navigate the evolving global financial landscape. It’s a call to action for policymakers to prioritize these foundational changes to unlock the full potential of digital currencies and secure South Korea’s future financial prowess. The journey towards a successful won-denominated stablecoin is complex, requiring a coordinated effort across policy, infrastructure, and regulation. However, the potential rewards—enhanced international competitiveness and a modern, resilient financial system—make these efforts undeniably worthwhile. South Korea stands at a pivotal moment, with the opportunity to redefine its role in the global digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a won stablecoin? A won stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won. It aims to combine the benefits of blockchain technology with the stability of a fiat currency. Q2: Who is KIEP and what is their role? KIEP stands for the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. It is a government-funded think tank that conducts research and provides policy recommendations on international economic issues, including financial markets and digital assets. Q3: Why are offshore FX and bond markets important for a won stablecoin? Offshore FX (foreign exchange) markets increase the won’s global accessibility and liquidity, while a robust short-term bond market provides stable and liquid assets to back the stablecoin’s value, ensuring its peg and redeemability. Q4: What are the main benefits for South Korea if a won stablecoin succeeds? A successful won stablecoin could significantly boost the international competitiveness of the Korean Won, position South Korea as a leader in financial innovation, and attract more global investment and trade. Q5: Are these reforms only about stablecoins? No, while crucial for stablecoins, these reforms (offshore FX, bond market improvements, and digital asset regulations) also generally strengthen South Korea’s overall financial market infrastructure and international competitiveness.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-warns-xrp-holders-our-time-is-running-out-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst CryptoSensei recently posted a video alongside a tweet that read, “ OUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT!!!” In the video, he outlined the distinction between two forms of central bank digital currency. According to the explanation, the wholesale version is intended for use between central banks, while the retail version would be designed for individuals and businesses to use in everyday transactions. The retail version, as CryptoSensei noted, would apply to the general public, such as a potential digital dollar. OUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT!!! #CBDC #XRP #RIPPLE pic.twitter.com/5OckIhmjSA — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) September 10, 2025 Concerns Over Missed Opportunities CryptoSensei emphasized that the wholesale form of CBDC could provide efficiencies, cost savings, and improvements in interbank operations. They noted that adopting a wholesale CBDC could accelerate transactions and reduce systemic inefficiencies, yet the United States has refrained from pursuing this path. The avoidance, they argued, appears tied to skepticism and fear surrounding CBDCs in general. CryptoSensei suggested that the hesitation may stem from misinformation or a lack of public understanding, even though the wholesale model would not carry the same concerns as a retail system. Global CBDC Advancements In the video, CryptoSensei pointed out that more than 90 percent of countries are currently exploring or developing some form of central bank digital currency. They highlighted China as an example, noting that its digital currency has already been deployed. They also referenced India and several other countries where retail CBDCs have gone live, describing their rollouts as being successful in supporting local economies. By comparison, the United States remains at a standstill, without meaningful progress toward implementation. The Issue of Timing CryptoSensei raised concerns about the timing of any U.S. decision on CBDCs . They stated that waiting until a new administration takes office to revisit the matter could result in further delays, potentially placing the U.S. at a disadvantage compared to other nations. While acknowledging that retail CBDCs spark debates over control and privacy, CryptoSensei reiterated that wholesale CBDCs offer a way to cut costs and streamline financial operations without raising the same level of concern. Their main question was why U.S. policymakers have avoided exploring this model, leaving the outcome uncertain. The Connection to XRP and Ripple Though not expanded upon in detail within the video, CryptoSensei included references to XRP and Ripple in the tweet itself. XRP has frequently been discussed in the context of payment efficiency and cross-border settlement, areas where wholesale CBDCs could play a significant role. By linking these terms, CryptoSensei suggested that there is an intersection between CBDC development and technologies like XRP that aim to improve global payment infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 CryptoSensei’s message underlined both urgency and frustration with the U.S. government’s approach to CBDCs. They framed the issue as one of missed opportunities, pointing out that while other countries move ahead with digital currencies, the United States risks falling behind. Their emphasis was not on advocating for retail CBDCs, but on highlighting the advantages of wholesale systems that could improve efficiency and reduce costs in interbank transactions. According to their perspective, continued delay may leave the U.S. unprepared as digital currency adoption accelerates worldwide.

What Are the Whales Doing?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-on-ethereum-eth-what-are-the-whales-doing/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant has released a compelling report on the current market outlook for Ethereum (ETH). The firm notes that Ethereum is experiencing one of its strongest periods in history in terms of institutional demand, staking participation, and on-chain activity. According to the report, Ethereum fund holdings have doubled since April 2025, reaching 6.5 million ETH. Furthermore, the total holdings of whale wallets with balances between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have surpassed 20 million ETH. While this indicates strong institutional interest, it also suggests significant “smart money” positioning and limited short-term upside potential. Ethereum staking also hit a new record. The total amount of ETH staked rose to 36.15 million. CryptoQuant notes that this reflects long-term confidence and a reduction in circulating supply. However, the high number of staked assets also highlights the possibility that new inflows could slow if price momentum weakens. Network expansion continues. The total number of transactions and active addresses on Ethereum has reached an all-time high. The growth of DeFi, stablecoin transfers, and token activity is driving ETH usage, while smart contract calls exceeding 12 million per day reinforce Ethereum's importance as a programmable consensus layer. Related News: The Wealth of Arthur Hayes, the Big Altcoin Bull, Revealed - Here Are the Cryptocurrencies He Holds Meanwhile, a sharp decline in inflows to exchanges has been observed. According to the analyst firm, the amount of ETH sent to exchanges has decreased significantly since the price of ETH reached $5,000. This suggests that selling pressure has eased and investors are anticipating upward price action. On the price front, critical levels are on the agenda. ETH's recent rally peaked at the upper band of the realized price at $5,200. CryptoQuant emphasizes that this level has historically been a strong resistance area. Currently trading around $4,400, analysts warn that consolidation or correction is likely if this resistance level is not clearly broken. *This is not investment advice.

These patterns, typically bullish, suggest the possibility of a long-term rally that could propel BTC to $360,000. The current price sits near $115,390. Smaller Pattern Confirms Breakout The first IH&S has been in play since November 2024. Bitcoin broke above the neckline in July at $112,000, confirming the bullish structure. The measured target for this pattern is around $170,000, implying a nearly 50% gain from current levels. The rebound from $112,000 indicates that the formation remains intact. Larger Supercycle Formation The second IH&S pattern stretches back to March 2021. Bitcoin crossed above its neckline near $73,000 in November 2024, shortly after the U.S. elections, pushing prices beyond $100,000. A subsequent retest of $74,400 in April confirmed the breakout, strengthening confidence in the bullish projection. If the pattern continues to unfold, analysts see Bitcoin climbing as high as $360,000, a 217% increase from present levels. Analysts Call It “Supercycle Ignition” Market analyst Merlijn The Trader described the setup as extraordinary. “The Bitcoin inverse head and shoulders of dreams has now doubled,” he said in a Wednesday post. “This isn’t a pattern. It’s the supercycle ignition.” The sentiment underscores growing excitement that Bitcoin could be entering a historic phase of growth. Short-Term Outlook Remains Bullish On shorter timeframes, technical analysis also favors upside. As reported by Cointelegraph, a similar formation on the four-hour chart suggests a near-term target of $120,000, provided BTC holds above $113,000. This shorter rally would align with broader bullish momentum, giving traders confidence in further gains. ETFs Fuel Institutional Demand Institutional participation is also on the rise. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded three straight days of inflows between Monday and Wednesday, totaling $1.15 billion. The $752 million of inflows on Wednesday marked the strongest single-day figure since mid-July. Analysts believe this renewed demand reflects growing confidence among institutions even as retail participation wanes. Market intelligence firm Santiment commented on the surge, saying: “Money is moving back into Bitcoin ETFs at a rapid rate as retailers impatiently drop out of crypto. Previous crypto rallies were boosted by inflow spikes like this.” Path Toward Higher Targets The combination of strong technical structures and institutional inflows provides a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin. If momentum continues, the possibility of a parabolic rise toward $170,000, and eventually $360,000, cannot be dismissed. For now, traders are closely watching the $113,000 support and ETF inflow trends as key signals of whether the “supercycle ignition” thesis will hold.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-12 05:24:36

The outcome could result in a new trial or a revised sentence. Meanwhile, several former executives have already been sentenced, including Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, Nishad Singh, and Ryan Salame, with Michelle Bond’s case still pending. SBF Appeal Hearing Set for November Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is set to take the next step in his appeals process with a hearing that is scheduled for November in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The court calendared arguments for Nov. 4, and it will be the first major development in his case since his transfer in March from a New York facility to the Federal Correctional Institution at Terminal Island in California. Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven felony counts and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2023, but has maintained that he was denied the presumption of innocence during his trial. His legal team argued in their September of 2024 appeal filing that prosecutors mischaracterized FTX user funds as permanently lost. If the appellate court rules in his favor, the outcome could include a new trial or a revised sentencing. Bankman-Fried’s conviction followed the collapse of FTX in November 2022, when the exchange filed for bankruptcy amid a severe liquidity crisis. While several top executives pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors, Bankman-Fried alone maintained a not guilty plea, which led to one of the most closely watched crypto-related trials to date. After his extradition from the Bahamas, he was initially allowed to stay at his parents’ home in California, but a judge revoked his bail in August of 2023 after evidence emerged suggesting he tried to intimidate witnesses . According to the US Bureau of Prisons, his projected release date is Oct. 25, 2044. The fallout from the FTX collapse also affected other executives. Caroline Ellison, former Alameda Research CEO and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend, was sentenced to two years in prison in 2024 after testifying against him. FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former engineering director Nishad Singh both received sentences of time served, while former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame was given more than seven years in prison after his failed attempt to vacate his guilty plea.

On one hand, presale crypto projects are gaining momentum as investors look for early opportunities with strong communities and creative ecosystems. On the other, established tokens like Shiba Inu continue to hold market dominance, backed by recognition and years of trading activity. Among the top crypto presales, Based Eggman $GGs has been highlighted for its unique blend of meme culture, gaming infrastructure, and Base network integration. Meanwhile, SHIB remains a powerful player in the meme coin space, continuing to capture interest from traders and long-term holders alike. This head-to-head comparison looks at how new crypto token presales stack up against established tokens when it comes to ROI potential in 2025. Based Eggman ($GGs): A Presale Designed for Growth Based Eggman $GGs is gaining recognition as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. Built on Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, $GGs is more than just a meme coin. It is a utility-driven token that supports liquidity, gaming, payments, and smart contract gas fees within the Based Eggman ecosystem. The token’s presale structure is designed to reward early adopters. The starting presale price is $0.006389, with a planned launch price of $0.0589. This structure encourages long-term holding by offering clear value at entry. Early numbers show strong traction, with more than 71,049 USDT raised and over 9 million $GGs tokens sold so far. The mission of Based Eggman is to merge gaming, memes, and blockchain into one ecosystem, making Base a hub for culture and entertainment in Web3. By positioning itself as a new crypto token presale with strong tokenomics, $GGs stands out among other presale crypto tokens in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Technical Signals and Market Behavior Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most recognizable meme coins in the crypto market. Current price action shows SHIB trading near $0.0000131, with mixed technical indicators shaping its outlook. On the 4-hour chart, SHIB’s 50-day moving average slopes upward, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. However, the daily and weekly charts show the same average sloping downward, which reflects ongoing bearish pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits in the neutral zone between 30 and 70, highlighting balanced momentum but with a weak bearish divergence on shorter timeframes. SHIB is also consolidating within a symmetrical triangle formation. This pattern often signals upcoming volatility, with key levels to watch around $0.0000131 for upward momentum and $0.0000120 for potential downside. These indicators show how SHIB continues to attract traders, but also how its volatility remains part of its market identity. New Presale vs Established Token: ROI Potential Compared When comparing Based Eggman $GGs and Shiba Inu, the difference lies in their positions within the market. $GGs is part of the new crypto presale wave, offering entry at a low cost with a presale coin designed for adoption on Base. Its tokenomics reward early participants, making it a strong example of how crypto coins on presale can build momentum. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, represents staying power in the meme coin sector. It has established liquidity, high market capitalization, and global recognition. However, as an established asset, its ROI potential depends on price performance within a mature market. This contrast shows why many investors diversify. Token presales like $GGs provide fresh opportunities, while established tokens like SHIB offer stability and recognition. Together, they reflect how top crypto presales and long-standing tokens both contribute to shaping the 2025 crypto landscape. Final Words: $GGs and the Presale Crypto Theme The comparison between Based Eggman $GGs and Shiba Inu highlights the dynamic nature of crypto in 2025. Presale crypto projects like $GGs bring new energy through culture, gaming, and structured tokenomics. Established tokens like SHIB maintain influence through liquidity, recognition, and trading history. Both approaches matter. For those looking to buy presale crypto, $GGs offers entry into one of the top presale crypto projects of 2025. For others who value established presence, SHIB remains a staple in the meme coin market.

The chart highlights three main points: the peak cost of 94,703 XRP for the iPhone 7, the current figure of 285 XRP for the iPhone 17, and a reported overall decrease of 99.7 percent across this time span. The cost of an iPhone in XRP over the years pic.twitter.com/EmdPLXU2pC — xpmarket® (@xpmarket) September 10, 2025 XRP Values Attached to Each Model According to the graphic, the iPhone 7 required 94,703 XRP. The iPhone 8 is shown at 3,976 XRP, while the iPhone X is listed at 4,943 XRP. The iPhone 11 is marked at 2,436 XRP, and the iPhone 12 at 3,133 XRP. The chart shows the iPhone 13 at 791 XRP, the iPhone 14 at 1,631 XRP, the iPhone 15 at 1,567 XRP, and the iPhone 16 at 1,427 XRP. The iPhone 17, as the most recent model presented, is placed at 285 XRP. This presentation allows a straightforward comparison across different generations of iPhones, with a visible trend toward lower XRP requirements in recent years. Analysis of the Trend The figures indicate that the number of XRP units required to purchase an iPhone has declined significantly over time, though not in a uniform pattern. Early models, such as the iPhone 7, required tens of thousands of XRP, while more recent models, like the iPhone 13, fall within the hundreds or low thousands. The infographic shows variation between models, with the iPhone X and iPhone 12 both appearing higher than adjacent models, but the general direction is downward. The result presented is a nearly complete reduction from the iPhone 7 peak to the iPhone 17 figure, quantified as 99.7 percent. Considerations on Methodology The chart offers a clear visualization of XRP-denominated costs but does not specify the assumptions used in compiling the data. Details such as whether launch prices or average retail values were applied, the storage capacity chosen for comparison, and the exchange rates used for conversions are not provided. Without this information, the figures serve as illustrative indicators rather than precise transactional values. Regional differences in pricing and variations in market exchange rates could also significantly alter the results if different sources or time frames were used.

Andrea Gacki, Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), announced this week in Congress that the “mixer rule” has reached its final stages. The regulation, which uses PATRIOT Act powers to ban privacy-enhancing software and methods for cryptocurrency transactions, is now in its final stages. The PATRIOT Act, enacted in 2001 after the September 11 attacks, gave the government broad oversight and investigative powers. Over the years, the law has tightened “know your customer” (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks in the financial system. Now, these powers are being extended to digital assets. The “mixer rule” the Treasury is working on classifies not just cryptocurrency mixers but also numerous on-chain transactions that can provide privacy as a “primary money laundering concern.” These include: Combine or split funds from multiple wallets or accounts Splitting transactions into parts and transferring them on the chain Creating disposable wallets or addresses Swapping between cryptocurrencies Applying user-induced delays to transactions Related News: Whales Are Hoarding Bitcoin, Small Investors Are Selling: What Does This Mean? Experts point out that these definitions are quite broad and could even lead to legitimate users being suspected of committing crimes. Citing the federal crime of breaking transactions into smaller pieces, known as “smurfing” in traditional finance, they suggest similar criminal liability could be extended to cryptocurrency. Concurrent with FinCEN's work, the Special Measures to Fight Modern Threats Act, previously considered dead in Congress, has been revived. Representative Zach Nunn confirmed that the bill is still being debated. This regulation could give the Treasury Department the authority to ban all crypto transactions verified through foreign countries, exchanges, or even miners abroad, without requiring any public due process. Critics argue that such authority could lead to a complete withdrawal of US banks and crypto exchanges from global transactions, which is an “authoritarian approach.” Cryptocurrency industry representatives believe that a complete ban on privacy software would disadvantage not only criminals but also individuals seeking protection from oppressive regimes. The direction the US will take on the final regulations will become clear in the coming weeks. *This is not investment advice.

Ether rose 2.5% to $4,519, while the overall crypto market added 1.5% to $4.1 trillion. The gains followed a week of closely watched economic releases that reinforced a shift in market sentiment. Producer price index data earlier this week showed wholesale inflation unexpectedly declined 0.1%, against forecasts for a 0.3% increase. That was followed by consumer price index figures, which confirmed headline inflation had quickened but not enough to derail bets on imminent monetary easing. JUST IN: $116,000 Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/kqCBWGaGGq — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 12, 2025 Sharp Job Revisions Add Weight To Fed Rate-Cut Bets At the same time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised down employment data for the 12 months through March 2025, erasing about 900,000 jobs. The adjustment, nearly halving the previous count, signaled that the labour market is weaker than previously thought. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said the combination of steady inflation numbers and large downward revisions to employment was pushing the Fed away from a focus on price stability toward supporting growth. “This is greatly helping shift the narrative of the Fed away from inflation towards cutting rates to support the labor market,” he said. He added that this tilt increased the likelihood of a 50-basis-point rate cut either next week or at the October policy meeting. Bitcoin Gains Momentum As Investors Brace For Fed Action Risk assets from Bitcoin to gold rallied in response, front-loading the impact of the expected easing. Investors interpreted the shift as an opportunity to position ahead of a decisive Fed move. Gadi Chait, investment manager at Xapo Bank, noted that Bitcoin had already shown resilience, climbing to $114,000 earlier in the week. “This divergence between sticky inflation and weakening employment creates an almost ideal backdrop for Bitcoin, as investors seek protection against both currency debasement risks and macroeconomic uncertainty,” he said. Weekly jobless claims rising to 263,000 reinforced that view, keeping a September cut firmly in play. Markets now anticipate the Fed will act quickly, balancing stubborn inflation with signs of softening growth. Institutional appetite showed through once again on Sept. 11, when spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $553m in net inflows, the fourth straight day of gains. Ethereum spot ETFs added another $113m, extending their own streak to three days. Whether the Fed opts for a quarter- or half-point cut, Bitcoin continues to attract capital. Its role in portfolios is expanding, with allocators seeing it as a unique asset that offers protection across multiple scenarios.

With its deliberate, peer-reviewed approach, Cardano has historically been more about building sustainable foundations than chasing short-term hype. But now that scaling solutions and governance upgrades are on the horizon, investors want to hear how that might impact ADA’s market value in the months ahead. While ADA’s trajectory depends on its execution of the roadmap, investors are also moving towards emerging opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its early rounds of presale have sold out at record speed, and some analysts predict up to 20,000% ROI if you enter before wider listings. This concurrent momentum illustrates the divide in the market between incumbent blockchains such as Cardano and new, high-growth challengers. Cardano’s 2025 Roadmap Cardano’s development has been divided into five eras, with the current focus on Basho (scaling) and Voltaire (governance). These phases aim to make Cardano more competitive with top networks while giving the community direct control over the future of the ecosystem. Scaling Goals (Basho Era) In the Basho-era, the emphasis is on performance and throughput. Key here is a Layer-2 approach called Hydra , which relies on off-chain state channels. Each Hydra “head” can possibly perform up to 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). And with different heads running in parallel, in theory the network could reach 1 million TPS – which would place Cardano for use in DeFi, gaming, and beyond. Other scaling enhancements are zero-knowledge rollups to pack transactions and next-gen consensus protocols such as Leios and Peras , which aim to enable faster parallel block creation. Governance Goals (Voltaire Era) The Voltaire phase is all about self-sustainability. Cardano is introducing a treasury system where ADA holders vote on proposals, funding ecosystem projects directly from the blockchain. Project Catalyst — this pillar will keep funding hundreds of startups and applications in 2025, extending Cardano’s footprint across DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. A New Altcoin’s Rapid Rise As Cardano is forging ahead with its research-driven roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines for radically different reasons. Its presale has turned into one of the fastest-selling in recent memory, with rounds closing nearly instantly amid overwhelming demand. Such early momentum could establish a platform for explosive growth once it hits major exchanges, analysts say. Comparisons with the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have been made, with the possibility of 20,000% returns for early backers, in a much more focused way on long-term ecosystem development. ADA Price Predictions for 2025 Projections for ADA are subject to a large range of forecasts based on how efficiently the network can execute its roadmap and the state of the crypto market at large. Bullish Scenario : If Hydra reaches mass adoption and DeFi activity grows, ADA might go towards $2.00–$3.00. Moderate Scenario: Analysts hopeful of steady growth point to ADA likely hovering at around $0.80 to $1.60 suggesting progress, with some movement, without a huge surge. Bearish Scenario: If development is slow, or if crypto markets decline, ADA could try to make lows of below $0.60 , but community and institutional support could prevent it from breaking down further. Key Drivers of ADA’s Performance Cardano’s 2025 journey is reliant on several key elements: Scaling Success: Hydra will be the major test case for whether Cardano is able to scale globally. Ecosystem Expansion: More DeFi and NFT projects building on Cardano will expand the use cases of ADA. Institutional Interest: Franklin Templeton running nodes, for example, provide evidence of increasing legitimacy. Regulatory Shifts: Cardano’s academic and compliance-driven strategic framework could benefit from a stricter environment Conclusion Cardano’s cautious, research-intensive approach is now under examination in real-world conditions. As Hydra grows, Voltaire governance gets upgraded, and the ecosystem goes further, 2025 should be the year of breakthrough. And, at the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s record-breaking presale and 20,000% ROI potential show how investors are balancing attention toward the giants that are already there and also looking for new, explosive opportunities. Both stories highlight the diversity of crypto’s future — one rooted in careful evolution, the other based on rapid momentum.

BitMine’s Total Ethereum Holdings Surge Past 2.1 Million ETH According to an X post by on-chain analytics account Lookonchain, BitMine seems to have further increased its total ETH holdings. Notably, the firm’s wallet added another 46,225 ETH to its total holdings, worth slightly more than $200 million. It should be recalled that on September 8, BitMine had bought 202,500 ETH, helping it boost its total ETH holdings to more than two million for the first time ever. Eventually, the firm aims to hold 5% of the total ETH supply. The New York Stock Exchange-listed (NYSE) firm has been on an ETH buying spree all summer. Following today’s purchase, its total ETH holdings have now surged above 2.1 million, worth approximately $9.27 billion at the time of writing. It is worth highlighting that BitMine currently holds the largest amount of ETH among all public companies. According to data from Coingecko, SharpLink is a distant second on the list, with 837,230 ETH on its balance sheet. Other firms like Coinbase (136,782 ETH), Bit Digital (120,306 ETH), and ETHZilla (102,246 ETH), round up the top five holders of ETH. Notably, nine out of the top ten firms holding the most amount of ETH are US-based. Following today’s purchase, BitMine’s stock BMNR is trading at $47.85, up 4.93% on the day. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the stock has jumped a whopping 559%, making it one of the best performing crypto-related stocks this year. ETH Giving Bitcoin A Run For Its Money As an increasing number of firms embrace ETH as the digital asset of choice, attention has been steadily moving away from the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin (BTC). However, this does not mean that ETH has completely displaced BTC. That said, the trend of companies choosing to add ETH to their balance sheets gained significant momentum in 2025. Yesterday, Cyprus-based firm Robin Energy announced it had bought ETH worth $5 million. Similarly, in August, SharpLink bought another 56,533 ETH to increase its total ETH reserves. In the same vein, Jack Ma-linked Yunfeng Financial invested close to $44 million into ETH earlier this week. ETH could see further price appreciation as staking activity on the network continues to grow at an exponential rate. At press time, ETH trades at $4,435, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|BitMine|btc|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ether|Ethereum Adoption|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 06:00:12

Sethi Warns Of Short-Term Crypto Bubbles In a recent interview with Fortune at the Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah, Sethi acknowledged the presence of a bubble when examining short-term market trends. During the panel discussion, Sethi noted, “If you look at it quarter by quarter, the answer is yes, we get into those bubbles all the time.” Related Reading: SEC Chair Declares ‘Crypto’s Time Has Come’ In Latest Statement – Get The Full Scoop Since the beginning of the year, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has achieved multiple all-time highs, contributing to a total market capitalization exceeding $4 trillion for the first time. This surge has been fueled by pro-crypto regulations stemming from President Donald Trump’s administration and crypto-focused initial public offerings (IPOs) in the United States from firms like Circle (CRLC) and the crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH). The current enthusiasm in the crypto market can be partially attributed to its correlation with the stock market, particularly following record highs in the S&P 500 since President Donald Trump took office. Some argue that these developments provide investors with exposure to cryptocurrencies that may not be accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. However, skeptics caution that many of these firms are merely capitalizing on the hype, leading to unsustainable valuations that could result in a market crash. Silbert Predicts Most Digital Assets Will Crash Recent data indicates that there may already be signs of a downturn. According to Architect Partners, a crypto advisory and financing firm, the average stock price of 15 digital asset treasuries dropped by 15% last week, raising red flags about the stability of the market. Conversely, Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), expressed a more optimistic outlook during the same panel. He acknowledged the presence of “overvalued assets” within the crypto space, stating, “There’s a whole lot of crap in crypto right now, which is overvalued. I think 99% of crypto is absolutely going to zero.” Related Reading: XRP Price Completes Wave 3 Move, Why $3.13 Must Be Broken Further complicating the landscape, Elliott Management, an activist investment firm, has also raised alarms about the cryptocurrency market. In a recent investor letter, the firm pointed to the rapid inflation of the so-called crypto bubble, attributing it in part to perceived endorsements from the White House during Trump’s administration. Elliott Management warned that the dramatic rise in crypto prices poses risks not only to individual investors but also to the overall economy. They caution that an impending collapse of this bubble could have unforeseen consequences, potentially destabilizing financial markets at large.

Key Takeaways: FTX and Alameda redeemed $44.9 million in Solana, continuing a $1.2 billion unstaking trend. Despite redemptions, the estate still holds 4.18 million SOL worth nearly $1 billion. FTX has returned $6.2 billion to creditors and plans a third payout on September 30. The move follows a consistent pattern observed over the past year, with the estate redeeming Solana assets on a near-monthly basis. Since November 2023, FTX and Alameda have unstaked and transferred nearly 9 million SOL, valued at $1.2 billion, averaging $134 per token. FTX Estate Still Holds Nearly $1B in Solana Despite Ongoing Redemptions Despite the ongoing redemptions, the estate still holds a significant Solana position. Data from Solscan shows that roughly 4.18 million SOL, worth an estimated $977 million, remains staked as of Thursday. Solana’s market response was muted but positive.

The estate has so far returned $6.2 billion to former users, $1.2 billion in February and another $5 billion in May, as part of its restructuring efforts. The payments will be processed through FTX’s designated distribution partners, including BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer. As reported, a Chinese creditor representing over 300 users is opposing FTX’s proposal to restrict payouts in 49 jurisdictions, including China, arguing it is legally unfounded and unfair. Earlier this year, FTX began repaying creditors after securing court approval for its redistribution plan, and to date, has returned approximately $6.2 billion. FTX, once a dominant player in the crypto space, collapsed in November 2022 following a liquidity crisis triggered by revelations about its balance sheet. The fallout led to criminal charges against founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced in 2023 to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors of more than $11 billion. However, he is now projected to be released from federal prison on December 14, 2044 , after serving less than 21 years of his 25-year sentence for fraud tied to the FTX collapse for good behavior. He was also fined over $11 billion. Federal records confirm that Bankman-Fried has been moved from New York to a transfer facility in Oklahoma following nearly two years behind bars. 3AC Targets FTX Execs Over $1.5B Liquidation in New Subpoenas The liquidators of collapsed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) have subpoenaed former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried , ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and FTX executive Ryne Salame. The move follows allegations that over $1.5 billion in 3AC assets were liquidated unlawfully by FTX-linked entities. Bankman-Fried’s deposition is scheduled for October 14, 2025, at Terminal Island prison, where he is currently serving time. 3AC co-founder Zhu Su claims Bankman-Fried executed unauthorized liquidations that contributed to 3AC’s downfall. He also accuses Salame of using insider knowledge to front-run trades and pocket over $1 billion in profits before FTX’s collapse. Ellison is expected to be questioned regarding Alameda’s trading strategies that may have played a role in the alleged misconduct.

Despite this decline, venture capital raises were consistent with July’s levels, supported by the $600 million generated from PUMP’s public sale. DeFi projects especially attracted investments across infrastructure and trading platforms in August, bringing third-quarter totals to $4.57 billion, already edging past Q2’s $4.54 billion in just two months. Daan Crypto says lower valuations on new launches have led to stable price performance In a Thursday X post , market analyst Daan Crypto Trades argued that investor interest has pivoted from continuous new-chain launches to treasury firms developing on existing projects. He noted that capital is now concentrated in liquid markets, reducing the amount of raises for new chains and similar ventures. Still, he argued that this trend is healthy for the market. Source: DefiLlama He explained that lower valuations on new launches have contributed to more stable price action following listings. “I’d say this is a good change for the market and the projects themselves,” he wrote, adding that it leaves room for potential upside for all participants. According to DeFiLlama’s analysis, at the beginning of 2022, monthly raises reached $7 billion , although they’ve declined significantly to much lower levels, while 2025 has had some big spikes. Experts say it still lays the foundation for a healthier ecosystem for both builders and investors despite any pullback. Outside of DeFi, AI protocols also gained significant inflows in August. Everlyn raised more than $15 million and several other seed-stage rounds in AI. Cybersecurity was another highlight category, led by IVIX’s $60 million Series B, the month’s largest traditional VC round. Stablecoin infrastructure followed closely behind, with Rain’s $58 million raise. Additionally, payment infrastructure grabbed headlines after OrangeX raised a $20 million Series B and later rounds for cross-border and merchant payment solutions, some of which benefit from a higher penetration of crypto in commerce. Gaming projects were not excluded, with Overtake coming in with an investment of $7 million, and other protocols supported through ongoing development. South Korea is lifting the VC funding ban on crypto firms Crypto firms are expected to start receiving more financing, especially in South Korea. Following the State Council and cabinet’s approval, the Ministry of SMEs and Startups said it officially lifted the long-standing VC funding ban on September 16. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the amendment to the Enforcement Decree will revoke the designation of crypto exchanges and brokerages as “restricted venture businesses,” effectively opening them up to VC participation. The measure dates back to October 2018, when the Moon administration introduced it to rein in an overheated and speculative crypto environment. Much has changed since then. South Korea has taken strong steps to bring order to its crypto market, starting with the introduction in 2021 of a licensing system for virtual asset service providers. Following this, the passage of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in July 2025 added deposit protection, mandatory record-keeping, and bans on unfair trading, all key measures that helped professionalize the industry and address past concerns. Now the ministry stated the amendment mirrors the shifting global status of the cryptoasset sector. It pointed out that new legal frameworks will protect local crypto exchange users extensively and support growth in the digital asset ecosystem, particularly focusing on blockchain and cryptography-focused companies. According to the government, the reform will also make it possible for crypto companies with proven technological capabilities and potential to access VC investment. The ministry emphasized that this will give them equal opportunities alongside other IT innovators. Minister Han Seong-sook remarked, “We will foster a transparent and responsible ecosystem. We will help facilitate the flow of venture capital and the growth of new industries.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs had $246 million in inflows, while Ethereum (ETH) ETFs saw $788 million in outflows. This raises uncomfortable concerns for investors who want to know why crypto is down when institutional interest seems to be quite selective. This difference in flows shows that even the biggest tokens might not expand. That’s why retail investors and people with a clearer vision are looking for the next ETH-like ROI story in presale initiatives with disruptive utility. One project that has been getting a lot of interest is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is now in Phase 6 of its presale. The token costs $0.035, and more than $15.6 million has already been raised. There are also more than 16,200 holders. About 38% of the 170 million tokens set up for this stage have already been taken, which makes people who are late feel rushed. Phase 7 will raise the price by 15% to $0.040, which means that this is the last chance for investors to get MUTM at today’s lower price before the next step up. BTC ETF inflows hit $246M, ETH loses $788M Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs brought in $246 million in net inflows for the week ending September 5, 2025. This pushed BTC up to about $112,200, with a trading volume of $45 billion in 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) ETFs, on the other hand, lost $788 million, which caused the price to drop 3.3% to almost $4,300, with a volume of $37.07 billion. BTC’s inflows show that institutions are confident, while ETH’s outflows show that people are being careful because of macroeconomic factors like U.S. tariffs and concern about the Federal Reserve. Technical indications reveal that BTC is testing support around $112,000 and ETH is testing support at $4,220. The RSI for BTC is at 50, and the RSI for ETH is at 46. If resistances pass, analysts think BTC will be worth $116,713 and ETH will be worth $4,868. But if they fall below $112,000 and $4,220, they might drop to $108,000 and $3,950, respectively. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): early ROI parallels with Ethereum (ETH) People know a lot about the first investors in Ethereum (ETH). People who bought during the token auction saw huge gains that changed their fortunes for good. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting similar conversations today by combining strong DeFi mechanics with an appealing entry point. For example, an investor who traded $5,000 worth of SOL or AVAX for MUTM in Phase 1 has already made a lot of money on paper by Phase 6, when the price had risen to $0.035. With a listing price of $0.06, these benefits are likely to grow even more, which is exciting for people who know how powerful it is to get in on a project early. Investors can use Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to access a platform that is geared toward genuine financial use cases, unlike passive speculating in a crypto ETF. Users can put stablecoins or blue-chip tokens like ETH and BTC into certified smart contracts in their P2C lending pools. These deposits are turned into mtTokens, which earn interest automatically and can even be used as collateral again. For example, an investor who gives $15,000 in BUSD gets mtBUSD at a 1:1 ratio. With an average APY of 15%, the investor gets $2,250 in passive income per year while still being able to access the initial funds. Borrowers get the same benefits. If you have $1,000 worth of ETH and don’t want to sell it, you can lock it up as collateral and borrow up to 75% of its value. This approach lets you get liquidity without giving up the chance to make more money on your primary holdings. Smart contracts make lending and borrowing easier, which means that security and efficiency go hand in hand. Building stability in volatile markets It’s evident from the way things are right now that managing volatility is the most important thing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built-in protections that keep both depositors and borrowers safe, even when the market is moving quickly. Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios are carefully set. Stablecoins like ETH can go up to 75% with an 80% liquidation barrier, whereas more volatile tokens can only go up to 35–40% LTV with thresholds closer to 65%. These cautious steps keep collateralized holdings healthy and make liquidation operations profitable for liquidators without upsetting the system. When the market becomes less liquid, the protocol automatically raises the rewards for liquidators to step in, making sure that distressed holdings are closed down quickly. Reserve factors, which range from 10% for stable assets to 38% for risky ones, give investors extra protection against risks that could lead to more problems. The platform’s open approach to security also helps build trust. A CertiK audit of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gave it a 95 Token Scan Score and a 78 Skynet Score. The team has also started a $50,000 bug bounty program that pays ethical hackers up to $2,000 for important discoveries. This makes defenses stronger and gets more developers involved. A $100,000 giveaway has also been announced to reward people who believed early on. Ten winners will each get $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Investors will soon be able to observe how lending, borrowing, and managing liquidity work together in real life when the beta version comes out around the time of the listing. The plan also includes Layer-2 integration to lower transaction costs and a proprietary stablecoin, all of which are meant to make the platform more useful and popular. Importantly, top-tier exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and MEXC are getting ready to list these tokens. This will give them the kind of visibility and accessibility that has historically driven demand for tokens. Conclusion The $0.06 listing charge is just the start of what is to come. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has everything it needs to flourish like Ethereum (ETH) did in its early days, as more people use it and it gets more attention. As Bitcoin (BTC) settles around institutional flows and Ethereum (ETH) fights outflows, the hunt for big profits will only get more intense. Investors don’t only want to know why crypto is down anymore. They want to find the new generation of DeFi enterprises that mix new ideas with long-term viability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is exactly that chance. It links vision with action and pledges to follow the same path to return on investment (ROI) as the first people who believed in Ethereum (ETH).

The aggressive accumulation has boosted their total holdings to a record 3.65 million BTC and even continued as spot prices consolidated near $112,000. This was indicative of a growing divergence between short-term retail speculation and conviction-driven structural demand. Exchanges Bleed BTC as Sharks Hoard Two critical datasets validate this outlook, according to CryptoQuant’s observation: Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Change Exchange Netflow The LTH metric has flipped sharply positive, as seasoned investors are accumulating rather than distributing coins. Historically, such green spikes precede larger bull cycles as BTC migrates into “strong hands” less likely to sell into temporary volatility. Meanwhile, exchange flows continue to show pronounced outflows, with investors steadily withdrawing coins into cold storage instead of leaving them available for immediate trading. This confirms that the recent buying is not just speculative repositioning but actual supply removal from liquid markets. When shark accumulation converges with LTH absorption and exchange withdrawals, the setup becomes highly conducive to a supply squeeze. While the potential for short-term pullbacks remains, particularly if derivatives markets become overheated, the structural forces at play tilt the balance toward higher valuations once renewed demand emerges. Beneath the surface-level swings, Bitcoin’s market structure is quietly but decisively moving toward scarcity, which could mean that the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next strong leg higher is already being laid. CryptoPotato had previously reported that Bitcoin’s liquidity on Binance is showing signs of stress, as withdrawals have been accelerating even as deposits remain subdued. As the platform with the deepest order books, Binance’s liquidity patterns often reflect the broader market’s underlying tone. Earlier in August, inflows climbed sharply as traders positioned for distribution or hedging while BTC approached $120,000. That activity cooled in the latter half of the month, which brought inflows and outflows into temporary balance and stabilized price action. This changed in September as outflows surged above 22 million BTC while inflows stalled. This sharp divergence points to reduced willingness to sell and stronger preference for self-custody, which strengthens the case for upward market moves. The result is a tightening liquidity pool that could act as fuel once demand strengthens. Should these conditions continue, Binance’s shrinking reserves may prove the catalyst for Bitcoin’s next leg higher. Miners Join the Bulls Adding to this tightening supply story, Bitcoin miners are also rewriting the playbook this cycle as they have transformed from aggressive sellers to steady accumulators. Traditionally, the Miners’ Position Index (MPI) spikes before halvings and late in bull markets as miners dump reserves into retail-driven demand. Despite record-high mining difficulty and surging transaction fees, miners are holding tight. Catalysts such as US spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and sovereign adoption are fueling this accumulation-first strategy.

A significant announcement has recently emerged from OKX, one of the leading global crypto exchanges, impacting a specific segment of the market. This development, involving the OKX delisting LUNC USTC futures , is set to reshape trading strategies for many and highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset markets. What Exactly is Happening with OKX Delisting LUNC USTC Futures? OKX has officially declared its decision to delist the USTC/USDT and LUNC/USDT perpetual futures. This means that as of September 18, at 8:00 a.m. UTC, these specific trading pairs will no longer be available on their platform. For traders involved in these assets, this announcement requires immediate attention and decisive action to manage their portfolios effectively. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset directly. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading and leveraged positions. The decision by OKX to remove these specific contracts signals a significant shift in their offering for LUNC and USTC, impacting liquidity and accessibility for these derivatives. Why is OKX Making This Critical Decision? Exchange delistings are not uncommon in the fast-paced crypto market. They can stem from various factors, including consistently low trading volume, concerns over an asset’s long-term stability, or potential regulatory pressures that exchanges must navigate. While OKX has not provided an exhaustive list of reasons for this particular OKX delisting LUNC USTC futures , the history of LUNC (formerly Terra Luna) and USTC (formerly TerraUSD) provides crucial context. The dramatic collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022 led to unprecedented price volatility and a profound loss of confidence in these assets. Many exchanges subsequently reviewed their listings to ensure market health, protect users from highly speculative or unstable instruments, and maintain their platform’s integrity. This proactive measure by OKX could be interpreted as a strategic move to manage risk, align with evolving market conditions, and potentially safeguard its user base from instruments associated with high historical volatility. What Does This Mean for Traders Holding LUNC and USTC Futures? For traders with open positions in USTC/USDT and LUNC/USDT perpetual futures, the upcoming delisting carries critical implications. It’s not merely a suggestion; it’s a mandatory closure of these markets on the OKX platform. Here’s what you absolutely need to know and the steps you should consider: Forced Liquidation Risk: Any open positions for USTC/USDT and LUNC/USDT perpetual futures that are not manually closed by the specified deadline will be automatically liquidated by OKX. This automated process might not occur at the most favorable price for the trader, potentially leading to unexpected losses. Urgent Position Closure: Traders are strongly advised to close their positions manually well in advance of September 18, 8:00 a.m. UTC. Taking control of your exits allows for better risk management and helps avoid the uncertainties associated with a forced liquidation event. Review and Withdrawal: After the delisting, any remaining funds or collateral associated with these futures contracts will likely be converted to USDT or another stablecoin and made available for withdrawal. However, it is crucial to confirm specific details directly with OKX customer support or their official announcements. Ignoring this announcement could lead to significant financial repercussions and missed opportunities to manage your capital effectively. Therefore, it is essential to review your portfolio, understand your exposure, and take the necessary steps promptly to manage your involvement with the OKX delisting LUNC USTC futures . Navigating the Market After the OKX Delisting: What Are Your Options? The delisting of these futures contracts from OKX doesn’t necessarily mean the end of LUNC or USTC spot trading, nor does it preclude their availability on other exchanges. However, it does significantly reduce the avenues for leveraged trading on these specific assets within a major platform. Traders might need to explore other reputable exchanges that still offer these pairs, but always with heightened caution and thorough due diligence regarding their terms, liquidity, and security. This event also serves as a potent reminder about the inherent risks in cryptocurrency trading, especially with highly volatile or historically problematic assets. Diversification across different assets, strict risk management protocols (like setting stop-losses), and staying diligently updated on exchange announcements are paramount for long-term success. Consider this a valuable moment to reassess your overall trading strategy, your risk tolerance, and your exposure to high-risk derivatives. The crypto market is dynamic and requires continuous learning. Understanding these market shifts helps you make more informed decisions and adapt your strategies to maintain a resilient portfolio. Staying ahead of such announcements can protect your investments and prepare you for future market movements. In summary, the upcoming OKX delisting LUNC USTC futures on September 18 is a critical event for traders involved in these specific perpetual contracts. Proactive and timely management of open positions is absolutely essential to mitigate potential losses and ensure a smooth transition. While the crypto market constantly presents new opportunities, it also demands vigilance, informed decision-making, and adaptability. Stay alert, stay informed, and trade responsibly to navigate these changes successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will OKX delist USTC and LUNC perpetual futures? A: OKX will delist the USTC/USDT and LUNC/USDT perpetual futures on September 18, at 8:00 a.m. UTC. Q2: What should I do if I have open positions in these futures contracts? A: It is strongly advised to manually close all your open positions before the delisting deadline to avoid automatic liquidation by OKX. Q3: Will I lose my funds if I don’t close my positions before the deadline? A: Any open positions not closed manually will be automatically liquidated, which may result in losses or unfavorable outcomes depending on market conditions at the time of liquidation. Q4: Can I still trade LUNC and USTC after the OKX delisting? A: While OKX will delist these specific futures contracts, LUNC and USTC may still be available for spot trading or on other cryptocurrency exchanges. Always conduct thorough research before trading on new platforms. Q5: Why is OKX delisting these specific futures contracts? A: While OKX hasn’t provided detailed reasons, such delistings often occur due to factors like low trading volume, concerns over asset stability, or regulatory considerations, especially given the historical volatility of LUNC and USTC.

ETHA offers cheaper and more efficient exposure to Ethereum than competitors, but short-term flows and technicals suggest a bearish outlook through year-end. ETH's utility as a smart contract platform is notable, yet most network activity remains speculative and tied mostly to crypto trading (stablecoins, etc.) rather than real-world use cases. I am bearish on ETHA for the short term due to waning liquidity and momentum, but maintain a neutral long-term view as institutional adoption could shift the narrative. The cryptocurrency market has had a great year. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is up to about $115K, rising ~23% this year, doubling in value since last September. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has performed even better this year, gaining by about 32%, outperforming Bitcoin over recent months with a staggering 130% gain over the past six months. Retail investor interest in Ethereum is very high, particularly for the newer Ethereum ETF ( ETHA ), which launched last summer. As ETH soared, ETHA's outstanding units have risen by roughly 220% since early summer. This metric is measured by dividing its AUM (which is almost $16B) by its price: Data by YCharts To me, this chart highlights a clear trend. Retail investor demand for ETHA rose dramatically over the past three months, but has since halted. There's been a small reversal in outstanding units, though it is not extended enough to indicate falling demand. ETHA is the largest Ethereum ETF, with about three times the assets as Grayscale's Ethereum ETF ( ETHE ). ETHE is older, but ETHA is, in my view, clearly the better fund, given its expense ratio is 0.25%, while ETHE's is 2.5% . ETHE provides cheap exposure to Ethereum, avoiding the higher transaction fees and wallet complexities often seen in direct cryptocurrency exchanges. With Ethereum floating around an all-time high, matching its 2021 peak level (preceding a fall back toward $1K), I think it's an excellent time to cover ETHA and provide an outlook for Ethereum. In my opinion, there are two key questions we must answer. First, how might immediate changes in retail sentiment and technical trends influence its price over the coming months? Second, what utility value (wealth storage, transactions, privacy, etc.) does Ethereum provide that secures its long-term value over other cryptocurrencies? Retail Exuberance Is Fading As Liquidity Slows The launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs may have been a major catalyst behind this year's bull market, allowing a large increase in retail investor flows, particularly from older/retired individual investors looking to diversify into alternative assets (without opening a separate crypto brokerage account). Still, given that both ETH and BTC have slowed down, with fund flows into ETHA slipping, it may be a good time to be cautious. Historically, my view on Bitcoin is that it's a neat trading asset, benefiting from lower cross-market correlations, but its long-term utility is weak given the immense energy costs and time required to perform transactions on its ledger. Bitcoin may still have a first-mover advantage, but I think it's technologically archaic compared to Ethereum and others. Given Bitcoin's many ""currency pitfalls,"" it is more often seen as ""digital gold."" However, I've also pointed out its low correlation to real interest rates/inflation expectations (which gold usually has), limiting its ability to store wealth truly. To me, it is essentially a store of excess market liquidity, which has been high since the money-printing binge of 2020-2021. The US Monetary Base , the total amount of currency and Fed reserve balances (money made through quantitative easing), was $3.2T in 2019, rising to just over $6.4T by the peak of QE in 2021. That figure has plateaued around $5.6T, meaning no new net currency is flowing into the US financial system. Still, that cash is still working its way through the system, first going primarily into banks and then into individual investors' cash balance. We can measure bank excess liquidity through Fed reverse repurchase liabilities (excess commercial bank cash lent back to the Fed). That metric skyrocketed toward the end of QE by 2021 as banks still saw cash rise due to QE, but that new money was not demanded by borrowers who were then coming out of COVID-related economic strains (this was a major inflationary trigger). Individual investor cash allocations can be tracked through AAII surveys. AAII members are representative of the ~60+ $1M+ net worth cohort, so not necessarily the younger ""early"" crypto investors, but what I think is the growing crypto investing class (those buying ETFs like ETHA). When we're thinking about Ethereum or Bitcoin on a short-term (3-6 month) basis, I think our best data is changes in market liquidity. Who has cash, and where are they putting it? With inflation a potential recurrent issue (limiting bonds), stock valuations very high, and the economy somewhat stagnant, it makes sense that cryptocurrencies are a go-to place for extra cash. The inverse correlation between Ethereum (and Bitcoin) and AAII cash allocations is particularly strong: Data by YCharts The crashing (deflationary) COVID economy was offset by tremendous monetary base expansion in 2020, resulting in inflationary excess bank liquidity by 2021 into 2022 (reverse repo liabilities). AAII cash allocations rose initially in 2020 as investors rebalanced during the ""lockdown crash."" As that cash went back into financial assets, Ethereum's value skyrocketed, peaking around November 2021, just as cash allocations hit an extreme bottom. The subsequent end to QE and sharp rate hikes led to a broad market sell-off in risk assets, including stocks, long-term bonds, and cryptos, throughout 2022. Cash allocations rose back to historical highs (~25%). Ethereum crashed. The transition to quantitative tightening took some money out of the financial system, resulting in the plateau and 2023 decline in reverse repos. Cash then flowed back into financial assets, pushing ETH and Bitcoin back up in late 2023 to early last year. We saw this cycle repeat early this year during the spring correction. That began with low cash allocations around 14-15%, resulting in a sharp ETH sell-off that ended around April, aligning with the peak in cash allocations. Summer saw the steep rise in basically everything, particularly Ethereum, potentially benefiting from added demand via ETFs. Cash allocations are relatively low again. They're not at the To me, the ""liquidity data"" I track paints a bearish picture for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum and Bitcoin's short-term movements are driven by changes in excess liquidity, which has been drying up over recent months. At the same time, shares outstanding of ETHA have shifted from sharply rising to a recent small decline, indicating investor demand may be shifting back toward defense. Further, the longer-term ETH-BTC trend, which bounced over the summer, is potentially reversing and may be back in line with a long-term negative trend: Data by YCharts Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin during the 2020-2022 period, but has reversed all relative gains since then. Although the above chart is not conclusive, I find it notable that ETH-BTC peaked around that linear negative trend from late 2022 to the start of 2025. I see this as ETH being oversold to BTC by late spring, now possibly being overbought (relative to BTC). This adds to my bearish short-term bias on ETHA. Ethereum Has More Utility Than Bitcoin Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin, and to me, it is clearly superior in terms of functionality. That said, it is not necessarily ""functional,"" just more so than Bitcoin. Ethereum is based on ""smart contracts,"" written in the programming language ""Solidity."" These coded contracts create a non-changeable contract that companies or people can use to make financial deals outside of centralized finance. While this improves Bitcoin, and it beats it on many other fronts , Ethereum still suffers from slow transaction times (compared to Visa, etc.) and high costs. Ethereum benefits from the usage of ""smart contracts"" through a ""computational fee"" called ""gas."" From Investopedia , ""Gas fees compensate validators, who maintain and secure the blockchain, especially under the proof-of-stake model, which begvan in September 2022."" This fee is then ""burned,"" removing ETH from the market, creating theoretical deflationary benefits to its price. After that change was made, the supply of Ethereum slowed to a halt. However, the gas price is now extremely low due to growing adoption of the ""layer 2"" network (also seen in BTC). See below: Data by YCharts From what I understand, the decline in gas fees from layer 2 utilization is not bearish because this results in more large transactions that use more ""gas."" To that end, Ethereum is seen as the ""plumbing of crypto,"" particularly as crypto becomes a Wall Street asset with more regulatory support. Trump's policy changes have led to the rise of stablecoins this year, most of which are backed by Ethereum's contract system. The Bottom Line The fact is that there is so much hype and jargon around cryptocurrencies. The use-case argument for Ethereum is compelling, particularly as we see PayPal, JPMorgan ( JPM ), and others start to create an institutional financial network that is tied to Ethereum. Still, are institutional financial firms adopting ETH-based crypto products in order to gain exposure to the significant market liquidity wrapped up in the cryptocurrency market? Years ago, we saw a popular ""use case"" from non-fungible tokens, but that unsurprisingly ended in a huge bust. There is a thought that ""smart contracts"" can be used for legal contracts, such as property titles, energy credits ( carbon credits ), and intellectual property ownership, etc. Yet, that remains mostly theoretically, and the vast majority of Ethereum network usage is for crypto trading. In my opinion, Ethereum is mostly a partial solution to a partial issue. To a degree, I think Ethereum and Bitcoin exist for their own sakes, lacking clear functionality beyond the crypto finance industry. I may be wrong, and many would disagree with me, but I don't expect to change my view until there are true, real-world (not finance/crypto) uses for the Ethereum network. NFTs were supposed to be that, but they proved to be mostly speculative hype. The Ethereum technology is interesting, but its primary ""use case"" (as in, why most people buy it) is seemingly to speculate on its price. It may have functionality in multiple domains, but the main domain seems to be gambling on its price. Thus, its primary driver is not ETH-based economic activity, but changes in excess cash in the financial system, particularly among individual investors. From a long-term standpoint, I think it's worth watching Ethereum. I know it's premature for me to state that it lacks non-speculation/crypto functionality. On a short-term basis, I expect ETHA will decline over the coming months or weeks as the liquidity-driven speculative momentum behind it slows or reverses. I am bearish on ETHA, expecting it to decline through year-end. However, while I see limited real-world economic value in Ethereum, I recognize the trend we've seen this year (in ETH-based stablecoins) may prove me wrong, so my long-term outlook is relatively neutral.",ETH-USD|ETHA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BTC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-12 07:26:36

One alt tipped for 50x soon",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/12/what-crypto-to-buy-now-as-eth-targets-4500-one-alt-tipped-for-50x-soon/,"Ethereum (ETH) is slowly making its way back up to $4,500, which has everyone in the crypto community excited. Traders and analysts think that ETH might even reach $6,000 in the next few months. However, Ethereum (ETH) is still a reliable blue-chip asset, and people who want to make money in a way that isn’t too risky are looking at new DeFi initiatives. One of these is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a presale altcoin that offers growth multiples that regular ETH investing can’t match. People who bought Ethereum (ETH) early on made a lot of money over the years, but buying it now for $4,500 doesn’t have as much potential for growth as tokens that are still in presale. This is exactly the kind of chance that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is ready for. At the moment, the presale price is only $0.035, so investors who get in now might make 50X their money before ETH even hits $6,000. Why MUTM could outpace ETH’s growth The basic ideas underlying Mutuum Finance (MUTM) make it a great choice for crypto investors who want to be smart but still take risks. The platform’s Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) makes it safer for users to borrow money, especially when they utilize stablecoins or other correlated assets. This leads to more efficient capital deployment and more loan activity. The utilization-based interest rate mechanism keeps liquidity flowing into the system all the time, which means that MUTM will still work even if the crypto market crashes. Layer-2 integration will make transactions much cheaper, which will speed up adoption and make it easier for more people to use Ethereum (ETH) than Layer-1 transactions. Investors who know how these things work see that MUTM’s design makes it possible to make money in many ways. Liquidation fines go straight to the treasury, where they build up protocol reserves that will later be used to pay for staking rewards and governance projects. Oracles protect pricing data, which lowers the danger of manipulation and makes the platform more appealing to both individual traders and businesses. These elements work together to make an ecosystem that can be adopted quickly, which means that the return on investment (ROI) will be far higher than with Ethereum (ETH), which moves more slowly. Presale traction shows that more and more people are interested in the market. More than 16,200 people have already invested $15.6 million in Phase 6 of MUTM. The project has passed a CertiK audit and gotten a Token Scan score of 95, which makes investors feel safer and more confident. Phase 6 is 38% sold out, and Phase 7 will raise the price of tokens by 15%. This makes it more important for new customers to buy at the current reduced pricing. This presale period is a rare chance to get MUTM before it becomes popular and prices go up after it is listed on exchanges. Catalysts for a 50x run Several things that are going to happen soon are predicted to push MUTM’s price much over its presale price of $0.035. The beta launch will let people lend and borrow on Layer-2, showing that it has genuine value from the start. The addition of stablecoins will make the ecosystem even better. When borrowers mint and burn stablecoins against collateral, it will create stickiness and drive organic demand for MUTM tokens. The protocol’s buyback-driven staking rewards make the supply even tighter, which adds another level of support for the price. The planned Tier-1 exchange listings are similar to the visibility techniques that helped Ethereum (ETH) become well-known in its early years. These elements work together to create short-term catalysts and long-term sustainability, making MUTM an unusual cryptocurrency that can give big profits before ETH reaches $6,000. The numbers are very convincing for anybody who buys early. If you invest $3,500 at $0.035, you will obtain 100,000 MUTM tokens. If the price goes up to $175,000 at a 50x objective, this is a better return than buying Ethereum (ETH) at $4,500 and waiting for it to reach $6,000. MUTM is a better asymmetric play in today’s market for traders who want exponential growth instead of little gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another DeFi token. It was designed for wide use, strong security, and long-term growth. ETH is still a good long-term store of value, but MUTM is a rare chance to make a lot of money quickly by using a mix of utility, presale pricing, and future events. Getting in early today puts investors in a good position to take advantage of the next big DeFi breakout before the rest of the market does.

Leading this revolution is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new decentralized finance platform causing ripples with its new thinking on lending and liquidity in a tightening macroeconomic world. Mutuum Finance presale is currently in Stage 6 with tokens being sold at $0.035. MUTM has surpassed $15.6M in funds raised and investors for the project already number over 16,220. Mutuum Finance can yield up to 300% upon release. Solana Jumps Close to $219 as Institutional Demand Picks Up Pace Solana (SOL) is currently at the $218.70 mark, flat above the $200 level with fresh market optimism. Among the drivers for this rally is the construction of a massive $1.65 billion Solana treasury by Forward Industries backed by heavyweights like Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, indicating solid institutional confidence. Concurrently, technicals, from a “V-shaped” patterned recovery to historical open interest levels, are indicating continuation to $300 in case resistance near $220 is breached. New DeFi narratives, such as those of Mutuum Finance, are also in expansion, along with this greater momentum. Mutuum Finance: Risk Mitigations and Protocol Safety Mutuum Finance employs robust risk parameters for all underlying assets. They include overcollateralization protocols, borrowing limits and deposit limits, and target collateral levels. Closure of undercollateralized positions, which provides stability, is rewarded to liquidators. Greater collateral efficiency for correlated assets means the power to borrow rises with LTV ratios topping collateralized borrowing. Liquidation trigger and penalties are there to protect the protocol and induce timely action. Reserve factors act as a tail market event buffer and default with greater reserves pledged to riskier assets. Stage 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Token Presale Mutuum Finance has already been stacked by 16,200 investors and has sold over $15.54 million worth of tokens. In a bid to enhance the security of the platform and promote community engagement, the project has introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, whereby bug hunting is rewarded in four categories depending on severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Adaptive Interest Rate Mechanism Mutuum Finance is a variable rate system. In times of high liquidity, borrowing is cheap; in times of low liquidity, borrowing is expensive to avoid too much borrowing. To re-balance its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can either encourage borrowers to repay loaned funds or encourage fresh deposits. Increased Security Due to Strict Lending Policies All Mutuum Finance assets are strictly controlled. Examples include borrowing limits, supply limits, and collateral limits. Market price fluctuations make the protocol immune due to overcollateralization, and incentivized liquidators limit undercollateralized loans. Limits on lending and borrowing minimize insolvency risk by capping illiquid or risky asset exposure. High collateral efficiency is granted to correlated assets, and riskier tokens have reduced collateral availability. Market Volatility and Asset Liquidity A sufficient on-chain liquidity must exist so that the stressed positions are liquidated with negligible slippage. Exposure is governed by Liquidation levels and parameters, where higher incentive to the liquidators when lower liquidity. Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation levels are determined by asset volatility: less volatile assets can collateralize higher LTVs and higher liquidation levels, and volatile assets more conservative ones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to watch as the market gains momentum again. Stage 6 tokens are at $0.035 and over $15.6M has been raised so far with 16,220+ investors already in.

Then you need to pay close attention to an important announcement. Binance has declared a crucial temporary Zilliqa ZIL suspension for all deposits and withdrawals. This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a necessary step to support an upcoming network upgrade and hard fork for the Zilliqa blockchain. Staying informed about such developments is key in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. What’s Behind the Zilliqa ZIL Suspension? The decision by Binance to implement a Zilliqa ZIL suspension is directly linked to an essential network upgrade and hard fork for the Zilliqa blockchain. Think of a network upgrade as a significant software update for a computer system. It brings improvements, enhances security, or introduces new features. A ‘hard fork’ means that the old rules of the blockchain are no longer compatible with the new ones, requiring everyone to switch to the updated version. These upgrades are vital for the long-term health and evolution of any blockchain project. They ensure the network remains robust, efficient, and capable of handling future demands. Binance’s role here is to facilitate a smooth transition for its users, preventing any potential issues during the upgrade process. When Will the Zilliqa ZIL Suspension Take Effect? Mark your calendars! The temporary halt for ZIL deposits and withdrawals is scheduled to commence promptly at 5:00 p.m. UTC on September 24 . It’s crucial for users to be aware of this exact timing. Any transactions initiated after this cutoff might not be processed until the suspension is lifted. While the duration of the suspension isn’t explicitly stated in the initial announcement, such halts typically last until the network upgrade is successfully completed and the platform has verified the stability of the new chain. Binance will provide further updates regarding the resumption of services, so keeping an eye on their official announcements is highly recommended. Why Are Temporary ZIL Deposits and Withdrawals Halts Necessary? You might wonder why exchanges need to stop services for an upgrade. It’s primarily about safeguarding your assets and ensuring the integrity of the blockchain. During a hard fork, there’s a risk of transaction discrepancies or even lost funds if exchanges continue processing transactions on a chain that’s about to be superseded or significantly altered. Halting ZIL deposits and withdrawals ensures: Asset Safety: Your ZIL tokens remain secure on the exchange during the transition. Data Integrity: Prevents issues like ‘replay attacks’ or ‘split-brain’ scenarios where transactions could be duplicated or lost across old and new chains. Smooth Transition: Allows Binance to thoroughly test and verify the new Zilliqa network’s stability before re-enabling services. User Experience: Minimizes potential confusion or errors for users interacting with the network during a critical change. This proactive measure reflects Binance’s commitment to providing a secure and reliable trading environment for all its users. What Should Zilliqa (ZIL) Holders Do Now? If you hold Zilliqa (ZIL) or plan to transact with it, there are a few actionable steps you can take. First and foremost, if you need to deposit or withdraw ZIL on Binance, ensure you complete these transactions well before the September 24, 5:00 p.m. UTC deadline. Secondly, there’s no need to move your ZIL tokens from Binance if you intend to keep them on the platform; your assets are safe and will be automatically converted or recognized on the upgraded network. Stay updated by regularly checking Binance’s official announcements page and their social media channels. They will communicate when services are expected to resume. Patience during such technical upgrades is always a virtue, as it ensures a more stable and secure future for the Zilliqa network. In conclusion, the temporary Zilliqa ZIL suspension by Binance is a standard, albeit crucial, procedure designed to support the blockchain’s evolution. This move underscores the continuous efforts within the crypto space to enhance technology, improve security, and deliver a better user experience. While a brief pause in service might be inconvenient, the long-term benefits of a more robust and efficient Zilliqa network are significant for all stakeholders. This commitment to ongoing development is what drives innovation in the cryptocurrency world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Binance suspending ZIL deposits and withdrawals?

Ripple and Cardano are set for strong gains, according to experts, with bold targets in sight. Meanwhile, all eyes are on XYZVerse as some predict explosive growth that could far outpace major coins. These fresh predictions hint at big moves ahead and keep the community guessing. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits XRP: The Digital Ripple Racing Through Global Payments XRP was built for movement. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it runs on the XRP Ledger, a public network with no boss. Payments settle in seconds, cost a small fraction of a cent, and cannot be undone or faked. No bank account is needed; a phone and internet are enough. Of the first 100 billion units, 80 billion were given to Ripple, the company that helps grow the system. Most of that sits in escrow, released bit by bit to keep supply steady. Today traders watch XRP as the market warms after a long cool spell. Bitcoin has reclaimed headlines, and many smaller coins follow its lead. Unlike Bitcoin, which can feel slow and pricey, XRP keeps fees tiny and speed high. Ethereum offers smart apps, but its congestion often spikes costs; the XRP Ledger stays light. If demand for quick cross-border deals grows, XRP could shine. The locked supply adds a layer of predictability that some investors value. Still, competition from new payment tokens is fierce, so future price moves may depend on fresh partnerships and wider use. ADA’s Green Engine: Why Cardano Could Shine This Crypto Season Cardano is a flexible and green network built for smart deals. It runs on a light system where coin holders help keep it safe, using far less power than older, energy-hungry mining chains. The network has two layers: one moves coins, the other runs apps like games, tokens, and finance tools. This split helps it aim for speeds that could reach a million moves each second. The coin that fuels it is ADA. People can pay, save, or even lock up ADA to support the chain and earn extra coins. Many traders call Cardano a quiet giant. Ethereum still rules in smart apps, but its fees can bite. ADA sends value for pennies and shows lower carbon use, two hot themes in today’s market. Big funds now look for green stories, and Cardano fits that trend. If the wider crypto scene keeps rising, coins with clear use and strong tech often jump first. ADA also lets holders lock coins and gain rewards that beat bank rates, so fewer sell. No asset is a sure bet, yet the mix of speed, eco appeal, and fresh upgrades makes ADA look bright in the current cycle. Conclusion XRP and ADA look strong for the 2025 surge, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, targets 20,000% growth through a community-led ecosystem blending meme culture and global sports passion.

Atgūšanās sekoja pēc pieprasījuma pieauguma no ASV spot ETF un makroekonomisko prognožu uzlabošanās, palīdzot BTC atgūt pagājušās nedēļas kritumu. Šis solis arī atjaunoja interesi par Bitcoin centrēto infrastruktūru. Bitcoin Hyper — Bitcoin Layer-2, kas darbojas uz Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) gandrīz tūlītējām, zemas komisijas maksas transakcijām — turpina piesaistīt pirmspārdošanas kapitālu, jo tirgotāji meklē iespējas, kas dod peļņu, kad ķēdes aktivitāte pieaug kopā ar cenu. Kāpēc BTC cena šonedēļ ir pieaugusi ETF plūsmas kļuva izteikti pozitīvas. Spot Bitcoin ETF reģistrēja spēcīgāko dienas neto ieplūdi kopš jūlija — aptuveni 757 miljonus dolāru 10. septembrī — ko vadīja Fidelity FBTC un BlackRock IBIT. Pat konservatīvāks izsekošanas rīks parāda > 740 miljonus dolāru šajā dienā, uzsverot skaidru pieprasījuma impulsu, kas samazina spot piedāvājumu. Cenas kustība atgriezās pie 114 000 dolāriem, kad šīs plūsmas sasniedza augstāko punktu. Spot Bitcoin ETFs just logged 3 straight days of inflows, $1.15B total. Wednesday alone saw $752M, the biggest since mid-July. Institutional demand is clearly coming back, giving $BTC more fuel for upside moves. pic.twitter.com/MEQswexDbF — Tom Tucker (@WhatzTheTicker) September 11, 2025 Makroekonomika veicināja riska noskaņojumu. ASV patēriņa cenu indekss augustā pieauga vairāk nekā gaidīts, bet tirgi joprojām sagaida, ka Federālā rezervju sistēma nākamnedēļ samazinās procentu likmes, un daži pat apspriež lielāku samazinājumu, jo bezdarbnieku pabalstu pieprasījumu skaits pieaudzis līdz 263 000 — augstākais rādītājs kopš 2021. gada. Atgriezās princips “sliktas ziņas ir labas ziņas”: mērenāki darba tirgus signāli, neskatoties uz stabilo inflāciju, uzturēja cerības un atbalstīja BTC. Kriptovalūtas kopumā bija noskaņotas uz risku. Globālā kriptovalūtu tirgus kapitalizācija 24 stundu laikā pieauga par ~1–2%, pievienojot nelielu atbalstu, jo populārākās kriptovalūtas un atsevišķas alternatīvās valūtas kopā ar BTC uzrādīja pieaugumu. Konteksts ir svarīgs: kad tirgus ir stabils, ETF ieplūdes skaidrāk atspoguļojas cenā. Galvenie līmeņi, struktūra un tuvākā laika riski Tehniski, buļļi vēlas pārvērst 114 000–115 000 ASV dolārus par atbalstu un pēc tam izmēģināt zemāko 120 000 ASV dolāru līmeni; ja tas neizdosies, pastāv risks, ka Bitcoin cena samazināsies līdz 111 000 ASV dolāru līmenim.Viena makroekonomiska piezīme: ja darba tirgus vājums padziļinās, bet inflācija paliek stabila, optimisms par procentu likmju samazināšanu var pārvērsties par bažām par izaugsmi, kas parasti ir nestabilāka riska aktīviem. Tas padara nākamās nedēļas Federālās rezervju sistēmas lēmumu un formulējumu īpaši svarīgu tuvākā laika virziena noteikšanai. Viena makroekonomiska piezīme: ja darba tirgus vājums padziļinās, bet inflācija paliek stabila, optimisms par procentu likmju samazināšanu var pārvērsties par bažām par izaugsmi, kas parasti ir nestabilāka riska aktīviem. Tas padara nākamās nedēļas Federālās rezervju sistēmas lēmumu un formulējumu īpaši svarīgu tuvākā laika virziena noteikšanai. Ja ETF neto ieplūdes paliks pozitīvas arī nākamajā nedēļā, mazākās pretestības ceļš būs augšupejošs, jo likviditāte spot tirgos samazināsies un ieguvēju pārdošanas spiediens paliks vājš. Dienas noslēgums virs 115 000 ASV dolāriem stiprinātu optimistisko scenāriju, savukārt atgūstot 118 000 ASV dolāru līmeni, sāktos mērens kāpums līdz 120 000 ASV dolāru līmenim. Bitcoin Hyper — BTC ātrums, zemas komisijas maksas un iepriekšpārdošanas dinamika Ar BTC atgriežoties virs 114 000 USD, uzmanības centrā ir mērogošanas tendences. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) ir Bitcoin Layer-2, kas izstrādāts uz Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) bāzes, un tā mērķis ir nodrošināt gandrīz tūlītējus darījumus un zemas komisijas maksas, vienlaikus nostiprinot norēķinus ar Bitcoin caur kanonisko tiltu. Īsumā: Bitcoin monetārā bāze, Solana stila caurlaidspēja. Augstā līmenī Bitcoin Hyper bloķē vietējo BTC bāzes ķēdē un izveido 1:1 pieprasījumu Layer-2, lai lietotāji varētu maksāt, apmainīties un mijiedarboties ar lietotnēm ātrāk par sekundi; kad viņi ir pabeiguši, viņi atgriežas L1 BTC. $HYPER žetons atbalsta tīklu, sedzot komisijas maksas, motivējot validatorus un pārvaldot atjauninājumus, savukārt SVM darbības laiks nodrošina paralēlu izpildi, ļoti zemas komisijas maksas un nobriedušus rīkus no Solana ekosistēmas. Dizains ir paredzēts reālai lietošanai (mikromaksājumi, BTC nodrošināts DeFi n ķēdes spēles), kas L1 būtu neekonomiski. Ja ETF virzītas plūsmas uztur BTC aktīvu, projekti, kas padara Bitcoin ātrāku un lētāku, būtu pirmie, kas gūtu labumu.

Despite $120M in large wallet sales, XRP holds firm above $3, showing steady demand. RSI signals rising strength as the price holds key levels; the next breakout zone sits near $3.65. Weekly Structure Breaks XRP has moved through a key weekly resistance level, breaking above a long-standing descending trendline, according to Dark Defender. This structure had capped the price advances for months. The breakout marks the completion of a corrective phase that began earlier this year, mapped out by a five-leg A-B-C-D-E pattern on the chart. #XRP is breaking the initial weekly resistance! pic.twitter.com/HxG1vx3nOq — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) September 11, 2025 Meanwhile, the move sets the stage for a potential upward trend . Based on Elliott Wave analysis, the first wave appears to be completed, and the second has pulled back into a common retracement zone between $2.65 and $2.86. These levels match the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracements, often used to identify reversal zones before a third wave move. XRP was priced at $3.07 at press time, up 2% over the last 24 hours and 9% over the past week. Trading volume stands near $6 billion. Notably, the RSI has formed a bullish divergence, where the price made a lower low while the RSI moved higher. This type of setup often suggests that momentum is shifting. With that, attention is turning to the next key resistance around $3.65, followed by projected targets at $4.39 and $5.85, based on standard Fibonacci extensions. Daily and Intraday Outlook Daily technical analysis suggests that XRP has closed above $3.0452, a short-term resistance level. Crypto analyst Dark Defender believes a breakout from this point may provide momentum toward the $3.65 mark. This level is also being monitored by other traders as a near-term target. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined two possible paths: “Break $3.05 and surge $3.6,” or “Retrace to $2.8, break $2.9, and surge to $3.6.” Both scenarios point toward $3.60 as a key target if the market holds current strength or finds support on any short-term dip. Traders remain cautious but are positioning around these levels, with a focus on clear breakouts for new entries. The broader market, especially Bitcoin, is expected to guide short-term sentiment. Whale Activity and Market Reaction Whale wallets reportedly offloaded over $120 million worth of XRP in a 24-hour period. While this kind of activity can trigger fear among smaller holders, the price has remained stable. XRP held the $3 level and climbed toward $3.10 shortly after. Consequently, the move shows buyers are still active despite the sell-off. The market did not see the kind of reaction that often follows large wallet exits. This behavior suggests strength and steady demand at current levels.

This ease of access makes it stand out in the growing crypto presale list. Key details include a presale price of $0.006389, with over 9 million tokens already sold and more than 71,000 USDT raised. Buyers using the code GGS-30 receive 30% more presale tokens. $GGs offers multiple utilities that extend beyond simple speculation. Players can stake, participate in community-driven events, and even trade using the upcoming $GGs bot. The project illustrates how token presales can link cultural identity with practical use in Web3. USDT Raised: 71,049.52 $GGs Sold: 9,031,378.9 Price: 1 $GGs = $0.006389 These figures highlight why many see Based Eggman as a contender for the best crypto presale to buy right now. PEPE: Market Sentiment Around the Frog Icon PEPE has established itself as one of the most recognizable meme coins, often acting as a barometer for memecoin enthusiasm. This week, PEPE reclaimed the $0.00001000 psychological level with a modest 2% rise. Technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook. Resistance looms at the 50-day EMA of $0.00001062, while the 100-day and 200-day EMAs remain in decline. The RSI, however, crossed above 53, hinting at a shift in buying momentum. Similarly, the MACD’s crossover on Sunday extends the uptrend, adding weight to the view of increased trading interest. Although not part of the current presale crypto projects, PEPE remains an important reference point. Its market moves show how meme-driven assets continue to influence sentiment, even as new token presales like $GGs enter the spotlight. Conclusion: Where Memes and Presales Converge The landscape of token presales and meme culture shows how fast Web3 can adapt to community-driven ideas. Based Eggman ($GGs) positions itself within the growing demand for presale crypto tokens, offering an ecosystem that connects play, social interaction, and trading. PEPE, while not part of new crypto presales, reminds the market of the cultural power that memes continue to hold. Together, they illustrate two different but connected stories: one focused on presale crypto projects looking to establish ecosystems, and another grounded in established community momentum. For anyone exploring the crypto presale 2025 environment, these examples provide insight into how presale tokens and meme coins shape the future of participation. The lesson is clear: memes and presales are no longer separate worlds but interwoven narratives that define how communities interact with crypto today.

Key Takeaways: CleanCore has acquired over 500 million DOGE, halfway to its 1 billion-token goal. The company aims to position Dogecoin as a strategic reserve asset and payment rail. ZONE stock rebounded after a $175M raise, while DOGE gained 23% this week. The company disclosed on Thursday that it had purchased $130 million worth of DOGE, following a 285.42 million token buy earlier in the week. CleanCore Aims to Cement DOGE as a Reserve Asset The rapid accumulation reflects a deliberate strategy to position DOGE as a strategic reserve asset. “Crossing the 500 million DOGE threshold demonstrates the speed and scale at which ZONE is executing its treasury strategy,” said Marco Margiotta, CleanCore’s chief investment officer and also CEO of House of Doge, a commercial partner of the Dogecoin Foundation. CleanCore was the first publicly listed firm to announce a formal Dogecoin treasury strategy, working in partnership with both the Dogecoin Foundation and House of Doge. The company is aiming to complete its 1 billion DOGE target within 30 days. Margiotta said the broader goal is to promote DOGE’s use across payments, tokenization, and global remittance products. Earlier this month, CleanCore raised $175 million via private placement to fund its DOGE purchases. The news initially triggered a 60% plunge in ZONE stock, though the company completed the raise by September 5. As of Thursday’s close, ZONE shares traded at $3.98, before jumping 11.81% in after-hours trading to $4.45. The stock is still up over 200% year-to-date. DOGE itself has gained nearly 23% over the past week, according to CoinGecko, adding fuel to CleanCore’s aggressive treasury expansion. Meanwhile, the launch of the Rex-Osprey Doge ETF (DOJE), originally scheduled for Thursday, has been postponed. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the fund will now likely go live next week, though an exact date remains unconfirmed. Update Part 3: Another delay. Launching next week. Mid week. Prob Thur. https://t.co/Lzk2pCVo0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 11, 2025 Strategy Tops Corporate Bitcoin Holdings with 636,505 BTC Michael Saylor’s Strategy now holds 636,505 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin by a wide margin. Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings remains in second with 52,477 BTC, after adding 705 BTC in August. But new entrants are gaining ground. XXI, founded by Strike CEO Jack Mallers, has amassed 43,514 BTC , while the Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company holds 30,021 BTC. Other major players include crypto exchange Bullish (24,000 BTC), Metaplanet (20,000 BTC) , and publicly listed names like Riot Platforms, Trump Media & Technology Group, CleanSpark, and Coinbase. This wave of accumulation has fueled speculation around a supply shock. With just 5.2% of Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply left to be mined, continued corporate demand could drive prices even higher. Some firms are aiming much higher. Japan’s Metaplanet and U.S.-based Semler Scientific have set targets of 210,000 BTC and 105,000 BTC by 2027, ten to twenty times their current holdings. Outside the US, 120 public companies now hold Bitcoin. Canada, the UK, Hong Kong, Mexico, South Africa, and Bahrain are among the countries where corporate BTC ownership is growing.

51590545,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82877,1757663103,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Market Strategist Has Major XRP News for Holders,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-has-major-xrp-news-for-holders/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto shared a detailed update on XRP’s short-term outlook in a recent video posted with the message “XRP HOLDERS I GOT MAJOR XRP NEWS”. According to Steph, XRP has broken out of a falling wedge pattern and has now closed three consecutive daily candles above the trend line, which he views as a bullish signal. He outlined near-term price targets at $3.60, $4.00, and $4.64, while also suggesting the possibility of further gains if momentum continues. On a three-day line chart, Steph pointed out that the stochastic RSI is moving upward from oversold conditions. He noted that in the past few months, each time this indicator moved out of oversold territory, XRP experienced significant rallies. In addition, He observed that the Bollinger Bands are currently in a tight squeeze. Historically, such squeezes have preceded major moves, which He interprets as another bullish indicator for the near term. #XRP HOLDERS I GOT MAJOR XRP NEWS!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/g0DviZkMZH — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 10, 2025 CPI release and possible market impact Steph also discussed the upcoming consumer price index release, explaining its relevance for XRP price action. He recalled that previous CPI announcements led to notable declines in June, July, and August, with drops of around 18%, 10%, and nearly 20% respectively. Despite this pattern, He suggested that the probability now favors a rally rather than another decline. Her reasoning is based on two factors. First, XRP has already been trading in a corrective structure for over 50 days. Second, inflation appears to be under control, which raises the chance that the CPI report could come in better than expected. He explained that if this happens, XRP could see a positive reaction instead of repeating the sharp declines associated with earlier CPI releases. Exchange reserve inflows raise caution One of the most notable parts of Steph’s update focused on on-chain data from major exchanges. On September 1, exchange reserves for XRP rose sharply in a synchronized move across multiple platforms. He highlighted Binance in particular, where reserves jumped by over 610 million XRP, moving from 2.9 billion to 3.5 billion in a short period. Steph described this increase as highly unusual, both for its speed and its scale, calling it one of the largest coordinated XRP inflows He has ever seen. He explained that typically, reserves build gradually rather than in sudden spikes. While large inflows are often interpreted as bearish since they may indicate preparation for selling, He acknowledged that they could also represent strategic positioning by exchanges or market makers. Even so, he said that the size of this inflow is difficult to ignore and could point to short-term sell pressure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cycle positioning and potential risks Looking beyond short-term moves, Steph also placed XRP within the broader market cycle. He said the market appears closer to the end of the current bull run rather than the beginning, though He still expects further price gains in the coming months. He cautioned that a bearish divergence is forming, where the RSI is making lower highs while price continues to climb. According to her, this reflects momentum loss similar to what occurred in the 2020–2021 cycle, which eventually led to a broader correction. He also referred to the altcoin season index, currently at 71 and approaching 75. Based on historical data, He explained that sharp pullbacks across altcoins have often followed readings above 75. Because of this, He advised that while XRP may rally toward the $4 to $5 range, traders should closely monitor market conditions once those levels are reached. While XRP’s upside targets remain in focus, Steph noted that conditions suggest traders should remain cautious as XRP approaches higher levels in the current cycle.

However, the regular weekly event does not currently point at higher volatility. The weekly Deribit options expiry points to a less eventful weekend. Usually, the Friday expiry brings at least somewhat increased volatility, potentially sparking weekend rallies. This time around, the weekly options expiry signals a slightly bearish attitude. A total of $3.4B in open interest was set to expire on Friday, with a predominance of put options. The put/call ratio for BTC expanded to 1.3, signaling a more marked bearish attitude compared to previous weeks. Despite the imminent Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, implied volatility in the options market remains relatively stable, even showing a slight decline.

The market is already taking into account the potential for a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed, not signaling any expectations for unexpected rallies. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, a Fed price cut was most probably priced into the crypto market. During the weekly options expiry, put calls dominated, signaling emerging bearish expectations for September. | Source: CoinGlass. The other weekly events until the end of September have lower notional value. At the end of the month, around $17.7B in options are set to expire, with a predominance of call options. BTC still strong despite altcoin season The crypto fear and greed index took a few steps back, but is still in ‘greed’ territory. BTC dominance slid to 55.9% as altcoins took over with outsized pumps. Despite this, BTC still shows signs of recovery, alongside ETH. Ahead of the options expiry, BTC traded at $115,400, while ETH rallied to $4,549.37. Altcoins have more dramatic rallies, but all hinge on the solid performance of BTC and ETH. BTC open interest on all crypto exchanges is above $41B ahead of the weekend, with ETH open interest recovering above $29B. On Hyperliquid, BTC open interest has inched up again to $3.9B, while ETH reached $2.9B. BTC next step: $120K or back to $110K? Based on derivative trading, BTC is locked in a range where the most probable price moves may be limited between $111,000 and $116,000. Open interest has accrued for short positions all the way up to $120,000, but the bulk of positions is at a lower range, so a short squeeze to $120,000 is less probable. On the downside, BTC may dip to $111,000, attacking over $75B in long positions. In the past 24 hours, BTC already saw over $82M in short liquidations. The surprise ETH rally led to $92M in liquidations for the past day, as the crypto market still shows exuberance. After a month of price records, crypto assets are setting up for one of the historically slow months. This time around, the market suffers smaller drawdowns, but whales regularly take profits to roll over into better positions. For now, the BTC bull market is seen as intact, with positive macro conditions. In the short term, the market can fluctuate and cause liquidations. At the same time, volatility has fallen near an all-time low of 1.12%, with fewer events to cause cascading capitulation. Demand for spot BTC is also at an all-time peak, with more coins locked away from the market into corporate treasuries. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A recent and significant development comes from Upbit, a leading South Korean crypto exchange, which has issued an important notice regarding POKT deposits and withdrawals . This temporary suspension is set to impact users of Pocket Network tokens, and understanding the details is key for managing your digital assets effectively. What’s Happening with POKT Deposits and Withdrawals on Upbit? Upbit officially announced a temporary halt to all deposit and withdrawal services for Pocket Network (POKT) tokens. This suspension began promptly at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 16. The primary reason, as stated by the exchange, is an upcoming network upgrade for Pocket Network. Suspending services for a specific token is a precautionary measure. It ensures the safety and integrity of user funds during significant network changes. This temporary pause affects all users who hold POKT on the Upbit platform or wish to transact with it. Start Date: September 16, 9:00 a.m. UTC Affected Service: POKT deposits and withdrawals Reason: Pocket Network’s upcoming network upgrade Why the Pause? Understanding Pocket Network’s Upgrade Pocket Network (POKT) is a decentralized infrastructure protocol. It provides Web3 applications with cost-efficient access to blockchain data. Network upgrades are vital, often introducing new features, improving scalability, or enhancing security. Processing POKT deposits and withdrawals during such a critical period could lead to issues like lost transactions or incorrect balances. Suspending services helps prevent these problems. It allows the exchange to monitor the upgrade, ensure system compatibility, and verify stability before resuming operations. What Does This Mean for Your POKT Holdings? If you hold POKT tokens on Upbit, your assets remain secure. The suspension only affects moving POKT in or out of the platform. You can still view your balance and, usually, trade POKT within the exchange if trading services are not also paused. It’s important to: Stay Informed: Regularly check Upbit’s official announcements for updates on when POKT deposits and withdrawals will resume. Avoid Transfers: Do not attempt to deposit or withdraw POKT during the suspension. Transactions may be lost or delayed. Plan Ahead: Adjust any immediate plans to move POKT until services are reinstated. This situation highlights the importance of following official communication channels from both the exchange and the project team. Navigating Exchange Announcements: Key Takeaways In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, such announcements are common. Network upgrades and maintenance frequently lead to temporary service interruptions. For users, proactive engagement with official sources is always the best approach. When you encounter a notice about suspended POKT deposits and withdrawals or any other token, consider these points: Verify the Source: Always confirm announcements come directly from the official exchange or verified social media. Understand the Reason: Knowing why a service is suspended helps you gauge its potential duration and impact. Follow Instructions: Adhere to any specific guidelines provided by the exchange during the suspension. Be Patient: These suspensions are typically temporary and for the long-term benefit of network stability and security. Your diligence ensures you remain prepared and your assets stay safe. The temporary suspension of POKT deposits and withdrawals by Upbit is a standard procedure in response to Pocket Network’s upcoming upgrade. While it might cause minor inconvenience, it underscores the exchange’s commitment to asset security and operational integrity. Users are encouraged to monitor Upbit’s official channels for updates and to exercise caution when dealing with their POKT tokens during this period. Your understanding and patience contribute to a safer crypto environment for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions About POKT Suspension Q1: Why did Upbit suspend POKT deposits and withdrawals? A1: Due to an upcoming network upgrade for Pocket Network (POKT). This ensures asset safety during protocol changes. Q2: When did the suspension begin? A2: The suspension started at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 16. Q3: Are my POKT tokens safe on Upbit? A3: Yes, your POKT tokens held on Upbit remain secure. Only deposits and withdrawals are affected.

Traders are already speculating about which tokens may deliver the most significant returns, and it is not just the usual suspects in the spotlight. While names like Cardano and Dogecoin continue to draw interest, newer projects like Little Pepe are turning heads with their performance and growing community. With its presale now in stage 12 and early buyers already sitting on 110% gains, many investors believe it has the potential to rally over 800% once Bitcoin kicks off its next big move. Cardano (ADA): Built on patience and progress Cardano ADA has always been known for playing the long game. The ADA trades around $0.82 after slipping about 2% on the last day and nearly 6% on the past week. The latest Plomin upgrade that shifts governance into a more decentralized structure has positioned Cardano as a network built for the future rather than quick wins. Analysts watching the charts suggest ADA may be building toward a breakout if Bitcoin takes the lead. Some forecasts indicate that ADA may reclaim the $3 zone if the broader market experiences a resurgence. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still fueled by culture Dogecoin DOGE has been around long enough to prove that community culture can keep a coin alive through any cycle. DOGE is trading near $0.216 with daily trading volumes topping $1.5 billion. It has been consolidating in a tight range with resistance forming around $0.24. If Bitcoin climbs toward $140,000, there is every reason to believe DOGE could break out of its range and ride the wave upward. While an 800% move would require a substantial narrative shift, the possibility is never far away with Dogecoin. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme energy with structure Among the tokens that could truly surprise the market stands Little Pepe . The presale has already raised over $24.5 million, with over 15.2 billion tokens sold out of the 15.75 billion allocated for stage 12. Tokens are selling for $0.0021; this stage is 97% filled at the time of writing. Early presale buyers from stage 1 are up 110% since the starting price of $0.0010, and even investors coming in now still have a clear 45% upside before launch at $0.0030. Little Pepe has gone beyond being another meme coin. It is listed on CoinMarketCap, has passed a Certik audit, and has managed to trend above DOGE and PEPE in ChatGPT memecoin questions between June and August 2025. That level of attention is not just numbers on a chart; it reflects real cultural relevance. Add the $777k giveaway, and the mix of humor, transparency, and utility makes LILPEPE one of the strongest candidates for outsized gains. If Bitcoin does climb to $140,000, this project has the foundation to deliver a rally that could reach or exceed 800%. Kaspa (KAS): Speed and community Kaspa KAS is trading near $0.083 after dipping slightly over the past week. Known for its fast block confirmation and innovative blockDAG technology, Kaspa has built a loyal developer community that believes in the network’s scalability. With Bitcoin leading, KAS could rally hard from its current levels as new capital flows into high-performance blockchains. Algorand (ALGO): Utility backed by science Algorand ALGO is priced around $0.23, and trading volumes show healthy activity despite 10% off its weekly highs. ALGO has always been marketed as a blockchain, which was born from academic research, with low-cost smart contracts and dApp development at its core. The bigger picture Bitcoin targeting $140,000 sets the tone for altcoins to follow. Cardano offers stability, Dogecoin offers culture, Kaspa offers speed, Algorand offers academic rigor, and VeChain offers enterprise focus. Yet the token standing out right now is Little Pepe. Its presale success, audit approval, cultural traction, and structured growth make it a strong contender for massive returns. Early-stage investors have already doubled their money; current buyers still have room to grow before the launch price. If Bitcoin truly pushes to $140,000, this project has the potential to deliver the kind of 800% rally that crypto traders dream about.

This marks a significant turnaround for the second-largest cryptocurrency after months of stagnation. Factors Behind ETH’s Surge A recent report from crypto bank Sygnum reveals that ETH’s price has surged dramatically, reaching all-time highs in August and outpacing Bitcoin in relative performance. According to the bank, several factors have contributed to this renewed bullish sentiment. Notably, the Pectra upgrade has addressed critical technical issues within the Ethereum ecosystem, enhancing its infrastructure. Related Reading: Ripple Quietly Shifts 15M XRP Post-SEC Win: Whales React as Price Slips The upgrade has expanded the staking cap from 32 to 2048 ETH, and has spiked ETH staking. This boost coincided with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarifying that protocol staking activities do not qualify as security offerings. Combined with increased stablecoin activity and the launch of tokenized securities on the Ethereum blockchain, the upgrade has further bolstered demand for ETH tokens, resulting in a new all-time high near the $5,000 mark. The bank also highlights record inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasury purchases, which mimic strategies employed with Bitcoin (BTC), as playing a significant role in driving up demand. Ethereum Faces Looming Supply Squeeze As institutional interest in Ethereum grows, the liquid supply of ETH on crypto exchanges has begun to dwindle, the report shows. Sygnum suggests that this trend raises the possibility of a supply crunch, which could lead to a significant price increase if demand continues to rise. With significant inflows into ETFs and corporate acquisitions, reserves held on exchanges have dipped to cycle lows, compounding the likelihood of a supply shock. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals What XRP Price Will Be If Ethereum Hits $25,000 Moreover, recent legislative developments in the US, including the passage of the GENIUS and CLARITY acts, have further provided clarity around stablecoins, opening doors for institutional offerings where Ethereum already leads in stablecoin and tokenization activities. Looking ahead, Ethereum appears poised for a bright future. The bank notes that with its technical upgrades and growing institutional interest, ETH’s price is well-positioned to capture a significant share of anticipated stablecoin issuance and institutional adoption trends. As liquid Ethereum reserves on exchanges dwindle and demand continues to surge, the potential for a supply squeeze looms, presenting a new opportunity for investors to capitalize on the expected new uptrend for the token. When writing, ETH trades at $4,420, surging nearly 3% in the 24 hour time frame and 87% year-to-date. With the broader market correction seen over the past week, the Ethereum price remains 10.6% below all-time high levels.

The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty.

Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0000092, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000816. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe up today? Pepe’s price strong accumulation around recent lows. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra day high of $0.000011. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000015 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A significant regulatory development occurred with PEPE’s inclusion in Indonesia’s approved cryptocurrency list on September 1, 2025. PT Central Finansial X (CFX), Indonesia’s first crypto exchange licensed by the Financial Services Authority (OJK), officially designated 1,444 crypto assets as legally tradable in Indonesia, including popular meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). PEPE Price Prediction September 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) September 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities.

Major exchange Coinbase has taken a bold step, asking a U.S. federal court to intervene and order the recovery of deleted communications. Specifically, Coinbase is seeking to retrieve deleted Coinbase SEC texts from former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler. This move underscores the ongoing tension between crypto innovators and regulatory bodies, highlighting the critical need for transparency in government dealings. Why Are These Coinbase SEC Texts So Crucial? This legal request isn’t just about a few messages; it’s about shedding light on how crypto regulations were shaped. According to reports from The Block, the SEC reportedly deleted a full year’s worth of text messages from Chairman Gensler. These crucial communications span from October 2022 to September 2023. The agency cited a new policy implemented in 2023 as the reason for this deletion. However, Coinbase views this as a significant obstacle to understanding regulatory decisions. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, has voiced strong concerns. He explained that Coinbase has been actively requesting internal SEC communications regarding crypto regulation for years. Discovering that a substantial portion of this information was reportedly destroyed has naturally raised red flags. The company believes these Coinbase SEC texts could contain vital context for the SEC’s approach to the digital asset space. What is Coinbase Asking the Court to Do About These Texts? Coinbase is not just making a simple request; they are pursuing a multi-pronged legal strategy to ensure accountability and retrieve the missing data. The exchange is asking the federal court for several key actions: Expedited Discovery: This means a faster-than-usual process to gather evidence. Coinbase wants to quickly get to the bottom of why these messages were deleted and what they contained. Sanctions Against the SEC: Sanctions are penalties imposed for misconduct during a lawsuit. Coinbase believes the alleged destruction of records warrants such measures. Submission of Relevant Text Messages: The ultimate goal is to compel the SEC to submit all pertinent text messages. This is crucial not only for the current case but also to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The implications of these deleted Coinbase SEC texts are far-reaching. The crypto industry often criticizes the SEC for a perceived lack of clear guidance and a ""regulation by enforcement"" approach. If internal communications related to policy-making are not preserved, it further complicates efforts to understand the basis for these regulatory actions. This legal battle highlights the growing demand for transparency from government agencies overseeing rapidly evolving sectors like cryptocurrency. How Do Deleted Coinbase SEC Texts Impact Trust and Regulation? The dispute over the deleted Coinbase SEC texts could have significant ramifications for the future of crypto regulation. Transparency and clear communication are foundational for building trust between regulators and the regulated entities. When key communications are deleted, it can erode that trust and lead to suspicions about the fairness and impartiality of regulatory processes. This situation also brings to light the challenges of digital record-keeping within government agencies. As more official communication shifts to digital platforms, robust policies for retention and disclosure become paramount. The SEC’s new policy, cited for the deletions, will likely face intense scrutiny in court. The outcome of Coinbase’s request could set a precedent for how government agencies handle digital communications related to emerging technologies. For market participants, this case reinforces the need for vigilance. It also emphasizes the importance of legal challenges in shaping the regulatory landscape. A favorable ruling for Coinbase could force greater transparency from the SEC and potentially lead to clearer, more predictable rules for the crypto industry. The legal tussle initiated by Coinbase to recover deleted Coinbase SEC texts from former Chairman Gensler is more than just a procedural request. It represents a critical juncture in the ongoing dialogue between the crypto industry and its regulators. The outcome will not only impact Coinbase’s specific legal battles but could also influence future standards for transparency and accountability within government agencies dealing with digital assets. As the crypto space matures, the demand for clear, consistent, and transparent regulation will only grow louder. This case serves as a powerful reminder of the industry’s commitment to pushing for a more open and equitable regulatory environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is Coinbase requesting from the court? A1: Coinbase is asking a U.S. federal court to order the recovery and disclosure of deleted text messages from former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, along with expedited discovery and potential sanctions against the SEC. Q2: Why are these deleted texts considered significant? A2: These texts are crucial because they could provide vital context and insights into the SEC’s internal discussions and decision-making processes regarding crypto regulation, which Coinbase believes were unfairly opaque. Q3: What reason did the SEC give for deleting the texts? A3: The SEC cited a new policy implemented in 2023 as the reason for deleting one year’s worth of messages from Chairman Gensler, specifically between October 2022 and September 2023. Q4: Who is Gary Gensler in this context? A4: Gary Gensler is the former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman whose deleted text messages are at the center of Coinbase’s legal request. Q5: What are the potential broader implications of this legal action for crypto regulation? A5: This case could set a precedent for transparency and accountability from government agencies regarding digital communications. A favorable outcome for Coinbase might lead to clearer, more predictable regulatory standards for the crypto industry and foster greater trust.
