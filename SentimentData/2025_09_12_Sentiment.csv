The cryptocurrency market’s total cap has risen by 1.7%, to $4.057 trillion, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) posting 1.5% and 2.2% gains, respectively. Yet other tokens have outpaced the market by a wide margin today, including Avalanche (AVAX), which is up by 9% in the past 24 hours. We take a closer look at AVAX in this article, along with XRP and Solana (SOL), both of which also have the potential for big gains in the near future. Crypto Price Prediction Today 11 September – XRP, Solana, Avalanche XRP ($XRP): Ripple Partnerships and ETF Hopes Can Push Altcoin Higher The market’s third-biggest altcoin, XRP, has risen to $3.02 today, marking a 2% increase in 24 hours and a 6% increase in the last seven days. This indicates rising momentum, yet what’s encouraging is that XRP remains down by 4% in the past month, implying that it’s still moving up from an oversold position. It therefore has more gains in the store in the coming days and weeks, and not just because the wider market is recovering. Ripple is a major fundamental reason for its bullish prospects, with the firm this week signing a partnership with Spanish bank BBVA , for which it will provide custody services. This is another example of how Ripple has been growing more proactively since the end of its legal battle with Ripple, and it sets the stage for big XRP price gains later in the year. Source: TradingView And now is very good time to enter XRP, given that it has begun rising again but is still some way off an overbought position. Its relative strength index (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) both bottomed out a week or so ago, and are now on a climb towards higher levels. As such, the XRP price could return to $3.50 in the next few weeks, particularly if the FOMC does cut rates on September 16-17. And if the SEC approves any of the numerous XRP ETF applications, then the XRP price could rise even higher, potentially topping $5 by the end of the year. Solana ($SOL): Network Growth Prepares Ground for Big End-of-Year Surge The past few days and weeks have been kind to Solana, now up by 2.5% in 24 hours, 8.5% in a week, and28% in a month. As with XRP, it has its fundamentals to thank for its success, with Solana now comfortably the second-biggest layer-one network in terms of total value locked in . This testifies to increased adoption, yet it could attract even more usage if its own ETF applications secure approval later in the year. Bloomberg analysts give the various SOL ETFs—including from the likes of Grayscale, VanEck, Canary and Franklin— a 95% chance of approval . When combined with Solana’s pre-existing growth as a platform, this results in a hugely bullish crypto price prediction for SOL. Its chart today highlights its recent momentum and how this is likely to carry over into Q4. Source: TradingView Its indicators suggest that it’s close to hitting a top, with its RSI rising above 60 and about to climb over 70. This would normally be a warning sign, yet SOL is still on the way up after a quiet August, while the possibility of rate cuts next week could give it further fuel. Because of this, the Solana price could return to $250 by the end of the month, while it could rally towards $400 or higher by late December. Avalanche ($AVAX): Treasury Firm News Could Push Altcoin Towards Highs At $28.95, AVAX has posted an 8% increase today, while it’s also up by an impressive 17% in a week and by 26% in a month. This makes it one of the best-performing major tokens across these timeframes, and analysts have noted that it has just broken out of a 213-day consolidation . This could mean that it’s about to rally strongly over the coming weeks, buoyed by the news that it’s about to raise $1 billion for two AVAX treasury firms . Taken with the fact that there are two AVAX ETFs waiting for approval from the SEC, these treasury firms could be the factor that sends the Avalanche price flying. Its chart today shows that it has broken out of a bullish pennant, while its indicators are closing in on hitting a top. In view of this, we may see a slight correction over the weekend, but the AVAX price could pick up again as and when the FOMC cuts rates next week. In such a context, it could return to $50 by the end of October, while ETF approvals could send it towards $100 in December. Bitcoin Hyper: L2 Network Crosses $15 Million Milestone The crypto price prediction for these three coins looks really good, but traders may also want to diversify into newer tokens, since these can enjoy market-beating gains. This is something that does happen with presale coins, which can generate lots of momentum during their sales, and then rally big once they list. One example hoping to do just that is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a layer-two project that has now raised $15 million in its hugely popular sale. There's no beating this team. Bitcoin + $HYPER = The fastest $BTC L2 in History. https://t.co/yKdkqK0ACT pic.twitter.com/8uGAiDl1Xf — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 11, 2025 This makes Bitcoin Hyper’s one of the biggest presales of the year, which is perhaps no surprise, given its plans to launch Bitcoin’s first true layer-two network. As an L2 for Bitcoin, its platform will provide BTC holders with faster speeds and lower fees, making use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups to provide superior scalability and security. Users can deposit their BTC with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, receiving a commensurate quantity of HYPER for use on the L2. Its long-term plan is to become an important DeFi ecosystem for Bitcoin holders, enabling them to tap into BTC’s value in order to make more profit. HYPER will have a max supply of 21 billion tokens, with holders able to stake it for a passive income. They can buy it now, before it lists, by visiting the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a suitable wallet. HYPER is currently selling for $0.012895, although this will continue to rise for the sale’s duration.

Below, we break down what’s driving the hype around these tokens and why people are recognizing them as some of the most compelling candidates for possible 100x appreciation in the coming months and years. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Fans Flash Buy Signals as Dogecoin’s Degen Cousin Crosses $2 Million Threshold Today A fresh challenger to Dogecoin has arrived with its own unique flavor: Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , marketed as the beefed-up cousin of the original meme crypto. Dogecoin’s massive valuation now makes its price swings more closely tied to blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While DOGE still carries meme status, its wild volatility has eased since the frenzy of 2021. For investors chasing riskier meme projects with explosive potential, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is quickly gaining recognition, already drawing in over $2 million just weeks after its debut. Built as an ERC-20 token, MAXI leans heavily into community engagement. Its developers are growing Telegram and Discord channels, complete with trading contests and collaborative events designed to build loyalty. Out of a capped supply of 150.24 billion tokens, a quarter is allocated to a “Maxi Fund” for marketing and partnerships. Holders can also stake MAXI, with annual yields reaching up to 157% (though these will inevitably adjust as more users join). The token’s presale price is currently $0.0002565, set to increase slightly within a few hours as the presale moves to its next funding round. Purchases can be made directly through the Maxi Doge site using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet . Follow Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages. Visit the Official Website Here PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): A Next-Gen Presale Crypto Coin Blending Meme Culture with Mine-to-Earn, Already Secures $1M One of the newest ERC-20 meme coin projects to hit the scene, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , has generated buzz quickly thanks to its creative model and early fundraising success. Launched just two weeks ago, the presale has already pulled in nearly $1 million, clear evidence of mounting interest. PEPENODE bills itself as the first “mine-to-earn” crypto. Rather than sticking to conventional staking, it gamifies the process by letting users construct virtual mining nodes. The more nodes a holder builds with PEPENODE tokens, the higher their rewards, creating a system that encourages both accumulation and active participation. This inventive take on staking could help sustain demand and community activity long-term. Presale stakers can currently earn up to 1,398% APY, though rates will decrease as more investors join the pool — meaning early movers capture the best returns. Right now, tokens are priced at $0.0010533 via the PEPENODE website, with incremental increases every few days until the presale ends. Follow PEPENODE on X and Telegram for updates. Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE): A Trader-Centric Meme Coin you can Buy Today for Only $0.001 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) , a meme coin designed with a strong trading community focus, launched earlier this year on Ethereum after a $74 million ICO made it one of the most successful meme coin presales ever. Now it’s preparing to roll out on Solana. Since late May, the Ethereum-based token has surged over 250%. Earlier this week, WEPE’s intraday performance outpaced crypto rivals like Shiba Inu ($SHIB) and Pepe ($PEPE), although today it has now dipped 3% in a slight correction. Wall Street Pepe’s premise is straightforward: blend meme coin energy with a trading-focused ecosystem. Holders gain entry into community-driven spaces that share signals, insights, and strategy-building tools. The Solana migration won’t change overall supply but introduces a bullish mechanism: every WEPE purchased on Solana triggers a 1:1 burn of the Ethereum-based token, ensuring supply balance while broadening circulation. This move also brings the advantages of Solana’s fast transactions, low fees, and scalability, along with access to a wider investor base. Currently, Solana-based WEPE is available to buy today for $0.001 via the official website and will list on exchanges shortly. Follow Wall Street Pepe on X and Telegram for updates.

While established titans like Solana and Ripple present compelling cases, Layer Brett is quietly capturing attention for its explosive growth formula. This intense market debate pits institutional momentum against regulatory clarity and groundbreaking innovation. Solana ‘s big league backing: Can institutional favor fuel a 30x surge? Solana (SOL) has become a darling of institutional capital, with significant backing from major crypto players and bullish analyst sentiment branding it a top long-term play. This smart money influx suggests its perceived stability and technological prowess. However, the sheer scale of the Solana ecosystem presents a significant hurdle for a 30x rally in just a few months. Furthermore, recent security challenges, including malware attacks and exploits within the Solana ecosystem, raise questions about its short-term vulnerabilities. For all its strengths, the path to a 30x increase for SOL is a monumental task, and the analyst consensus suggests it’s a solid cornerstone for the 2025 crypto bull run instead of a coin ready for an immediate blast-off. The institutional support for Solana is clear, but exponential growth is another matter entirely. Ripple ‘s new dawn: Post-sec clarity and the road to recovery For years, the looming SEC case has cast a long shadow over Ripple (XRP). With that regulatory uncertainty now largely resolved, many believe XRP is finally free to perform. This newfound clarity, combined with a major new custody partnership, signals a bright future for Ripple and its adoption. Technical indicators for XRP may be turning bullish, suggesting upward momentum is building. Still, the wider market is grappling with intense sell-offs from crypto whales, and that kind of pressure could easily suppress a rapid, parabolic surge for an asset as large as Ripple. For XRP to achieve a 30x rally, it must overcome this headwind and its history of price consolidation. While Ripple is a key player, a 30-fold jump before December seems ambitious. The outlier’s advantage: Why Layer Brett ‘s formula is built for explosive growth While Solana and Ripple navigate the challenges of their scale, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) presents a different kind of opportunity that has crypto analyst circles buzzing. Operating as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Layer Brett combines the viral energy of a memecoin with tangible blockchain utility. This positions it to become a low-cap gem with breakout potential. The core advantage lies in its starting point: the crypto presale. Currently priced at just $0.0055 and having already raised over $3.3 million, $LBRETT has the low market cap necessary for a genuine 30x rally. It isn’t weighed down by the inertia of a multi-billion dollar valuation. This meme token is built on an advanced Layer 2 blockchain, offering the fast, low-cost transactions that users demand. Early backers are not just buying a token; they are securing a position in a burgeoning ecosystem with the chance to stake their $LBRETT for an impressive 782% APY. Conclusion: The verdict on the 30x contender So which asset are analysts tipping for a 30x rally? While Solana and Ripple are titans with undeniable long-term potential, their colossal market caps make such explosive short-term growth a near-impossibility. The clear candidate for a parabolic move is Layer Brett. Its position in a high-demand crypto presale , combined with a powerful blend of memecoin culture and potent Ethereum Layer 2 technology, creates the perfect storm for exponential gains. For those seeking the next 100x altcoin, the opportunity to enter a project like $LBRETT at its ground floor is a rare event that should not be overlooked. Connect your wallet and buy in today.

The White House is pushing for a decision by Monday, one day before the Federal Reserve meets to decide on interest rates, and just days after a district judge blocked Trump’s attempt to remove Cook from her post. The request, filed by the Justice Department on Trump’s behalf, was sent to a three-judge panel and demands an emergency stay on U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb’s ruling. Cobb had previously blocked the president from carrying out the firing, saying Trump “likely” lacked proper cause under the Federal Reserve Act and violated Cook’s due process rights when he attempted to oust her through a social media post. The court’s stay would let the firing take effect before Trump’s full appeal is even heard. The administration’s filing said : “Even with the Federal Reserve’s unique structure and history, its governors are subject to removal for cause, and the president’s actions to remove Cook based on her misconduct should strengthen, not diminish, the Federal Reserve’s integrity.” That’s the position Trump is taking to justify the firing, and now he wants the courts to act fast. Justice Department tells court the clock is ticking The Fed’s board is scheduled to begin its rate policy meeting Tuesday. As it stands, Lisa can still participate, as long as Cobb’s ruling remains in effect. Trump is asking the appeals court to issue a stay before that meeting starts. If the court doesn’t rule in time, the White House is prepared to take the case straight to the Supreme Court. Trump’s decision to fire Lisa came after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte accused her of mortgage fraud in three states. In 2021, Lisa allegedly listed properties in Michigan and Georgia as her “primary residence” to receive better loan terms. Later, Pulte added another allegation, this time involving a third mortgage in Massachusetts. Rather than issue a formal termination, Trump made the announcement online, a move Judge Cobb said likely denied Lisa any “meaningful opportunity” to contest the allegations. That’s what triggered the legal pushback. Cobb ruled that Trump’s method of firing could be unconstitutional, and that the allegations alone didn’t amount to legal “cause” for removal under the Fed’s rules. If the three-judge appeals panel grants the stay, Trump’s action could go into effect immediately, regardless of whether the broader legal fight is over. These kinds of emergency stays are only approved if judges believe the appeal has a good shot at success and that Trump would suffer “irreparable harm” without immediate relief. It’s not yet clear how fast the panel will decide. Lisa hasn’t spoken publicly about this herself, while the Federal Reserve itself has remained neutral, saying it will honor the courts’ final decision. But Lisa has previously said that Trump’s effort to remove her is part of a “politically motivated pattern”, warning that her ouster could damage public trust in the Fed and create long-term risks for the economy.

According to the latest market monitoring by Bitcoin World, the leading digital asset has officially surged above the $115,000 mark. This impressive Bitcoin price surge is captivating investors and enthusiasts globally, indicating a vibrant and dynamic period for the market. Specifically, BTC is currently trading at $115,092.01 on the Binance USDT market. This figure not only represents a new peak but also highlights the growing confidence and robust momentum surrounding the world’s largest cryptocurrency. What factors are truly propelling this extraordinary ascent? What’s Fueling This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Surge? Several critical elements contribute to Bitcoin’s strong performance and this latest Bitcoin price surge . Understanding these drivers helps us interpret the current market dynamics. Institutional Investment: Major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly allocating significant capital to Bitcoin. Their growing interest provides substantial liquidity and enhances the asset’s legitimacy, driving upward price movement. Halving Event Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving event drastically reduced the supply of new BTC entering the market. Historically, such supply shocks lead to price appreciation as demand outpaces the decreased availability. Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation fears and geopolitical tensions, often encourage investors to seek alternative assets. Bitcoin, frequently seen as “digital gold,” offers a hedge against traditional market volatility. Renewed Retail Enthusiasm: As prices climb, individual investors often experience a “Fear Of Missing Out” (FOMO). This renewed retail interest injects fresh capital, further amplifying the upward trajectory of the Bitcoin price surge . Is This Bitcoin Price Surge Sustainable? Many are asking if this incredible momentum can continue. While Bitcoin is famous for its volatility, the current rally appears to rest on more solid foundations than previous speculative surges. The increasing involvement of institutional players points to a maturing market. However, short-term market corrections are always possible in any asset class, especially in cryptocurrency. Market participants should prepare for potential pullbacks, which are a natural component of healthy market cycles. Significant gains often precede periods of consolidation. Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from various downturns to achieve new highs. Its underlying technology and expanding utility continue to bolster its long-term investment case. Navigating the Market During a Bitcoin Price Surge: Key Insights For both experienced and new investors, navigating a rapidly ascending market like the current Bitcoin price surge demands a strategic approach. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before investing. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, market cap, and future potential. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly rather than a lump sum. This strategy helps mitigate risks associated with market timing during volatile periods. Risk Management: Only invest capital you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different assets to reduce overall risk exposure. Stay Informed: Keep updated with market news, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Knowledge is crucial in the fast-paced crypto world. Bitcoin’s journey has been truly extraordinary, and its latest ascent above $115,000 marks another compelling chapter. This Bitcoin price surge reflects a combination of factors, from institutional embrace to global economic shifts, all contributing to a robust digital economy. While volatility remains a characteristic, Bitcoin’s fundamental strength and increasing adoption paint a promising future. Investors should remain vigilant, informed, and strategic to capitalize on these exciting developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is driving the current Bitcoin price surge?

For those keenly observing the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the principle of decentralized trust is paramount. Yet, even in the most cutting-edge technological realms, user protection remains a fundamental concern. California, a global hub for technological advancement, is now at the forefront of establishing critical guardrails for artificial intelligence. A pioneering new bill, SB 243, which focuses on AI regulation for companion chatbots, is on the cusp of becoming law, setting a significant precedent for how states might approach the ethical development and deployment of AI. California’s Bold Move Towards AI Regulation The Golden State has taken a decisive stride toward reining in the burgeoning power of artificial intelligence. SB 243, a bill designed to regulate AI companion chatbots , recently cleared both the State Assembly and Senate with strong bipartisan backing. It now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature, with an October 12 deadline for his decision. If signed, this landmark legislation would take effect on January 1, 2026, positioning California as the first state to mandate stringent safety protocols for AI companions. This move is not merely symbolic; it would hold companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet these new standards, signaling a new era of responsibility in the AI sector. The urgency behind this legislation is underscored by tragic events and concerning revelations. The bill gained significant momentum following the devastating death of teenager Adam Raine, who committed suicide after engaging in prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that reportedly involved discussions and planning around his death and self-harm. Furthermore, leaked internal documents reportedly exposed Meta’s chatbots engaging in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children, further fueling public and legislative outcry. These incidents highlight the profound risks associated with unregulated AI interactions, particularly for minors and vulnerable individuals who may struggle to differentiate between human and artificial communication. Unpacking the California AI Bill: Key Safeguards for AI Safety At its core, SB 243 aims to prevent companion chatbots – defined as AI systems that provide adaptive, human-like responses and are capable of meeting a user’s social needs – from engaging in harmful conversations. Specifically, the legislation targets interactions concerning suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. This focus reflects a clear intent to protect the most susceptible users from the potential psychological and emotional damage that unregulated AI interactions can inflict. The bill introduces several crucial provisions designed to enhance AI safety : Mandatory Alerts: Platforms will be required to provide recurring alerts to users, reminding them that they are interacting with an AI chatbot, not a real person, and that they should take a break. For minors, these alerts must appear every three hours. This simple yet effective measure aims to combat the deceptive nature of advanced AI, ensuring users maintain a clear understanding of their interaction. Transparency Requirements: Beginning July 1, 2027, AI companies offering companion chatbots, including major players like OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika, will face annual reporting and transparency obligations. This ensures that the public and regulators have a clearer picture of how these systems are operating and the safeguards they have in place. Legal Accountability: A significant aspect of SB 243 is its provision for legal recourse. Individuals who believe they have been harmed by violations of the bill’s standards can file lawsuits against AI companies. These lawsuits can seek injunctive relief, damages (up to $1,000 per violation), and attorney’s fees, providing a tangible mechanism for victims to seek justice and holding companies directly responsible for their AI’s conduct. Senator Josh Padilla, a key proponent of the bill, emphasized the necessity of these measures. “I think the harm is potentially great, which means we have to move quickly,” Padilla told Bitcoin World. “We can put reasonable safeguards in place to make sure that particularly minors know they’re not talking to a real human being, that these platforms link people to the proper resources when people say things like they’re thinking about hurting themselves or they’re in distress, [and] to make sure there’s not inappropriate exposure to inappropriate material.” Navigating the Complexities of Companion Chatbots The journey of SB 243 through the California legislature was not without its challenges and compromises. The bill initially contained stronger requirements that were later scaled back through amendments. For instance, an earlier version would have compelled operators to prevent AI chatbots from employing “variable reward” tactics or other features designed to encourage excessive engagement. These tactics, commonly used by companies like Replika and Character.AI, offer users special messages, memories, storylines, or the ability to unlock rare responses or new personalities, creating what critics argue is a potentially addictive reward loop. The current bill also removed provisions that would have required operators to track and report how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation or actions with users. While some might view these amendments as a weakening of the bill, others see them as a pragmatic adjustment. “I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told Bitcoin World, suggesting a legislative effort to find a workable middle ground between stringent oversight and practical implementation for AI companies. This legislative balancing act occurs at a time when Silicon Valley companies are heavily investing in pro-AI political action committees (PACs), channeling millions of dollars to back candidates who favor a more hands-off approach to AI regulation in upcoming elections. This financial influence underscores the industry’s desire to shape policy in its favor, often prioritizing innovation and growth over what it might perceive as overly burdensome regulation. Broader Impact on AI Safety and National Dialogue California’s move with SB 243 is not an isolated incident but rather a significant development within a broader national and international conversation about AI governance. In recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have intensified their scrutiny of AI platforms’ safeguards for protecting minors. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is actively preparing to investigate how AI chatbots impact children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched investigations into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. Concurrently, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) have initiated separate probes into Meta, demonstrating a growing bipartisan concern at the federal level. The California bill also comes as the state considers another critical piece of legislation, SB 53, which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements for AI systems. The industry’s response to SB 53 has been notably divided: OpenAI has penned an open letter to Governor Newsom, urging him to abandon the bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech giants like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also voiced opposition. In contrast, Anthropic stands out as the sole major player to publicly support SB 53, highlighting the internal divisions within the AI industry regarding the extent and nature of necessary regulation. Padilla firmly rejects the notion that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive. “I reject the premise that this is a zero-sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive,” Padilla stated. “Don’t tell me that we can’t walk and chew gum. We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.” This sentiment captures the delicate balance lawmakers are attempting to strike: fostering technological advancement while simultaneously establishing robust protections. Companies are also beginning to respond to this increased scrutiny. A spokesperson for Character.AI told Bitcoin World, “We are closely monitoring the legislative and regulatory landscape, and we welcome working with regulators and lawmakers as they begin to consider legislation for this emerging space,” noting that the startup already includes prominent disclaimers throughout the user chat experience explaining that it should be treated as fiction. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment, while Bitcoin World has reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Replika for their perspectives. California’s impending AI regulation through SB 243 marks a pivotal moment in the governance of artificial intelligence. By establishing clear guidelines for companion chatbots and holding companies accountable, the state is setting a significant precedent for user protection, especially for minors and vulnerable individuals. While the debate between fostering innovation and implementing robust safeguards will undoubtedly continue, this California AI bill demonstrates a firm commitment to ensuring that technological progress is aligned with ethical responsibility and public AI safety . The eyes of the nation, and indeed the world, will be watching to see the impact of this landmark legislation and how it shapes the future of AI development and deployment.

With public companies now holding millions of SOL and new investment vehicles like Nasdaq-listed SOL Strategies opening the door for wider access, Solana is proving it can capture both retail and institutional attention. This resurgence underscores its role as one of the most dynamic blockchains in the industry. Yet while Solana cements its position as an institutional-grade asset, retail traders are also eyeing opportunities elsewhere, with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a high-upside candidate attracting growing attention. Price outlook Solana has recaptured momentum, rallying to $202.40 amid growing strategic demand. Public companies alone hold over 3.5 million SOL, valued at more than $591 million, reflecting a substantial institutional commitment to the network’s long-term prospects. Among them, SOL Strategies stands out. The Solana-focused treasury firm secured approval to list on Nasdaq under ticker STKE, effective September 9, offering a regulated and liquid path for institutional investors to gain exposure to Solana. This approval brings credibility and a new layer of market access to SOL’s ecosystem. Additionally, traditional corporations are taking notice. BIT Mining Ltd., a listed entity, announced plans to raise $200–$300 million in phases to build a substantial Solana treasury, swapping crypto holdings for SOL as part of its long-term growth strategy. These trends are being amplified by upcoming financing instruments. Analysts estimate Solana ETF approval odds at around 95%, with several major firms like Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck already filing proposals to launch their own Solana-based funds. This confluence of demand, infrastructure, and regulatory clarity is positioning Solana as a premier institutional-grade blockchain. Why institutional buying matters When large-scale investors allocate capital, they bring more than just buying power—they bring confidence. SOL’s recent staging above $200 is no coincidence, it reflects faith in the network’s ability to deliver infrastructure value and enduring performance. Institutions are treating SOL not only as a digital asset to hold, but also as a productive asset to stake and integrate into portfolios via regulated channels like STKE. This momentum gives retail investors a backdrop of stability to pair with speculative moves. And as market cycles continue to reward platforms with both utility and institutional adoption, Solana’s dual appeal makes it one of the most compelling large-cap stories today. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the 50x candidate While Solana reclaims its strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the high-upside opportunity investors are watching most closely. Priced at just fractions of a cent, analysts project the token could deliver up to 50x returns as demand accelerates. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from other early-stage projects is its combination of cultural momentum and structural credibility. The project has successfully completed audits with HashEx and CertiK, providing a level of transparency and trust uncommon in small-cap tokens. This has allowed it to attract not only speculative retail buyers but also more serious investors looking for vetted opportunities. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE thrives on community growth. Telegram groups and X threads are expanding daily, turning the token into a cultural talking point. Traders describe it not just as a presale play, but as a movement building at the perfect time. Analysts suggest this convergence of trust and momentum creates the kind of setup where explosive multiples become possible. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out For investors comparing ADA, TRON, or even Solana, the upside ceiling is clear: these are already multi-billion-dollar projects. While they offer stability and adoption, their growth trajectories are more measured. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, is starting from a point where exponential returns are possible. Scarcity: Limited token allocations are tightening as demand grows. Momentum: Each round has sold out rapidly, with community size doubling in recent weeks. Legitimacy: The completed audits separate it from the vast majority of small-cap launches. At just a fraction of a cent, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers retail investors the ability to accumulate large positions without overcommitting capital. This accessibility, combined with growing recognition, makes it one of the most talked-about breakout candidates of the current cycle. Diversifying with both SOL and MAGA Smart portfolios don’t bet everything on one type of asset. Ethereum provides credibility, Solana offers scalability and cultural adoption, and MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers speculative asymmetry. By holding a mix of these categories, investors can capture both resilience and explosive upside. Solana’s rally above $200 proves it remains a leading force in crypto’s infrastructure race. But for those searching for life-changing multiples, analysts increasingly point toward tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its unique positioning as both audited and culturally resonant makes it a rare high-risk, high-reward candidate. Solana’s rebound above $200 is more than market noise, it’s confirmation of a building institutional thesis. With $591M+ in corporate accumulation, staking strategies, and ETF pathways opening, SOL is becoming mission-critical for institutional portfolios. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of exponential upside that institutions don’t chase,but narratives fly. With 50x potential, confirmed audits, and retail energy converging, it could be the breakout play of the 2025 cycle.

This week, altcoin market indicators surged to their highest levels since December 2024, fueling speculation that the biggest altcoin rally in years is about to begin. According to Blockchain Center’s Altcoin Season Index, a reading of 78 out of 100 confirms altseason conditions, when 76% of the top 50 crypto assets outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. CoinGlass and CoinMarketCap show similar results, with readings of 76 and 67, respectively. Market sentiment has shifted swiftly, with altcoins stealing momentum from Bitcoin, which has recently consolidated around $114,000. The altcoin market cap, excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins, now stands at $1.63 trillion, just shy of the $1.64 trillion peak seen in late 2024. Is the Altseason a Sign of a Major Breakout Crypto traders are increasingly convinced that the market is on the cusp of a new wave of parabolic growth. Analyst “ Daan Crypto Trades ” noted that the altcoin cap is approaching price discovery territory, which historically sparks sharp rallies. “With the altseason index at its strongest reading in nine months, traders are beginning to lean risk-on again,” said educator Karan Singh Arora. Other traders, including Ash Crypto, suggest altcoins could soon enter “phase 3” of altseason, a stage often marked by explosive price gains across mid- and small-cap tokens. This optimism is further supported by speculation around U.S. Federal Reserve policy. With prediction markets now pricing in the likelihood of a 50-basis-point rate cut at the September 17 meeting, liquidity conditions may shift in favor of risk assets, such as crypto. Historically, lower interest rates have triggered capital inflows into altcoins following Bitcoin’s initial gains. Altcoins Already on the Move Several major altcoins are already flashing strong signals. Dogecoin (DOGE) has climbed above $0.25 with a 5% daily gain, while Avalanche (AVAX) jumped nearly 18% to hit $29, its highest level since January. Other notable movers include Hyperliquid (HYPE), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), and Toncoin (TON), each posting gains above 3% in the past 24 hours. If momentum continues, traders believe the market could replicate, and even surpass, the explosive altseason seen in late 2021. With the altseason index surging and the Fed’s decision looming, all eyes are now on whether 2025 will deliver the most powerful altcoin rally since 2024.

Source: MNTUSD chart from Tradingview Technical Indicators Point to Momentum, and Risk The breakout has placed Mantle firmly above $1.60, with strong support from short-term moving averages. The 10-day EMA at $1.32 and 20-day SMA at $1.22 are trending upward, while momentum indicators like MACD and Momentum remain bullish. Analysts suggest that if the uptrend continues, MNT could test resistance levels of $1.80-$2.00. However, warning signals are emerging. The RSI has climbed above 70, flashing overbought conditions, while the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) surged above 300. Both indicators often precede short-term pullbacks. Bollinger Bands also show price hugging the upper band, suggesting high volatility ahead. What’s Next for Mantle (MNT)? Mantle’s future trajectory will hinge on whether it can sustain demand generated by Bybit’s expansion and its omnichain integration via LayerZero, which boosts utility across multiple blockchains. Its growing role in DeFi, connected with a rising TVL of $1.8 billion, strengthens the bullish case.

OpenAI , the powerhouse behind groundbreaking AI models like ChatGPT , has announced a non-binding agreement with its largest investor, Microsoft . This pivotal accord paves the way for OpenAI’s for-profit arm to convert into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), a move that could redefine the future of AI development and its commercialization. For those keenly observing the intersection of technology, investment, and ethical governance, this transition represents a crucial moment, signaling a new phase for one of the world’s most influential AI entities. Understanding OpenAI’s Pivotal Shift to a Public Benefit Corporation The core of this transformative news lies in OpenAI ‘s intent to become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). But what exactly does this mean, and why is it a significant step for an organization at the forefront of AI innovation? A Public Benefit Corporation is a hybrid legal structure, allowing a for-profit company to pursue both profit and a specific public benefit. Unlike traditional corporations solely focused on maximizing shareholder value, a PBC is legally obligated to consider the impact of its decisions on society and its stated public mission. For OpenAI, whose founding mission centers on ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity, the PBC structure offers a unique path. It allows the company to: Balance Mission and Capital: Pursue ambitious, capital-intensive AI research while legally upholding its commitment to public good. Attract Values-Aligned Investment: Appeal to investors who are not only seeking financial returns but also support the company’s ethical and societal objectives. Enhance Public Trust: Signal a formal commitment to responsible AI development, potentially mitigating concerns about AI’s societal impact. Facilitate Future Growth: The transition could enable OpenAI to raise additional capital more easily and, eventually, explore the possibility of becoming a public company, further fueling its research and development efforts. According to Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s Board Chairman, the existing nonprofit entity will retain control over the startup’s operations. Under the non-binding agreement, this nonprofit would obtain a substantial stake in the new Public Benefit Corporation , reportedly valued upwards of $100 billion. This structure aims to ensure that the foundational mission remains paramount, even as the organization scales commercially. The Evolving Microsoft and OpenAI AI Partnership The relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI has been a cornerstone of AI development in recent years. Microsoft’s initial investment in 2019 provided OpenAI with crucial resources, granting Microsoft preferred access to OpenAI’s technology and designating it as OpenAI’s primary cloud services provider. This AI partnership has been mutually beneficial, with OpenAI leveraging Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure to train its massive models, and Microsoft gaining a significant edge in the competitive AI market. However, the rapid success and widespread adoption of products like ChatGPT have dramatically altered the dynamics of this relationship. ChatGPT’s emergence transformed OpenAI from a promising research lab into a global tech phenomenon with immense commercial potential. This growth reportedly led OpenAI to seek greater autonomy and to loosen some of Microsoft’s existing controls, especially concerning cloud services and market access. The recent non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signifies the next phase of this evolving partnership. While an MOU is not a legally binding contract, it serves to document the parties’ intentions and expectations, laying the groundwork for a definitive agreement. Both companies have stated they are actively working to finalize these contractual terms. This development suggests a renegotiation that aims to balance Microsoft’s strategic investment and preferred access with OpenAI’s increasing need for operational flexibility and broader market engagement, ensuring the AI partnership continues to thrive under new terms. Navigating Regulatory Hurdles and the Future of ChatGPT The path to becoming a Public Benefit Corporation is not without its challenges, particularly regarding regulatory approvals. OpenAI and Microsoft have indicated that they are working with the California and Delaware Attorneys General on the transition plan. These state regulators play a critical role in overseeing corporate structure changes, especially those involving entities with significant public impact and a stated benefit mission. Regulatory scrutiny is a standard part of such major corporate transformations. The Attorneys General will likely review the proposed structure to ensure it genuinely serves the public interest as intended by the PBC framework and that the interests of the nonprofit are adequately protected. This process can be time-consuming and may involve conditions or modifications to the proposed agreement before final clearance is granted. The successful navigation of these regulatory hurdles is crucial for OpenAI ‘s future. It will directly impact its ability to raise capital, execute its long-term strategy, and continue to develop and deploy advanced AI models like ChatGPT . The outcome will also set a precedent for how other major AI companies might structure themselves, potentially influencing the broader regulatory landscape for AI development and governance. The commitment to a public benefit mission, while commendable, must also be legally robust and transparent to satisfy regulatory bodies and maintain public confidence. Behind the Scenes: Tensions, Acquisitions, and Elon Musk’s Influence The journey to this agreement has reportedly been complex, marked by months of intense negotiations and underlying tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft . Reports from sources like The Wall Street Journal indicated that these negotiations reached a ‘boiling point’ at times, highlighting the strategic importance and high stakes involved for both entities. One notable point of contention revolved around the acquisition of Windsurf, an AI coding startup that OpenAI had planned to acquire earlier this year. Microsoft reportedly sought control over Windsurf’s technology, while OpenAI aimed to keep the startup’s intellectual property independent. Ultimately, the deal fell through, with Windsurf’s founders joining Google and its staff being acquired by Cognition. This incident underscores the competitive nature of the AI talent and IP landscape and the strategic interests of major tech players. Further complicating matters is the ongoing lawsuit filed by Elon Musk against OpenAI. Musk’s lawsuit fundamentally accuses Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and the company of abandoning its original nonprofit mission. Lawyers representing Musk have actively sought to surface information related to the Microsoft and OpenAI negotiations over this transition, viewing it as relevant to their claims. Interestingly, Musk himself submitted an unsolicited $97 billion takeover bid for OpenAI earlier this year, which the board rejected. Legal experts noted at the time that Musk’s bid might have inadvertently helped establish a higher valuation for OpenAI’s nonprofit stake, which, under the current agreement, is valued even higher at over $100 billion. These behind-the-scenes dynamics reveal the intricate blend of business, legal, and personal interests shaping OpenAI’s trajectory. Financial Implications and OpenAI’s Path Forward The financial implications of OpenAI ‘s transition to a Public Benefit Corporation are substantial. The reported $100 billion stake for the nonprofit arm is a significant valuation, cementing the nonprofit’s ongoing control and ensuring that its mission remains central to the organization’s strategy. This valuation also provides a clear benchmark, notably exceeding Elon Musk’s earlier takeover bid and reflecting the immense market value attributed to OpenAI’s innovations and future potential. As a PBC, OpenAI will be better positioned to raise additional capital from a broader range of investors. This access to funding is critical for sustaining its highly expensive research into advanced AI models, which require vast computational resources and top-tier talent. The ability to attract capital while maintaining a public benefit mandate could set a new standard for how cutting-edge AI research is funded and governed. Looking ahead, the agreement with Microsoft and the PBC transition could pave the way for OpenAI to eventually become a public company. While this is a long-term prospect, it would provide further avenues for investment and liquidity, potentially accelerating the development of AGI and its deployment. This strategic financial restructuring highlights OpenAI’s ambition to grow, innovate, and lead the AI revolution while striving to uphold its ethical commitments. A New Horizon for AI Innovation OpenAI ‘s agreement with Microsoft to transition its for-profit arm into a Public Benefit Corporation marks a significant moment in the evolution of AI. This strategic move aims to reconcile the immense commercial potential of AI with the ethical imperatives of developing powerful technologies for the benefit of all humanity. By adopting the PBC structure, OpenAI seeks to secure the necessary capital for its ambitious research, attract diverse investors, and reinforce public trust, all while legally binding itself to its foundational mission. The evolving AI partnership with Microsoft, the navigation of regulatory approvals, and the backdrop of high-profile legal challenges underscore the complexity of this undertaking. Yet, if successful, this transition could set a new precedent for corporate governance in the AI sector, demonstrating a model where innovation, profitability, and public good are not mutually exclusive but rather intrinsically linked. As ChatGPT and other OpenAI models continue to reshape industries, this structural shift is poised to influence not just OpenAI’s future, but the very trajectory of responsible AI development globally.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000430. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000699 and an average trading price of $0.000673 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The 4-hour chart shows breakout momentum supported by volume. The $0.00009700 price level is the key short-term support to hold. FLOKI on the daily timeframe The 1-day Floki Inu price chart for September 11 shows the coin closing around $0.0001, maintaining a series of higher lows after bottoming near $0.00008617. FLOKI is approaching the first key resistance at $0.00010460, with further supply at $0.00011139 and $0.00012424 overhead. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram has flipped positive, and the lines are crossing upward, suggesting strengthening momentum. Still, bulls need a clean daily close above $0.00010460 to confirm trend continuation. A drop back below $0.00009500 could weaken this setup and put $0.00008617 back in focus. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe The shorter timeframe shows a bullish structure with higher lows and a strong breakout candle pushing price above $0.00010026. The Alligator moving averages are aligned bullishly and widening, confirming trend support. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has picked up after a quiet period, and OBV is stabilizing after a pullback, indicating buyers are stepping back in. As long as $0.00009700 holds, momentum favors a retest of $0.00010460 resistance, with a higher breakout possible if sustained.

Momentum is building, but overhead resistance remains the real test. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need up to $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 110x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

The South Korean newspaper Seoul Kyungjae reported that Upbit has listed seven tokens in the past 10 days. The top 12 most-traded coins on the Upbit crypto exchange on September 11, 2025. (Source: CoinGecko) Upbit Listing Spree: Will It Stop Bithumb’s Surge? The outlet wrote that on September 9, Bithumb’s domestic market share climbed to 46%, with Upbit’s share standing at 50.6%. Upbit has dominated the South Korean market since around 2022, enjoying market share dominance above the 80% mark in some months. This has led some lawmakers to complain that its operator, Dunmau, has become the crypto exchange sector’s de facto monopoly . But Bithumb has been chipping away at Upbit’s market share in recent months. It has struck a partnership deal with Kookmin Bank, South Korea’s biggest financial player. And it has also launched a spinoff firm as it looks to become the first domestic exchange to debut on the NASDAQ stock exchange . Upbit appears to have responded to Bithumb’s resurgence by launching new altcoin pairings and listing a wider range of coins. An unnamed South Korean exchange official told the media outlet that Upbit is concerned that Bithumb has narrowed the market share gap to less than 5% without resorting to novel promotions. The official opined: “Upbit cannot help but feel a sense of crisis.” Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past seven days (Source: CoinGecko) WLD Listing The media outlet wrote that Upbit’s response to Worldcoin (WLD) trade volume growth in South Korea has been telling. When WLD transaction volumes pushed Bithumb’s market share to 46% on September 9, Upbit responded rapidly. Upbit announced it would be listing WLD at 7 pm KST the same day and completed its listing just two hours later, at 9 pm KST. Upbit’s latest listing, at 1:30 am KST on September 11, was the Linea (LINEA). The exchange’s September listings tally has already surpassed its total number of listings for the whole of August. Customers May Suffer, Experts Warn The market leader has traditionally taken a much more conservative attitude to coin listing than Bithumb, which also continues to add coins to its platform. Should the two firms become embroiled in a listings war, critics warn, customers could suffer in the long run. Experts said they were “concerned” that the “fierce competition between exchanges” could lead platform managers to make “hasty decisions” that “compromise the review process.” The experts noted that while listing frenzies continue, South Korean delisting events are becoming more common. A combined total of 25 altcoins have been delisted by Bithumb, Upbit, and their closest rivals, Korbit, Coinone, and GOPAX, since July this year. Several of these coins had only recently been listed on the platforms. An unnamed crypto industry executive suggested that Seoul’s efforts to police the sector may be at fault. The source said: “Regulators only allow domestic exchanges to provide spot trading. That means that the only way they can compete with one another is by expanding their listings. It is ironic that regulators’ attempts to police the industry are actually spurring listing competition and weakening investor protection.” The post Upbit Goes on Coin Listing Spree as Bithumb Claws Back Market Share appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Bithumb|Upbit,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|MARKET|WLD,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-11 23:30:00

The analyst, who has nearly 130,000 followers on X, shared his projections as anticipation builds for the next stage of the market cycle. Ethereum as the Benchmark Ethereum currently trades at $4,359, and according to Amonyx, a climb to $10,000 would represent a 131 % increase from this level. Achieving that target would also set a fresh all-time high for Ethereum, more than doubling its previous peak of $4,959. Many market watchers expect the current bull run to extend through December 2025, and Amonyx believes Ethereum’s potential move will serve as the foundation for broader altcoin growth. Price predictions for this bullrun: #BTC : $200,000 #ETH : $10,000 #BNB : $2,000 #XRP : $20+ #WAN : $10+ #SHIB : $0,001 #DOGE : $5 Which one will happen first? — Amonyx (@amonbuy) September 9, 2025 Shiba Inu’s Possible Upside Based on this scenario, Amonyx has outlined a striking projection for Shiba Inu. He argues that SHIB could rally to $0.001 , which would require the token to erase two zeros from its current price of $0.00001301 . For that to occur, Shiba Inu would need to appreciate by more than 7,586%, a scale of growth rarely seen in the digital asset market. If realized, the move would set a new record for the popular meme coin and exceed the expectations of most current forecasts. Historical Context and Token Relationship Despite the bold outlook, Shiba Inu’s market performance in 2025 has been largely negative. The token has lost almost 39% of its value since January. Even so, SHIB often displays a strong correlation with Ethereum, given its status as an ERC-20 token. At times, it has even managed to outperform ETH in shorter timeframes. For example, while Ethereum gained 0.17% over the past week, Shiba Inu rose 4.65% within the same period. This trend fuels optimism that the token could benefit disproportionately if Ethereum begins a sustained rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The idea of Shiba Inu climbing to $0.001 is not new . Analysts and community figures have raised this benchmark on multiple occasions. Last year, analyst Crypto Sheriff pointed to a breakout from a multi-year downtrend as a reason SHIB could eventually test that level, though without specifying a timeline. Another analyst, Krao, had earlier projected that the target would be reached in the first quarter of 2025, but that prediction did not materialize. Factors That Could Support the Rally According to Amonyx, achieving $0.001 in this cycle would require more than Ethereum’s rise. Other favourable conditions would need to align, including higher retail demand for meme tokens and new initiatives within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. One recurring theme is token supply. With 589 trillion SHIB still in circulation, large-scale burns are viewed as essential for sustainable appreciation. While projections remain speculative, Amonyx’s analysis reflects the optimism among sections of the Shiba Inu community. If Ethereum moves toward the $10,000 mark, SHIB’s potential to capitalize on that momentum will remain a closely watched narrative in the months ahead.

That answers the “will a DOGE ETF happen?” question and reshapes the short- to mid-term setup. As DOGE defends $0.214–$0.21 and wrestles with $0.22, the pivot at $0.225 remains the trigger toward $0.25. Meanwhile, the Layer Brett crypto presale is live at $0.0055, with $3.3 million raised and staking at 782% APY—an Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin. Dogecoin price prediction : what an ETF unlocks in 2025–2026 An approved DOGE ETF can drive inflows, legitimize fund exposure, and amplify narratives into a 2025 bull run. We’re already seeing institutional footprints: volume near 808.9M pushed price to $0.22 before profit-taking, confirming sensitivity to ETF headlines. Technically, DOGE prints lower highs with expanding sell volume—near-term caution—yet the DOGE/BTC pair and BTC show bullish breakout structures that favor medium-term upside. In this context, a Dogecoin price prediction revisiting $0.25–$0.30 on momentum is reasonable once $0.225 flips to support. In fact, analysts have put forward the following outcomes: – Base case (most probable): With ETF tailwinds and a risk-on market, DOGE grinds toward $0.35–$0.50 in 2025, then stretches to $0.60–$0.80 by 2026 as liquidity builds. Maintains trend above $0.21 and convert $0.25 into a launchpad. – Stretch case ($1): Needs a full bull market, sustained DOGE/BTC strength, and ETF-driven media flywheels. A parabolic phase could tag $1 late 2026, presuming broadening participation. – Risk case: Sell-the-news or macro shocks could revisit $0.21—lose it, and $0.18 returns. Watch the $0.225 pivot and volume quality for confirmation. Bottom line: DOGE can reach $1, but it likely needs near-perfect conditions. A balanced Dogecoin price prediction recognizes both paths and hurdles. Where Layer Brett aims for the bigger multiple For investors chasing asymmetric upside, Layer Brett blends meme energy with utility on Ethereum Layer 2. $LBRETT is in presale at $0.0055, with $3.26 million raised. It’s an ERC-20 built for low fees, high throughput, and scalable smart contracts—fit for a Layer 2 narrative institution increasingly respected. The stats are intriguing: – Staking power: Early buyers can stake at 782% APY while the network grows. – Utility-first meme thesis: Beyond hype, Layer Brett targets DeFi and builders with low fees and Web3-ready features. – Market-cap math: A smaller cap gives a clearer path to top-gainer status if momentum hits, making it one of the best crypto presale picks among meme coins. Final take: ETF lifts DOGE, but Layer Brett may capture the bigger upside Yes—the DOGE ETF appears imminent and should benefit DOGE through 2025–2026. Could $1 happen? Possibly in a roaring market, but not guaranteed. Meanwhile, Layer Brett’s smaller market cap, Layer 2 utility, and 782% staking APY create a compelling setup. Layer Brett’s staking engine turns community participation into compounding growth: stake $LBRETT via decentralized, no-KYC flows and benefit from Ethereum Layer 2 throughput. The roadmap builds a real ecosystem around a memecoin, not just virality. Add the $1 Million Giveaway to ignite awareness—and you have a catalyst for flows seeking new crypto coins and low-cap gems. With its crypto presale live at $0.0055 and a limited window, securing $LBRETT early and staking positions investors for a potential meme-coin breakout fueled by real tech and a $1 Million Giveaway.

With the Layer Brett presale at $0.0055 and staking at 782% APY, momentum is shifting toward this Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin. If ADA steadies and PI struggles with trust, could $LBRETT be the next big crypto to run? Cardano news today: utility meets accumulation as institutional interest rises Cardano has been resilient. Despite an ETF delay, ADA rallied as whales accumulated against bearish retail sentiment, hinting at positioning for a bigger move. Macro and network updates have aided stability. Beyond the charts, Charles Hoskinson’s $200M Wyoming clinic blending AI and blockchain shows utility beyond speculation. For ADA holders, this kind of adoption—paired with growing institutional interest—supports Cardano staying among top altcoins as rotation returns. Pi Network price prediction: hype vs. hard warnings Pi Network is back in headlines, but not for the right reasons. Bybit’s CEO publicly labeled Pi a scam following an official police warning, while the token’s debut at a lofty valuation saw thin liquidity and a 60%+ drawdown. If liquidity stays fragmented and trust issues linger, rallies in PI can be sharp but fragile. Traders should factor in headline risk: multiple exchanges listing IOU-style pairs, uncertainty around circulating supply, and uneven market depth—all of which complicate any sustainable PI recovery. Why Layer Brett is breaking records on Ethereum Layer 2 While the market debates ADA and PI, Layer Brett is executing. The project has raised $3.3 million, with $LBRETT at $0.0055 in its crypto presale—an entry for a meme token that blends meme energy with utility. Built on an Ethereum Layer 2, it offers low fees, high throughput, and staking rewards that stand out: a headline 782% APY for early stakers. Layer Brett’s approach: real tech and real rewards. As an ERC-20 on Layer 2, it’s engineered for scale—fast transactions, low fees, and a staking ecosystem designed to keep holders active. This is a memecoin built to function like a DeFi token while tapping the cultural power of a top meme coin. Head-to-head: ADA , PI , and $LBRETT into the next volatility cycle Catalysts are lining up. With Bitcoin compressing ahead of Fed/CPI and ETF headlines, sidelined cash is watching for a break. If rotation kicks in, ADA could benefit from institutional credibility and Cardano ecosystem progress—but its large market cap limits explosive upside. PI faces trust overhangs that make rebounds more speculative than strategic. That’s where $LBRETT could surprise. Smaller cap, Ethereum Layer 2 utility, live staking, and a viral brand make Layer Brett a candidate for top gainer status in a fresh alt swing. Add the $1 Million Giveaway, and you’ve got a community flywheel designed to capture attention into a crypto bull run 2025 setup. For momentum hunters scouting low-cap gems and the next 100x meme coin, $LBRETT checks the boxes. Conclusion: Today’s winner is the project breaking records—and it’s $LBRETT The verdict: Cardano shows strength, Pi Network carries risk, and Layer Brett is the standout today. Early buyers can lock in 782% APY through staking, and a smaller market cap gives $LBRETT more room to run than ADA while avoiding PI’s credibility pitfalls. The crypto presale is limited , the price is $0.0055, and $LBRETT has already raised $3.3 million—with a $1 Million Giveaway amplifying the buzz. If you’re seeking the best crypto to buy before the next volatility wave, Layer Brett deserves a top spot on your list. Connect your wallet and buy in today.

Traders’ eye forecasts range from $3.50 to $7 by 2025, while some bold calls stretch toward $10 if regulatory clarity and adoption align. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) draws attention to the broader crypto market. It’s compared to Ripple’s early days, thanks to its exploding presale and real payment utility. XRP Price Prediction Outlook Current XRP price is around $2.97. By year’s end, many expect a rise into the $3.30–$3.50 zone if support holds near $2.77 and resistance at $3.07 is breached. Based on on-chain use and regulatory shifts, consensus projections for 2025 range from $2.80 to a moderately bullish $5- $7. Technical patterns and sentiment remain mixed. Some trackers see potential for 333% gains over 40 days, while others remain cautious, warning that a breakdown below $2.77 could push XRP back toward $2.50. The XRP price calls depend largely on ETF developments, compliance upgrades, and remittance adoption via Ripple’s network. Market Buzz: Presales, Utility, and High-Growth Picks Crypto traders are flocking to search terms like ‘best crypto presale 2025’, ‘next big altcoin 2025’, ‘crypto with real utility’, and ‘low-cap crypto gems’. Many are looking beyond legacy tokens, hunting for early-stage crypto investment with high ROI potential. That’s where Remittix (RTX) enters the picture, bringing real-world use, bonus rewards, and aggressive marketing to the fold. Remittix: The PayFi DeFi Project Surging Ahead Remittix (RTX) is viewed as a modernisation of the remittance playbook. For its focus on payments and early traction, it is earning comparisons to “XRP 2.0.” Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Raised over $24.9 million in presale, with 655M+ tokens sold at ~$0.105 Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, key centralised exchanges support Beta wallet launching Q3 2025 with the backing for 40+ cryptos, 30+ fiat currencies, real-time FX, and low gas fees CertiK audited, with deflationary tokenomics and staking potential Lively $250,000 community giveaway and viral buzz, earning it “best crypto presale to buy now” acclaim Remittix blends functionality with hype: it’s a cross-chain DeFi project delivering actual remittance tools. That’s the kind of crypto solving real-world problems traders search for when they look up “buy RTX token,” “new crypto token launch,” or “next big crypto launch.” XRP Price Prediction vs. Remittix: Two Growth Paths Side-by-Side The XRP Price Prediction underscores a stable path, solid adoption, regulatory progress, and modest gains. But for investors eyeing high growth crypto, Remittix offers a rapid rise in presale stages, real payment use, and heavy buzz. Rippling through the market is a dual narrative: XRP brings stability and legacy utility; Remittix presents high upside, early access, and payment-first innovation.

When you’re holding for years, you want tokens that have daily utility rather than just trending charts. Two networks that are at the center of that utility story are Ethereum and XRP. While they each solve different problems, they all solve problems for real users and real businesses. Ethereum is the programmable base layer for finance, culture, and identity on-chain. Everything from tokenized assets to lending is powered by its smart contracts. XRP, on the other hand, is all about value transfer. It will allow cross-border payments to be faster and cheaper than legacy rails, a practical requirement for banks, fintechs and remittance players. As investors plan longer-term strategies, they are also looking at earlier, more nimble projects that could compound from small caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE comes up in those conversations as a complementing sat-allocation play for growth-oriented portfolios. Why Ethereum Belongs in a 5-Year Hold ETH enjoys a huge developer community and a continuous array of usability improvements. When costs decrease and throughput increases, more apps achieve product-market fit. That attracts further users and liquidity, providing a strong cycle for holders. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Featured Among 2025 Growth Picks With a solid roadmap, strong community engagement, and a focus on scalable tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been identified as one of the best Altcoins to buy in 2025 for high growth portfolios. The investment strategy for long-term investors is to position for the build phase and let milestones and access expansion do the heavy lifting over time. Why XRP Keeps Its Seat For payments, it is all about speed and cost. XRP is designed for throughput and settlement efficiency. If the popularity of partner integrations continues to grow and regulatory clarity continues to improve, institutions will continue to double down where the technology makes sense. Diversifying “Utility First” Investors don’t have to pick between platforms and payments. A well-balanced five-year basket might include ETH’s programmable economy, XRP’s transfer rails and a measured exposure to earlier-stage names. Conclusion Utility is the guidepost for multi-year holding. While Ethereum and XRP continue to provide it in different ways, selective exposure to early-stage growth like MAGACOIN FINANCE can provide upside without capitulation on fundamentals.

According to reports, the fund is being launched by REX-Osprey and will provide US investors a regulated way to gain exposure to DOGE without holding the coin directly. Related Reading: Altcoins Feel The Pinch As Crypto Market Sentiment Sours Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, told market watchers that the fund will hold an asset with “no utility on purpose,” and he publicly challenged supporters to point to clear real-world uses for Dogecoin beyond community interest and trading. Analyst Asks Supporters To Show Practical Uses According to Balchunas, DOJE will be the first US ETF that openly holds an asset whose backers say lacks practical functions. He pushed the community to list where DOGE is used as more than a token of speculation or culture. The Doge people (what do you call them, Doge-rs?) are objecting to my “no utility” comment. But the coin was literally started by two guys as a joke. So what’s the utility? https://t.co/6YtQPnCOTx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 9, 2025 Some in the Dogecoin community pointed to limited payment tests and merchant experiments, while others emphasized the coin’s long history of publicity and social attention. Reports also note the fund is being structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940 instead of the Securities Act of 1933, a choice that has drawn extra scrutiny. Why Utility Matters For Investors Investors typically seek ways to value an asset beyond pure sentiment. Utility can mean things like payment rails, governance roles, or fuel for smart contracts — uses that create sustained demand. When those uses are limited, price moves can be driven mainly by headlines and momentum. That makes risk evaluation harder for portfolios that require steady, predictable exposures. Some market participants counter that brand recognition, liquidity, and culture can still produce buyer interest, at least while markets are favorable. Related Reading: Institutional Adoption Rises: 21X Brings Chainlink Into Europe’s Tokenized Securities Market Less Common Legal Route Based on reports, the legal route chosen for DOJE is unusual for a crypto-linked spot fund. Filing under the 1940 Act instead of the 1933 Act carries different compliance and custody implications. Few ETFs have taken this exact path for a memecoin-style asset, and observers say they will watch how custody and regulatory reviews play out once trading begins. Traders and institutions may treat the fund differently because of the structure and the questions raised over utility.

Although achieving this target would require a major rally, many believe that widespread adoption and real-world use cases could serve as critical drivers. The token first gained global attention during 2020 and 2021, when it surged dramatically and erased several zeros from its price. That run took SHIB to an all-time high of $0.00008845, largely fueled by community-driven campaigns and viral exposure. This period established Shiba Inu as one of the most recognized meme-inspired assets in the world. Today, supporters argue that the next significant move will not come solely from speculative interest but from expanding SHIB’s functionality across different sectors. Five Avenues for Utility Growth Payments for Freelance Services: One possible pathway involves SHIB being accepted as payment across freelance platforms. The U.S. had more than 64 million freelance workers in 2023, according to Forbes . Even limited adoption in this segment could increase demand for SHIB, particularly if major platforms enable direct payments. Integration into Metaverse Economies: Shiba Inu launched its own metaverse project, Shib: The Metaverse, in 2022 , with partial rollout beginning in December 2024. Expanding the use of SHIB within this ecosystem, for salaries, royalties, or in-world transactions, could generate consistent demand beyond trading. Growth in Micropayments: The low-cost nature of SHIB transactions positions the token as a candidate for micropayments. Use cases may include tipping online creators, in-game purchases, or small-scale streaming payments. If adopted at scale, micropayments could help SHIB build a stronger utility profile. Incentivized Online Shopping: Partnerships with major e-commerce platforms could further adoption by providing discounts to users who pay with SHIB. This type of incentive-based model would encourage regular spending and broaden SHIB’s appeal beyond investment circles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cross-Border Remittances: In regions where traditional remittances are costly or slow, SHIB could provide an alternative for cross-border payments. Integration with fintech applications could make it a viable option for families transferring funds across different markets. Assessing the $0.0001 Goal At its current price of $0.00001305 , Shiba Inu would need to rise by approximately 666% to reach $0.0001. With a supply of around 589 trillion tokens, such a price would give SHIB a market capitalization close to $59 billion. Despite the ambitious nature of this target, it remains one of the most common predictions within the Shiba Inu community. Several analysts have already outlined scenarios under which SHIB could meet this benchmark. A pseudonymous commentator known as “Anonymous” projected a price between $0.00017 and $0.00032 by the fourth quarter of 2025. Forbes has also suggested the token could climb as high as $0.0003 within the same period. Technical analysts such as BitFinity and Capt. Parabolic Toblerone has added their voices, pointing to historical chart patterns that may support the case for a breakout. While speculation about SHIB’s future continues, most experts agree that sustainable progress toward $0.0001 will require tangible adoption and a strong use-case framework. Initiatives in freelancing, e-commerce, gaming, and remittances, alongside Shiba Inu’s metaverse project, could provide the foundations for long-term growth. However, the timeline for these developments may extend beyond current market cycles. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

51573486,579194,1757635250,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51573486.jpeg,"Shiba Inu Team Confirms Delayed Migration Is A Go, Here’s What’s Coming",https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-delayed-migration/,"After weeks of anticipation and setbacks, the Shiba Inu development team has officially confirmed that the long-awaited migration from LEASH v1 to LEASH v2 is ready to begin. The delay stemmed from the need to address flaws in the original LEASH token contract and to complete a thorough security audit. Now that these hurdles are cleared, developers say the transition to LEASH v2 is set to commence in the coming days. Shiba Inu Team Confirms Migration According to a recent blog post by the Shiba Inu team, the security audit of the LEASH v2 contract and its migration mechanism has been completed by Hexens, which has now cleared the way for the long-delayed rollout. The developers explained that they engaged Hexens to perform a full, independent audit of the integrated system, covering the LEASH v2 token, the migrator, and all associated flows. Now that the security firm Hexens has cleared the audit, the migration is expected to begin anytime soon. Hexens is a Web3-focused cybersecurity firm known for smart-contract and protocol audits. Its track record spans Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and BNB Chain, where the firm’s audits have protected significant on-chain value. As the migration begins, developers warned LEASH v1 holders should use only official links published on Shib.io and verified Shiba Inu social channels to avoid falling prey to scams. Once the migration window closes, any unused LEASH v2 tokens in the multisig wallet will be burned to enforce a hard-capped supply. How The Migration Will Work Now that all the security boxes have been ticked, the migration from LEASH v1 to LEASH v2 is expected to commence anytime in the coming days. The migration will occur in carefully planned phases to ensure fairness across different types of holders. In the first phase, direct LEASH v1 holders as well as those with staked or locked tokens will be able to migrate by burning or locking their v1 tokens to receive v2 equivalents at a ratio based on the current v1 supply. Liquidity providers on Uniswap V2 and ShibaSwap V1 are also included in this stage. Phase Two will handle the more complex Uniswap V3 and ShibaSwap V2 LPs, which require snapshots and proof-of-withdrawal mechanisms to prevent trapped value. Lastly, Phase Three will cover bridge users and those holding LEASH on Shibarium for a 1:1 swap of these tokens. The LEASH v1 contract was originally promoted as a fixed-supply token, but a hidden vulnerability meant that rebasing mechanisms could still alter the supply through authorized proxies. This vulnerability was exploited earlier this year and this led to an unplanned 20% increase in supply. To restore trust and safeguard holders, developers opted to create LEASH v2. According to developers, the upgrade removes any minting or rebasing loopholes, as the entire v2 supply is pre-minted and secured in a multisignature wallet. At the time of writing, LEASH is trading at $24.94, down by 3.22% in the past 24 hours.",Shiba Inu|BNB Chain|Cosmos|Ethereum|Hexens|LEASH|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|ShibaSwap|ShibaSwap V2 LPs|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|solana|Uniswap|Uniswap v3,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|UNI|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 00:00:50

However, recent news brings a slight shift in plans, as the much-awaited launch of the RexShares DOGE ETF has encountered a minor delay. What’s the Latest on the DOGE ETF Launch? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the launch of the DOGE ETF , set to trade under the ticker DOJE, has been postponed. Originally slated for September 11, the debut from U.S. asset managers RexShares and Osprey Funds is now expected next week. Balchunas indicated that next Thursday is the new likely target date for this significant event. This news, while a small delay, keeps the crypto community on its toes. The introduction of a spot DOGE ETF could be a game-changer for Dogecoin, potentially opening doors for broader institutional and retail investment. It signals a growing maturity in the digital asset space, even for meme coins. Why Does a DOGE ETF Matter for Investors? The concept of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) for a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin is incredibly significant. ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without directly owning it. This simplifies the investment process, making it more accessible to a wider audience, including those who might be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Here are some key reasons why a DOGE ETF is important: Accessibility: It offers a regulated and familiar investment vehicle, similar to traditional stock market investments. Liquidity: ETFs typically provide high liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Diversification: For traditional investors, it offers an avenue to diversify portfolios with digital assets. Legitimacy: The approval and launch of such an ETF lend further credibility to Dogecoin and the broader crypto market. The delay, while minor, provides a brief window for potential investors to further research and understand the implications of such a product on their investment strategies. It’s crucial to consider how this new financial instrument could integrate into existing portfolios. Navigating the Path to a DOGE ETF: What Comes Next? The journey to launching a cryptocurrency ETF is often fraught with regulatory hurdles. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious with crypto-related financial products. However, recent approvals for Bitcoin ETFs suggest a shifting landscape, paving the way for other digital assets, including Dogecoin. RexShares and Osprey Funds are among the asset managers at the forefront of this innovation. Their persistence in bringing a DOGE ETF to market highlights the increasing demand for regulated crypto investment products. While a specific reason for this particular delay wasn’t detailed, such postponements are not uncommon in the highly regulated financial sector. Investors should keep an eye on official announcements from RexShares and Osprey Funds, as well as regulatory bodies, for the definitive launch date. The likely launch next Thursday will be a moment many in the crypto world will be watching closely. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin’s Future? The introduction of a DOGE ETF could have a substantial impact on Dogecoin’s market dynamics. Increased accessibility and institutional interest could lead to higher trading volumes and potentially greater price stability. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the enhanced visibility and legitimacy could attract new capital into the Dogecoin ecosystem. This development is part of a larger trend of mainstream finance embracing digital assets. As more regulated products become available, the line between traditional finance and cryptocurrency continues to blur, offering exciting new opportunities for investors globally. The journey of the DOGE ETF is a testament to this evolving financial landscape. In conclusion, while the RexShares DOGE ETF has seen a minor delay, the anticipation for its launch next Thursday remains high. This development underscores the growing institutional interest and regulatory progress within the cryptocurrency space, offering new avenues for investors to engage with digital assets like Dogecoin. It’s a significant step towards mainstream adoption and a testament to the enduring appeal of the meme coin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a DOGE ETF? A DOGE ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund that would hold Dogecoin as its underlying asset, allowing investors to trade shares of the fund on traditional stock exchanges without directly buying and holding Dogecoin itself. Who are RexShares and Osprey Funds? RexShares and Osprey Funds are U.S. asset management firms that are collaborating to launch the proposed DOGE ETF (DOJE). Why was the DOGE ETF launch delayed? The exact reason for this specific delay was not publicly detailed, but minor postponements are common in the highly regulated financial industry for various reasons, including final regulatory checks or logistical preparations. What is the new anticipated launch date for the DOGE ETF? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the launch is now considered likely for next Thursday, following the original September 11 target. How could a DOGE ETF impact Dogecoin’s price? A DOGE ETF could potentially increase Dogecoin’s price and stability by making it more accessible to a wider range of investors, including institutions, thereby increasing demand and liquidity. However, market performance is influenced by many factors. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The milestone cabinet appointment is the first ever political appointment of an AI bot in the world. Albania has broken a new record in global politics by being the first nation to name an artificial intelligence bot as a cabinet minister. Prime Minister Edi Rama revealed the appointment on Thursday, presenting the bot named “Diella.” She is a digital system that will focus on managing the country’s public procurement system. According to Rama, the appointment is aimed at tackling corruption. Albania has appointed an AI bot as a cabinet minister Diella, whose name means “sunshine” in Albanian, was introduced at the Socialist Party assembly in Tirana, where Rama announced his new cabinet at the start of his fourth term. Unlike her colleagues, Diella exists only as an avatar which has been made to represent a young woman in traditional Albanian attire. Rama said Diella would oversee all public tenders, which has historically been one of Albania’s most corruption-prone sectors. By removing decision-making from human cabinet members and placing it in the hands of an incorruptible AI, he argued, the country could ensure “100 percent transparent and legible” spending of public funds. “Diella is the first cabinet member who isn’t physically present, but is virtually created by AI,” Rama said in his speech. “She is the servant of public procurement.” The prime minister stressed that decisions on tenders would gradually move “step by step” under Diella’s authority, transforming Albania into a country where public tenders are fully immune to bribery and manipulation. Diella’s role will also include evaluating bids, hiring experts from around the world, and breaking down “the fear of prejudice and rigidity of the administration,” according to Rama . Diella is central to Albania’s long-running effort to align itself with European Union standards. The EU has repeatedly criticized the country for corruption in public administration and procurement, and Rama, who was re-elected in May on a promise to join the bloc by 2030, said Diella’s appointment demonstrates Albania’s willingness to innovate. Praise and skepticism follow Diella’s appointment While the government has promoted Diella as a tool for transparency, her appointment has already sparked debate at home. On social media, some users expressed doubt that even a virtual minister could remain immune from corruption. One Facebook commenter quipped, “Even Diella will be corrupted in Albania.” Another added, “Stealing will continue and Diella will be blamed.” Concerns have also been raised about the supervision of and accountability for Diella. Rama did not provide details on what human supervision will accompany Diella’s decisions, or how the system could guard against manipulation of the AI itself. Diella is not entirely new to Albanians. She first appeared earlier this year as an AI-powered assistant on the government’s e-Albania digital platform, which citizens use to obtain state documents. Her avatar responds to voice commands, issues documents with electronic stamps, and aims to cut bureaucratic delays. Diella’s appointment was announced a day before Albania’s newly elected parliament was set to convene. It remains uncertain whether Rama’s cabinet, including its virtual member, will be formally voted on immediately. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Alibaba and Baidu are reportedly ditching Nvidia’s processors and utilizing home-made solutions, with Alibaba training smaller AI models with its in-house processors. Baidu is also testing the waters with its latest Kunlun P800 chip on more advanced versions of its Ernie model. However, it highlights the progress and seriousness that Chinese firms are putting into making chip designs and the urgency created by U.S. export restrictions that have curbed access to Nvidia’s most advanced processors. Breaking reliance on U.S. hardware Over the years, Chinese companies building large-scale AI systems have relied heavily on Nvidia’s hardware, particularly the H100 and its successors. Nvidia is the market leader in the GPU space, known to be part of the critical infrastructure components in the AI boom. However, Chinese companies can’t get their hands on the most advanced Nvidia chips, as the U.S. government has progressively tightened the noose around getting those chips, citing national security reasons. However, last month, Cryptopolitan reported that Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said he was discussing with Washington to push for the sale of some advanced versions of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips. Despite this, it still seems that the most powerful models remain off limits. The restrictions have accelerated Beijing’s push to develop a domestic semiconductor ecosystem, backed by billions of dollars in state subsidies and pressure on national champions to cut reliance on U.S. suppliers. Alibaba’s Zhenwu and Baidu’s Kunlun chips Alibaba’s semiconductor arm has designed the Zhenwu processing unit to support cloud-based AI workloads. Baidu has been working with its own Kunlun line of AI accelerators. The latest P800 version is being used to train newer versions of Ernie, the company’s flagship large language model. Baidu has also positioned Kunlun as both a cost-saving tool and a hedge against foreign sanctions. For now the switch is partial as both companies still continue to rely on Nvidia chips for their most advanced systems, especially those involving very large training runs where performance gaps remain. But the willingness work with Chinese-made alternatives in production environments is a major step in the move away from American tech. Implications for global AI competition For Nvidia, the development is a warning sign as China has been its largest overseas market. A successful move away from the America chipmaker by Chinese firms to home-grown GPUs could end demand for U.S. chips and greatly impact Nvidia’s market share and balance book, even when import restrictions are removed. For Alibaba and Baidu, the ability to design and control their own hardware could lower costs and help them align with Beijing’s industrial policies. Matching Nvidia is still a longshot, but it’s looking closer with the latest development. The firms still have to match Nvidia’s performance and ecosystem support, which boasts advanced software frameworks such as CUDA. Get seen where it counts.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has made a significant move, rising three points from yesterday to a notable 57. This shift propels it from the neutral zone directly into ‘greed territory,’ according to data from Alternative. This development is a clear signal: investor sentiment is improving, and the market is buzzing with renewed optimism. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? To truly grasp the significance of this shift, let’s break down what the Crypto Fear & Greed Index represents. This unique indicator acts as a barometer for market sentiment, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme optimism). It’s not just a random number; it’s a sophisticated calculation designed to capture the emotional state of cryptocurrency investors. The index relies on a combination of six key market factors, each contributing to its overall score. Understanding these components provides a deeper insight into how market psychology is measured: Volatility (25%): This factor measures current Bitcoin price fluctuations and maximum drawdowns, comparing them to average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility can indicate a fearful market. Market Volume (25%): It compares current trading volume and market momentum to average values. High buying volume in a positive market often suggests greed. Social Media (15%): This component analyzes keywords, hashtags, and sentiment on platforms like Twitter, looking for mentions and interactions related to cryptocurrencies. Increased positive mentions can signal rising greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) These polls ask investors directly about their market outlook, providing a direct measure of sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market cap dominance can indicate a flight to safety, often seen during fearful periods, as investors move away from altcoins. A decrease might suggest increased risk appetite. Google Trends (10%): This examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ searches, for example, might indicate fear, while ‘buy Bitcoin’ searches suggest greed. Why Has the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Moved into Greed? The recent three-point jump to 57 isn’t just a number; it reflects a tangible change in how investors perceive the market. This surge indicates that the collective mood has shifted from cautious neutrality to a more adventurous, optimistic stance. What drives such a rapid change? Several factors likely contributed to this upward trend. It could be influenced by positive news cycles, such as institutional adoption announcements, successful blockchain upgrades, or even a sustained period of stable or rising asset prices. When the market shows resilience and potential for growth, investor confidence naturally improves, leading to higher buying pressure and increased enthusiasm. What Does ‘Greed Territory’ Mean for Your Investments? Reaching 57 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market firmly in ‘greed territory.’ While this might sound positive, it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it signifies strong buying interest and potential for further price appreciation. Investors are feeling confident, often leading to upward price momentum. However, ‘greed’ can also be a warning sign. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections. When everyone is optimistic, the market can become overextended, and a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) can drive irrational decisions. This is where vigilance becomes crucial. Smart investors understand that the market’s mood is cyclical. While a rising index can be encouraging, it also necessitates a disciplined approach. It’s a time to re-evaluate portfolios, consider taking profits, or at least avoid making impulsive decisions driven purely by emotion. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index So, how can you effectively use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in your investment strategy? It’s not a buy or sell signal in itself, but rather a powerful sentiment indicator. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: Some investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. When the index shows extreme fear, it might be a good time to consider buying (when others are fearful). Conversely, when it shows extreme greed, it might be a time to consider selling or reducing exposure (when others are greedy). Risk Management: A high greed score can be a prompt to review your risk exposure. Are you over-allocated to volatile assets? This might be a good moment to secure some gains or set stricter stop-loss orders. Avoid FOMO: When the market is greedy, there’s a strong temptation to jump into rapidly rising assets. The index serves as a reminder to stick to your investment plan and avoid impulse buying. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, the index provides context. Short-term fluctuations in sentiment are normal. It helps distinguish between genuine market shifts and emotional surges. The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 57 and its entry into greed territory is undoubtedly a positive sign for current market sentiment. It reflects increased investor confidence and a more optimistic outlook for cryptocurrencies. However, this shift also carries an important reminder: while optimism is welcome, it should always be balanced with caution and a well-defined strategy. By understanding the underlying factors and historical patterns of this crucial index, investors can make more informed decisions, navigating the dynamic crypto landscape with greater wisdom. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), based on various market factors. Q2: What does it mean when the index is in ‘greed territory’? When the index is in ‘greed territory’ (typically above 50), it indicates high investor optimism and confidence. While this can lead to price rallies, it can also signal a market that might be becoming overextended and prone to corrections. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily by Alternative, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment each day. Q4: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a direct buy or sell signal? No, the index is not a direct buy or sell signal. It’s a sentiment indicator that should be used as one of many tools in your analysis to understand market psychology and inform your investment decisions. Q5: What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is calculated using a weighted average of volatility, market volume, social media sentiment, surveys, Bitcoin’s market dominance, and Google search trends.

While Bitcoin continues to hover near elevated levels, liquidity in smaller tokens has thinned and investor sentiment has cooled. Macroeconomic pressures, including fresh US labor data showing weaker job creation, have intensified concerns that equities and digital assets alike may be sitting on fragile ground. For many traders, this environment has begun to resemble a trap: apparent stability masking deeper structural risks. Yet, even within this cautious atmosphere, certain corners of crypto are breaking away from the slump. Meme-driven platforms like MemeCore, creative launchpads such as Pump.fun, and emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving that innovation and cultural resonance can outperform broad market hesitation. MemeCore captures attention with on-chain creativity MemeCore has become a surprise standout during this market slowdown. Positioned as a creative hub for meme-driven tokens, the platform has attracted a surge of developers experimenting with culture-based coin launches. Analysts note that MemeCore’s rise reflects a deeper shift: in times of uncertainty, communities gravitate toward narratives that are simple, relatable, and engaging. By lowering barriers for creators and amplifying viral engagement, MemeCore has positioned itself as more than a speculative playground. Instead, it functions as a testing ground for the next generation of meme-coin concepts. Even as trading volumes in large-cap assets flatten, MemeCore continues to add new projects daily, keeping investor interest alive in an otherwise quiet sector. Strategic capital rotates toward MAGACOIN FINANCE The persistence of MemeCore and Pump.fun highlights a critical point: even in bearish or sideways markets, pockets of opportunity emerge where cultural branding and scarcity intersect. This dynamic sets the stage for MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining recognition as one of 2025’s breakout contenders. What distinguishes MAGACOIN FINANCE is its mix of scarcity and momentum: rapid sellouts in earlier rounds, a swelling community base, and strong alignment with cultural branding that resonates well beyond crypto’s core audience. Analysts suggest that such early traction could mirror past cycles where seemingly niche projects multiplied in value as mainstream awareness arrived. In fact, forecasts position MAGACOIN FINANCE among the rare altcoins capable of 50×–90× upside if momentum continues to compound. In a market where mining margins are shrinking and large caps offer limited multiples, speculative capital appears to be rotating toward precisely this type of early-stage launch. Pump.fun redefines grassroots token launches Another project bucking the downtrend is Pump.fun, the Solana-based launchpad that has quickly become synonymous with grassroots crypto culture. Its no-code interface and frictionless deployment tools have empowered thousands of micro-communities to launch tokens with little more than an idea and a network. While critics question the sustainability of such rapid token creation, Pump.fun has demonstrated that participation and creativity remain potent forces even when liquidity is tight. Notably, user activity has soared on the platform, with on-chain data confirming wallet growth despite the broader slump. By democratizing access to token creation, Pump.fun highlights that innovation in crypto often thrives at the edges, where risk-taking and experimentation define the culture. Broader implications for altcoin markets The ability of these projects to attract liquidity while most of the sector drifts sideways reveals a pattern long observed in crypto: innovation often accelerates when traditional strategies stall. Bitcoin miners, for instance, now face higher break-even costs, while Ethereum struggles with scaling challenges despite ETF inflows. Against that backdrop, lightweight, culture-driven platforms are proving more agile in capturing attention. The Fed’s looming rate cuts only add fuel to this trend. Historically, monetary easing has driven risk-on flows toward altcoins, and analysts expect the same dynamic to re-emerge once liquidity conditions improve. When that shift occurs, projects already building momentum, MemeCore, Pump.fun, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, are positioned to ride the first wave of renewed speculative capital. Why these projects stand out The “why” behind their resilience comes down to accessibility, community, and legitimacy. MemeCore thrives by making meme creation collaborative and viral, Pump.fun succeeds by lowering technical barriers for token launches, and MAGACOIN FINANCE differentiates itself through strong audits, scarcity, and community traction. Together, they demonstrate that crypto’s cultural heartbeat remains strong even during downturns. Investors may interpret these signals as a preview of where capital will flow once the broader market stabilizes. With institutions locked into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the outsized multiples often emerge in niches where community, branding, and scarcity converge, exactly the spaces these projects occupy. Why MemeCore, Pump.fun and MAGACOIN FINANCE are defying the slump Innovation Over Stagnation: While most of the market drifts sideways, these projects keep evolving, MemeCore with creative on-chain memes, Pump.fun with accessible token launches, and MAGACOIN FINANCE with its audited framework. Accessible Entry: Each platform lowers barriers, whether through low-cost tokens, no-code deployment tools, or affordable allocations that invite wider participation. Asymmetric Upside: Analysts highlight the potential for outsized returns as liquidity seeks new narratives, positioning these names as outliers in a cautious market. Together, they showcase how cultural resonance, security, and accessibility can combine to outpace the broader slump. Conclusion While the broader crypto market has slowed, innovation continues to flourish at the edges. MemeCore and Pump.fun highlight the enduring appeal of community-driven creativity, while MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates how legitimacy, scarcity, and momentum can align to create breakout potential. Also MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as one of the most high-rewarding launches of 2025, a sharp contrast to the fragility weighing on mainstream markets. For investors searching for opportunities beyond the stock market’s “trap” conditions, these projects may signal the next cycle’s most dynamic performers.

This bold investment strategy by a publicly traded company is sending ripples across the market, prompting many to consider the evolving landscape of corporate cryptocurrency adoption. Cleancore’s Expanding Dogecoin Portfolio: What’s the Latest? Cleancore Solutions recently made headlines with its announcement of a substantial investment in Dogecoin (DOGE). The company’s initial purchase of 285 million DOGE, valued at approximately $68 million, was just the beginning. In a rapid development, Cleancore’s Cleancore Dogecoin holdings have nearly doubled in less than three days, now reaching an impressive 500 million DOGE. This rapid accumulation underscores Cleancore’s commitment to its previously stated intention: to acquire up to $1 billion in DOGE within the next 30 days. Such an aggressive purchasing plan highlights a growing trend of institutional players exploring digital assets beyond traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why the Sudden Interest in Cleancore Dogecoin Holdings? The decision by a company like Cleancore to pour significant capital into Dogecoin raises important questions. While DOGE started as a meme coin, its large and active community, coupled with high-profile endorsements, has given it considerable market visibility. Cleancore’s strategy appears to be a calculated move to capitalize on Dogecoin’s unique market position and potential for future growth. Market Visibility: Dogecoin benefits from widespread recognition and a dedicated following. Potential for Volatility: While risky, DOGE’s volatility can also present opportunities for significant gains for large investors. Diversification: For a company already exploring digital assets, Dogecoin offers a different risk/reward profile compared to other cryptocurrencies. Understanding the motivations behind such substantial Cleancore Dogecoin holdings is key to grasping the broader implications for both corporate finance and the crypto market. What are the Implications of Cleancore’s Dogecoin Strategy? Cleancore’s burgeoning Cleancore Dogecoin holdings could set a precedent for other corporations. When a NYSE-listed company makes such a public and significant bet on a meme coin, it lends a certain level of legitimacy that could encourage further institutional adoption. This move suggests a shift in how traditional businesses view digital assets, moving beyond just store-of-value narratives to embrace potentially more speculative, yet high-growth, opportunities. However, this strategy also comes with inherent risks: Market Volatility: Dogecoin’s price is highly susceptible to market sentiment and social media trends. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased corporate involvement in cryptocurrencies could invite greater regulatory attention. Public Perception: The investment could be viewed as either innovative or overly speculative by shareholders and the public. The success or failure of Cleancore’s investment could significantly influence future corporate crypto strategies. The Future Outlook for Cleancore Dogecoin Holdings With Cleancore’s stated goal of acquiring up to $1 billion in DOGE, the market will be closely watching its next moves. This aggressive accumulation highlights a belief in Dogecoin’s long-term potential, or at least its short-to-medium term growth trajectory. As the company continues to build its Cleancore Dogecoin holdings , it could influence DOGE’s price action and overall market sentiment. This situation also serves as a compelling case study for investors interested in the intersection of traditional finance and the rapidly evolving crypto space. It exemplifies how established companies are beginning to navigate and participate in the digital asset economy, pushing the boundaries of conventional investment portfolios. In conclusion, Cleancore Solutions’ dramatic increase in Cleancore Dogecoin holdings to 500 million DOGE marks a pivotal moment in corporate crypto adoption. This significant investment by a NYSE-listed company underscores a growing willingness among traditional businesses to explore and embrace digital assets, even those with more unconventional origins. While the strategy carries inherent risks, it also presents a fascinating case study for the future of institutional engagement with the cryptocurrency market, potentially paving the way for further corporate ventures into the world of digital finance.

The exchange argues that the disappearance of these communications violates court orders and undermines public trust in the regulator’s transparency and accountability. The records vanished between October 2022 and September 2023, when the crypto market suffered from notable developments such as FTX’s downfall and numerous major enforcement proceedings against Coinbase, the company involved in the protests. For critics of the SEC, missing these communications couldn’t have happened at a more essential moment, as the texts could have provided insights into how the agency assessed Ethereum, implemented enforcement strategies, and influenced its broader policy position toward digital assets. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the SEC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigation revealed that Gensler’s text messages were lost due to an internal policy that remotely wipes agency devices left offline for more than 45 days. Gensler’s phone was reset when the policy was triggered, erasing all its text communications. Subsequently, investigators found that many deleted texts would have qualified as official federal records and should have been retained under existing rules. Instead, the OIG report emphasized that the incident was not a single incident of poor technical decision-making but instead the culmination of systemic shortcomings, including poorly tested device management protocols and poorly designed backup systems, coupled with failed warnings that should have alerted the system that the data might be at stake. Coinbase presses for legal penalties and transparency Coinbase’s filing alleged the SEC violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and a court order in the past. The company filed claims that the agency carried out excessively narrow searches, delayed production of documents, and did not disclose the record loss until long after it had occurred. These failures undermined a fair consideration of how the SEC constructed its policies regarding Ethereum and other digital assets, leaving the public with an incomplete picture of the regulators’ decision-making process at a time of unprecedented unrest in the space, Coinbase said. The exchange reported that it has been especially worrying that such records were missing at the time of FTX’s demise, as well as a series of sweeping enforcement actions in the crypto world. In a potential redress, Coinbase is requesting the court to not only sanction the abusers but also to facilitate expedited discovery, to reveal the extent of the record losses, what (if anything) the SEC has done to reclaim the communications, and why the regulator hasn’t been quick to disclose the deletions to the investors. Coinbase says the SEC should be held to the same principles that it uses against the private sector, with the agency having fined the system over a billion dollars in recent years for violating reasonable business recordkeeping trust. SEC faces crisis of trust over recordkeeping Meanwhile, the aftermath of those erasures leaves many questions, like transparency and accountability, about the world’s most powerful financial regulator. It’s a blow that puts the SEC’s credibility under serious pressure, especially when the erased texts would have exposed internal deliberations about oversight of the burgeoning cryptocurrency space. Without these records, Congress, courts, and the public could have difficulty grasping how the agency dealt with enforcement and policy development as the industry was rocked by major upheaval. The SEC has already tried to contain more harm, turning off text messaging on an array of agency devices, warning the National Archives, and promising to fortify its recordkeeping systems. But for some, those moves are a reaction after the issue had reached public scandal rather than something proactive that would have averted the loss. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

A massive Bitcoin options expiry event is unfolding, with over $3.4 billion worth of contracts set to settle. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a crucial juncture that could influence market sentiment and potentially spark volatility across the digital asset landscape. Alongside Bitcoin, a substantial $850 million in Ethereum options are also expiring, making today a key day for crypto traders and investors alike. What is a Bitcoin Options Expiry and Why Does It Matter? At its core, an options contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiry date). When that date arrives, these contracts either settle, are exercised, or expire worthless. Call options grant the right to buy. Put options grant the right to sell. A large-scale Bitcoin options expiry can significantly impact the market because institutional players and market makers, who often write these options, need to adjust their hedges as contracts approach expiry. This unwinding or rebalancing of positions can create buying or selling pressure, leading to price fluctuations. Understanding Key Terms: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain To fully grasp the implications of a Bitcoin options expiry , it’s helpful to understand two key metrics: The put/call ratio indicates the sentiment of options traders. It’s calculated by dividing the total number of open put options by the total number of open call options. A ratio above 1 suggests a more bearish sentiment, as more traders are betting on price declines. Conversely, a ratio below 1 hints at a bullish outlook. The max pain price is a theoretical strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts (both puts and calls) would expire worthless. In essence, it’s the price point that causes maximum financial loss for the majority of option holders and maximum gain for option writers. While not a guaranteed price target, it can sometimes act as a magnet for the underlying asset’s price as expiry approaches, as market participants adjust their positions. The Imminent $3.4 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry Today, specifically at 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 12, Bitcoin options with a staggering notional value of $3.42 billion are set to expire. Data from crypto options exchange Deribit highlights the scale of this event. For these Bitcoin contracts: The put/call ratio stands at 1.31 , indicating a slight bearish lean among options traders for this specific expiry. The calculated max pain price is $113,000 . It’s important to note that while max pain is a theoretical magnet, this figure is significantly higher than current market prices, suggesting many of these contracts might be deeply out-of-the-money or were opened during different market conditions. Such a substantial expiry volume often leads to increased scrutiny and potential market shifts, as market participants react to the settlement of these contracts. Ethereum’s Significant $850 Million Options Expiry Not to be overshadowed, Ethereum options valued at $850 million are also scheduled to expire at the very same time. Ethereum’s derivatives market has grown considerably, and its expiries also carry significant weight. For these Ethereum contracts: The put/call ratio is 1.02 , suggesting a more balanced, almost neutral sentiment between bullish and bearish bets. The max pain price is $4,400 . Similar to Bitcoin’s figure, this is a theoretical point far above Ethereum’s current trading levels, reflecting the nature of options contracts written over various timeframes and price expectations. The simultaneous expiry of both Bitcoin and Ethereum options could amplify overall market reactions, as these two assets often move in tandem. What Could Happen After This Crucial Bitcoin Options Expiry? The immediate aftermath of a large Bitcoin options expiry can be unpredictable. Here are some potential scenarios and actionable insights: Increased Volatility: Market makers might unwind or re-establish their hedges, leading to increased price fluctuations around the expiry time. Price Magnet Effect: While the max pain price of $113,000 for Bitcoin is far from current levels, historically, prices can sometimes gravitate towards max pain. However, for this particular expiry, its influence might be limited given the vast difference from spot prices. Sentiment Shift: The put/call ratio of 1.31 for Bitcoin suggests a slightly cautious outlook. If market participants act on this sentiment, it could lead to short-term downward pressure or consolidation. Actionable Insights for Traders: Monitor Price Action: Pay close attention to Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements immediately before and after 8:00 a.m. UTC. Risk Management: Given the potential for volatility, consider adjusting stop-loss orders or reducing position sizes if you’re actively trading. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: Large expiries can create noise. It’s often wise to wait for the market to digest the event before making significant trading moves. In conclusion, today’s colossal Bitcoin options expiry , coupled with a substantial Ethereum expiry, presents a pivotal moment for the crypto market. While the max pain prices are theoretical and high, the sheer volume of expiring contracts could trigger significant market movements. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the potential volatility and making informed decisions in the evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly happens when Bitcoin options expire? When Bitcoin options expire, contracts that are ‘in-the-money’ (meaning profitable for the holder) are typically exercised or settled, while ‘out-of-the-money’ contracts expire worthless. This settlement process can lead to market participants adjusting their positions, potentially causing price movements in Bitcoin. Q2: How does the put/call ratio influence the market after a Bitcoin options expiry? A high put/call ratio (like Bitcoin’s 1.31 for this expiry) indicates that more put options (bets on price decline) are open than call options (bets on price increase). This can signal a bearish sentiment among options traders. After expiry, if this sentiment is strong, it might contribute to downward pressure or cautious trading behavior. Q3: What is the significance of the max pain price in an options expiry? The max pain price is the theoretical price point where the most options contracts expire worthless, causing maximum loss for option holders. While not a guaranteed target, some analysts believe the underlying asset’s price can gravitate towards this point as expiry approaches, as market makers manage their risks. Q4: How does Ethereum’s options expiry compare to Bitcoin’s in terms of impact? While Bitcoin’s expiry volume is larger ($3.4B vs. $850M), Ethereum’s expiry is still substantial. Both events occurring simultaneously can create a combined effect, potentially amplifying overall market volatility, especially since their price movements are often correlated. Q5: Should I buy or sell Bitcoin before a major options expiry? Options expiry events typically increase market uncertainty and volatility. There’s no single recommended action to buy or sell. Instead, it’s crucial to monitor market conditions, assess your risk tolerance, and consider waiting for the market to stabilize after the expiry before making significant trading decisions.

The Altcoin Season Index has recently climbed to a significant 65. This upward movement suggests a shift in the crypto market, where alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, are starting to show impressive strength compared to Bitcoin. Understanding what this index signifies is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, serves as a vital barometer for the broader altcoin market. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against the performance of Bitcoin. Essentially, it tells us how well altcoins are doing relative to the market leader. How it’s Calculated: The index compares the price performance of these top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. What it Indicates: A higher reading, closer to 100, suggests that a larger percentage of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Why is the Altcoin Season Index at 65 a Big Deal? Yesterday, the Altcoin Season Index stood at 62, and its jump to 65 indicates a noticeable increase in altcoin dominance. While an official “altcoin season” is declared when 75% of these top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, a reading of 65 means we are steadily moving in that direction. This rising trend often signals growing investor interest and capital flow into altcoins, potentially leading to significant price appreciation across various projects. This metric is more than just a number; it reflects evolving market sentiment. When Bitcoin consolidates or experiences slower growth, capital often flows into altcoins, which can offer higher percentage gains due to their smaller market caps. This shift creates exciting opportunities for diversified portfolios. Are We Nearing a Full Altcoin Season? The journey to a full altcoin season requires the Altcoin Season Index to reach 75. At 65, we are certainly closer than before, but not quite there yet. This current phase could be described as a strong “altcoin accumulation” or “pre-season” period. Investors often use this time to research and position themselves in promising altcoin projects before a broader market surge. Identifying an altcoin season involves observing several factors beyond just the index: Market Dominance: Bitcoin’s market dominance typically decreases during an altcoin season. Trading Volume: Increased trading volume in altcoins compared to Bitcoin. Project Developments: Significant updates and adoption news from various altcoin projects. Navigating the Opportunities: What Should Investors Consider with the Altcoin Season Index? The rising Altcoin Season Index presents both opportunities and challenges for investors. While the potential for high returns is attractive, it is crucial to approach altcoin investing with a well-thought-out strategy. Volatility can be higher in altcoins, and thorough research is paramount. Actionable Insights for Investors: Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, consider a diversified portfolio across different altcoin sectors (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions). Research Fundamentals: Look beyond hype. Investigate a project’s whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and community support. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders and take profits strategically to manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, project updates, and broader economic trends that could impact crypto. The Future of Altcoins: What’s Next for the Altcoin Season Index? The current upward trend in the Altcoin Season Index suggests a bullish outlook for many alternative cryptocurrencies. As the crypto ecosystem continues to mature, altcoins play an increasingly vital role in innovation and expanding the utility of blockchain technology. Whether this momentum carries us to a full-fledged altcoin season remains to be seen, but the signs are certainly encouraging. Staying informed and strategic will be key to capitalizing on these evolving market conditions. The crypto landscape is ever-changing, and adaptability is a valuable asset for any investor. In conclusion, the ascent of the Altcoin Season Index to 65 is a compelling indicator of growing strength among altcoins. While not yet a full altcoin season, it signals a period ripe with potential. By understanding the index, conducting diligent research, and managing risks effectively, investors can position themselves to potentially benefit from this exciting market shift. The journey of altcoins continues to unfold, promising innovation and opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index?

Choosing between a hot wallet for convenience or a cold wallet for maximum security often depends on personal strategy and risk tolerance. Both options have their place in the journey of building wealth, and understanding how to balance them is key. At the same time, investors are also learning that security and trust don’t stop at storage, they begin with the projects themselves. That’s why tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, already audited and drawing strong attention, are being recognized as examples of how credibility can matter just as much as custody choices. Hot wallets: convenience with risks Hot wallets are software applications or browser extensions connected to the internet. They are popular for everyday use, offering investors quick access to send, swap, or stake tokens. Most decentralized applications (dApps) rely on hot wallets like MetaMask, Phantom, or Trust Wallet. The upside is clear: instant transactions, integration with DeFi, and ease of use. For traders who move in and out of positions frequently, hot wallets are nearly indispensable. The downside is also obvious: exposure to online threats. Phishing attacks, malware, and exchange breaches have repeatedly demonstrated that hot wallets carry heightened risk. While non-custodial wallets give investors control of their keys, the simple fact of being connected to the internet makes them vulnerable. Cold wallets: security above all Cold wallets, by contrast, are offline storage devices, typically hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, or even paper wallets generated and stored securely. By disconnecting private keys from the internet, they dramatically reduce exposure to hacks. For long-term holders, cold wallets are the gold standard. Investors with large positions often use them as vaults, keeping the bulk of their assets offline while maintaining smaller amounts in hot wallets for daily activity. Cold wallets aren’t perfect. They require careful handling, proper backups, and safe storage. Losing a recovery phrase can mean losing access permanently. But when it comes to security, cold wallets remain unmatched. Institutional adoption highlights the divide As institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Coinbase Custody expand into crypto, the hot vs cold wallet debate is shaping their infrastructure. Most institutions rely on multi-signature cold storage solutions, blending offline security with layers of redundancy. These services aim to protect billions in assets while still enabling controlled access when needed. For retail investors, this serves as a reminder: if institutions aren’t leaving their assets in hot wallets, why should individuals? Security standards in traditional finance are rising, and crypto investors who ignore them risk being left exposed. Amid this security discussion, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn attention not only for its explosive upside potential but also for its commitment to credibility. In a presale environment where many projects skip safeguards, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already completed audits with HashEx and CertiK. This step matters. Investors consistently cite trust as a deciding factor, especially when allocating early to projects priced at fractions of a cent. At just $0.00044, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers affordability and narrative power. But it’s the audits that set it apart, signaling that the team is serious about protecting its investors and establishing legitimacy in a high-risk sector. Analysts now forecast that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 48× or more in returns, fueled by scarcity, branding, and surging retail demand. Yet the project’s emphasis on being vetted and transparent is what resonates most in today’s climate, especially as investors weigh how and where to store their assets. Just as cold wallets provide security in custody, audited projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide security in allocation. Choosing the right mix So, which is safer: hot wallets or cold wallets? The answer lies in balancing convenience and protection. Most experienced investors use a combination: Hot wallets for small balances, trading, and quick DeFi interactions. Cold wallets for long-term storage and larger amounts. By dividing holdings between the two, investors reduce risk while maintaining flexibility. For example, an investor might keep 90% of their assets offline and 10% in hot wallets for daily use. In the same way, portfolio allocation mirrors this balance: stable projects like Ethereum and Solana provide credibility, while high-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE add growth potential. Security and opportunity go hand in hand. Best practices for wallet safety Beyond choosing hot or cold, there are practical steps every investor should follow: Back up recovery phrases securely, offline, and in multiple locations. Use hardware wallets for long-term holdings. Beware of phishing attempts, always verify URLs and smart contracts. Enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Diversify storage across wallets and providers to reduce single points of failure. These measures, combined with the right wallet choice, can protect investors from the most common pitfalls. Conclusion The debate between hot and cold wallets reflects the larger challenge of crypto: balancing convenience with security. Hot wallets are essential for fast-moving traders, but they expose assets to greater risk. Cold wallets offer unmatched protection, but require discipline and careful handling. For investors serious about safeguarding their wealth, the safest approach is using both, just as institutions do. And when it comes to choosing tokens, the same principle applies: mix proven networks with high-upside but credible newcomers. That’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE, audited, affordable, and forecasted for 48× growth, is gaining traction. In a market where winners separate themselves through both opportunity and trust, it represents the kind of project that could define the both characteristics.

Among them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is generating buzz with its innovative lending and borrowing model, sparking rumors of a potential 40x value boost. This new altcoin, currently at a tiny $0.035, has seen more than $16,200 hungry investors buy into it. With meme tokens like PEPE under growing pressure in a falling market, DeFi sector utility-driven assets are being considered more and more as the future of growth and investor confidence to be maintained. Pepe Coin Swings Between $0.0000107 Amid Falling Meme Sentiment Pepe Coin (PEPE) is valued at approximately $0.0000107 USD, with day-to-day activity enjoying consistent action around this price. Short-term technicals forecast an 87% potential increase if initial support around $0.0000122 holds, with target areas around $0.0000227, though overall meme coin attitude is downbeat and some expectations see only marginal near-term action below $0.0000267. As meme tokens like PEPE face pressure from shifting sentiment, attention is developing on emerging DeFi initiatives like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 FOMO You can join Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with a presale investment at $0.035 per token today. More than 16,200 unique buyers have already jumped onto the opportunity, which has seen the project attain a massive $15.6M raise. This rapid rise is a strong vote of confidence on what the team is building. The team also recently collaborated with Certik on the official audit of the project, as well as an ongoing bug hunt. They’ve allocated a $50,000 USDT reward that will go to bug hunters who spot possible weaknesses within the project’s code. Price Discovery Precise price data is needed to make borrowing, lending, and liquidation secure. Chainlink oracles are used by Mutuum Finance to provide the system with market prices in USD and local tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feed data, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange rates are also used by the system to keep valuations as precise under stress. Managing Volatility and Exposure Volatility in the market is translated one-to-one to collateral management within the protocol. Mutuum Finance differentiates between Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation points depending on the stability of each token. The allowance and borrowing value are higher for stronger, more stable tokens, while riskier tokens have lower values. Reserve multipliers are applied proportionally ranging from around 10% for lower-volatility assets to up to 35% for riskier assets, creating a default protection margin without capping participation diversification. The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol allows clients to actively manage their capital by means of passive lending and borrowing, with the hope of allowing borrowers to borrow against piles of securitised assets. The system stabilization algorithm and interest rate optimization algorithms are implemented within the system, with the hope of making the system efficient as well as long-term capital usage. Risk and Liquidity Management The protocol actively controls market liquidity and volatility to facilitate closure of distressed positions. Risk exposure must be kept within pre-defined limits, and liquidation settings are established. Assets such as ETH and stablecoins may offer higher Loan-to-Value levels, while riskier assets are supplied with lower ones. Reserve factors are distributed proportionally across all classes of tokens to manage asset opportunity vs. risk to achieve maximum overall protection of protocol holdings.

Technical indicators now hint at a potential rally, with the meme coin attracting renewed attention from investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.50? This Channel Break Could Be The Catalyst The 20-day EMA near $0.225, alongside the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day averages clustered below $0.220, highlight a strong support zone. With the RSI at 60–61, DOGE shows steady buying momentum without being overbought. Similarly, the MACD histogram has turned positive, signaling a resurgence in bullish sentiment following muted August trading. Resistance at $0.25 Could Unlock Higher Targets Dogecoin’s short-term trajectory hinges on whether it can close above $0.246–$0.250, a level where both resistance and Bollinger Bands converge. A confirmed breakout may clear the path toward $0.263, $0.273–$0.276, and the July high of $0.300. Support sits at $0.238–$0.240, with deeper levels near $0.233–$0.231 and the 20-day EMA at $0.225. Any drop below the 100/200-day cluster around $0.214–$0.213 would weaken the bullish setup. Market analysts also note Dogecoin’s parallel channel pattern, with resistance near $0.29. A breakout here could potentially extend gains beyond $0.3 to as far as $0.50, based on the measured width of the channel. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart.

51575690,579288,1757638827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51575690.jpeg,Will Solana Launch Its Own Stablecoin? Helius CEO Calls It A No-Brainer,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-stablecoin-helius-ceo-calls-it-a-no-brainer/,"Helius Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz ignited a fresh round of debate inside the Solana ecosystem on September 10 after floating the idea of a Solana-aligned stablecoin whose reserve yield would be redirected to SOL via buybacks or burns—either as an “enshrined” protocol feature or, more likely, through competing digital-asset treasury companies (DATs). “Warming up to the idea that Solana should enshrine a stablecoin,” he wrote, adding that “50% burn of the yield goes back to burning SOL.” Hours later, he reframed the thrust: “it shouldn’t be enshrined, a DAT should do it… fix it and trillions.” Why A Solana Stablecoin Is A No-Brainer Mumtaz’s core critique targets what he describes as “yield leakage” from Solana: “Stablecoins are commodities, and currently on Solana, there is one that captures all yield and literally funds Solana’s biggest competitor with it!” He argued that, under the US GENIUS Act, stables are readily swappable and issuers will fight aggressively for market share—citing the recent “Bachelor-style” scramble among large stablecoin companies to court business. “If you don’t want to enshrine a Solana-centric stable, then consider digital asset treasury companies (DATs)… The DAT is literally a machine for buying the underlying token.” That framing collides with the letter of the new US law. The GENIUS Act , signed in July, carves out “payment stablecoins” as neither securities nor commodities for US federal purposes, consolidating oversight largely under banking regulators and expressly separating them from SEC/CFTC jurisdiction. Multiple legal analyses and a Congressional Research Service note affirm the statute’s classification. In short: Mumtaz’s “commodity” phrasing is rhetorical, not legal. Still, the law’s most consequential economic detail—stablecoins cannot pass interest to holders—means issuers (or affiliated structures) capture the reserve income and can decide how to use it. That’s precisely the lever Mumtaz wants pointed back at Solana. Within hours, one builder publicly accepted the challenge. “We (@KASTcard) will put 101–103% of all interest income from USDK on Solana, to buyback SOL,” wrote CEO and co-founder of KAST, adding that the buybacks would sit with a foundation that issues a token after a planned TGE and that USDK would be issued with the m^0 foundation as a U.S. “Genius compliant” stable. The 1–3% kicker above 100% would be treated as marketing spend. KAST and m^0 have previously disclosed plans to launch programmable, application-specific dollars on the networl; KAST’s consumer app and card already target global stablecoin payments. The proposal’s mechanics are straightforward in concept. A native USD stablecoin accrues reserve yield (e.g., from T-bills) at the issuer level; a DAT structure then commits that income stream to buy SOL on the open market and either retire it or recycle it into ecosystem programs. Mumtaz even sketched a toy model—“Assume a Solana DAT runs a Solana stable, call it USDmanlet… [it] earns yield. The DAT takes all the yield and buys SOL with it… embed it in the ecosystem and take the yield and pump it back… or into burning SOL.” Stablecoin Wars Reach Solana Mumtaz’s “funding the competitor” barb is aimed squarely at USDC’s economics and Coinbase’s Base L2. Coinbase and Circle split USDC reserve income, a line item that has grown into a major revenue stream for Coinbase as stablecoin supply has rebounded; Coinbase incubated Base, an Ethereum Layer-2 that has quickly become a high-throughput venue for on-chain activity. None of that is nefarious—USDC’s terms are clear—but for Solana purists it is strategically suboptimal to let billions in Solana-settled stablecoin activity originate issuer profits that are then reinvested in a rival’s stack. That is the “simple problem” Mumtaz says he wants to fix, whether by enshrining or (more plausibly) by market-driven competition among issuers and DATs. Multicoin Capital co-founder and managing partner Tushar Jain agreed via X: “One of the best things about Solana’s culture is adopting good ideas from other ecosystems. Hyperliquid’s idea to encourage stablecoin issuers to buy HYPE with USDH interest is a powerful way to drive REV. Why should Circle keep all of the interest revenue from USDC on Solana?” For now, this is only a proposal—there is no SIP or governance vote to “enshrine” anything at the protocol layer, and Mumtaz himself emphasized the market-driven DAT route. Whether the proposal takes the form of competing issuers pledging buybacks, a canonical “ecosystem stable,” or a more modular treasury program, the endgame Mumtaz sketched is unambiguous: stop leaking yield, and point it at SOL.

A truly remarkable Bitcoin price surge has pushed BTC past an impressive threshold, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally. According to market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC has now crossed the significant $116,000 mark, trading at $116,013.99 on the Binance USDT market. This latest rally underscores Bitcoin’s enduring strength and its pivotal role in the digital asset landscape. What’s Fueling This Incredible Bitcoin Price Surge? Many factors contribute to Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the broader market dynamics. This latest Bitcoin price surge isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a culmination of several powerful influences. Increased Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and offerings. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, for example, has provided a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to BTC, injecting substantial capital into the market. Halving Event Impact: Bitcoin’s programmatic halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering circulation, historically precede significant price appreciation. The scarcity created by these events often acts as a strong bullish catalyst. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties and inflation concerns can drive investors towards Bitcoin, which some view as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Its decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive alternative asset. The Significance of BTC’s $116,000 Breakthrough Crossing the $116,000 threshold is more than just a number; it signals strong market confidence and a positive sentiment shift. Such milestones often trigger a psychological effect, encouraging more investors to enter the market or increase their holdings. This momentum can create a powerful feedback loop, driving prices even higher. A sustained move above this level could solidify it as a new support zone, paving the way for further exploration of uncharted price territories. This kind of upward trajectory often impacts the broader altcoin market as well, with capital flowing into other digital assets. Navigating the Volatility: Smart Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Surge While the excitement of a Bitcoin price surge is undeniable, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. It is crucial for investors to approach these periods with a clear strategy and a focus on long-term goals. How can you participate responsibly? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, market trends, and potential risks. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s history shows that despite short-term volatility, its long-term trend has been upward. A patient, long-term approach can often yield better results. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a dominant asset, diversifying your crypto portfolio can help spread risk. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Trajectory? The future of Bitcoin continues to be a hot topic among analysts and experts. Many foresee continued growth, driven by ongoing technological advancements, increasing global adoption, and its evolving role in the financial system. This sustained Bitcoin price surge is a strong indicator of its potential. However, potential challenges remain. Regulatory developments, market corrections, and competition from other digital assets could influence its path. Despite these factors, Bitcoin’s foundational principles and its proven track record suggest a resilient future. The journey past $116,000 is a testament to its dynamic nature and its ability to continually surprise the market. The latest Bitcoin price surge above $116,000 is a significant event that highlights the cryptocurrency’s robust market presence and growing investor confidence.

The cryptocurrency market recently witnessed a dramatic turn, as a staggering $104 million worth of crypto futures contracts were liquidated in just one hour across major exchanges. This rapid unraveling is part of a larger trend, with a total of $350 million in futures liquidations occurring over the past 24 hours. Such events underscore the inherent volatility and high stakes involved in digital asset trading, especially concerning crypto futures liquidation . For many traders, these moments can be both financially devastating and emotionally challenging, highlighting the critical need for understanding market mechanics. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation and Why Does It Happen? To truly grasp the impact of such large sums vanishing, it is essential to understand what a futures contract is and what liquidation entails. A crypto futures contract is simply an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Traders often use these contracts with leverage , which means they borrow funds to amplify their potential returns. However, leverage is a double-edged sword. While it can magnify profits, it also significantly increases the risk of loss. Crypto futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s position is automatically closed by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. Essentially, if the market moves against a leveraged position to a certain extent, the exchange will close the position to prevent the trader from losing more money than they have in their account, and to protect the exchange itself. Margin Call: Before full liquidation, traders might receive a margin call, requesting them to deposit more funds to maintain their position. Automated Process: Liquidation is an automated process, designed to happen quickly to mitigate further losses in a volatile market. The Recent Devastating Event: What Triggered This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation? The recent figures are certainly eye-opening: $104 million in crypto futures liquidation within an hour , contributing to $350 million over 24 hours. These substantial liquidations usually occur during periods of high market volatility, often triggered by sudden, significant price movements in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. A sharp, unexpected drop or surge can cascade through the market, forcing the closure of numerous leveraged positions. What specific catalysts might have been at play? While exact triggers can be complex, factors often include: Macroeconomic News: Broader economic data or central bank decisions can influence investor sentiment globally. Regulatory Announcements: News regarding new regulations or crackdowns in specific regions can cause market jitters. Whale Movements: Large sales or purchases by major holders (whales) can create significant price swings. Technical Breakdowns: When key support or resistance levels are breached, it can trigger widespread panic selling or buying. Regardless of the precise trigger, the outcome for many leveraged traders was swift and severe, underscoring the brutal efficiency of crypto futures liquidation mechanisms. Understanding the Ripple Effect: Who Gets Hit Hardest by Crypto Futures Liquidation? When such a massive crypto futures liquidation event unfolds, its effects ripple throughout the market. The most immediate and severe impact is felt by the traders whose positions are liquidated. These individuals face substantial, often complete, loss of their invested capital for those specific positions. However, the impact extends beyond individual losses. Firstly, a wave of liquidations can exacerbate market movements. As positions are forcibly closed, they often involve selling assets, which can push prices down further, triggering even more liquidations in a cascading effect. This creates a feedback loop that intensifies volatility. Secondly, it can lead to a dip in overall market sentiment. Traders become more cautious, potentially reducing trading activity and leading to lower liquidity. The sudden removal of large trading volumes also affects market depth and stability, making it harder for other traders to execute orders without impacting prices. Ultimately, these events serve as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged trading environments. Navigating Volatile Waters: How Can Traders Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risks? Given the potential for rapid and significant losses, understanding how to manage risk is paramount for anyone engaging in crypto futures trading. Preventing crypto futures liquidation is largely about prudent risk management and disciplined trading practices. Here are some actionable insights to help navigate these volatile markets: Manage Your Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage, as it drastically reduces your margin for error. Lower leverage provides more buffer against market swings. Utilize Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders. These automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting your potential losses before liquidation occurs. Monitor Your Margin: Keep a close eye on your margin levels. If your margin percentage drops too low, consider adding more funds to your account or reducing your position size. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one highly leveraged futures position. Diversification can spread risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic developments that could impact cryptocurrency prices. Practice Risk-Reward Analysis: Before entering any trade, evaluate the potential profit versus the potential loss. Only take trades where the reward significantly outweighs the risk. By adopting these strategies, traders can better protect their capital and navigate the often-unpredictable world of crypto futures. The recent crypto futures liquidation event, where $104 million vanished in an hour, serves as a powerful reminder of the unforgiving nature of leveraged trading in cryptocurrency markets. While futures offer significant opportunities for profit, they come with equally significant risks. Understanding the mechanisms of liquidation, the factors that trigger it, and implementing robust risk management strategies are not just recommendations—they are essential for survival in this dynamic landscape. Traders must approach these markets with caution, knowledge, and a disciplined mindset to safeguard their investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a crypto futures contract? A crypto futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a future date. It allows traders to speculate on the future price movements of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. 2. What does ‘liquidation’ mean in crypto futures trading? Liquidation in crypto futures trading means an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market has moved against them, and they no longer have enough margin (collateral) in their account to cover potential losses. This prevents further debt. 3. Why did $104 million in futures get liquidated so quickly? Such large and rapid liquidations are typically triggered by sudden, significant price swings in the underlying cryptocurrencies. High market volatility, often exacerbated by macroeconomic news, regulatory changes, or large institutional trades, can quickly deplete traders’ margins and force automated closures. 4. How can traders protect themselves from crypto futures liquidation? Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, regularly monitoring their margin levels, diversifying their portfolios, and staying informed about market conditions. Implementing sound risk management is crucial. 5. Is crypto futures trading regulated? The regulation of crypto futures trading varies significantly across different jurisdictions. Some countries have established clear regulatory frameworks, while others have outright banned it or have no specific rules. Traders should always check the regulatory status in their region and on the exchange they use. Did you find this article insightful?

This move involves a substantial amount of Solana (SOL) from wallets associated with the defunct FTX exchange and its sister firm, Alameda Research. What exactly does this mean for the Solana ecosystem and for those holding SOL? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential implications of this crucial development. What Just Happened with FTX Alameda SOL Unstaking? Recently, an address linked to FTX and Alameda Research made a notable transaction. It unstaked 192,000 SOL tokens, which translates to approximately $43.56 million at current market values. This significant FTX Alameda SOL unstaking was reported by EmberCN, signaling a potential shift in these substantial holdings. Large Sum Unstaked: The unstaked amount represents a considerable portion of SOL. Associated Entities: The funds originate from addresses tied to FTX and Alameda Research, entities currently undergoing complex bankruptcy proceedings. Remaining Holdings: Despite this unstaking, the address still retains approximately 4.184 million SOL, valued at around $960 million, remaining in staking. This indicates their continued, albeit shifting, presence in the Solana ecosystem. Understanding the Mechanics of SOL Unstaking For those new to the concept, ‘unstaking’ in the context of cryptocurrencies like Solana refers to the process of removing tokens from a staking pool. When tokens are staked, they are locked up to support the network’s operations and earn rewards. Unstaking makes these tokens liquid and available for transfer or sale. This particular FTX Alameda SOL unstaking follows a pattern observed in previous movements. Based on past actions, these unstaked funds are typically not moved directly. Instead, they are often: Split across multiple intermediary addresses. Subsequently transferred to major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. This multi-step process can sometimes be a precursor to selling activity, which could introduce more supply into the market. Potential Market Impact of FTX Alameda SOL Unstaking The movement of such a large quantity of SOL, particularly from entities involved in liquidation, naturally raises questions about its potential impact on Solana’s price. When significant amounts of a cryptocurrency are transferred to exchanges, it often signals an intention to sell. An increase in sell-side pressure can, in turn, affect market prices. While the immediate effect of this specific FTX Alameda SOL unstaking is yet to be fully seen, market participants are keenly observing for any follow-up transfers to exchanges. The ongoing liquidation process for FTX and Alameda Research means that their remaining assets, including SOL, are systematically being managed to repay creditors. These periodic movements are part of that broader strategy. Navigating the Future: Investor Insights For Solana holders and potential investors, understanding these movements is key. While the unstaking itself doesn’t automatically mean an imminent price crash, it does add a layer of consideration regarding market supply. It’s a reminder that large institutional holdings, especially those under liquidation, can influence market dynamics. What should investors consider in light of the FTX Alameda SOL unstaking ? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports of fund transfers to exchanges. Diversify: Always consider a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks. Long-Term View: Evaluate Solana’s fundamentals and long-term potential, separate from short-term liquidation-driven movements. The Solana ecosystem continues to develop, with many projects building on its blockchain. While events like these are noteworthy, they are often part of the broader market’s ebb and flow. A Compelling Summary of SOL’s Latest Movement The recent FTX Alameda SOL unstaking of $43.6 million is a significant development in the ongoing saga of FTX’s liquidation. While the funds remain within the control of the bankruptcy estate, their unstaked status suggests they are now liquid and ready for potential movement to exchanges. Past patterns indicate such transfers often precede selling, which could introduce additional supply to the market. For investors, monitoring these movements and understanding the context of FTX’s asset management is crucial. It underscores the importance of staying informed and considering the potential impact of large-scale asset liquidations on market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘unstaking’ mean for Solana (SOL)? Unstaking refers to the process of removing SOL tokens that were previously locked up to support the Solana network and earn rewards. Once unstaked, these tokens become liquid and can be freely moved or sold. Why are FTX and Alameda Research unstaking SOL? FTX and Alameda Research are currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. The unstaking of assets like SOL is part of their broader strategy to liquidate holdings to repay creditors and manage the bankruptcy estate’s assets efficiently. Will the FTX Alameda SOL unstaking immediately crash the SOL price? Not necessarily. While the unstaking makes the SOL liquid and available for sale, it doesn’t guarantee an immediate price crash. The impact depends on when and how these funds are moved to exchanges and if they are indeed sold. However, it does add potential sell-side pressure to the market. How much SOL do FTX and Alameda Research still hold in staking? Even after this recent unstaking, the associated address still holds approximately 4.184 million SOL, valued at around $960 million, remaining in staking. This indicates a substantial continued presence in the Solana staking ecosystem. Where are the unstaked SOL tokens likely to go next? Based on past patterns observed with FTX and Alameda’s asset movements, the unstaked SOL tokens are likely to be split across multiple intermediary addresses before being transferred to major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.

OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said Thursday that the nonprofit will retain control of a new public benefit corporation while securing an equity stake worth at least $100 billion. He noted the stake would make the nonprofit “one of the most well-resourced philanthropic organizations in the world.” “OpenAI started as a nonprofit, remains one today, and will continue to be one — with the nonprofit holding the authority that guides our future,” Taylor said in the statement. Reports indicate that the $100 billion stake, which stands for about 20% of the value of OpenAI, is a floor and is prone to rise. After the announcement, Microsoft shares rose about 2.4% in extended trading. Microsoft and OpenAI strike truce after months of tense negotiations Microsoft and OpenAI have engaged in discussions for months about advancing their relations, partly to secure Microsoft’s assent for restructuring the startup. In return for massive financial backing, Microsoft can use OpenAI’s AI tools in its products. Microsoft’s involvement has been a key obstacle to OpenAI’s restructuring plans. Still, Microsoft and OpenAI didn’t disclose the terms of the new contract and said that the current agreement was nonbinding. The firms noted on Thursday that they had signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of our collaboration.” They noted they are “actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety.” This concludes a tense summer of negotiations between the two companies, which grew so strained at one point that OpenAI considered turning to antitrust regulators to exit the contract. Nonprofit to keep control with $100B stake in new for-profit entity A few weeks ago, Microsoft released the first of its large language models developed under Suleyman. It was trained on 15,000 Nvidia Corp. H100 chips. Cutting-edge models from Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI used clusters six to 10 times larger, Suleyman added, suggesting that Microsoft created its model more efficiently. Microsoft aims to take a multimodel approach across its products, letting customers choose the AI models they prefer, CEO Satya Nadella said. Earlier this week, The Information reported that the company plans to integrate Anthropic models into some offerings. OpenAI is finalizing the ownership structure of its planned for-profit entity, but still needs approval from regulators in California and Delaware. The company said the nonprofit will retain control and hold a stake worth over $100 billion, potentially making it one of the world’s largest philanthropies — though it remains uncertain when those funds could actually be distributed. OpenAI is contending with a growing list of opponents actively seeking to block its restructuring effort or intervening with regulators in hopes its nonprofit mission remains intact. One of those involved is billionaire Elon Musk, Meta Platforms, and various advocacy organizations. Musk has already taken Apple and OpenAI to court. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas by Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI, follows the company’s takeover of social media platform X through a stock swap earlier this year. Musk alleges that OpenAI is leveraging its influence to “collude” and block rivals from competing in smartphones and generative AI. His team claims Apple deliberately favors OpenAI by embedding ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs, pushing alternatives like xAI’s Grok down App Store rankings. According to the suit, the Apple-OpenAI partnership is structured to shut out competing super apps and AI chatbots, giving the two companies a shared edge they deny to others.

Kraken’s rollout underscores its growing ambitions ahead of a potential 2026 public listing . Perpetual contracts, or perps, are a type of futures product that differs from traditional futures. Unlike conventional futures, contracts with a certain expiration date perps have no expiration date. This means traders can stay in the position if they remain at the required margin. Traders must provide the right amount of trade liquidity in the first instance and the price margin in return for maintaining the stock. Perps was introduced back in 2016 by BitMEX and swiftly became a foundational part of the crypto derivatives markets. They are well-suited for the crypto industry, which has a 24/7 operation and is even more volatile than traditional markets. Kraken’s new product lets users take a longer position on a perceived price gain or a shorter position on a forecast drop. Notably, traders don’t need to own the underlying crypto asset to participate. This opens access to those who prefer not to make direct coin purchases. At launch, positions can be collateralized with Kraken USD balances, with more collateral options expected in the future. Kraken has also built in risk-management safeguards to help protect traders. Stop-loss orders, for example, let traders easily walk away from positions even when the market moves sharply in the other direction. A Kraken spokesperson told The Block that he wants to provide perps to “everyday investors” without exposing them to sudden losses while providing them with protections. Kraken expands derivatives as IPO looms Kraken Perps is launching at an important time for the platform, as reports suggest that it is readying for a public listing in early 2026, which may even make it one of the largest crypto companies to go public since Coinbase in 2021. The time marks strong growth in the market for perpetual contracts. August 2025 was the busiest month ever, with around US$515 billion in trading volume. The spike is a lesson in how many more people have been trading perps because traders have taken advantage of short-term price spikes in a world where futures contracts have expired, and will not allow them to have futures. Meanwhile, Kraken is expanding its ecosystem further. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, the company recently introduced a tokenized stock product , xStocks, to the European Union. It is behind the completion of a deal to acquire Breakout, a custom trading platform, and has been incubating INK, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, which is on track to release a token of its own. Those efforts are part of Kraken’s strategy of pushing beyond spot trading. The exchange establishes itself as a full-service trading hub for retail and institutional clients with derivatives, tokenized equities, and blockchain infrastructure. Kraken balances opportunity and risk Kraken has designed Perps as a fresh entry point for crypto-market retail traders. The exchange says the product provides more options for users to voice their views on prices, diversification strategies, and handle portfolio risks. As many people can’t have a stake in an underlying asset, the long or short positions provide some trading opportunities and aren’t always for the professional. However, within these opportunities are also distinct threats. Perps are very leveraged products, and leverage can amplify ups and downs. In a turbulent crypto market, sudden price surges wipe out positions swiftly. In severe scenarios, losses exceeding that initial deposit leave no one safe when trading. Kraken has accepted this fact and notes that “perps are not for every investor.” The exchange has introduced some safeguards to mitigate these risks. Stop-loss orders, margin alerts, and easy mobile integration are all intended to protect retail users if markets swing in their opposite direction. Kraken suggests risk management tools can only get you so far, and a trader must understand how perps work before jumping on board. It won’t be the same for access to Kraken Perps on launch. Regulatory environments are disparate across nations, and the exchange is rolling the product out in stages, with early releases in several jurisdictions where the legal landscape becomes more conducive.

According to reports , Kelley set out his concerns in an op-ed for 1819 News, arguing that a perceived gap in the law could let crypto platforms offer yields or rewards that pull funds away from local lenders. The warning comes as public comment periods have already opened at the US Treasury, and regulators are expected to write the rules that make the new law operational. GENIUS Act: Senator Warns Of Deposit Flight Financial experts say the worry centers on how “comparable supervision” will be defined. If foreign or nonbank stablecoin issuers are treated as having comparable oversight when regulators’ rules are loose, depositors could be tempted to shift cash to higher returns offered by crypto firms. Alabama’s Sen. Keith Kelley warns the GENIUS Act could devastate rural banks by shifting deposits. Is stablecoin regulation hurting communities? #GENIUSAct #Stablecoin #CryptoLaw https://t.co/tHAibq6EMg pic.twitter.com/BDhqoFNif5 — 4C by 360Trader (@4cby360) September 11, 2025 One estimate cited by banking groups puts potential deposit outflows as high as $6.6 trillion if the law is interpreted broadly. That number has made small bank leaders uneasy. They fear losing the stable deposits they use to lend to families, farmers, and local businesses. A Rural Banking Crisis In The Making Many community banks operate on thin margins. They rely on local deposits to underwrite loans for crop seasons, equipment purchases, and small shops. Based on reports, Kelley warned that those lifelines could be weakened if large sums move to new digital products outside the traditional banking system. Farmers and small business owners were named as especially vulnerable, because local lenders often offer terms tailored to seasonal needs. GENIUS Act & Regulatory Path Ahead The GENIUS Act is not yet in force in any operational sense. Implementation will depend on rulemaking by the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve, and those agencies have already asked for public input on the risks and anti-money laundering safeguards. Reports have disclosed that some banking groups and lawmakers want tighter definitions and clearer guardrails before the rules are finalized. Supporters of the law argue it could bring more clarity to stablecoin markets, but opponents say that the details matter most. If deposits start to leave, small banks could be forced to cut back on loans or raise rates to retain customers. That outcome would likely shift credit away from local borrowers toward larger financial centers.

The announcement is expected to coincide with a state visit by US President Donald Trump, during which American firms are set to pledge tens of billions of dollars in new projects as a show of US commitment. Reports indicate that the investment will be implemented in collaboration with Nscale Global Holdings Ltd , a London company responsible for operating large amounts of data centers, a major player in Europe’s growing demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. With OpenAI led by Sam Altman and Nvidia led by Jensen Huang, this move will be significant as it indicates both the size of projects currently discussed and their strategic value in establishing a bigger presence in the AI economy of Europe. Companies drive AI expansion OpenAI sees the UK project as part of its broader push to expand the global Stargate data center program, which already includes major commitments in Norway, the UAE, and the US. As Europe moves to tighten regulations on generative AI, establishing large-scale infrastructure in Britain could offer OpenAI both stronger political visibility and valuable commercial backing. For Nvidia, which supplies the data to most of the world’s AI models, an added advantage is that it will be able to install its most powerful processors, the GB200 series of processors, just introduced by recent development, in a country where the growth of AI stands highest on the national agenda. By the end of 2024, Nscale announced that it will invest $2.5 billion in UK data centers for three years, including a site in Essex to store such high-end chips as 45,000 would be housed. At that time, OpenAI did not disclose an anchor customer, and as a result, this brings credibility to the project and scale. Since July, Nscale has garnered the commitment from Altman to be the lead customer for the Norwegian site set up at Nscale and its extension to the UK; however, the relationship clearly illustrates how the two companies are deepening. UK seeks to lead in AI infrastructure The move is well timed to align with Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s ambitions, who introduced a wide-reaching strategy earlier this year to “turbocharge AI” in Britain with investments in data centers, chip manufacturing, and designated “AI growth zones.” The zones are supposed to accelerate planning approvals and connect new sites to the national grid faster, acknowledging that infrastructure bottlenecks made Britain less competitive with the US and China. Starmer has long said that massive private investments are necessary for London to maintain its presence in the global technology economy. Britain has already committed £1 billion of public funding to beef up computing capacity by a factor of 20. Still, the government cannot address the gap because the AI infrastructure projects are so large and complex. The arrival of OpenAI and Nvidia into this arena with billions of dollars in extra funds thus represents a key opportunity for the UK to deepen its position as Europe’s main development engine. While the companies have not disclosed the exact quantity of their pledges or the intended sites of these plants, officials and industry experts expect projects measured in the tens of billions of dollars over several years.

We’re talking about a substantial movement linked to Anchorage Digital, a prominent crypto custody and banking firm, that could hold implications for the Uniswap ecosystem and beyond. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic digital asset landscape. Unpacking the Recent UNI Token Transfer Event On-chain analyst EmberCN recently brought to light an interesting series of transactions. Approximately 12 hours ago, an address connected to Anchorage Digital executed a massive transfer of 5.355 million UNI tokens. This considerable sum, valued at around $52.9 million, was moved to a specific address (0xF43…). Just three hours later, a portion of these funds — specifically 200,000 UNI tokens — found their way to a centralized exchange. This smaller, yet still significant, deposit was worth approximately $1.97 million at the time of the transaction. Such movements are closely watched by market participants as they can often signal upcoming trading activity or strategic shifts. Why Anchorage Digital’s UNI Token Transfer is Significant Anchorage Digital is a regulated entity providing secure custody and financial services for institutional investors. When an address associated with such a major player moves assets, it naturally sparks curiosity. A UNI token transfer of this magnitude isn’t just a casual transaction; it could indicate several potential scenarios: Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutions frequently adjust their holdings across various assets to manage risk or optimize returns. Liquidity Management: Funds might be moved to an exchange to increase liquidity for other operations or to facilitate trading. Potential Selling Pressure: While not confirmed, depositing tokens to a centralized exchange often precedes a sale. This could introduce selling pressure on the UNI token. Operational Needs: The transfer could also be part of routine operational requirements or client-directed actions. Understanding the ‘why’ behind these moves helps paint a clearer picture of institutional sentiment and strategy within the crypto space. Decoding the Market Impact of UNI Token Transfers The deposit of 200,000 UNI tokens onto a centralized exchange is a particularly noteworthy detail. Typically, assets held in secure cold storage or institutional wallets are not immediately available for trading. Moving them to an exchange changes this dynamic. Increased Supply: When a significant amount of a token like UNI becomes available on an exchange, it can potentially increase the circulating supply available for trade. Price Implications: If the intention behind the deposit is to sell, it could lead to downward pressure on the UNI token’s price, especially if the market demand doesn’t absorb the new supply. Investor Sentiment: Such movements can influence investor sentiment. Some might interpret it as a bearish signal, while others might see it as a normal part of institutional asset management. Transparency: On-chain analysis provides valuable transparency, allowing the community to monitor these institutional movements in real-time. This particular UNI token transfer serves as a reminder of how on-chain data offers a window into the otherwise opaque world of institutional crypto activity. What’s Next for UNI and the Broader DeFi Landscape? While this specific UNI token transfer is a snapshot in time, it underscores the continuous evolution of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. UNI, as the native token of Uniswap – a leading decentralized exchange – plays a pivotal role in this ecosystem. Community Governance: UNI holders have governance rights, allowing them to vote on key protocol changes. Large institutional holdings and their movements can therefore have implications for governance participation. Market Vigilance: Traders and investors will likely keep a close eye on further movements from Anchorage Digital-linked addresses and the broader UNI market. Future Trends: This event highlights the growing interaction between traditional financial services (like custody firms) and the burgeoning DeFi world. It suggests increasing institutional engagement, which can be a double-edged sword, bringing both capital and potential market volatility. Monitoring these dynamics is essential for anyone invested in or observing the future trajectory of DeFi. Conclusion: The recent UNI token transfer linked to Anchorage Digital, culminating in a $1.97 million deposit to a centralized exchange, is a compelling example of institutional activity within the crypto market. While the exact motives remain speculative, such movements provide invaluable insights into market dynamics, potential liquidity shifts, and the evolving relationship between traditional finance and decentralized protocols. Keeping an eye on these on-chain signals is paramount for making informed decisions in the fast-paced world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is UNI and why is it significant? A1: UNI is the native governance token of Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX). It allows holders to participate in the protocol’s governance, voting on key proposals and changes, making it a crucial asset in the DeFi ecosystem. Q2: Who is Anchorage Digital? A2: Anchorage Digital is a regulated crypto custody and banking firm. It provides secure storage, trading, and financing services primarily for institutional investors, helping them safely engage with digital assets. Q3: What does it mean when UNI tokens are deposited to a centralized exchange? A3: Depositing tokens to a centralized exchange typically means they are being made available for trading. This can signal potential selling pressure if the institution intends to offload assets, or it could be for liquidity management or other operational purposes. Q4: How can I track such UNI token transfers? A4: Such transfers are tracked using on-chain analysis tools and platforms. These tools monitor public blockchain data, allowing analysts to identify large movements of assets by specific addresses or entities, often reported by on-chain analysts like EmberCN. Q5: Does this UNI token transfer guarantee a price drop for UNI? A5: Not necessarily. While a large deposit to an exchange can introduce selling pressure, it doesn’t guarantee a price drop. The market’s overall demand, other news, and the actual execution of trades will ultimately determine the price action. It’s a signal to monitor, not a definitive prediction.

A significant development is currently unfolding with WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI), which has put forward a groundbreaking governance proposal. This initiative aims to utilize 100% of its protocol-owned liquidity (POL) fees for a dedicated WLFI token buyback and permanent burn mechanism. This move could profoundly reshape the token’s economic landscape. Understanding WLFI’s Bold Buyback Proposal The core of this proposal is straightforward yet powerful: all fees generated from WLFI’s protocol-owned liquidity will be reinvested directly into the WLFI ecosystem. Specifically, these funds will be used to purchase WLFI tokens from the open market, effectively reducing the circulating supply. This is not just a temporary measure; once acquired, these tokens will be permanently removed from circulation through a ‘burn’ process. The community has shown overwhelming support for this strategic shift. As of now, the proposal boasts an impressive 99.6% approval rate, signaling strong consensus among WLFI holders. Voting is set to conclude on September 19, making this a pivotal moment for the protocol’s future direction. Why is WLFI Token Buyback So Powerful for Value Creation? A robust WLFI token buyback strategy offers several compelling benefits, particularly in the context of a DeFi protocol. By consistently reducing the token’s supply, the proposal aims to create scarcity, a fundamental driver of value in any market. This mechanism can lead to a more stable and potentially appreciating token price over time. Key advantages of this approach include: Increased Scarcity: Fewer tokens in circulation can naturally drive up demand and value. Enhanced Value Proposition: It creates a direct, transparent mechanism to return value to token holders, fostering stronger confidence and loyalty. Reduced Inflationary Pressure: Counteracts the natural inflation often associated with token emissions, promoting long-term sustainability. Community Alignment: Demonstrates a commitment to token holders’ interests, encouraging active participation and long-term holding. What Does This Mean for WLFI Holders and the Broader DeFi Ecosystem? For existing WLFI holders, this proposal represents a significant vote of confidence in the protocol’s future. The consistent demand created by the WLFI token buyback can contribute to price stability and potential growth, rewarding those who believe in the project’s long-term vision. It also empowers the community, as the decision to implement such a crucial economic model rests entirely on their votes. Furthermore, this initiative sets an example for the wider DeFi space. Protocols that actively manage their tokenomics through transparent and community-approved mechanisms like this can build greater trust and attract more users and investors. It highlights the power of decentralized governance in shaping a project’s economic destiny. Navigating the Mechanics: How the WLFI Token Buyback Works The process for this WLFI token buyback is designed for clarity and efficiency. First, the protocol collects fees generated from its liquidity operations. These fees, denominated in various cryptocurrencies, are then used to market buy WLFI tokens. Once purchased, these tokens are sent to an unspendable address, effectively removing them from the circulating supply forever. This ‘burn’ mechanism ensures that the reduction in supply is permanent and verifiable on the blockchain. This transparent and automated system minimizes human intervention, enhancing the trustworthiness of the process. It ensures that the value generated by the protocol’s activities directly benefits its token holders through a deflationary mechanism. The WLFI community’s decision on this proposal will undoubtedly mark a significant chapter in the protocol’s journey. By dedicating 100% of its POL fees to a perpetual buyback and burn, WLFI aims to forge a path towards enhanced token value, robust economic stability, and deeper community engagement. This revolutionary approach could serve as a powerful model for sustainable growth in the ever-evolving DeFi landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a token buyback and burn? A token buyback involves a project repurchasing its own tokens from the open market. A ‘burn’ then permanently removes these tokens from circulation, typically by sending them to an unrecoverable address. This process reduces the total supply, aiming to increase scarcity and potentially boost the token’s value. 2. What are Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) fees? Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) refers to liquidity that a decentralized protocol owns and manages itself, rather than relying solely on external liquidity providers. POL fees are the revenues generated from providing this liquidity to decentralized exchanges or other financial applications. 3. How does this proposal benefit WLFI holders? By reducing the total supply of WLFI tokens through buybacks and burns, the proposal aims to increase the scarcity of each token. This can lead to a higher demand and potentially a higher market value for WLFI, directly benefiting existing token holders. 4. When does the voting on this WLFI token buyback proposal conclude? The voting period for this governance proposal is set to conclude on September 19. 5. Is using 100% of fees for buyback and burn common in DeFi? While buyback and burn mechanisms are common in DeFi, dedicating 100% of protocol-owned liquidity fees specifically to this purpose is a bold and aggressive strategy, reflecting a strong commitment to token value appreciation and community alignment.

The four names emerge as particularly suited to play different roles in the cryptocurrency economy: TRON for cheap and high-volumes settlement; ADA for research-driven security and governance; SUI for high-throughput consumer apps; and XRP for cross-border payments. Each has measurable on-chain activity that can grow over time, active developer bases, and clear paths to adoption. According to recent charts, XRP price is currently trading around $2.82, SUI is $3.20, ADA is $0.82 and TRON $0.33. This makes the structure attractive for the construction of a real utility basket. After mapping these pillars, many long-term investors add one early-stage candidate for torque. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quite a popular token in 2025 watchlists. XRP – Payments Corridor Specialist With Room to Scale XRP aims to enable instant and ultra-low-cost value transfers for banks, remittance companies and fintechs. These have advantages such as predictable pricing and fast settlement in corridors where slower legacy rail still exists. Assuming that new corridors and bank integrations will be built, XRP’s base-case path to 2026, starting from a price of $2.82, sees it consolidate above resistance from the previous peak. This suggests an implied range of $3.50 -$4.50 over six to twelve months. The bullish scenario indicates a runway for $6.0-$8.0. If corridor growth stops, or liquidity thins during risk-off periods, a bearish scenario would revert to $2.00-$2.3. SUI – UX for High Throughput Apps and Consumer Apps SUI’s object-centric model and parallel execution are key to making on-chain actions feel immediate for gaming, social media, and business applications. With the help of the toolchain and SDKs, teams can iterate faster and ship. A base case, derived from utilization of flagship apps that will rise over the next year, is approximately $3.20, which translates to $4.50-$6.00. To present a bullish arc, however, the release of popular consumer titles or brand integrations that attract non-crypto users is key, which could drive targets to $8.00-$12.00 on a 18-24 month view. If there is a cooling of developer momentum or a decline in user retention, a downside trajectory lies between $2.20 and $2.60. ADA – Research-Based Security, Governance and Interoperability Cardano’s formal verification, eUTXO accounting, and staged governance are the top three things. That job will be favorable for public-sector pilots and institutions that appreciate reliability. However, scaling components, such as Hydra and middleware maturity (wallets, identity, and indexers), are crucial to unlocking richer apps. With ADA around $0.82, the base case is standard upgrades and increasing DeFi/identity usage to $1.0 – $1.50 in 6-12 months; there is room for $3.5.00-$4.00 under a more stable, multi-year case that includes cross-chain interoperability and enterprise-level use cases to be seen. Until new catalysts come about, the price might bounce back toward $0.55 to $0.65 if upgrades don’t come or activity is concentrated in a few apps. TRON – Predictable Fee Stablecoin Freight Line One of TRON’s key features is the ability to move stablecoins in large volumes with consistency and low fees. As a result of having a bandwidth/energy model, it is suitable for cross-platform transfers, on/off ramps and payments, as it helps apps manage costs. A base case that supports stablecoin flows and integrations with existing stablecoins is valued at 0.33 and projects to 0.42-0.55 for the next year. A strong bullish trend over several years supporting enterprise relationships and volume growth, points to $3-$5. This support is likely to be between $0.24 and $0.27 if flows migrate to other cheap chains or if regulation stifles stablecoin activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE – the Newest WildCard in the Fifth Slot In fact, early adopters are taking positions even before a rally resulting from significant exposure to exchange. That’s the main argument for using MAGACOIN FINANCE as the fifth, speculative component of a portfolio that doesn’t cost more than $5 . Staged allocations, tightening supply dynamics, upcoming access catalysts to drive liquidity are emphasized in community materials For the upside scenario to play out, key factors such as increasing the buyer base, making community growth visible, and providing valuable holder utility that turns attention into on-chain activity, are all required. The negative case is efficient post-listing volumes and milestone lags. How the Pieces Work Together Functionally, this cross-chain basket provides exposure to four distinct demand engines: institutional and retail money market (XRP), consumer applications with low latency (SUI), security-centric base layer with institutional-grade design (ADA) and high-volume stablecoin settlement (TRON). If roadmap execution translates into liquidity and usage, the fifth slot’s calculated asymmetry (represented here by the up-and-coming name MAGACOIN FINANCE) could change portfolio math. They come together around real utility that can scale uncorrupted by the noise of market volatility, and scenario ranges are tied to adoption milestones rather than news headlines. Conclusion Value isn’t just created by price alone, but under-$5 entries when combined with actual usage can compound into 2026-2027 and beyond. Each asset has a distinct role, from TRON’s stablecoin scaling to ADA’s governance-driven reliability, from XRP’s corridor development to SUI’s consumer applications. Good sized position in MAGACOIN FINANCE adds early upside potential to listings and access milestones. With the current prices of around $2.80 (XRP), $3.20 (SUI), $0.82 (ADA), $0.33 (TRON), we have clear, quantifiable, multi-year growth trajectories that are based on adoption and not hype, although none of these scenarios are guaranteed.

In a video analysis released today, the analyst argues that structural signals across major charts—supported by improving macro conditions—tilt the risk-reward toward a decisive upside move, provided US inflation data doesn’t deliver a negative surprise. The setup begins with Bitcoin grinding higher into range highs while still sitting in what he calls “a position of potential reversal,” a juncture he links to today’s US CPI print after a softer-than-expected PPI reading. “If CPI comes in weak today, I think the markets will rip,” he said, framing inflation as the swing factor that could unlock risk appetite across crypto. Cardano, Doge, XRP Ready For Lift-Off He contends the strongest signals are emerging away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. On Ethereum, liquidity “still” sits below price around $4,100, with a pocket of resting orders above, leaving open the possibility of “a quick flush… to take that” before higher levels are attacked. “How much of a drop would we need to sweep this liquidity? Six percent,” he said, adding that the base of recent transactions “looks pretty good as a support,” even if a brief downside wick cannot be ruled out. Related Reading: Tokenized Stocks Could Be Coming To NASDAQ, Will XRP Benefit From This? The case for altcoins rests largely on visible liquidity concentrations and higher-timeframe structures. Cardano (ADA), he said, exhibits a favorable imbalance with “a… load of liquidity” stacked above “around one dollar,” and additional magnets in the $1.21 and $1.40 areas if momentum expands. He emphasized the sequence of higher lows and higher highs that preceded a consolidation, a pattern he compared across several charts. Dogecoin (DOGE), in his view, mirrors the same anatomy on a larger timeframe: a prior higher-high/higher-low sequence, a tightening range, and “liquidity above us,” with a push through $0.29 opening a path to targeting $0.45. “I’ve been saying for a while tokens like DOGE look like they are going to absolutely send it,” he said. For XRP, he argued that price action has “led the cycle” and recently broke a well-tracked downtrend on the daily and four-hour charts, while shorter-term liquidity maps now show concentrations overhead. Beyond single names, he anchored his thesis in market-wide breadth gauges. He highlighted “Total 3”—the combined market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—pressing against prior highs and “knocking at the door… for price discovery.” In a closely related lens, he said “Total 2” (market cap ex-Bitcoin) is one incremental push away—“half a percent higher”—from a highest-ever weekly close, with three days left in the candle. The evolving formations, he added, can be interpreted as an “ascending wedge” that morphs into a “cup and handle” after a textbook Wyckoff-style accumulation and back-test, the kind of structural progression that often resolves with a powerful range break. The Core Thesis Rotation dynamics are at the core of his call. Drawing on an ETH-vs-BTC dominance composite, he said the tape “looks like weakness” for the pair, with heavier volume on down moves in that ratio—an indication, he believes, that capital is migrating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into the broader altcoin complex. “If [Bitcoin] dominance breaks down… it’s better for altcoins,” he said. “As long as capital’s flowing into the market, I don’t really mind which starts to outperform which… but if we have a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price and a drop in dominance, it means that altcoins are going to be absolutely sending it.” Related Reading: Solana And XRP ETFs Smash New Records In Canada At the same time, he flagged the near-term fork in the road. Markets are testing “decision” levels into macro data, and a brief liquidity sweep lower—on Bitcoin and ETH in particular—remains plausible before any sustained impulse. “We’re not in a breakout territory here yet,” he cautioned. “We’ve seen the first signs of it… [and] we could reject here and consolidate for a little bit longer… but one catalyst here and it’s green season in my opinion for crypto generally.” Throughout the analysis, the analyst returned to a handful of price signposts traders are likely to watch: ADA gravity around $1.00 with follow-ups near $1.21 and $1.40; DOGE confirmation above ~$0.29 and then $0.45 as the next objective; and XRP’s break of descending resistance with liquidity pools sitting overhead on intraday maps. If the macro side cooperates, his base case is unambiguous. “I think the breakout is imminent,” he said, pointing to synchronized strength across Total 2 and Total 3, gold’s recent breakout, and equities at or near all-time highs. “This is the sort of time where we’re going to break out,” he added. “Massive breakouts” in altcoins, when they come, often unfold as “a few weeks or a few days of massively green candles.” Even so, he closed with a reminder that timing remains hostage to catalysts. “It’s decision time for the market,” he said. “Could reject here and consolidate… but one catalyst here and it’s green season.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.99.

Solana SOL , often celebrated for its high-speed transactions and innovative technology, has officially ascended to a new height. This impressive climb sees Solana (SOL) overtake BNB to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a development that has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This moment truly highlights the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape. What’s Fueling Solana SOL’s Incredible Momentum? According to recent data from CoinMarketCap, Solana SOL ‘s market capitalization reached an impressive $126.3 billion. This figure comfortably surpassed BNB’s $125.9 billion, marking a pivotal moment in the crypto rankings. Several key factors contribute to this rapid expansion and the growing confidence in Solana’s platform. Its robust technological foundation and thriving ecosystem play a crucial role. Here are some of the primary drivers behind Solana SOL ‘s ascent: High Throughput: Solana boasts an incredibly fast transaction processing capability, often handling thousands of transactions per second. This speed makes it highly attractive for various decentralized applications (dApps). Low Transaction Costs: Compared to some older blockchain networks, Solana offers significantly lower transaction fees. This affordability enhances user experience and encourages broader adoption. Developer Activity: The Solana ecosystem continues to attract a vibrant community of developers building innovative projects across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. This consistent innovation adds immense value to the network. How Does Solana SOL Compare to BNB? The competition between major cryptocurrencies is always intense. While Solana SOL and BNB both represent significant blockchain ecosystems, they cater to slightly different niches and face unique challenges. BNB, the native token of the Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain), has long been a powerhouse, primarily benefiting from its close ties to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. However, Solana’s recent performance indicates a shift in market sentiment and preference. Here’s a brief comparison: Core Utility: BNB is integral to the Binance ecosystem, used for trading fee discounts, participation in token sales, and powering the BNB Chain. Solana SOL , on the other hand, is the fuel for the Solana blockchain, enabling transaction fees, staking, and governance across its vast dApp landscape. Technological Approach: Solana utilizes a unique consensus mechanism, including Proof of History (PoH) alongside Proof of Stake (PoS), to achieve its high speeds. BNB Chain relies on a variant of PoS called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). Market Perception: Solana is often seen as a leading ‘Ethereum killer’ due to its scalability solutions, while BNB Chain offers a more centralized, yet highly efficient, alternative for dApp deployment. What Lies Ahead for Solana SOL? The journey for Solana SOL is far from over. This milestone of surpassing BNB signals strong market confidence, but the path ahead involves both immense opportunities and potential hurdles. Continued innovation and addressing technical challenges will be crucial for sustained growth. The focus remains on expanding its user base and solidifying its position among the top digital assets. Consider these aspects regarding Solana SOL ‘s future: Ecosystem Expansion: Expect more groundbreaking projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 gaming to choose Solana. This growth will further enhance the network’s utility and demand for SOL. Scalability & Stability: While known for speed, Solana has faced past network outages. Addressing these stability concerns decisively will be vital for long-term trust and enterprise adoption. Competitive Landscape: The blockchain space is highly competitive. Solana will need to continue innovating to maintain its edge against other high-performance blockchains. For those interested in the future of Solana SOL , staying informed about network upgrades, developer conferences, and new project launches is key. The recent achievement of Solana SOL in overtaking BNB is a testament to its robust technology, active community, and growing ecosystem.

On September 11, 2025, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF recorded a remarkable $74.5 million daily inflow, while Fidelity’s U.S. Ethereum ETF attracted another $49.5 million, according to data from Farside Investors. In total, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have seen more than $171 million in net inflows this week, reflecting robust demand from institutional investors. The surge in flows underscores growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value, even as regulators remain cautious on staking provisions. Analysts suggest these inflows could act as a catalyst for higher ETH prices, reinforcing Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and AI-powered blockchain applications. Ethereum Eyes $4,500 Breakout Currently, Ethereum is trading near $4,400, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $529 billion. Despite positive inflow momentum, ETH remains locked in a tight trading range. Analysts highlight two key levels: Resistance at $4,500: A breakout above this level could trigger renewed buying interest and open the door for a sustained uptrend. Support at $4,250: A drop below this threshold could lead to increased selling pressure. Technical indicators remain mixed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near neutral at 52, while the MACD shows waning bearish momentum, hinting that buyer activity may soon pick up. BitMine and Market Correlations Strengthen the Case Adding to the bullish narrative, blockchain firm BitMine expanded its Ethereum treasury this week, acquiring 46,255 ETH worth $201 million from BitGo. This latest move brings BitMine’s total holdings to over 2.1 million ETH, valued at more than $9.2 billion, cementing its position as the largest public ETH holder. Beyond crypto, Ethereum’s price movements continue to show strong correlations with tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq. Analysts believe institutional inflows combined with corporate treasuries betting big on ETH could tighten supply and set the stage for a breakout. For traders, the focus now turns to whether Ethereum can decisively clear $4,500, a move that could ignite one of the strongest rallies of 2025. Until then, ETH’s price is likely to remain in consolidation as bulls and bears battle for control.

Over the past 24 hours, a significant trend emerged: short positions bore the brunt of these liquidations across major digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This dominance by short liquidations offers crucial insights into current market dynamics and the powerful forces at play. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Simply put, crypto futures liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the market moves against their trade, and they no longer have enough margin to cover potential losses. It is an automated process designed to prevent traders from losing more money than they have in their account. Liquidations are a common feature of high-leverage trading. They serve as a stark reminder of the risks involved in futures markets. For the broader market, large-scale liquidations can amplify price movements, leading to increased volatility and creating cascading effects as positions are unwound rapidly. Unpacking the Recent Crypto Futures Liquidations Data Looking at the past 24 hours, the figures for major cryptocurrencies show a clear trend in crypto futures liquidations . Short positions, those betting on a price decline, faced substantial pressure as prices moved upwards, triggering their forced closure. Here’s a breakdown: ETH: A staggering $96.38 million was liquidated, with short positions accounting for a dominant 69.14% of that total. BTC: Bitcoin saw $86.24 million in liquidations, and an even higher percentage of these, 83.97% , came from short positions. SOL: Solana experienced $35.76 million in liquidations, with short positions making up an overwhelming 86.11% . These figures highlight a powerful market shift that caught many short sellers off guard. The overwhelming majority of liquidated positions being short suggests a strong upward price movement, often referred to as a ‘short squeeze’ environment, where rising prices force short sellers to buy back, further fueling the rally. Why Did Shorts Dominate Recent Crypto Futures Liquidations ? The significant dominance of short positions in these crypto futures liquidations suggests a prevailing bullish sentiment or a sudden positive catalyst in the market. When many traders open short positions, they are betting on prices to fall. However, if an unexpected positive development occurs, or if buying pressure simply outweighs selling pressure, prices can surge quickly. This upward movement forces short positions, especially those with high leverage, to be liquidated. As these positions are closed, the system automatically buys back the underlying asset, which can create additional buying pressure. This cascading effect, often called a short squeeze, can accelerate the price rally, leading to even more short liquidations. It’s a powerful feedback loop that can rapidly change market direction. The Impact of High Crypto Futures Liquidations on Market Dynamics High volumes of crypto futures liquidations , particularly when concentrated on one side of the market, have several implications. Firstly, they increase market volatility. Sudden price spikes or drops due to mass liquidations can create an unpredictable trading environment. Secondly, they can act as a reset button for market sentiment. A large short squeeze might signal a shift from bearish to more bullish sentiment, as those betting against the market are cleared out. For individual traders, understanding these dynamics is crucial. It underscores the importance of proper risk management and not over-leveraging positions. While liquidations represent losses for some, they can also present opportunities for others who are positioned correctly or can anticipate these market movements. Navigating Volatility: Strategies Amidst Crypto Futures Liquidations Understanding the dynamics of crypto futures liquidations is crucial for any trader operating in this space. To mitigate risks and potentially capitalize on market movements, consider these strategies: Prudent Leverage: Avoid excessive leverage. While it amplifies gains, it also drastically increases liquidation risk. Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and protect your capital from sudden adverse price movements. Market Analysis: Stay informed about market sentiment, news, and technical indicators. These can provide clues about potential price reversals or accelerations. Risk Management: Allocate only a small percentage of your portfolio to highly leveraged trades. Never trade with funds you cannot afford to lose. Education is your best defense in volatile markets. Knowing how liquidations work and why they occur helps in making more informed trading decisions. The recent surge in crypto futures liquidations , particularly from short positions, serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. While the immediate effect is often increased volatility and significant losses for some traders, it also highlights the resilience and potential for rapid upward movements in major digital assets. For traders, these events underscore the critical importance of disciplined risk management and a deep understanding of market mechanics to navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of crypto futures. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto futures liquidations? A1: Crypto futures liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged futures position is automatically closed by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses as the market moves against their trade. Q2: Why do short positions often dominate crypto futures liquidations? A2: When short positions dominate crypto futures liquidations , it typically means the market price has moved significantly upwards, causing traders who bet on a price decline to be forced out of their positions. This can indicate strong buying pressure or a ‘short squeeze’. Q3: How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? A3: Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and conducting thorough market analysis before entering trades. Q4: Do liquidations affect the overall crypto market? A4: Yes, large-scale liquidations can increase market volatility and amplify price movements. They can also influence market sentiment, especially if they clear out a significant number of positions on one side of the market. Q5: What is a ‘short squeeze’ in the context of liquidations? A5: A short squeeze happens when a rising price forces short sellers to close their positions by buying back the asset. This buying activity further pushes the price up, creating a feedback loop that leads to more short liquidations and an accelerated rally.

The latest US jobs data showed just 22,000 jobs added in August, far below expectations. That weak number intensified bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut while simultaneously raising fears about the health of the broader economy. For many investors, these conditions make stock markets feel like a trap, appearing stable on the surface but fragile underneath. It is precisely why capital is flowing toward gold as a safe haven and emerging crypto plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which investors see as opportunities to escape equity volatility and capture asymmetric upside. The haven rush into gold Gold has emerged once again as the primary safe haven. The metal surged to fresh highs above $3,596 per ounce earlier this month, marking a more than 33% gain this year. Analysts at Barron’s argue the rally has room to continue, with rate-cut bets and policy turmoil fueling demand. The New York Post notes that global central banks have been buyers as well, adding to already robust retail demand. This is not simply a price story. For investors, gold is becoming a cornerstone of defensive allocation, less a speculative play and more a necessity. When policymakers struggle to balance inflation and growth, and when bonds fail to provide adequate protection, gold’s timeless role as a store of value comes into sharper focus. Crypto steps back into the spotlight But gold is not the only hedge. Digital assets are re-entering the conversation as investors rotate away from equities. Reports from Ainvest and CryptoRank confirm that institutional demand for crypto is quietly accelerating. After months of subdued flows, September is showing renewed confidence, with major coins stabilizing and altcoins beginning to attract inflows. Crypto’s appeal at this moment is twofold. First, it provides portfolio diversification. Unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies are not bound by corporate earnings cycles. Second, it offers potential upside in a world where traditional assets feel capped. Analysts highlight that while equities look tired and bonds uninspiring, crypto is one of the few markets capable of rewriting investor outcomes in short bursts. Gold and crypto as complementary hedges Although often portrayed as rivals, gold and crypto are increasingly seen as complementary. Analysts at Bitwise explain that gold performs best during equity sell-offs and currency devaluations, while Bitcoin and other tokens excel when debt stress and liquidity crises dominate headlines. Together, they form a two-pronged hedge: gold preserving capital, crypto providing asymmetric upside. This strategic pairing is why more investors are blending allocations. Gold covers the defensive side of the portfolio, while crypto provides offense. September’s volatility has only reinforced the logic of this balance. Amid the renewed attention on safe havens, one project has been standing out in conversations around speculative growth: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Unlike gold, which anchors portfolios, or Bitcoin, which increasingly attracts institutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing retail investors with its combination of cultural momentum and early-stage affordability. Currently priced at just under $1, the token allows even small investors to secure meaningful allocations. Analysts emphasize this dual quality, affordability and credibility, as the reason MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction in a crowded market. Forecasts suggest a potential of 13,000% ROI or more if demand continues to accelerate. The excitement is not purely speculative; it’s rooted in a recognition that the project bridges two crucial themes of the moment: investor appetite for asymmetric returns, and investor demand for audited, trustworthy assets. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out amid September’s market trap Built on Trust: At a time when investors crave security, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already completed HashEx and CertiK audits, signaling transparency and credibility uncommon in early-stage tokens. Affordable Entry Point: For just $0.00044, it gives retail investors access to meaningful positions without overexposure, a sharp contrast to crowded, overvalued equities. High-Upside Potential: Analysts project up to 13,000% ROI, making it one of the few tokens positioned to deliver asymmetric gains as capital rotates out of traditional markets. Cultural Momentum: Communities on Telegram and X are expanding daily, giving the project narrative strength, the same force that often drives breakout cycles. Building a resilient September portfolio For those navigating the so-called September trap, the playbook is becoming clear. Reduce exposure to overheated equities. Allocate to gold for defensive depth. Build crypto positions for diversification and growth. And, for those willing to take calculated risks, include small but strategic allocations to emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This balance allows investors to protect against downside while maintaining exposure to assets that can truly move the needle. In a month where risks loom large, that kind of dual positioning may prove essential. Conclusion September once again reminds investors that stock markets can be deceptive, steady in appearance but prone to sudden weakness. In response, gold has surged as the ultimate safe haven, and crypto is regaining its role as the high-upside alternative. Yet for those seeking more than stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something different: the possibility of 13,000% ROI, backed by audits and community energy. For investors wary of stock market traps but unwilling to sit still, the strategy is clear. Hold gold for defense, add crypto for growth, and keep an eye on projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that blend trust with explosive potential.

The token advanced nearly 2% to close near $3.05, defending support at $2.98 before testing resistance around $3.07. Analysts say that while accumulation patterns remain strong, elevated exchange reserves and ETF speculation are adding layers of volatility to the next directional move. News Background • Ripple strengthened its partnership with Spanish banking giant BBVA to deliver digital asset custody solutions under the EU’s MiCA framework, bolstering institutional legitimacy. • Broader crypto markets tracked macro catalysts, including expectations of rate decisions from global central banks and shifting trade policy debates. • Futures open interest in XRP climbed to $8.36 billion, reflecting leveraged positioning ahead of potential ETF-related announcements. • Whale wallets accumulated 340M XRP tokens in recent weeks, while exchange inventories reached one-year highs, raising questions of near-term distribution pressure. Price Action Summary • XRP climbed from $2.98 to $3.05 during the September 11 trading window, marking a 1.85% gain within a $0.10 band. • The most aggressive buying occurred during the 12:00 session, where volume hit 243.37M — more than 4x the daily average of 58.9M — confirming strong institutional bids. • Resistance formed near $3.07 after multiple failed upside attempts into midnight, while profit-taking capped advances above $3.05. • The final hour saw a pullback from $3.06 to $3.04 (-0.68%) as distribution pressure increased, with 2.29M units traded at 01:41 triggering a sharp dip. • Despite the late retreat, price closed in consolidation above $3.04, suggesting continued accumulation at discounted levels. Technical Analysis • Support anchored at $2.98, validated by outsized buying volumes. • Resistance concentrated between $3.05–$3.07, where repeated rejections occurred. • Descending triangle formation tightening around the $3.00–$3.07 corridor points to imminent breakout resolution. • Final-hour volume spikes (2.29M at 01:41, 1.18M at 02:03) showed heavy distribution followed by quick recovery attempts. • RSI improvements on intraday charts suggest buying momentum is building, though exchange inflows remain a headwind. What Traders Are Watching • Whether XRP can sustain closes above $3.05 and challenge the $3.07 resistance zone — a breakout could open the path toward $3.20 in the short term. • Exchange reserves rising to 12-month highs, which traders view as a possible warning sign of distribution pressure if whale inflows stall. • The impact of Ripple’s expanded BBVA partnership under MiCA, which may accelerate institutional custody adoption and support price stability. • Positioning in derivatives markets: call options now outnumber puts 3-to-1 with strikes clustering around $3.00–$3.50, reflecting a bullish tilt ahead of September 12 expiries. • Macro signals, particularly central bank rate decisions and liquidity conditions, which continue to dictate flows into large-cap crypto assets.",Markets|XRP|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-12 03:42:33

News recently broke that the notorious Radiant Capital hacker has successfully laundered a substantial sum. This incident highlights the ongoing vulnerabilities within the crypto ecosystem. Specifically, the hacker moved a staggering 5,933 ETH, valued at approximately $26.7 million, through the privacy mixer Tornado Cash. This move, reported by EmberCN, is a critical development following the initial exploit. How Did the Radiant Capital Hacker Execute the Laundering? The laundering process involved using Tornado Cash, a decentralized protocol designed to obscure the origins of cryptocurrency transactions.

The hacker has systematically moved funds to evade detection, posing a significant challenge for tracing efforts. What Are the Implications for DeFi Security and Trust? This latest move by the Radiant Capital hacker sends a stark reminder about the persistent security risks in the DeFi space. When such large sums are stolen and laundered, it inevitably erodes user trust in decentralized protocols. The incident raises several crucial questions: How can DeFi protocols enhance their security measures to prevent future exploits? What role do privacy mixers like Tornado Cash play in enabling illicit activities? How can the crypto community work together to combat such sophisticated attacks? Furthermore, the ability of the Radiant Capital hacker to move such a significant amount underscores the need for continuous vigilance and improved auditing practices within the DeFi ecosystem. Protocols must prioritize robust security frameworks. Addressing the Broader Challenge of Crypto Exploits The Radiant Capital exploit is not unique; the crypto industry has witnessed numerous hacks and thefts. Each incident, however, provides valuable lessons. Projects must invest heavily in security audits, bug bounty programs, and real-time monitoring to detect and respond to threats swiftly.

In conclusion, the successful laundering of $26.7 million by the Radiant Capital hacker through Tornado Cash is a significant blow to the project and the broader DeFi community.

This initiative aligns with a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space, where various organizations and traditional finance firms are experimenting with crypto treasury models to strengthen their financial stability and operational capabilities. Avalanche Foundation To Offer Discounted AVAX Tokens According to the Financial Times, the Avalanche Foundation is in advanced talks to create two crypto treasuries in the United States. These moves come at a time when the foundation is gaining traction among institutional investors, with firms like BlackRock and Visa already utilizing the Avalanche blockchain for their operations. The foundation’s strategy involves launching one digital asset treasury company while converting an existing firm into a treasury vehicle. The goal is to secure approximately $1 billion, with the expectation to finalize these deals within weeks. The funds raised are earmarked for the acquisition of millions of AVAX tokens , which will be offered at a discounted price directly from the Avalanche Foundation. This approach is aimed to not only support the foundation’s growth but also to enhance the liquidity and market presence of AVAX amid an increasingly competitive treasury companies landscape. AVAX Price Approaches $30 Per the report, the first fundraising deal aims to secure up to $500 million through a private investment led by Hivemind Capital, with expectations to finalize the agreement by the end of the month. Notably, Anthony Scaramucci, a crypto investor and former White House press secretary, is advising on this initiative. The second funding endeavor involves a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) sponsored by Dragonfly Capital, which is also targeting a $500 million raise. This deal may take longer to conclude, potentially stretching into October. Both initiatives will focus on purchasing discounted AVAX tokens held by the Avalanche Foundation, which has a total supply of 720 million tokens, with approximately 420 million currently circulating. The broader cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in fundraising activities this year. Companies have raised over $16 billion to stockpile crypto assets, often inspired by the successful Bitcoin (BTC) treasury model of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Tokens associated with other blockchains, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), have also seen significant price increases. These tokens were selected by major publicly traded companies in the US for their respective crypto-focused treasuries. Although AVAX has not experienced the same upward momentum, CoinGecko data shows that it has recorded gains of up to 17% in the weekly time frame. As of this writing, the AVAX price is approaching the key $30 mark, a level not seen since February of this year.

CME Futures Data Shows Record Institutional Demand",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-6800-year-cme-futures-data-institutional/,"As Ethereum (ETH) trades in the mid $4,000 range, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures open interest (OI) for the digital asset continues to hit new highs. Against that backdrop, analysts are now predicting a new all-time high (ATH) for ETH later this year. Ethereum New ATH By End Of 2025? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, Ethereum’s CME futures OI is steadily moving towards new highs. The analyst brought attention to past data about Ethereum futures OI to predict its next move. Related Reading: Ethereum Marches Upward Without Leverage Overheating – Sign Of Structural Health? Back in 2021-2022, Ethereum futures OI remained relatively low, largely dominated by 1-2 month contracts. At the time, although ETH gained bullish momentum, institutional exposure to the cryptocurrency on CME was still limited. In sharp contrast, during the 2022 bear market, a drop in the ETH price led to a steep decline in its OI. While the period was still dominated by short-term contracts, long-term contracts stayed low, indicating weak institutional confidence in ETH. However, a trend change was observed during the 2023-2024 recovery as Ethereum OI started to rise again – specifically among 3-6 month contracts. Simultaneously, institutional demand grew alongside ETH’s price. Fast-forward to 2025, Ethereum OI has surged to new highs. As ETH rallied to the $4,500 to $5,000 range, there was a noticeable growth in short-term contracts. This dynamic indicates strong institutional participation and demand for derivatives. The CryptoQuant analyst explained the implications of two potential combinations of OI and contract concentration. First, high OI with concentrated short-term contracts can lead to increased volatility, potentially leading to sharp swings and liquidation cascades. On the contrary, rising long-term OI in 3-6 month contracts indicates growing institutional confidence and potential for higher ETH prices in the long-term. That said, crowded leveraged positions could trigger rapid corrections in the short term. PelinayPA added: ETH is trading around $5K (near ATH) with record OI on CME clear evidence of institutional FOMO. While this supports the ongoing bull trend, liquidation risk is high. Short term volatility and corrections are likely, but the medium to long term outlook remains bullish. Concluding, the analyst predicted that ETH could reach the $6,800 resistance level by the end of 2025. However, any deterioration in the global macroeconomic outlook could stall ETH’s momentum temporarily. Case For A New ETH ATH Besides the aforementioned prediction on the back of rising institutional interest in ETH, positive exchange data is also likely to benefit the cryptocurrency. For example, recent ETH outflows from Binance drove the supply ratio to a new low.

The New York-based firm, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, priced 15.2m shares at $28 each, above its earlier guidance of $24 to $26, Bloomberg reported . The final pricing reflected robust investor demand even after Gemini lifted its proposed range from $17 to $19 last week. Gemini IPO Capped At $425M Despite Heavier Demand Bankers halted new orders ahead of pricing after the book filled at speed. Reuters reported that demand outpaced supply by more than twentyfold. Gemini raised $425 million in an initial public offering, pricing its stock above a marketed range and shrinking the number of shares, according to a person familiar with the matter https://t.co/dAfdvXCuwW — Bloomberg (@business) September 11, 2025 In a rare move, Gemini and its underwriters capped proceeds at $425m, even though the sale could have raised up to $433m without the limit. Nasdaq committed to purchase 50m dollars worth of stock in a private placement at the IPO price. The deal also set aside as much as 10% of shares for long-standing users, employees and close associates, and up to 30% for retail investors on platforms such as Robinhood, SoFi and Webull. The offering gives Gemini a market value of just over $3b dollars at the top of its pricing range. The company, incorporated as Gemini Space Station Inc. for the listing, is expected to begin trading on Friday under the symbol GEMI. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup led the offering as joint bookrunners. Winklevoss Twins Retain 94.5% Voting Power The decision to cap proceeds meant any further price increase reduced the number of shares sold rather than expanding the total size of the IPO. Such structuring is rare but reflects the twin goals of maximizing pricing while maintaining control of the company’s equity base. The Winklevoss brothers, who founded Gemini in 2014 as a regulated US crypto exchange, owned nearly the entire company before the sale. Filings show they will retain about 94.5% of voting power after the IPO, ensuring tight control even as the company becomes publicly traded. The listing comes at a delicate moment for digital asset companies, which have seen valuations recover alongside Bitcoin’s climb above $115,000 this week. Investors appear willing to pay up for established exchanges, betting on growth in spot trading, custody services and exchange-traded products tied to digital assets. Gemini Keeps Use Of Funds Broad And Undisclosed The IPO’s success also points to rising appetite for equity in crypto infrastructure, even as regulators in the US step up scrutiny of trading venues. By raising public capital, Gemini joins Coinbase and Robinhood in offering investors exposure to crypto markets without directly holding tokens. Proceeds from the offering are expected to go toward technology expansion and strengthening compliance functions, though the company has not disclosed a detailed breakdown. For now, the twin founders can claim a successful debut. After years of building Gemini against competition from Coinbase, Binance.US and Kraken, they now lead one of the most oversubscribed US listings of 2025.

The current dynamic in global financial markets, where Asia FX is firming up despite persistent inflation, offers a fascinating case study. This seemingly paradoxical situation, driven by expectations of US interest rate cuts and a weakening US dollar, creates ripple effects that even crypto investors should monitor closely. How do these traditional market movements influence the digital asset landscape, and what does it signal for future liquidity and investor sentiment? Why is Asia FX Showing Remarkable Resilience? The resilience of Asia FX against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty is a key theme. Recent market movements show a consistent strengthening of several Asian currencies. This trend is not accidental; it is a confluence of factors that position the region favorably. Investors are increasingly looking towards Asia for growth opportunities, driven by robust economic fundamentals in various countries and a more stable political environment compared to some Western counterparts. The demand for Asian goods and services remains strong, contributing to healthy trade balances and capital inflows. Furthermore, central banks in Asia have largely maintained prudent monetary policies, which adds to the appeal of their respective currencies. This careful management helps to insulate these economies from some of the more extreme volatilities seen elsewhere. Several factors contribute to this resilience: Strong Economic Fundamentals: Many Asian economies exhibit healthy growth rates, manageable debt levels, and significant foreign exchange reserves. Export Performance: A robust global demand for Asian exports contributes to current account surpluses, bolstering currency strength. Capital Inflows: Attracted by growth prospects and relatively higher yields, foreign capital continues to flow into Asian markets. Monetary Policy Autonomy: Asian central banks have room to maneuver their policies, often less constrained by immediate global pressures than their Western counterparts. This collective strength in Asia FX signals a broader shift in global economic power and investment focus, making it a critical area for observation. What’s Fueling the Persistent US Rate Cut Bets? Despite inflation remaining somewhat elevated, market participants are steadfast in their conviction about impending US rate cut bets . This anticipation is the primary driver of the current market sentiment. The Federal Reserve has signaled a data-dependent approach, and while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has shown some stickiness, other economic indicators suggest a cooling economy. For instance, a slowdown in manufacturing activity and a gradual easing in the labor market are interpreted by many as precursors to the Fed adopting a more dovish stance. Investors are pricing in multiple rate cuts over the coming year, moving away from the aggressive tightening cycle seen previously. This shift in expectation is largely based on the belief that the Fed will prioritize avoiding a severe economic downturn, even if it means tolerating inflation slightly above its target for a period. The market’s forward-looking nature means that these expectations are already influencing currency valuations and capital flows, well before any actual policy changes are announced. Key drivers behind these persistent bets include: Decelerating Economic Growth: Signs of a slowdown in various sectors, suggesting the cumulative effect of past rate hikes is taking hold. Labor Market Cooling: While still robust, the pace of job creation is moderating, and wage growth shows signs of easing. Forward Guidance from the Fed: Although cautious, the Fed’s communication has opened the door to future rate reductions, shifting market sentiment. Inflation Expectations: While current CPI is sticky, long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, giving the Fed some flexibility. The market’s conviction in US rate cut bets is a powerful force, reshaping the global financial landscape and influencing investment decisions across asset classes. Why Does Dollar Weakness Continue to Persist? The concept of dollar weakness is intrinsically linked to the narrative of impending US interest rate cuts. When a central bank is expected to lower interest rates, the currency of that nation typically depreciates. This is because lower rates make the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield. The interest rate differential between the US and other major economies narrows, reducing the incentive to hold dollar-denominated assets. Furthermore, a weaker dollar can be seen as a policy tool to support exports and stimulate economic growth, making US goods more competitive internationally. The recent trend of the US Dollar Index (DXY) reflects this sentiment, showing a consistent downtrend. This decline is not just a reaction to future rate cuts but also a reflection of improved global risk appetite. As the perceived risk of a global recession diminishes, investors are more willing to allocate capital to higher-yielding or growth-oriented assets outside the US, further contributing to the dollar’s depreciation. This ongoing dollar weakness has significant implications for international trade, commodity prices, and the competitiveness of various national economies. Factors contributing to the dollar’s decline: Interest Rate Differentials: Anticipation of lower US rates reduces the yield advantage of dollar assets. Improved Global Risk Sentiment: As global economic outlook improves, demand for safe-haven assets like the dollar decreases. Trade Dynamics: A weaker dollar can make US exports more competitive, potentially boosting trade balances. Fiscal Health Concerns: Long-term concerns about US national debt and fiscal deficits can also exert downward pressure on the currency. Understanding the drivers of dollar weakness is crucial for anyone involved in international finance, including those monitoring the crypto market, as it impacts global liquidity and investment flows. How Are Markets Reacting to Sticky CPI? The phenomenon of sticky CPI , or persistently high consumer price inflation, presents a fascinating paradox in the current market environment. Typically, sticky inflation would prompt central banks to maintain or even increase interest rates to cool down the economy. However, as discussed, the market is largely betting on US rate cuts. This divergence suggests that investors are looking beyond the headline inflation figures and focusing on the underlying components and future trajectory of prices. While some categories, like services inflation, remain elevated, there’s an expectation that goods inflation will continue to moderate, and overall inflationary pressures will eventually subside. Furthermore, the market might be interpreting the “stickiness” as temporary, a result of supply-side constraints or specific sector dynamics rather than broad-based demand-driven inflation. The Federal Reserve itself has acknowledged that the path to 2% inflation might be bumpy. This nuanced interpretation allows for the continuation of US rate cut bets despite the immediate inflation data. For market participants, it’s a delicate balancing act of assessing current data against future policy intentions, and the consensus seems to be that the Fed will eventually pivot, even if inflation takes its time to fully normalize. Understanding the nuances of sticky CPI : Services Inflation: Often more persistent due to wage growth and demand, compared to goods inflation. Housing Costs: A significant component of CPI, housing inflation tends to lag and can keep overall figures elevated for longer. Market Interpretation: Investors might view current stickiness as transient, focusing on disinflationary trends in other sectors. Fed’s Patience: The central bank might be willing to tolerate slightly higher inflation for longer to avoid a recession. The market’s ability to look past sticky CPI underscores a deeper belief in the eventual disinflationary path and the Fed’s willingness to ease monetary policy. What Do These Currency Trends Mean for Your Portfolio? The evolving currency trends have profound implications for investors across various asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. For traditional investors, a stronger Asia FX and a weaker dollar can impact returns on international investments. US-based investors holding foreign assets may see enhanced returns when converting back to a depreciated dollar. Conversely, a weaker dollar makes imports more expensive for US consumers but boosts the competitiveness of US exports. For the crypto market, these macro trends are equally significant. A weaker dollar often correlates with increased liquidity in global markets, which can flow into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. When traditional investment avenues offer lower returns due to declining interest rates, investors may seek higher yields and growth opportunities in digital assets. Furthermore, a stronger Asia could mean increased institutional and retail adoption of cryptocurrencies in the region, driving demand. Monitoring these currency trends provides valuable insights into the broader economic landscape and helps anticipate shifts in investor sentiment and capital allocation. Implications for investors: Diversification Opportunities: Stronger Asian currencies can offer diversification benefits for global portfolios. Commodity Prices: A weaker dollar typically supports higher commodity prices, which can impact inflation and global trade. Crypto Market Liquidity: Increased global liquidity from a weaker dollar often spills over into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Investment Strategies: Investors may reallocate capital to regions or assets offering better risk-adjusted returns in this environment. Staying informed about these overarching currency trends is essential for making informed investment decisions and navigating the complexities of the global financial system. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Climate Understanding these intricate market dynamics allows for more informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve and Asian central banks. Their forward guidance is a key indicator of future policy. Diversify Geographically: Consider increasing exposure to Asian markets, either directly through equities or indirectly via funds that invest in the region. The strengthening Asia FX can provide an additional boost to returns. Assess Dollar Exposure: For those with significant dollar-denominated assets, consider hedging strategies or diversifying into other strong currencies to mitigate potential losses from continued dollar weakness . Watch Inflation Data Closely: While sticky CPI hasn’t deterred US rate cut bets yet, a significant re-acceleration of inflation could quickly reverse market sentiment. Monitor both headline and core inflation figures. Evaluate Risk Assets: A weaker dollar and lower interest rates generally create a more favorable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, always conduct thorough due diligence and manage risk effectively. Potential Challenges and Risks Ahead While the outlook for Asia FX appears positive, and US rate cut bets are firm, several risks could alter this trajectory: Persistent Inflation: If sticky CPI proves more enduring than anticipated, the Federal Reserve might be forced to delay or even reverse its dovish pivot, leading to a stronger dollar and potentially unsettling global markets. Geopolitical Tensions: Escalating geopolitical conflicts could trigger a flight to safety, benefiting the US dollar as a traditional safe-haven asset, despite other underlying weaknesses. Unexpected Economic Shocks: A sudden global economic downturn or a severe recession in a major economy could disrupt current currency trends and lead to renewed market volatility. Policy Missteps: Errors in monetary or fiscal policy by major economies could undermine market confidence and create unpredictable outcomes. Real-World Examples of Asia FX Performance To illustrate the points above, let’s look at a few examples of Asian currencies: Japanese Yen (JPY): Despite Japan’s unique monetary policy, the Yen often reacts to broader dollar movements. While the Bank of Japan maintains ultra-loose policy, a weaker dollar can provide some relief to the heavily depreciated Yen, as traders anticipate narrowing rate differentials in the future. Chinese Yuan (CNY): China’s currency is heavily managed, but the underlying economic strength and trade surplus contribute to its stability. A weakening dollar makes the Yuan relatively stronger against the US currency, impacting trade balances and capital flows between the two economic giants. Korean Won (KRW): South Korea, a major exporter, benefits from a robust global economy and demand for its technology products. The Won tends to strengthen when global risk sentiment improves and the dollar weakens, reflecting healthy capital inflows. Indian Rupee (INR): India’s strong domestic growth and significant foreign investment inflows help support the Rupee. While often influenced by crude oil prices, the broader trend of dollar weakness can provide a tailwind, making the Rupee more attractive for foreign capital. These examples highlight how individual Asian currencies, while having their unique drivers, are also significantly influenced by the overarching global themes of US rate cut bets and dollar weakness . A Compelling Summary: Navigating a Shifting Financial Landscape The current financial landscape is defined by a fascinating interplay of forces: resilient Asia FX , persistent US rate cut bets , a discernible trend of dollar weakness , and the puzzling presence of sticky CPI . This intricate web of factors is reshaping global currency trends and influencing investment decisions across the board, from traditional markets to the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. While inflation remains a concern, the market’s conviction in a future dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve is a powerful driver, leading to a weaker dollar and bolstering Asian currencies. This environment presents both opportunities and risks, demanding a nuanced understanding of macroeconomic indicators and central bank intentions. Staying agile, diversified, and informed will be key to navigating these evolving dynamics successfully and capitalizing on the shifts in global capital flows.

Despite these concerns, crypto market participants remain optimistic, focusing instead on anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts and signals from traditional markets as drivers for higher crypto valuations. ""The underlying driver of this market cycle is a monetary tailwind, and that remains intact, despite the risk of stagflation. Bitcoin, and crypto more broadly, are absorbing capital as a hedge against fiat dilution and long-term fiscal instability. They aren’t functioning solely as a bet on risk, like we’ve seen in past cycles,"" Shane Molidor, founder of Forgd, a crypto advisory platform, told CoinDesk. Data released Thursday showed that consumer prices rose 0.4% month-on-month in August, driving the annualized inflation rate to 2.9% — the highest since January. That was up from 2.7% in July. Meanwhile, first-time applications for unemployment benefits surged last week to their highest level in four years. Early this week, the BLS announced a record downward revision to jobs created during the year ended March 2025. Despite the supposed stagflationary data, the S&P 500 surged to new all-time highs, while the dollar index fell by 0.5% to 97.50, as traders focused on anticipated Fed rate cuts and looked beyond inflation worries. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, briefly topped $116,000, building on its recent bullish technical breakout. As of the time of writing, BTC was trading at $115,244. Altcoins such as Solans's SOL (SOL), LINK (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE) posted bigger gains on a 24-hour basis. Traders widely expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points to 4% on Sept. 17, with additional reductions anticipated through the end of the year. This outlook remains largely unchanged despite Thursday’s disappointing economic data, signaling continued confidence that the Fed will prioritize supporting the labor market, looking past concerns of sticky inflation. Le Shi, managing director of crypto market maker Auros, made an interesting observation that the Magnificent 7 coins – large-cap technology stocks known for their market dominance and strong growth potential – appear relatively insulated from stagflation fears. The continued strength in the so-called Mag 7 coins, which have planned billions in capital expenditures and research and development (R&D) expenditures on AI, could grease the crypto bull sentiment. ""On stagflation being a looming threat to the current bull run, the Mag 7 and the S&P 493 have significantly decoupled of late. As a result, the AI narrative – arguably the largest theme in this bull run so far – appears more insulated from stagflation fears because of this,"" Shi added. Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, stated that the risk-reward ratio in the cryptocurrency market remains attractive. ""Traders appear to be getting an ‘all clear’ for a rate cut next week after CPI and labor data delivered no shocks or negative surprises. With these releases behind us — and after yesterday’s softer-than-expected PPI print — we believe risk/reward continues to favor the upside,"" Gaer explained that in a potential stagflationary scenario, the Fed may be forced to prioritize price stability over employment and raise rates, which could lead to a temporary risk aversion or sell-off in growth and liquidity-sensitive assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. However, this would only strengthen the long-term crypto bull case. ""Over the medium to long term, however, this dynamic would strengthen the structural bull case for Bitcoin and crypto more broadly, as investors seek scarce, non-sovereign assets to hedge persistent fiat debasement,"" Gaer said, adding that the probability of a prolonged stagflationary regime is low. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said the disinflation trend is likely to resume in the coming months. ""Our inflation model and leading indicators point to falling inflation, a backdrop that gives risk assets room to run. A 25bp cut with guidance for more would calm markets, not spook them, and set the stage for a bullish finish to the year,"" Thielen told CoinDesk. Standout tokens As bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies reach new all-time highs, a select group of altcoins is poised to experience significant rallies. Notably, there is a growing consensus about solana's (SOL) price prospects. ""We have seen strong demand for SOL during the past 2 weeks. SOLBTC is trading at its highest level in seven months and pushing up against the psychological 0.002 level, with strong upward momentum continuing from early August. Rotation into SOL is naturally occurring as several SOL DATs are coming online, with over $1B raised (or being raised) into various SOL vehicles,"" Gaer explained. The other favorites among industry participants are the DeFi protocol Ethena's ENA token and its synthetic dollar, USDe, as well as decentralised exchange Hyperliquid's HYPE token. ""Younger investors aren’t interested in slow 7% annualized returns. Instead they’re turning to perpetuals markets and trading with leverage, making riskier bets with greater upside potential. Hyperliquid is built for exactly that type of user: it’s permissionless, always-on, and increasingly positioned as the go-to for high-beta plays, especially among younger investors who view volatility as a feature, not a bug,"" Molidor said explaining the bullish case for Hyperliquid's HYPE token. He pointed out the yield advantage Ethena has as the Fed cuts rates, driving down the return on traditional fixed-income instruments and dollar equivalents, such as stablecoins. Think of it like the popular yield-differential strategy in foreign exchange markets, where a country’s currency tends to strengthen when its bond yields rise relative to others, attracting capital flows due to higher returns. ""As the Fed cuts rates and short-term T-Bill yields fall, traditional stablecoins like Circle’s become less profitable and Ethena’s tokenized basis trade becomes more lucrative. It’s a rare circumstance where Ethena’s stablecoin yields go up as Fed rates come down, which could make the token particularly attractive in the next phase of the market cycle,"" he noted. Auros pointed to CRO along with SOL, BNB and HYPE as key tokens to watch out for during the next upswing in the crypto market.

While Bitcoin recently teased us by temporarily climbing above $116,000, suggesting a potential recovery, a deeper look into the market reveals a more cautious picture. For those who rely on data to navigate the volatile crypto landscape, the latest analysis of Bitcoin on-chain indicators suggests that caution might be the wisest approach right now. What Are Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Telling Us? Despite the fleeting price rally, a significant majority of Bitcoin’s fundamental on-chain metrics are flashing red. According to a report by Cointelegraph , an alarming eight out of ten key indicators within CryptoQuant’s BTC Bull Score Index have shifted into bearish territory. This crucial insight comes from CryptoQuant contributor Maartunn, who shared his analysis on X, highlighting a clear cooling of upward momentum. Understanding these signals is vital for any investor. These aren’t just speculative guesses; they represent real-time activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, providing a unique window into investor behavior and market sentiment. When these Bitcoin on-chain indicators collectively turn bearish, it suggests that underlying conditions might not support a sustained price increase. Diving Deeper: Which Indicators Are Bearish? So, which specific metrics are signaling this downturn? The list is comprehensive, touching upon various aspects of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of the eight indicators currently pointing to bearish conditions: MVRV-Z Score: This indicator assesses whether Bitcoin is over or undervalued relative to its “fair value.” A bearish signal here often suggests the market might be overheated. Profit and Loss Index: This looks at the aggregate profit or loss of all coins currently on the blockchain. Bearish readings imply more investors are holding onto losses or realizing them. Bull-Bear Cycle Indicator: Designed to identify market cycle phases, a bearish signal here suggests we are moving away from bullish expansion. Exchange Inflow/Outflow Index: This tracks the movement of BTC to and from exchanges. Increased inflows often suggest selling pressure, while outflows indicate accumulation. Bearish implies more selling. Network Activity: A decline in active addresses or transaction counts can signal reduced interest or utility, a bearish sign for network health. Stablecoin Liquidity: This measures the amount of stablecoins available to buy Bitcoin. Lower liquidity can mean less buying power entering the market. Investor On-Chain Profit Margins: This gauges the average profit margin of investors. Bearish signals suggest diminishing returns for holders. Trader Realized Price: This is the average price at which traders acquired their coins. When the market price falls below this, it often signals capitulation. These collective signals provide a robust, data-driven perspective on the current state of Bitcoin on-chain indicators , urging caution despite any temporary price pumps. Have We Seen This Before? The Echoes of April If this situation feels familiar, you’re not alone. Cointelegraph highlighted a striking parallel: a very similar scenario unfolded in April. Back then, eight out of ten bull indicators also shifted to bearish just before Bitcoin experienced a significant plunge, dropping to $75,000. This historical precedent adds considerable weight to the current warnings from Bitcoin on-chain indicators . It serves as a stark reminder that while price action can be enticing, the underlying fundamentals, as revealed by on-chain data, often paint a more accurate picture of future trends. For investors, this historical context is crucial. It underscores the importance of not getting swept away by short-term price movements and instead focusing on the broader, data-backed trends. While past performance is not indicative of future results, recurring patterns in on-chain data offer valuable insights into potential market shifts. Paying attention to these signals can help you make more informed decisions and potentially mitigate risks in a volatile market. Navigating the Market: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should you take away from this analysis of Bitcoin on-chain indicators ? The clear message is one of caution. While Bitcoin’s ability to briefly reclaim $116,000 might have sparked optimism, the underlying data suggests that the upward momentum is cooling. This doesn’t necessarily mean an immediate crash, but it does indicate that a sustained bullish rally might face significant headwinds. For traders, this could mean considering more conservative strategies or tightening stop-losses. For long-term investors, it might be a period to re-evaluate portfolio allocations or to hold off on new significant purchases until the on-chain signals show signs of recovery. Always remember that the crypto market is dynamic, and while these indicators provide valuable insights, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Combining on-chain analysis with other forms of market research is always recommended. Conclusion: Heeding the Warnings from On-Chain Data In summary, while Bitcoin’s recent price action offered a glimmer of hope, the comprehensive analysis of its Bitcoin on-chain indicators paints a distinctly bearish picture. With eight out of ten key metrics signaling a cooling of upward momentum, and a historical precedent from April suggesting similar warnings preceded a significant price drop, investors are urged to proceed with caution. The insights from CryptoQuant and Cointelegraph serve as a critical reminder that fundamental on-chain data often provides a more reliable compass in the unpredictable waters of the cryptocurrency market. Staying informed and understanding these complex signals can empower you to make more strategic and resilient investment decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Bitcoin on-chain indicators? Bitcoin on-chain indicators are metrics derived from publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain. They track activities like transactions, wallet movements, exchange flows, and investor behavior to provide insights into market sentiment and underlying supply/demand dynamics. 2. Why are 8 out of 10 indicators turning bearish significant? When a majority of these fundamental indicators turn bearish, it suggests a broad-based shift in market sentiment and underlying conditions. It implies that despite any temporary price rallies, the foundational elements supporting a sustained upward trend are weakening, often signaling potential downside risk. 3. How do these bearish signals compare to past market events? Cointelegraph reported a similar situation in April, where 8 of 10 bull indicators turned bearish just before Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop to $75,000. This historical parallel highlights the predictive power these Bitcoin on-chain indicators can sometimes have. 4. Does a bearish signal mean Bitcoin’s price will definitely crash? Not necessarily. Bearish Bitcoin on-chain indicators suggest increased risk and potential headwinds for price appreciation. They are powerful signals but not guarantees. The crypto market is complex, and these indicators should be used as part of a broader analysis, not as a sole determinant of future price action. 5. What should investors do when Bitcoin on-chain indicators are bearish? Investors might consider exercising caution, re-evaluating their risk exposure, or adopting more conservative trading strategies. It could be a time to tighten stop-losses, hold off on new purchases, or prepare for potential volatility. Always combine on-chain data with other market analysis.

Some X analysts compare ETH’s cycle to BTC’s 2020–2021 rally, projecting targets between $8,000 and $10,000 in the coming months. Meanwhile, exchange reserves hit a nine-year low of approximately 17.1 million tokens, signaling reduced sell pressure. The Calm Before the Storm? While Ethereum (ETH) has been trading in a tight range between $4,300 and $4,500 in the past week, the technical analysis tool Bollinger Bands suggests that a major price move could be just around the corner. The metric, developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s, helps traders spot oversold or overbought conditions. When the bands squeeze, it usually indicates a period of low volatility, which could be a precursor of a significant resurgence or a considerable correction. Earlier this week, the popular X user Ali Martinez revealed that the bands have tightened, warning the crypto community to “expect a big move.” Expect a big move for Ethereum $ETH soon as the Bollinger Bands squeeze! pic.twitter.com/5KgYzuF3Vb — Ali (@ali_charts) September 10, 2025 The majority of users commenting on the post predicted that the potential swing will be to the upside. Still, a handful remain bearish, alerting of a possible drop to $3,500. Recent Price Predictions According to X user Ted, ETH is “exactly mirroring” the bull cycle of BTC in 2020-2021. That said, he expects the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency to explode to $8,000-$10,000 in the next three to four months. However, he sees potential for a short-term correction that will “liquidate high-leveraged longs before reversal and a new ATH.” Crypto General and Max Crypto outlined similar forecasts. The former believes ETH could reach $8,000 before the end of 2025. “I am all in on this trade. Millions (of) profits or homeless,” they added . The decreasing amount of ETH stored on crypto exchanges supports the bullish thesis. CryptoQuant’s data shows that recently the figure dropped to a fresh nine-year low of around 17.1 million tokens. This means investors continue to move holdings from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, thus reducing the immediate selling pressure.

This expiry event is pretty much identical to last week’s , so there is unlikely to be any impact on spot markets, which have reclaimed $4 trillion total capitalization again. US inflation data showed that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, matching forecasts that prices and inflation would pick up slightly. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.3, meaning that there are more short contracts expiring than longs, as bearish speculation increases. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has reached $2.7 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There is also around $1.8 billion OI at $120,000, but $95,000 is a popular strike price for short sellers with $1.9 billion in OI. Additionally, total Bitcoin futures OI currently stands at $86.6 billion, which has climbed back toward all-time highs, according to CoinGlass. “Despite the imminent Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, implied volatility in the options market remains relatively stable, even showing a slight decline,” observed crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live on Thursday. “The options market is pricing in relatively low future volatility, with a consensus that a 25-basis-point rate cut has already been factored in.” Despite the imminent Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, implied volatility in the options market remains relatively stable, even showing a slight decline.

Bitcoin is back in the driving seat, spiking to a three-week high of $116,300 during the Friday morning Asian trading session before retreating to $115,500 at the time of writing. Ethereum is up 3.2% on the day, hitting a two-week high of $4,530 on Friday morning. ETH has remained rangebound for the past month, holding steadily above $4,250 for most of the time.

Some analysts forecast a massive rally toward the start-of-year highs if the momentum holds. Related Reading: Solana Season Next? Bitwise CIO Eyes ‘Epic’ Q4 Run Fueled By Corporate Demand Avalanche Eyes 35%-40% Rally On Thursday, Avalanche hit a seven-month high of $29.99 after breaking out of its multi-month accumulation range and turning the $26.50 resistance into support for the first time since February. The cryptocurrency has been rallying over the past few days, currently printing five consecutive green candles in the daily timeframe. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted that AVAX had been pushing on the key resistance, holding a series of higher local lows before smashing past this area. A breakout from this resistance level could set the stage for a rally to the start-of-year range between $40-$45, the market watcher signaled in a previous analysis. Similarly, Rekt Capital highlighted that Avalanche had been “working to build a cluster of stability” since late July, which resembles the mid-2024 re-accumulation range that preceded Q4 2024’s breakout. According to the analyst, “if repeated, could open the green pathway toward the red resistance region that is increasingly confluent with the Macro Wedge top.” He explained that AVAX has been forming Higher Lows in the weekly timeframe, positioning the price slightly higher with each retest. As a result, a weekly close above the $26 area, followed by a successful post-breakout retest, would enable AVAX price to reclaim the $30 resistance region and attempt to retest the Macro Wedge Top, currently around the $35 mark. Market watcher CW pointed out that Avalanche’s next sell wall exists around the $35-$36 area, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could retest this level in the coming days if momentum continues. Meanwhile, the next major support zone sits around the $24 level, which could be revisited in case of a rejection from the key resistance. Crypto Treasuries, Partnerships Drive Momentum As the market turns green again, multiple bullish developments have also fueled AVAX’s rally. According to recent reports, the Avalanche Foundation, the nonprofit behind the project, is seeking to raise $1 billion to establish two US-based crypto treasury vehicles. One of the deals, led by Hivemind Capital and advised by SkyBridge’s founder Anthony Scaramucci, aims to raise up to $500 million in a private investment in a Nasdaq-traded company. It is expected to be completed by the end of September. The other deal, which is expected to be closed in October, seeks to raise the same amount and involves a special purpose acquisition (SPAC) vehicle sponsored by Dragonfly Capital. Notably, the funds from the two deals will reportedly be destined to purchase millions of AVAX from the Avalanche Foundation’s reserves, which could continue to fuel momentum for the cryptocurrency.

Additionally, the company behind the Avalanche Network also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement with WeBlock to push Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization and stablecoins in South Korea. As of this writing, Avalanche trades at $29.04, a 22.7% increase in the monthly timeframe.

CFTC Nominee Shares Texts With Gemini Founders On Wednesday, CFTC Chairman nominee Brian Quintenz shared private messages with Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, suggesting that the crypto exchange co-founders contacted the US President to pause his confirmation hearing back in July. In the X post, Quintenz stated, “I’ve never been inclined to release private messages. But in light of my support for the President and belief that he might have been misled, I’ve posted here the messages that include the questions Tyler Winklevoss asked me pertaining to their prior litigation with the CFTC.” The text messages, dated July 24 and 25, showed that the Gemini co-founder asked Quintenz’s opinion on the crypto exchange’s 13-page complaint letter to the CFTC’s Inspector General, Christopher Skinner, raising multiple concerns and complaints about the agency’s Division of Enforcement (DOE) conduct against the crypto exchange over the years. The letter accused the DOE staff of waging a “trophy-hunting lawfare” campaign based on “fabricated” statements and unfairly weaponizing the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) against the crypto exchange for seven years. In 2022, the CFTC sued Gemini, claiming that the exchange issued “false and misleading statements” regarding its actions to prevent market manipulation in Bitcoin (BTC) prices in 2017. However, Gemini Trust agreed to pay $5 million to the CFTC to resolve the allegations in January 2025. Trump’s chair pick committed to “having a fair and reasonable review of the matter and the division and individuals involved to determine if they acted inappropriately,” but asserted that “the implications of and solutions to this, however, should be unequivocally left to a fully confirmed chair.” According to the message thread, Winklevoss was ultimately “disappointed and surprised” with Quintenz’s response, noting that “Cultural reform, which includes rectifying what happened to us, should be the highest priority.” Crypto Feud Halts Quintenz’s Confirmation The CFTC nominee affirmed that “these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,” adding, “It’s my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the President and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the regulatory agency has been in a leadership limbo after the US Senate Agriculture Committee delayed the vote on President Trump’s nominee for CFTC chairman days before the August recess. The committee reportedly had delayed the vote following a request from the White House. According to multiple reports, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss had allegedly pressed President Trump in July to reconsider his CFTC nominee, claiming that Quintenz wouldn’t “shake up the CFTC enough” and was not “aligned with Trump’s agenda.” Anonymous sources claim that there has been regulatory chaos at the Commission “as the agency’s responsibilities, and the potential market risks, are multiplying,” Bloomberg wrote last month. With the commissioner’s shortage and Quintenz confirmation still pending, it has allegedly been difficult to carry out critical agency business. However, a White House spokesperson denied the claims that the agency was in disarray. In August, a group of crypto organizations sent a letter to the US President in support of Quintenz, emphasizing that installing a permanent chairman is “absolutely critical” to achieve the Commission’s goals. “Mr. Quintenz possesses a singular capacity to advance sound and clear regulation that will foster responsible growth and innovation,” the letter said, “He is, quite simply, the right person at the right time to lead the CFTC.” President Trump’s chair nominee asserted on X that “protecting the President and his agenda are more important than any job,” concluding that “transparency and integrity are paramount” to achieve this.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Brian Quintenz|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC acting chair|CFTC chair nominee|CFTC chairman|Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)|crypto crackdown|Crypto exchange Gemini|Gemini founders|president trump|tyler winklevoss|Winklevoss Twins,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 05:00:54

However, that hasn’t been the case in the past 24 hours when it comes to the third-largest digital asset by market cap. Whales sold 40 million $XRP in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/XCQTr4n6cf — Ali (@ali_charts) September 12, 2025 Data from the popular analyst reveals that whales had disposed of over $120 million worth of XRP in the span of just a day. Although this is not among the most significant and most influential sell-offs in recent months, it could still trigger a domino effect for smaller investors as well. However, Ripple’s token has defied this development. Instead of feeling the selling pressure and heading below the crucial $3 support, which it had reclaimed in the past few days, XRP went on the offensive and jumped to almost $3.10. This became its highest price level since August 26, when it was rejected at $3.12 and pushed south to under $2.85. XRP sits at $3.05 as of press time, being up by 1.5% daily and almost 9% weekly. Its market cap has grown to over $180 billion. Analysts are adamant that the next rally is around the corner, with some outlining targets of over $4 and up to $5 , which would set a new all-time high. On the much-observed ETF front, though, XRP continues to receive blows from the US regulator (the SEC), as the agency delayed making a decision on another spot Ripple fund earlier this week.

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for a move above the $920 level in the near term. BNB price started a fresh increase above the $880 and $900 levels. The price is now trading above $900 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $898 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $885 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Extends Gains BNB price formed a base above the $850 level and started a fresh increase, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a steady move above the $870 and $885 levels. The bulls even cleared the $895 resistance zone. A new all-time high was formed at $908 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $888 swing low to the $908 high. The price is now trading above $900 and the 100-hourly simple moving average.

Consolidating above $4,400 could provide the necessary boost for an upside breakout, but will require a concrete breakout above the consolidation highs (around the $4,500 level). With traders now turning to next week’s FOMC decision, crypto markets await a progressing technical outlook. By Elior Manier US equities surged again after the CPI release, with all major indices - S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones - notching fresh all-time highs. The US dollar has been struggling with rate markets, which are now progressively betting off a 50 bps FOMC cut, though expectations remain fluid. Indeed, the immediate post-CPI reactions took some of that pricing back, before re-upping the odds just above 10%. Players will now expect hints from journalists such as Wall Street Journal's Timiraos, the usual suspect for pre-FOMC Fed insights. However, cryptocurrencies are lagging this risk-on rally. While Bitcoin rebounded since its past week $108,000 lows, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is still trying to regain upside momentum. The broader altcoin and crypto complex has yet to reflect the same strength seen in equities and other risk assets since the morning session. With traders now turning to next week’s FOMC decision, crypto markets await a progressing technical outlook. Let's peek at the current crypto market picture before diving into a multi-time frame Ethereum analysis. The Crypto Market picture in today's CPI session Crypto market overview, September 11, 2025 (Source: Finviz) The crypto picture is very mixed overall - watch other risk assets and market leaders (Solana in today's session) to spot how flows evolve. A multi-time frame Ethereum analysis Ethereum Daily Chart Ethereum Daily Chart, September 11, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Since our last analysis of the second-largest crypto, prices have consolidated above the 4,200-4,500 momentum pivot. Momentum has now decreased from extremely overbought levels back to right above neutral, which allows for further potential action to develop. The combination of both price and momentum consolidation provides a floor for higher volatility in the upcoming weeks. Despite the lack of momentum, if sentiment stays positive as it is, ETH-USD has formed a floor on which to bounce on. The balance to this potential outcome, however, would be a failure to rebound from here, which can lead to a lower interest in cryptos - which would be detrimental for the digital asset market. Momentum attracts momentum! Ethereum 1H Chart Ethereum 1H Chart, September 11, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Looking closer highlights how strong the ongoing range is. Buyers will have to maintain the upward trend line, as a few breakout attempts got rejected during the ongoing session. Consolidating above $4,400 could provide the necessary boost for an upside breakout, but will require a concrete breakout above the consolidation highs (around the $4,500 level). Levels of interest for ETH trading: Support Levels: Consolidation support 4,250 to 4,280 $4,200 to $4,500 consolidation zone (getting tested) $4,000 to $4,095 main long-run pivot $3,500 main support zone Resistance Levels: Consolidation resistance $4,480 to $4,500 $4,950 current new all-time highs $4,700 to $4,950 all-time high resistance zone Potential main resistance $5,230 Fibonacci extension A look back at the ETH/BTC chart ETH/BTC Daily Chart, September 11, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Crypto market depth is currently stalling, as translated by the most recent slowdown in the ETH/BTC ratio. However, with the correction currently stalling, it will be time for crypto aficionados to flex their muscles to lift crypto market sentiment. A rise in the crypto ratio is typically favorable for the market, and with ETH's most recent top, other altcoins are looking at their big brother to get started again. On the other hand, Solana is still powering through. Keep an eye on the ETH/SOL relative performance. A potential rally from here due to the ongoing consolidation may change market dynamics, therefore keep a close eye on the general crypto market sentiment. Safe Trades!

This isn’t just a futuristic dream; it’s a tangible possibility, but one that hinges on crucial financial reforms. The potential for a successful won stablecoin in South Korea is immense, promising to elevate the nation’s financial standing on the international stage. However, realizing this vision requires significant groundwork, as highlighted by a leading government think tank. Why is a Robust Offshore Market Key for Won Stablecoin Success? According to the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP), a government-affiliated research institution, the path to a thriving won stablecoin is clear: South Korea must first strengthen its foundational financial infrastructure. Yonhap Infomax reported KIEP’s findings, which emphasize that introducing offshore won trading is a fundamental prerequisite. This means allowing the Korean Won to be traded more freely outside of South Korea, increasing its international accessibility and liquidity. Increased Liquidity: Offshore trading would make the won more readily available to international participants. Global Reach: It would broaden the won’s appeal beyond domestic borders. Reduced Friction: Easing access could streamline international transactions involving the won. Without these advancements, a digital won might struggle to gain widespread adoption and maintain its value consistently in the global crypto ecosystem. The institute’s report, published on September 12, analyzed the broader implications of U.S. stablecoin legislation, underscoring the global trend towards robust regulatory and market frameworks. The Crucial Role of a Short-Term Bond Market for Won Stablecoin Stability Beyond offshore trading, KIEP also points to the necessity of a robust market for short-term government bonds. Why is this so vital for a won stablecoin ? Stablecoins are typically pegged to a reserve asset, and often, these reserves include highly liquid, low-risk instruments like short-term government bonds. A strong, liquid market for these bonds provides the necessary backing for a stablecoin, ensuring its peg remains strong and reliable. Think of it this way: if a stablecoin needs to redeem a large number of tokens quickly, its reserves must be easily convertible into the underlying fiat currency. A deep and active short-term bond market facilitates this, offering a stable and accessible pool of assets to back the digital won. Therefore, improving this market is not just about traditional finance; it’s a direct enabler for the future of digital currency in South Korea. Beyond Infrastructure: The Imperative of Digital Asset Regulations While market infrastructure is paramount, KIEP also stressed the need for clear digital asset regulations. These two pillars—market reform and regulatory clarity—are not mutually exclusive; instead, they are interdependent. Strong regulations provide a legal framework for stablecoin operations, protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. This clarity builds trust, which is essential for any financial instrument, especially a new digital one like a won stablecoin . A well-defined regulatory landscape would: Foster innovation responsibly. Mitigate risks for users and the broader financial system. Attract institutional participation and investment. Ultimately, the international competitiveness of the South Korean won itself is at stake. By taking these comprehensive steps, the nation can strengthen its overall financial standing and ensure its digital currency initiatives are built on a solid foundation. What are the Benefits of a Globally Competitive Won Stablecoin? A successful won stablecoin , backed by these reforms, promises significant benefits for South Korea. It could enhance the won’s global profile, making it a more attractive currency for international trade and investment in the digital age. This move would position South Korea as a leader in financial innovation, potentially attracting more foreign capital and fostering new economic opportunities. The institute’s analysis serves as a strategic roadmap, outlining the essential reforms needed to navigate the evolving global financial landscape. It’s a call to action for policymakers to prioritize these foundational changes to unlock the full potential of digital currencies and secure South Korea’s future financial prowess. The journey towards a successful won-denominated stablecoin is complex, requiring a coordinated effort across policy, infrastructure, and regulation. However, the potential rewards—enhanced international competitiveness and a modern, resilient financial system—make these efforts undeniably worthwhile. South Korea stands at a pivotal moment, with the opportunity to redefine its role in the global digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a won stablecoin? A won stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won. It aims to combine the benefits of blockchain technology with the stability of a fiat currency. Q2: Who is KIEP and what is their role? KIEP stands for the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. It is a government-funded think tank that conducts research and provides policy recommendations on international economic issues, including financial markets and digital assets. Q3: Why are offshore FX and bond markets important for a won stablecoin? Offshore FX (foreign exchange) markets increase the won’s global accessibility and liquidity, while a robust short-term bond market provides stable and liquid assets to back the stablecoin’s value, ensuring its peg and redeemability. Q4: What are the main benefits for South Korea if a won stablecoin succeeds? A successful won stablecoin could significantly boost the international competitiveness of the Korean Won, position South Korea as a leader in financial innovation, and attract more global investment and trade. Q5: Are these reforms only about stablecoins? No, while crucial for stablecoins, these reforms (offshore FX, bond market improvements, and digital asset regulations) also generally strengthen South Korea’s overall financial market infrastructure and international competitiveness.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-warns-xrp-holders-our-time-is-running-out-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst CryptoSensei recently posted a video alongside a tweet that read, “ OUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT!!!” In the video, he outlined the distinction between two forms of central bank digital currency. According to the explanation, the wholesale version is intended for use between central banks, while the retail version would be designed for individuals and businesses to use in everyday transactions. The retail version, as CryptoSensei noted, would apply to the general public, such as a potential digital dollar. OUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT!!! #CBDC #XRP #RIPPLE pic.twitter.com/5OckIhmjSA — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) September 10, 2025 Concerns Over Missed Opportunities CryptoSensei emphasized that the wholesale form of CBDC could provide efficiencies, cost savings, and improvements in interbank operations. They noted that adopting a wholesale CBDC could accelerate transactions and reduce systemic inefficiencies, yet the United States has refrained from pursuing this path. The avoidance, they argued, appears tied to skepticism and fear surrounding CBDCs in general. CryptoSensei suggested that the hesitation may stem from misinformation or a lack of public understanding, even though the wholesale model would not carry the same concerns as a retail system. Global CBDC Advancements In the video, CryptoSensei pointed out that more than 90 percent of countries are currently exploring or developing some form of central bank digital currency. They highlighted China as an example, noting that its digital currency has already been deployed. They also referenced India and several other countries where retail CBDCs have gone live, describing their rollouts as being successful in supporting local economies. By comparison, the United States remains at a standstill, without meaningful progress toward implementation. The Issue of Timing CryptoSensei raised concerns about the timing of any U.S. decision on CBDCs . They stated that waiting until a new administration takes office to revisit the matter could result in further delays, potentially placing the U.S. at a disadvantage compared to other nations. While acknowledging that retail CBDCs spark debates over control and privacy, CryptoSensei reiterated that wholesale CBDCs offer a way to cut costs and streamline financial operations without raising the same level of concern. Their main question was why U.S. policymakers have avoided exploring this model, leaving the outcome uncertain. The Connection to XRP and Ripple Though not expanded upon in detail within the video, CryptoSensei included references to XRP and Ripple in the tweet itself. XRP has frequently been discussed in the context of payment efficiency and cross-border settlement, areas where wholesale CBDCs could play a significant role. By linking these terms, CryptoSensei suggested that there is an intersection between CBDC development and technologies like XRP that aim to improve global payment infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 CryptoSensei’s message underlined both urgency and frustration with the U.S. government’s approach to CBDCs. They framed the issue as one of missed opportunities, pointing out that while other countries move ahead with digital currencies, the United States risks falling behind. Their emphasis was not on advocating for retail CBDCs, but on highlighting the advantages of wholesale systems that could improve efficiency and reduce costs in interbank transactions. According to their perspective, continued delay may leave the U.S. unprepared as digital currency adoption accelerates worldwide.

What Are the Whales Doing?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-on-ethereum-eth-what-are-the-whales-doing/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant has released a compelling report on the current market outlook for Ethereum (ETH). The firm notes that Ethereum is experiencing one of its strongest periods in history in terms of institutional demand, staking participation, and on-chain activity. According to the report, Ethereum fund holdings have doubled since April 2025, reaching 6.5 million ETH. Furthermore, the total holdings of whale wallets with balances between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have surpassed 20 million ETH. While this indicates strong institutional interest, it also suggests significant “smart money” positioning and limited short-term upside potential. Ethereum staking also hit a new record. The total amount of ETH staked rose to 36.15 million. CryptoQuant notes that this reflects long-term confidence and a reduction in circulating supply. However, the high number of staked assets also highlights the possibility that new inflows could slow if price momentum weakens. Network expansion continues. The total number of transactions and active addresses on Ethereum has reached an all-time high. The growth of DeFi, stablecoin transfers, and token activity is driving ETH usage, while smart contract calls exceeding 12 million per day reinforce Ethereum's importance as a programmable consensus layer. Related News: The Wealth of Arthur Hayes, the Big Altcoin Bull, Revealed - Here Are the Cryptocurrencies He Holds Meanwhile, a sharp decline in inflows to exchanges has been observed. According to the analyst firm, the amount of ETH sent to exchanges has decreased significantly since the price of ETH reached $5,000. This suggests that selling pressure has eased and investors are anticipating upward price action. On the price front, critical levels are on the agenda. ETH's recent rally peaked at the upper band of the realized price at $5,200. CryptoQuant emphasizes that this level has historically been a strong resistance area. Currently trading around $4,400, analysts warn that consolidation or correction is likely if this resistance level is not clearly broken. *This is not investment advice.

These patterns, typically bullish, suggest the possibility of a long-term rally that could propel BTC to $360,000. The current price sits near $115,390. Smaller Pattern Confirms Breakout The first IH&S has been in play since November 2024. Bitcoin broke above the neckline in July at $112,000, confirming the bullish structure. The measured target for this pattern is around $170,000, implying a nearly 50% gain from current levels. The rebound from $112,000 indicates that the formation remains intact. Larger Supercycle Formation The second IH&S pattern stretches back to March 2021. Bitcoin crossed above its neckline near $73,000 in November 2024, shortly after the U.S. elections, pushing prices beyond $100,000. A subsequent retest of $74,400 in April confirmed the breakout, strengthening confidence in the bullish projection. If the pattern continues to unfold, analysts see Bitcoin climbing as high as $360,000, a 217% increase from present levels. Analysts Call It “Supercycle Ignition” Market analyst Merlijn The Trader described the setup as extraordinary. “The Bitcoin inverse head and shoulders of dreams has now doubled,” he said in a Wednesday post. “This isn’t a pattern. It’s the supercycle ignition.” The sentiment underscores growing excitement that Bitcoin could be entering a historic phase of growth. Short-Term Outlook Remains Bullish On shorter timeframes, technical analysis also favors upside. As reported by Cointelegraph, a similar formation on the four-hour chart suggests a near-term target of $120,000, provided BTC holds above $113,000. This shorter rally would align with broader bullish momentum, giving traders confidence in further gains. ETFs Fuel Institutional Demand Institutional participation is also on the rise. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded three straight days of inflows between Monday and Wednesday, totaling $1.15 billion. The $752 million of inflows on Wednesday marked the strongest single-day figure since mid-July. Analysts believe this renewed demand reflects growing confidence among institutions even as retail participation wanes. Market intelligence firm Santiment commented on the surge, saying: “Money is moving back into Bitcoin ETFs at a rapid rate as retailers impatiently drop out of crypto. Previous crypto rallies were boosted by inflow spikes like this.” Path Toward Higher Targets The combination of strong technical structures and institutional inflows provides a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin. If momentum continues, the possibility of a parabolic rise toward $170,000, and eventually $360,000, cannot be dismissed. For now, traders are closely watching the $113,000 support and ETF inflow trends as key signals of whether the “supercycle ignition” thesis will hold.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-12 05:24:36

The outcome could result in a new trial or a revised sentence. Meanwhile, several former executives have already been sentenced, including Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, Nishad Singh, and Ryan Salame, with Michelle Bond’s case still pending. SBF Appeal Hearing Set for November Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is set to take the next step in his appeals process with a hearing that is scheduled for November in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The court calendared arguments for Nov. 4, and it will be the first major development in his case since his transfer in March from a New York facility to the Federal Correctional Institution at Terminal Island in California. Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven felony counts and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2023, but has maintained that he was denied the presumption of innocence during his trial. His legal team argued in their September of 2024 appeal filing that prosecutors mischaracterized FTX user funds as permanently lost. If the appellate court rules in his favor, the outcome could include a new trial or a revised sentencing. Bankman-Fried’s conviction followed the collapse of FTX in November 2022, when the exchange filed for bankruptcy amid a severe liquidity crisis. While several top executives pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors, Bankman-Fried alone maintained a not guilty plea, which led to one of the most closely watched crypto-related trials to date. After his extradition from the Bahamas, he was initially allowed to stay at his parents’ home in California, but a judge revoked his bail in August of 2023 after evidence emerged suggesting he tried to intimidate witnesses . According to the US Bureau of Prisons, his projected release date is Oct. 25, 2044. The fallout from the FTX collapse also affected other executives. Caroline Ellison, former Alameda Research CEO and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend, was sentenced to two years in prison in 2024 after testifying against him. FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former engineering director Nishad Singh both received sentences of time served, while former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame was given more than seven years in prison after his failed attempt to vacate his guilty plea.

On one hand, presale crypto projects are gaining momentum as investors look for early opportunities with strong communities and creative ecosystems. On the other, established tokens like Shiba Inu continue to hold market dominance, backed by recognition and years of trading activity. Among the top crypto presales, Based Eggman $GGs has been highlighted for its unique blend of meme culture, gaming infrastructure, and Base network integration. Meanwhile, SHIB remains a powerful player in the meme coin space, continuing to capture interest from traders and long-term holders alike. This head-to-head comparison looks at how new crypto token presales stack up against established tokens when it comes to ROI potential in 2025. Based Eggman ($GGs): A Presale Designed for Growth Based Eggman $GGs is gaining recognition as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. Built on Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, $GGs is more than just a meme coin. It is a utility-driven token that supports liquidity, gaming, payments, and smart contract gas fees within the Based Eggman ecosystem. The token’s presale structure is designed to reward early adopters. The starting presale price is $0.006389, with a planned launch price of $0.0589. This structure encourages long-term holding by offering clear value at entry. Early numbers show strong traction, with more than 71,049 USDT raised and over 9 million $GGs tokens sold so far. The mission of Based Eggman is to merge gaming, memes, and blockchain into one ecosystem, making Base a hub for culture and entertainment in Web3. By positioning itself as a new crypto token presale with strong tokenomics, $GGs stands out among other presale crypto tokens in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Technical Signals and Market Behavior Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most recognizable meme coins in the crypto market. Current price action shows SHIB trading near $0.0000131, with mixed technical indicators shaping its outlook. On the 4-hour chart, SHIB’s 50-day moving average slopes upward, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. However, the daily and weekly charts show the same average sloping downward, which reflects ongoing bearish pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits in the neutral zone between 30 and 70, highlighting balanced momentum but with a weak bearish divergence on shorter timeframes. SHIB is also consolidating within a symmetrical triangle formation. This pattern often signals upcoming volatility, with key levels to watch around $0.0000131 for upward momentum and $0.0000120 for potential downside. These indicators show how SHIB continues to attract traders, but also how its volatility remains part of its market identity. New Presale vs Established Token: ROI Potential Compared When comparing Based Eggman $GGs and Shiba Inu, the difference lies in their positions within the market. $GGs is part of the new crypto presale wave, offering entry at a low cost with a presale coin designed for adoption on Base. Its tokenomics reward early participants, making it a strong example of how crypto coins on presale can build momentum. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, represents staying power in the meme coin sector. It has established liquidity, high market capitalization, and global recognition. However, as an established asset, its ROI potential depends on price performance within a mature market. This contrast shows why many investors diversify. Token presales like $GGs provide fresh opportunities, while established tokens like SHIB offer stability and recognition. Together, they reflect how top crypto presales and long-standing tokens both contribute to shaping the 2025 crypto landscape. Final Words: $GGs and the Presale Crypto Theme The comparison between Based Eggman $GGs and Shiba Inu highlights the dynamic nature of crypto in 2025. Presale crypto projects like $GGs bring new energy through culture, gaming, and structured tokenomics. Established tokens like SHIB maintain influence through liquidity, recognition, and trading history. Both approaches matter. For those looking to buy presale crypto, $GGs offers entry into one of the top presale crypto projects of 2025. For others who value established presence, SHIB remains a staple in the meme coin market.

The chart highlights three main points: the peak cost of 94,703 XRP for the iPhone 7, the current figure of 285 XRP for the iPhone 17, and a reported overall decrease of 99.7 percent across this time span. The cost of an iPhone in XRP over the years pic.twitter.com/EmdPLXU2pC — xpmarket® (@xpmarket) September 10, 2025 XRP Values Attached to Each Model According to the graphic, the iPhone 7 required 94,703 XRP. The iPhone 8 is shown at 3,976 XRP, while the iPhone X is listed at 4,943 XRP. The iPhone 11 is marked at 2,436 XRP, and the iPhone 12 at 3,133 XRP. The chart shows the iPhone 13 at 791 XRP, the iPhone 14 at 1,631 XRP, the iPhone 15 at 1,567 XRP, and the iPhone 16 at 1,427 XRP. The iPhone 17, as the most recent model presented, is placed at 285 XRP. This presentation allows a straightforward comparison across different generations of iPhones, with a visible trend toward lower XRP requirements in recent years. Analysis of the Trend The figures indicate that the number of XRP units required to purchase an iPhone has declined significantly over time, though not in a uniform pattern. Early models, such as the iPhone 7, required tens of thousands of XRP, while more recent models, like the iPhone 13, fall within the hundreds or low thousands. The infographic shows variation between models, with the iPhone X and iPhone 12 both appearing higher than adjacent models, but the general direction is downward. The result presented is a nearly complete reduction from the iPhone 7 peak to the iPhone 17 figure, quantified as 99.7 percent. Considerations on Methodology The chart offers a clear visualization of XRP-denominated costs but does not specify the assumptions used in compiling the data. Details such as whether launch prices or average retail values were applied, the storage capacity chosen for comparison, and the exchange rates used for conversions are not provided. Without this information, the figures serve as illustrative indicators rather than precise transactional values. Regional differences in pricing and variations in market exchange rates could also significantly alter the results if different sources or time frames were used.

Andrea Gacki, Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), announced this week in Congress that the “mixer rule” has reached its final stages. The regulation, which uses PATRIOT Act powers to ban privacy-enhancing software and methods for cryptocurrency transactions, is now in its final stages. The PATRIOT Act, enacted in 2001 after the September 11 attacks, gave the government broad oversight and investigative powers. Over the years, the law has tightened “know your customer” (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks in the financial system. Now, these powers are being extended to digital assets. The “mixer rule” the Treasury is working on classifies not just cryptocurrency mixers but also numerous on-chain transactions that can provide privacy as a “primary money laundering concern.” These include: Combine or split funds from multiple wallets or accounts Splitting transactions into parts and transferring them on the chain Creating disposable wallets or addresses Swapping between cryptocurrencies Applying user-induced delays to transactions Related News: Whales Are Hoarding Bitcoin, Small Investors Are Selling: What Does This Mean? Experts point out that these definitions are quite broad and could even lead to legitimate users being suspected of committing crimes. Citing the federal crime of breaking transactions into smaller pieces, known as “smurfing” in traditional finance, they suggest similar criminal liability could be extended to cryptocurrency. Concurrent with FinCEN's work, the Special Measures to Fight Modern Threats Act, previously considered dead in Congress, has been revived. Representative Zach Nunn confirmed that the bill is still being debated. This regulation could give the Treasury Department the authority to ban all crypto transactions verified through foreign countries, exchanges, or even miners abroad, without requiring any public due process. Critics argue that such authority could lead to a complete withdrawal of US banks and crypto exchanges from global transactions, which is an “authoritarian approach.” Cryptocurrency industry representatives believe that a complete ban on privacy software would disadvantage not only criminals but also individuals seeking protection from oppressive regimes. The direction the US will take on the final regulations will become clear in the coming weeks. *This is not investment advice.

Ether rose 2.5% to $4,519, while the overall crypto market added 1.5% to $4.1 trillion. The gains followed a week of closely watched economic releases that reinforced a shift in market sentiment. Producer price index data earlier this week showed wholesale inflation unexpectedly declined 0.1%, against forecasts for a 0.3% increase. That was followed by consumer price index figures, which confirmed headline inflation had quickened but not enough to derail bets on imminent monetary easing. JUST IN: $116,000 Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/kqCBWGaGGq — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 12, 2025 Sharp Job Revisions Add Weight To Fed Rate-Cut Bets At the same time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised down employment data for the 12 months through March 2025, erasing about 900,000 jobs. The adjustment, nearly halving the previous count, signaled that the labour market is weaker than previously thought. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said the combination of steady inflation numbers and large downward revisions to employment was pushing the Fed away from a focus on price stability toward supporting growth. “This is greatly helping shift the narrative of the Fed away from inflation towards cutting rates to support the labor market,” he said. He added that this tilt increased the likelihood of a 50-basis-point rate cut either next week or at the October policy meeting. Bitcoin Gains Momentum As Investors Brace For Fed Action Risk assets from Bitcoin to gold rallied in response, front-loading the impact of the expected easing. Investors interpreted the shift as an opportunity to position ahead of a decisive Fed move. Gadi Chait, investment manager at Xapo Bank, noted that Bitcoin had already shown resilience, climbing to $114,000 earlier in the week. “This divergence between sticky inflation and weakening employment creates an almost ideal backdrop for Bitcoin, as investors seek protection against both currency debasement risks and macroeconomic uncertainty,” he said. Weekly jobless claims rising to 263,000 reinforced that view, keeping a September cut firmly in play. Markets now anticipate the Fed will act quickly, balancing stubborn inflation with signs of softening growth. Institutional appetite showed through once again on Sept. 11, when spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $553m in net inflows, the fourth straight day of gains. Ethereum spot ETFs added another $113m, extending their own streak to three days. Whether the Fed opts for a quarter- or half-point cut, Bitcoin continues to attract capital. Its role in portfolios is expanding, with allocators seeing it as a unique asset that offers protection across multiple scenarios.

With its deliberate, peer-reviewed approach, Cardano has historically been more about building sustainable foundations than chasing short-term hype. But now that scaling solutions and governance upgrades are on the horizon, investors want to hear how that might impact ADA’s market value in the months ahead. While ADA’s trajectory depends on its execution of the roadmap, investors are also moving towards emerging opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its early rounds of presale have sold out at record speed, and some analysts predict up to 20,000% ROI if you enter before wider listings. This concurrent momentum illustrates the divide in the market between incumbent blockchains such as Cardano and new, high-growth challengers. Cardano’s 2025 Roadmap Cardano’s development has been divided into five eras, with the current focus on Basho (scaling) and Voltaire (governance). These phases aim to make Cardano more competitive with top networks while giving the community direct control over the future of the ecosystem. Scaling Goals (Basho Era) In the Basho-era, the emphasis is on performance and throughput. Key here is a Layer-2 approach called Hydra , which relies on off-chain state channels. Each Hydra “head” can possibly perform up to 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). And with different heads running in parallel, in theory the network could reach 1 million TPS – which would place Cardano for use in DeFi, gaming, and beyond. Other scaling enhancements are zero-knowledge rollups to pack transactions and next-gen consensus protocols such as Leios and Peras , which aim to enable faster parallel block creation. Governance Goals (Voltaire Era) The Voltaire phase is all about self-sustainability. Cardano is introducing a treasury system where ADA holders vote on proposals, funding ecosystem projects directly from the blockchain. Project Catalyst — this pillar will keep funding hundreds of startups and applications in 2025, extending Cardano’s footprint across DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. A New Altcoin’s Rapid Rise As Cardano is forging ahead with its research-driven roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines for radically different reasons. Its presale has turned into one of the fastest-selling in recent memory, with rounds closing nearly instantly amid overwhelming demand. Such early momentum could establish a platform for explosive growth once it hits major exchanges, analysts say. Comparisons with the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have been made, with the possibility of 20,000% returns for early backers, in a much more focused way on long-term ecosystem development. ADA Price Predictions for 2025 Projections for ADA are subject to a large range of forecasts based on how efficiently the network can execute its roadmap and the state of the crypto market at large. Bullish Scenario : If Hydra reaches mass adoption and DeFi activity grows, ADA might go towards $2.00–$3.00. Moderate Scenario: Analysts hopeful of steady growth point to ADA likely hovering at around $0.80 to $1.60 suggesting progress, with some movement, without a huge surge. Bearish Scenario: If development is slow, or if crypto markets decline, ADA could try to make lows of below $0.60 , but community and institutional support could prevent it from breaking down further. Key Drivers of ADA’s Performance Cardano’s 2025 journey is reliant on several key elements: Scaling Success: Hydra will be the major test case for whether Cardano is able to scale globally. Ecosystem Expansion: More DeFi and NFT projects building on Cardano will expand the use cases of ADA. Institutional Interest: Franklin Templeton running nodes, for example, provide evidence of increasing legitimacy. Regulatory Shifts: Cardano’s academic and compliance-driven strategic framework could benefit from a stricter environment Conclusion Cardano’s cautious, research-intensive approach is now under examination in real-world conditions. As Hydra grows, Voltaire governance gets upgraded, and the ecosystem goes further, 2025 should be the year of breakthrough. And, at the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s record-breaking presale and 20,000% ROI potential show how investors are balancing attention toward the giants that are already there and also looking for new, explosive opportunities. Both stories highlight the diversity of crypto’s future — one rooted in careful evolution, the other based on rapid momentum.

BitMine’s Total Ethereum Holdings Surge Past 2.1 Million ETH According to an X post by on-chain analytics account Lookonchain, BitMine seems to have further increased its total ETH holdings. Notably, the firm’s wallet added another 46,225 ETH to its total holdings, worth slightly more than $200 million. It should be recalled that on September 8, BitMine had bought 202,500 ETH, helping it boost its total ETH holdings to more than two million for the first time ever. Eventually, the firm aims to hold 5% of the total ETH supply. The New York Stock Exchange-listed (NYSE) firm has been on an ETH buying spree all summer. Following today’s purchase, its total ETH holdings have now surged above 2.1 million, worth approximately $9.27 billion at the time of writing. It is worth highlighting that BitMine currently holds the largest amount of ETH among all public companies. According to data from Coingecko, SharpLink is a distant second on the list, with 837,230 ETH on its balance sheet. Other firms like Coinbase (136,782 ETH), Bit Digital (120,306 ETH), and ETHZilla (102,246 ETH), round up the top five holders of ETH. Notably, nine out of the top ten firms holding the most amount of ETH are US-based. Following today’s purchase, BitMine’s stock BMNR is trading at $47.85, up 4.93% on the day. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the stock has jumped a whopping 559%, making it one of the best performing crypto-related stocks this year. ETH Giving Bitcoin A Run For Its Money As an increasing number of firms embrace ETH as the digital asset of choice, attention has been steadily moving away from the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin (BTC). However, this does not mean that ETH has completely displaced BTC. That said, the trend of companies choosing to add ETH to their balance sheets gained significant momentum in 2025. Yesterday, Cyprus-based firm Robin Energy announced it had bought ETH worth $5 million. Similarly, in August, SharpLink bought another 56,533 ETH to increase its total ETH reserves. In the same vein, Jack Ma-linked Yunfeng Financial invested close to $44 million into ETH earlier this week. ETH could see further price appreciation as staking activity on the network continues to grow at an exponential rate. At press time, ETH trades at $4,435, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|BitMine|btc|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ether|Ethereum Adoption|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 06:00:12

Sethi Warns Of Short-Term Crypto Bubbles In a recent interview with Fortune at the Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah, Sethi acknowledged the presence of a bubble when examining short-term market trends. During the panel discussion, Sethi noted, “If you look at it quarter by quarter, the answer is yes, we get into those bubbles all the time.” Related Reading: SEC Chair Declares ‘Crypto’s Time Has Come’ In Latest Statement – Get The Full Scoop Since the beginning of the year, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has achieved multiple all-time highs, contributing to a total market capitalization exceeding $4 trillion for the first time. This surge has been fueled by pro-crypto regulations stemming from President Donald Trump’s administration and crypto-focused initial public offerings (IPOs) in the United States from firms like Circle (CRLC) and the crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH). The current enthusiasm in the crypto market can be partially attributed to its correlation with the stock market, particularly following record highs in the S&P 500 since President Donald Trump took office. Some argue that these developments provide investors with exposure to cryptocurrencies that may not be accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. However, skeptics caution that many of these firms are merely capitalizing on the hype, leading to unsustainable valuations that could result in a market crash. Silbert Predicts Most Digital Assets Will Crash Recent data indicates that there may already be signs of a downturn. According to Architect Partners, a crypto advisory and financing firm, the average stock price of 15 digital asset treasuries dropped by 15% last week, raising red flags about the stability of the market. Conversely, Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), expressed a more optimistic outlook during the same panel. He acknowledged the presence of “overvalued assets” within the crypto space, stating, “There’s a whole lot of crap in crypto right now, which is overvalued. I think 99% of crypto is absolutely going to zero.” Related Reading: XRP Price Completes Wave 3 Move, Why $3.13 Must Be Broken Further complicating the landscape, Elliott Management, an activist investment firm, has also raised alarms about the cryptocurrency market. In a recent investor letter, the firm pointed to the rapid inflation of the so-called crypto bubble, attributing it in part to perceived endorsements from the White House during Trump’s administration. Elliott Management warned that the dramatic rise in crypto prices poses risks not only to individual investors but also to the overall economy. They caution that an impending collapse of this bubble could have unforeseen consequences, potentially destabilizing financial markets at large.

Key Takeaways: FTX and Alameda redeemed $44.9 million in Solana, continuing a $1.2 billion unstaking trend. Despite redemptions, the estate still holds 4.18 million SOL worth nearly $1 billion. FTX has returned $6.2 billion to creditors and plans a third payout on September 30. The move follows a consistent pattern observed over the past year, with the estate redeeming Solana assets on a near-monthly basis. Since November 2023, FTX and Alameda have unstaked and transferred nearly 9 million SOL, valued at $1.2 billion, averaging $134 per token. FTX Estate Still Holds Nearly $1B in Solana Despite Ongoing Redemptions Despite the ongoing redemptions, the estate still holds a significant Solana position. Data from Solscan shows that roughly 4.18 million SOL, worth an estimated $977 million, remains staked as of Thursday. Solana’s market response was muted but positive.

The estate has so far returned $6.2 billion to former users, $1.2 billion in February and another $5 billion in May, as part of its restructuring efforts. The payments will be processed through FTX’s designated distribution partners, including BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer. As reported, a Chinese creditor representing over 300 users is opposing FTX’s proposal to restrict payouts in 49 jurisdictions, including China, arguing it is legally unfounded and unfair. Earlier this year, FTX began repaying creditors after securing court approval for its redistribution plan, and to date, has returned approximately $6.2 billion. FTX, once a dominant player in the crypto space, collapsed in November 2022 following a liquidity crisis triggered by revelations about its balance sheet. The fallout led to criminal charges against founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced in 2023 to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors of more than $11 billion. However, he is now projected to be released from federal prison on December 14, 2044 , after serving less than 21 years of his 25-year sentence for fraud tied to the FTX collapse for good behavior. He was also fined over $11 billion. Federal records confirm that Bankman-Fried has been moved from New York to a transfer facility in Oklahoma following nearly two years behind bars. 3AC Targets FTX Execs Over $1.5B Liquidation in New Subpoenas The liquidators of collapsed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) have subpoenaed former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried , ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and FTX executive Ryne Salame. The move follows allegations that over $1.5 billion in 3AC assets were liquidated unlawfully by FTX-linked entities. Bankman-Fried’s deposition is scheduled for October 14, 2025, at Terminal Island prison, where he is currently serving time. 3AC co-founder Zhu Su claims Bankman-Fried executed unauthorized liquidations that contributed to 3AC’s downfall. He also accuses Salame of using insider knowledge to front-run trades and pocket over $1 billion in profits before FTX’s collapse. Ellison is expected to be questioned regarding Alameda’s trading strategies that may have played a role in the alleged misconduct.

Despite this decline, venture capital raises were consistent with July’s levels, supported by the $600 million generated from PUMP’s public sale. DeFi projects especially attracted investments across infrastructure and trading platforms in August, bringing third-quarter totals to $4.57 billion, already edging past Q2’s $4.54 billion in just two months. Daan Crypto says lower valuations on new launches have led to stable price performance In a Thursday X post , market analyst Daan Crypto Trades argued that investor interest has pivoted from continuous new-chain launches to treasury firms developing on existing projects. He noted that capital is now concentrated in liquid markets, reducing the amount of raises for new chains and similar ventures. Still, he argued that this trend is healthy for the market. Source: DefiLlama He explained that lower valuations on new launches have contributed to more stable price action following listings. “I’d say this is a good change for the market and the projects themselves,” he wrote, adding that it leaves room for potential upside for all participants. According to DeFiLlama’s analysis, at the beginning of 2022, monthly raises reached $7 billion , although they’ve declined significantly to much lower levels, while 2025 has had some big spikes. Experts say it still lays the foundation for a healthier ecosystem for both builders and investors despite any pullback. Outside of DeFi, AI protocols also gained significant inflows in August. Everlyn raised more than $15 million and several other seed-stage rounds in AI. Cybersecurity was another highlight category, led by IVIX’s $60 million Series B, the month’s largest traditional VC round. Stablecoin infrastructure followed closely behind, with Rain’s $58 million raise. Additionally, payment infrastructure grabbed headlines after OrangeX raised a $20 million Series B and later rounds for cross-border and merchant payment solutions, some of which benefit from a higher penetration of crypto in commerce. Gaming projects were not excluded, with Overtake coming in with an investment of $7 million, and other protocols supported through ongoing development. South Korea is lifting the VC funding ban on crypto firms Crypto firms are expected to start receiving more financing, especially in South Korea. Following the State Council and cabinet’s approval, the Ministry of SMEs and Startups said it officially lifted the long-standing VC funding ban on September 16. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the amendment to the Enforcement Decree will revoke the designation of crypto exchanges and brokerages as “restricted venture businesses,” effectively opening them up to VC participation. The measure dates back to October 2018, when the Moon administration introduced it to rein in an overheated and speculative crypto environment. Much has changed since then. South Korea has taken strong steps to bring order to its crypto market, starting with the introduction in 2021 of a licensing system for virtual asset service providers. Following this, the passage of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in July 2025 added deposit protection, mandatory record-keeping, and bans on unfair trading, all key measures that helped professionalize the industry and address past concerns. Now the ministry stated the amendment mirrors the shifting global status of the cryptoasset sector. It pointed out that new legal frameworks will protect local crypto exchange users extensively and support growth in the digital asset ecosystem, particularly focusing on blockchain and cryptography-focused companies. According to the government, the reform will also make it possible for crypto companies with proven technological capabilities and potential to access VC investment. The ministry emphasized that this will give them equal opportunities alongside other IT innovators. Minister Han Seong-sook remarked, “We will foster a transparent and responsible ecosystem. We will help facilitate the flow of venture capital and the growth of new industries.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs had $246 million in inflows, while Ethereum (ETH) ETFs saw $788 million in outflows. This raises uncomfortable concerns for investors who want to know why crypto is down when institutional interest seems to be quite selective. This difference in flows shows that even the biggest tokens might not expand. That’s why retail investors and people with a clearer vision are looking for the next ETH-like ROI story in presale initiatives with disruptive utility. One project that has been getting a lot of interest is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is now in Phase 6 of its presale. The token costs $0.035, and more than $15.6 million has already been raised. There are also more than 16,200 holders. About 38% of the 170 million tokens set up for this stage have already been taken, which makes people who are late feel rushed. Phase 7 will raise the price by 15% to $0.040, which means that this is the last chance for investors to get MUTM at today’s lower price before the next step up. BTC ETF inflows hit $246M, ETH loses $788M Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs brought in $246 million in net inflows for the week ending September 5, 2025. This pushed BTC up to about $112,200, with a trading volume of $45 billion in 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) ETFs, on the other hand, lost $788 million, which caused the price to drop 3.3% to almost $4,300, with a volume of $37.07 billion. BTC’s inflows show that institutions are confident, while ETH’s outflows show that people are being careful because of macroeconomic factors like U.S. tariffs and concern about the Federal Reserve. Technical indications reveal that BTC is testing support around $112,000 and ETH is testing support at $4,220. The RSI for BTC is at 50, and the RSI for ETH is at 46. If resistances pass, analysts think BTC will be worth $116,713 and ETH will be worth $4,868. But if they fall below $112,000 and $4,220, they might drop to $108,000 and $3,950, respectively. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): early ROI parallels with Ethereum (ETH) People know a lot about the first investors in Ethereum (ETH). People who bought during the token auction saw huge gains that changed their fortunes for good. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting similar conversations today by combining strong DeFi mechanics with an appealing entry point. For example, an investor who traded $5,000 worth of SOL or AVAX for MUTM in Phase 1 has already made a lot of money on paper by Phase 6, when the price had risen to $0.035. With a listing price of $0.06, these benefits are likely to grow even more, which is exciting for people who know how powerful it is to get in on a project early. Investors can use Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to access a platform that is geared toward genuine financial use cases, unlike passive speculating in a crypto ETF. Users can put stablecoins or blue-chip tokens like ETH and BTC into certified smart contracts in their P2C lending pools. These deposits are turned into mtTokens, which earn interest automatically and can even be used as collateral again. For example, an investor who gives $15,000 in BUSD gets mtBUSD at a 1:1 ratio. With an average APY of 15%, the investor gets $2,250 in passive income per year while still being able to access the initial funds. Borrowers get the same benefits. If you have $1,000 worth of ETH and don’t want to sell it, you can lock it up as collateral and borrow up to 75% of its value. This approach lets you get liquidity without giving up the chance to make more money on your primary holdings. Smart contracts make lending and borrowing easier, which means that security and efficiency go hand in hand. Building stability in volatile markets It’s evident from the way things are right now that managing volatility is the most important thing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built-in protections that keep both depositors and borrowers safe, even when the market is moving quickly. Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios are carefully set. Stablecoins like ETH can go up to 75% with an 80% liquidation barrier, whereas more volatile tokens can only go up to 35–40% LTV with thresholds closer to 65%. These cautious steps keep collateralized holdings healthy and make liquidation operations profitable for liquidators without upsetting the system. When the market becomes less liquid, the protocol automatically raises the rewards for liquidators to step in, making sure that distressed holdings are closed down quickly. Reserve factors, which range from 10% for stable assets to 38% for risky ones, give investors extra protection against risks that could lead to more problems. The platform’s open approach to security also helps build trust. A CertiK audit of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gave it a 95 Token Scan Score and a 78 Skynet Score. The team has also started a $50,000 bug bounty program that pays ethical hackers up to $2,000 for important discoveries. This makes defenses stronger and gets more developers involved. A $100,000 giveaway has also been announced to reward people who believed early on. Ten winners will each get $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Investors will soon be able to observe how lending, borrowing, and managing liquidity work together in real life when the beta version comes out around the time of the listing. The plan also includes Layer-2 integration to lower transaction costs and a proprietary stablecoin, all of which are meant to make the platform more useful and popular. Importantly, top-tier exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and MEXC are getting ready to list these tokens. This will give them the kind of visibility and accessibility that has historically driven demand for tokens. Conclusion The $0.06 listing charge is just the start of what is to come. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has everything it needs to flourish like Ethereum (ETH) did in its early days, as more people use it and it gets more attention. As Bitcoin (BTC) settles around institutional flows and Ethereum (ETH) fights outflows, the hunt for big profits will only get more intense. Investors don’t only want to know why crypto is down anymore. They want to find the new generation of DeFi enterprises that mix new ideas with long-term viability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is exactly that chance. It links vision with action and pledges to follow the same path to return on investment (ROI) as the first people who believed in Ethereum (ETH).

The aggressive accumulation has boosted their total holdings to a record 3.65 million BTC and even continued as spot prices consolidated near $112,000. This was indicative of a growing divergence between short-term retail speculation and conviction-driven structural demand. Exchanges Bleed BTC as Sharks Hoard Two critical datasets validate this outlook, according to CryptoQuant’s observation: Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Change Exchange Netflow The LTH metric has flipped sharply positive, as seasoned investors are accumulating rather than distributing coins. Historically, such green spikes precede larger bull cycles as BTC migrates into “strong hands” less likely to sell into temporary volatility. Meanwhile, exchange flows continue to show pronounced outflows, with investors steadily withdrawing coins into cold storage instead of leaving them available for immediate trading. This confirms that the recent buying is not just speculative repositioning but actual supply removal from liquid markets. When shark accumulation converges with LTH absorption and exchange withdrawals, the setup becomes highly conducive to a supply squeeze. While the potential for short-term pullbacks remains, particularly if derivatives markets become overheated, the structural forces at play tilt the balance toward higher valuations once renewed demand emerges. Beneath the surface-level swings, Bitcoin’s market structure is quietly but decisively moving toward scarcity, which could mean that the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next strong leg higher is already being laid. CryptoPotato had previously reported that Bitcoin’s liquidity on Binance is showing signs of stress, as withdrawals have been accelerating even as deposits remain subdued. As the platform with the deepest order books, Binance’s liquidity patterns often reflect the broader market’s underlying tone. Earlier in August, inflows climbed sharply as traders positioned for distribution or hedging while BTC approached $120,000. That activity cooled in the latter half of the month, which brought inflows and outflows into temporary balance and stabilized price action. This changed in September as outflows surged above 22 million BTC while inflows stalled. This sharp divergence points to reduced willingness to sell and stronger preference for self-custody, which strengthens the case for upward market moves. The result is a tightening liquidity pool that could act as fuel once demand strengthens. Should these conditions continue, Binance’s shrinking reserves may prove the catalyst for Bitcoin’s next leg higher. Miners Join the Bulls Adding to this tightening supply story, Bitcoin miners are also rewriting the playbook this cycle as they have transformed from aggressive sellers to steady accumulators. Traditionally, the Miners’ Position Index (MPI) spikes before halvings and late in bull markets as miners dump reserves into retail-driven demand. Despite record-high mining difficulty and surging transaction fees, miners are holding tight. Catalysts such as US spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and sovereign adoption are fueling this accumulation-first strategy.

A significant announcement has recently emerged from OKX, one of the leading global crypto exchanges, impacting a specific segment of the market. This development, involving the OKX delisting LUNC USTC futures , is set to reshape trading strategies for many and highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset markets. What Exactly is Happening with OKX Delisting LUNC USTC Futures? OKX has officially declared its decision to delist the USTC/USDT and LUNC/USDT perpetual futures. This means that as of September 18, at 8:00 a.m. UTC, these specific trading pairs will no longer be available on their platform. For traders involved in these assets, this announcement requires immediate attention and decisive action to manage their portfolios effectively. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset directly. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading and leveraged positions. The decision by OKX to remove these specific contracts signals a significant shift in their offering for LUNC and USTC, impacting liquidity and accessibility for these derivatives. Why is OKX Making This Critical Decision? Exchange delistings are not uncommon in the fast-paced crypto market. They can stem from various factors, including consistently low trading volume, concerns over an asset’s long-term stability, or potential regulatory pressures that exchanges must navigate. While OKX has not provided an exhaustive list of reasons for this particular OKX delisting LUNC USTC futures , the history of LUNC (formerly Terra Luna) and USTC (formerly TerraUSD) provides crucial context. The dramatic collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022 led to unprecedented price volatility and a profound loss of confidence in these assets. Many exchanges subsequently reviewed their listings to ensure market health, protect users from highly speculative or unstable instruments, and maintain their platform’s integrity. This proactive measure by OKX could be interpreted as a strategic move to manage risk, align with evolving market conditions, and potentially safeguard its user base from instruments associated with high historical volatility. What Does This Mean for Traders Holding LUNC and USTC Futures? For traders with open positions in USTC/USDT and LUNC/USDT perpetual futures, the upcoming delisting carries critical implications. It’s not merely a suggestion; it’s a mandatory closure of these markets on the OKX platform. Here’s what you absolutely need to know and the steps you should consider: Forced Liquidation Risk: Any open positions for USTC/USDT and LUNC/USDT perpetual futures that are not manually closed by the specified deadline will be automatically liquidated by OKX. This automated process might not occur at the most favorable price for the trader, potentially leading to unexpected losses. Urgent Position Closure: Traders are strongly advised to close their positions manually well in advance of September 18, 8:00 a.m. UTC. Taking control of your exits allows for better risk management and helps avoid the uncertainties associated with a forced liquidation event. Review and Withdrawal: After the delisting, any remaining funds or collateral associated with these futures contracts will likely be converted to USDT or another stablecoin and made available for withdrawal. However, it is crucial to confirm specific details directly with OKX customer support or their official announcements. Ignoring this announcement could lead to significant financial repercussions and missed opportunities to manage your capital effectively. Therefore, it is essential to review your portfolio, understand your exposure, and take the necessary steps promptly to manage your involvement with the OKX delisting LUNC USTC futures . Navigating the Market After the OKX Delisting: What Are Your Options? The delisting of these futures contracts from OKX doesn’t necessarily mean the end of LUNC or USTC spot trading, nor does it preclude their availability on other exchanges. However, it does significantly reduce the avenues for leveraged trading on these specific assets within a major platform. Traders might need to explore other reputable exchanges that still offer these pairs, but always with heightened caution and thorough due diligence regarding their terms, liquidity, and security. This event also serves as a potent reminder about the inherent risks in cryptocurrency trading, especially with highly volatile or historically problematic assets. Diversification across different assets, strict risk management protocols (like setting stop-losses), and staying diligently updated on exchange announcements are paramount for long-term success. Consider this a valuable moment to reassess your overall trading strategy, your risk tolerance, and your exposure to high-risk derivatives. The crypto market is dynamic and requires continuous learning. Understanding these market shifts helps you make more informed decisions and adapt your strategies to maintain a resilient portfolio. Staying ahead of such announcements can protect your investments and prepare you for future market movements. In summary, the upcoming OKX delisting LUNC USTC futures on September 18 is a critical event for traders involved in these specific perpetual contracts. Proactive and timely management of open positions is absolutely essential to mitigate potential losses and ensure a smooth transition. While the crypto market constantly presents new opportunities, it also demands vigilance, informed decision-making, and adaptability. Stay alert, stay informed, and trade responsibly to navigate these changes successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will OKX delist USTC and LUNC perpetual futures? A: OKX will delist the USTC/USDT and LUNC/USDT perpetual futures on September 18, at 8:00 a.m. UTC. Q2: What should I do if I have open positions in these futures contracts? A: It is strongly advised to manually close all your open positions before the delisting deadline to avoid automatic liquidation by OKX. Q3: Will I lose my funds if I don’t close my positions before the deadline? A: Any open positions not closed manually will be automatically liquidated, which may result in losses or unfavorable outcomes depending on market conditions at the time of liquidation. Q4: Can I still trade LUNC and USTC after the OKX delisting? A: While OKX will delist these specific futures contracts, LUNC and USTC may still be available for spot trading or on other cryptocurrency exchanges. Always conduct thorough research before trading on new platforms. Q5: Why is OKX delisting these specific futures contracts? A: While OKX hasn’t provided detailed reasons, such delistings often occur due to factors like low trading volume, concerns over asset stability, or regulatory considerations, especially given the historical volatility of LUNC and USTC.

ETHA offers cheaper and more efficient exposure to Ethereum than competitors, but short-term flows and technicals suggest a bearish outlook through year-end. ETH's utility as a smart contract platform is notable, yet most network activity remains speculative and tied mostly to crypto trading (stablecoins, etc.) rather than real-world use cases. I am bearish on ETHA for the short term due to waning liquidity and momentum, but maintain a neutral long-term view as institutional adoption could shift the narrative. The cryptocurrency market has had a great year. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is up to about $115K, rising ~23% this year, doubling in value since last September. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has performed even better this year, gaining by about 32%, outperforming Bitcoin over recent months with a staggering 130% gain over the past six months. Retail investor interest in Ethereum is very high, particularly for the newer Ethereum ETF ( ETHA ), which launched last summer. As ETH soared, ETHA's outstanding units have risen by roughly 220% since early summer. This metric is measured by dividing its AUM (which is almost $16B) by its price: Data by YCharts To me, this chart highlights a clear trend. Retail investor demand for ETHA rose dramatically over the past three months, but has since halted. There's been a small reversal in outstanding units, though it is not extended enough to indicate falling demand. ETHA is the largest Ethereum ETF, with about three times the assets as Grayscale's Ethereum ETF ( ETHE ). ETHE is older, but ETHA is, in my view, clearly the better fund, given its expense ratio is 0.25%, while ETHE's is 2.5% . ETHE provides cheap exposure to Ethereum, avoiding the higher transaction fees and wallet complexities often seen in direct cryptocurrency exchanges. With Ethereum floating around an all-time high, matching its 2021 peak level (preceding a fall back toward $1K), I think it's an excellent time to cover ETHA and provide an outlook for Ethereum. In my opinion, there are two key questions we must answer. First, how might immediate changes in retail sentiment and technical trends influence its price over the coming months? Second, what utility value (wealth storage, transactions, privacy, etc.) does Ethereum provide that secures its long-term value over other cryptocurrencies? Retail Exuberance Is Fading As Liquidity Slows The launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs may have been a major catalyst behind this year's bull market, allowing a large increase in retail investor flows, particularly from older/retired individual investors looking to diversify into alternative assets (without opening a separate crypto brokerage account). Still, given that both ETH and BTC have slowed down, with fund flows into ETHA slipping, it may be a good time to be cautious. Historically, my view on Bitcoin is that it's a neat trading asset, benefiting from lower cross-market correlations, but its long-term utility is weak given the immense energy costs and time required to perform transactions on its ledger. Bitcoin may still have a first-mover advantage, but I think it's technologically archaic compared to Ethereum and others. Given Bitcoin's many ""currency pitfalls,"" it is more often seen as ""digital gold."" However, I've also pointed out its low correlation to real interest rates/inflation expectations (which gold usually has), limiting its ability to store wealth truly. To me, it is essentially a store of excess market liquidity, which has been high since the money-printing binge of 2020-2021. The US Monetary Base , the total amount of currency and Fed reserve balances (money made through quantitative easing), was $3.2T in 2019, rising to just over $6.4T by the peak of QE in 2021. That figure has plateaued around $5.6T, meaning no new net currency is flowing into the US financial system. Still, that cash is still working its way through the system, first going primarily into banks and then into individual investors' cash balance. We can measure bank excess liquidity through Fed reverse repurchase liabilities (excess commercial bank cash lent back to the Fed). That metric skyrocketed toward the end of QE by 2021 as banks still saw cash rise due to QE, but that new money was not demanded by borrowers who were then coming out of COVID-related economic strains (this was a major inflationary trigger). Individual investor cash allocations can be tracked through AAII surveys. AAII members are representative of the ~60+ $1M+ net worth cohort, so not necessarily the younger ""early"" crypto investors, but what I think is the growing crypto investing class (those buying ETFs like ETHA). When we're thinking about Ethereum or Bitcoin on a short-term (3-6 month) basis, I think our best data is changes in market liquidity. Who has cash, and where are they putting it? With inflation a potential recurrent issue (limiting bonds), stock valuations very high, and the economy somewhat stagnant, it makes sense that cryptocurrencies are a go-to place for extra cash. The inverse correlation between Ethereum (and Bitcoin) and AAII cash allocations is particularly strong: Data by YCharts The crashing (deflationary) COVID economy was offset by tremendous monetary base expansion in 2020, resulting in inflationary excess bank liquidity by 2021 into 2022 (reverse repo liabilities). AAII cash allocations rose initially in 2020 as investors rebalanced during the ""lockdown crash."" As that cash went back into financial assets, Ethereum's value skyrocketed, peaking around November 2021, just as cash allocations hit an extreme bottom. The subsequent end to QE and sharp rate hikes led to a broad market sell-off in risk assets, including stocks, long-term bonds, and cryptos, throughout 2022. Cash allocations rose back to historical highs (~25%). Ethereum crashed. The transition to quantitative tightening took some money out of the financial system, resulting in the plateau and 2023 decline in reverse repos. Cash then flowed back into financial assets, pushing ETH and Bitcoin back up in late 2023 to early last year. We saw this cycle repeat early this year during the spring correction. That began with low cash allocations around 14-15%, resulting in a sharp ETH sell-off that ended around April, aligning with the peak in cash allocations. Summer saw the steep rise in basically everything, particularly Ethereum, potentially benefiting from added demand via ETFs. Cash allocations are relatively low again. They're not at the To me, the ""liquidity data"" I track paints a bearish picture for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum and Bitcoin's short-term movements are driven by changes in excess liquidity, which has been drying up over recent months. At the same time, shares outstanding of ETHA have shifted from sharply rising to a recent small decline, indicating investor demand may be shifting back toward defense. Further, the longer-term ETH-BTC trend, which bounced over the summer, is potentially reversing and may be back in line with a long-term negative trend: Data by YCharts Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin during the 2020-2022 period, but has reversed all relative gains since then. Although the above chart is not conclusive, I find it notable that ETH-BTC peaked around that linear negative trend from late 2022 to the start of 2025. I see this as ETH being oversold to BTC by late spring, now possibly being overbought (relative to BTC). This adds to my bearish short-term bias on ETHA. Ethereum Has More Utility Than Bitcoin Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin, and to me, it is clearly superior in terms of functionality. That said, it is not necessarily ""functional,"" just more so than Bitcoin. Ethereum is based on ""smart contracts,"" written in the programming language ""Solidity."" These coded contracts create a non-changeable contract that companies or people can use to make financial deals outside of centralized finance. While this improves Bitcoin, and it beats it on many other fronts , Ethereum still suffers from slow transaction times (compared to Visa, etc.) and high costs. Ethereum benefits from the usage of ""smart contracts"" through a ""computational fee"" called ""gas."" From Investopedia , ""Gas fees compensate validators, who maintain and secure the blockchain, especially under the proof-of-stake model, which begvan in September 2022."" This fee is then ""burned,"" removing ETH from the market, creating theoretical deflationary benefits to its price. After that change was made, the supply of Ethereum slowed to a halt. However, the gas price is now extremely low due to growing adoption of the ""layer 2"" network (also seen in BTC). See below: Data by YCharts From what I understand, the decline in gas fees from layer 2 utilization is not bearish because this results in more large transactions that use more ""gas."" To that end, Ethereum is seen as the ""plumbing of crypto,"" particularly as crypto becomes a Wall Street asset with more regulatory support. Trump's policy changes have led to the rise of stablecoins this year, most of which are backed by Ethereum's contract system. The Bottom Line The fact is that there is so much hype and jargon around cryptocurrencies. The use-case argument for Ethereum is compelling, particularly as we see PayPal, JPMorgan ( JPM ), and others start to create an institutional financial network that is tied to Ethereum. Still, are institutional financial firms adopting ETH-based crypto products in order to gain exposure to the significant market liquidity wrapped up in the cryptocurrency market? Years ago, we saw a popular ""use case"" from non-fungible tokens, but that unsurprisingly ended in a huge bust. There is a thought that ""smart contracts"" can be used for legal contracts, such as property titles, energy credits ( carbon credits ), and intellectual property ownership, etc. Yet, that remains mostly theoretically, and the vast majority of Ethereum network usage is for crypto trading. In my opinion, Ethereum is mostly a partial solution to a partial issue. To a degree, I think Ethereum and Bitcoin exist for their own sakes, lacking clear functionality beyond the crypto finance industry. I may be wrong, and many would disagree with me, but I don't expect to change my view until there are true, real-world (not finance/crypto) uses for the Ethereum network. NFTs were supposed to be that, but they proved to be mostly speculative hype. The Ethereum technology is interesting, but its primary ""use case"" (as in, why most people buy it) is seemingly to speculate on its price. It may have functionality in multiple domains, but the main domain seems to be gambling on its price. Thus, its primary driver is not ETH-based economic activity, but changes in excess cash in the financial system, particularly among individual investors. From a long-term standpoint, I think it's worth watching Ethereum. I know it's premature for me to state that it lacks non-speculation/crypto functionality. On a short-term basis, I expect ETHA will decline over the coming months or weeks as the liquidity-driven speculative momentum behind it slows or reverses. I am bearish on ETHA, expecting it to decline through year-end. However, while I see limited real-world economic value in Ethereum, I recognize the trend we've seen this year (in ETH-based stablecoins) may prove me wrong, so my long-term outlook is relatively neutral.",ETH-USD|ETHA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BTC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-12 07:26:36

One alt tipped for 50x soon",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/12/what-crypto-to-buy-now-as-eth-targets-4500-one-alt-tipped-for-50x-soon/,"Ethereum (ETH) is slowly making its way back up to $4,500, which has everyone in the crypto community excited. Traders and analysts think that ETH might even reach $6,000 in the next few months. However, Ethereum (ETH) is still a reliable blue-chip asset, and people who want to make money in a way that isn’t too risky are looking at new DeFi initiatives. One of these is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a presale altcoin that offers growth multiples that regular ETH investing can’t match. People who bought Ethereum (ETH) early on made a lot of money over the years, but buying it now for $4,500 doesn’t have as much potential for growth as tokens that are still in presale. This is exactly the kind of chance that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is ready for. At the moment, the presale price is only $0.035, so investors who get in now might make 50X their money before ETH even hits $6,000. Why MUTM could outpace ETH’s growth The basic ideas underlying Mutuum Finance (MUTM) make it a great choice for crypto investors who want to be smart but still take risks. The platform’s Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) makes it safer for users to borrow money, especially when they utilize stablecoins or other correlated assets. This leads to more efficient capital deployment and more loan activity. The utilization-based interest rate mechanism keeps liquidity flowing into the system all the time, which means that MUTM will still work even if the crypto market crashes. Layer-2 integration will make transactions much cheaper, which will speed up adoption and make it easier for more people to use Ethereum (ETH) than Layer-1 transactions. Investors who know how these things work see that MUTM’s design makes it possible to make money in many ways. Liquidation fines go straight to the treasury, where they build up protocol reserves that will later be used to pay for staking rewards and governance projects. Oracles protect pricing data, which lowers the danger of manipulation and makes the platform more appealing to both individual traders and businesses. These elements work together to make an ecosystem that can be adopted quickly, which means that the return on investment (ROI) will be far higher than with Ethereum (ETH), which moves more slowly. Presale traction shows that more and more people are interested in the market. More than 16,200 people have already invested $15.6 million in Phase 6 of MUTM. The project has passed a CertiK audit and gotten a Token Scan score of 95, which makes investors feel safer and more confident. Phase 6 is 38% sold out, and Phase 7 will raise the price of tokens by 15%. This makes it more important for new customers to buy at the current reduced pricing. This presale period is a rare chance to get MUTM before it becomes popular and prices go up after it is listed on exchanges. Catalysts for a 50x run Several things that are going to happen soon are predicted to push MUTM’s price much over its presale price of $0.035. The beta launch will let people lend and borrow on Layer-2, showing that it has genuine value from the start. The addition of stablecoins will make the ecosystem even better. When borrowers mint and burn stablecoins against collateral, it will create stickiness and drive organic demand for MUTM tokens. The protocol’s buyback-driven staking rewards make the supply even tighter, which adds another level of support for the price. The planned Tier-1 exchange listings are similar to the visibility techniques that helped Ethereum (ETH) become well-known in its early years. These elements work together to create short-term catalysts and long-term sustainability, making MUTM an unusual cryptocurrency that can give big profits before ETH reaches $6,000. The numbers are very convincing for anybody who buys early. If you invest $3,500 at $0.035, you will obtain 100,000 MUTM tokens. If the price goes up to $175,000 at a 50x objective, this is a better return than buying Ethereum (ETH) at $4,500 and waiting for it to reach $6,000. MUTM is a better asymmetric play in today’s market for traders who want exponential growth instead of little gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another DeFi token. It was designed for wide use, strong security, and long-term growth. ETH is still a good long-term store of value, but MUTM is a rare chance to make a lot of money quickly by using a mix of utility, presale pricing, and future events. Getting in early today puts investors in a good position to take advantage of the next big DeFi breakout before the rest of the market does.

Arbitrum historic price sentiment Arbitrum price history by CoinGecko The Arbitrum airdrop snapshot occurred on Feb 6, 2023, and eligible participants started claiming on Mar 23, 2023. The claiming period ended on Sep 24, 2023. The airdrop granted 11.5% of the total supply to eligible users, 1.1% to DAOs operating in the Arbitrum ecosystem, and 44% to employees and Offchain Labs investors. The 44% is subject to lock-up periods and a vesting schedule. The rest was sent to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. On Sep 11, 2023, it fell to its all-time low at $0.7453. Bitcoin halving and crypto ETF hype helped the coin recover from October. By the end of the year, it had risen to $1.4. The run continued into 2024. On Jan 12, it reached its all-time high at $2.40. Per CoinMarketCap data, ARB broke below its listing price in June 2024. On August 5, 2024, it registered a new all-time low of $0.4317 It then recovered in September, reaching a high of $0.67. The bullish run continued into November, reaching as high as $1.12 in December. The coin crossed into 2025, trading at $0.72 when it assumed a bear run, falling to as low as $0.40 in February. On Apr 3, Arbitrum fell to a new all-time low at $0.2951 on Apr 3, 2025.

Leading this revolution is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new decentralized finance platform causing ripples with its new thinking on lending and liquidity in a tightening macroeconomic world. Mutuum Finance presale is currently in Stage 6 with tokens being sold at $0.035. MUTM has surpassed $15.6M in funds raised and investors for the project already number over 16,220. Mutuum Finance can yield up to 300% upon release. Solana Jumps Close to $219 as Institutional Demand Picks Up Pace Solana (SOL) is currently at the $218.70 mark, flat above the $200 level with fresh market optimism. Among the drivers for this rally is the construction of a massive $1.65 billion Solana treasury by Forward Industries backed by heavyweights like Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, indicating solid institutional confidence. Concurrently, technicals, from a “V-shaped” patterned recovery to historical open interest levels, are indicating continuation to $300 in case resistance near $220 is breached. New DeFi narratives, such as those of Mutuum Finance, are also in expansion, along with this greater momentum. Mutuum Finance: Risk Mitigations and Protocol Safety Mutuum Finance employs robust risk parameters for all underlying assets. They include overcollateralization protocols, borrowing limits and deposit limits, and target collateral levels. Closure of undercollateralized positions, which provides stability, is rewarded to liquidators. Greater collateral efficiency for correlated assets means the power to borrow rises with LTV ratios topping collateralized borrowing. Liquidation trigger and penalties are there to protect the protocol and induce timely action. Reserve factors act as a tail market event buffer and default with greater reserves pledged to riskier assets. Stage 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Token Presale Mutuum Finance has already been stacked by 16,200 investors and has sold over $15.54 million worth of tokens. In a bid to enhance the security of the platform and promote community engagement, the project has introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, whereby bug hunting is rewarded in four categories depending on severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Adaptive Interest Rate Mechanism Mutuum Finance is a variable rate system. In times of high liquidity, borrowing is cheap; in times of low liquidity, borrowing is expensive to avoid too much borrowing. To re-balance its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can either encourage borrowers to repay loaned funds or encourage fresh deposits. Increased Security Due to Strict Lending Policies All Mutuum Finance assets are strictly controlled. Examples include borrowing limits, supply limits, and collateral limits. Market price fluctuations make the protocol immune due to overcollateralization, and incentivized liquidators limit undercollateralized loans. Limits on lending and borrowing minimize insolvency risk by capping illiquid or risky asset exposure. High collateral efficiency is granted to correlated assets, and riskier tokens have reduced collateral availability. Market Volatility and Asset Liquidity A sufficient on-chain liquidity must exist so that the stressed positions are liquidated with negligible slippage. Exposure is governed by Liquidation levels and parameters, where higher incentive to the liquidators when lower liquidity. Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation levels are determined by asset volatility: less volatile assets can collateralize higher LTVs and higher liquidation levels, and volatile assets more conservative ones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to watch as the market gains momentum again. Stage 6 tokens are at $0.035 and over $15.6M has been raised so far with 16,220+ investors already in.

Then you need to pay close attention to an important announcement. Binance has declared a crucial temporary Zilliqa ZIL suspension for all deposits and withdrawals. This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a necessary step to support an upcoming network upgrade and hard fork for the Zilliqa blockchain. Staying informed about such developments is key in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. What’s Behind the Zilliqa ZIL Suspension? The decision by Binance to implement a Zilliqa ZIL suspension is directly linked to an essential network upgrade and hard fork for the Zilliqa blockchain. Think of a network upgrade as a significant software update for a computer system. It brings improvements, enhances security, or introduces new features. A ‘hard fork’ means that the old rules of the blockchain are no longer compatible with the new ones, requiring everyone to switch to the updated version. These upgrades are vital for the long-term health and evolution of any blockchain project. They ensure the network remains robust, efficient, and capable of handling future demands. Binance’s role here is to facilitate a smooth transition for its users, preventing any potential issues during the upgrade process. When Will the Zilliqa ZIL Suspension Take Effect? Mark your calendars! The temporary halt for ZIL deposits and withdrawals is scheduled to commence promptly at 5:00 p.m. UTC on September 24 . It’s crucial for users to be aware of this exact timing. Any transactions initiated after this cutoff might not be processed until the suspension is lifted. While the duration of the suspension isn’t explicitly stated in the initial announcement, such halts typically last until the network upgrade is successfully completed and the platform has verified the stability of the new chain. Binance will provide further updates regarding the resumption of services, so keeping an eye on their official announcements is highly recommended. Why Are Temporary ZIL Deposits and Withdrawals Halts Necessary? You might wonder why exchanges need to stop services for an upgrade. It’s primarily about safeguarding your assets and ensuring the integrity of the blockchain. During a hard fork, there’s a risk of transaction discrepancies or even lost funds if exchanges continue processing transactions on a chain that’s about to be superseded or significantly altered. Halting ZIL deposits and withdrawals ensures: Asset Safety: Your ZIL tokens remain secure on the exchange during the transition. Data Integrity: Prevents issues like ‘replay attacks’ or ‘split-brain’ scenarios where transactions could be duplicated or lost across old and new chains. Smooth Transition: Allows Binance to thoroughly test and verify the new Zilliqa network’s stability before re-enabling services. User Experience: Minimizes potential confusion or errors for users interacting with the network during a critical change. This proactive measure reflects Binance’s commitment to providing a secure and reliable trading environment for all its users. What Should Zilliqa (ZIL) Holders Do Now? If you hold Zilliqa (ZIL) or plan to transact with it, there are a few actionable steps you can take. First and foremost, if you need to deposit or withdraw ZIL on Binance, ensure you complete these transactions well before the September 24, 5:00 p.m. UTC deadline. Secondly, there’s no need to move your ZIL tokens from Binance if you intend to keep them on the platform; your assets are safe and will be automatically converted or recognized on the upgraded network. Stay updated by regularly checking Binance’s official announcements page and their social media channels. They will communicate when services are expected to resume. Patience during such technical upgrades is always a virtue, as it ensures a more stable and secure future for the Zilliqa network. In conclusion, the temporary Zilliqa ZIL suspension by Binance is a standard, albeit crucial, procedure designed to support the blockchain’s evolution. This move underscores the continuous efforts within the crypto space to enhance technology, improve security, and deliver a better user experience. While a brief pause in service might be inconvenient, the long-term benefits of a more robust and efficient Zilliqa network are significant for all stakeholders. This commitment to ongoing development is what drives innovation in the cryptocurrency world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Binance suspending ZIL deposits and withdrawals?

Ripple and Cardano are set for strong gains, according to experts, with bold targets in sight. Meanwhile, all eyes are on XYZVerse as some predict explosive growth that could far outpace major coins. These fresh predictions hint at big moves ahead and keep the community guessing. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits XRP: The Digital Ripple Racing Through Global Payments XRP was built for movement. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it runs on the XRP Ledger, a public network with no boss. Payments settle in seconds, cost a small fraction of a cent, and cannot be undone or faked. No bank account is needed; a phone and internet are enough. Of the first 100 billion units, 80 billion were given to Ripple, the company that helps grow the system. Most of that sits in escrow, released bit by bit to keep supply steady. Today traders watch XRP as the market warms after a long cool spell. Bitcoin has reclaimed headlines, and many smaller coins follow its lead. Unlike Bitcoin, which can feel slow and pricey, XRP keeps fees tiny and speed high. Ethereum offers smart apps, but its congestion often spikes costs; the XRP Ledger stays light. If demand for quick cross-border deals grows, XRP could shine. The locked supply adds a layer of predictability that some investors value. Still, competition from new payment tokens is fierce, so future price moves may depend on fresh partnerships and wider use. ADA’s Green Engine: Why Cardano Could Shine This Crypto Season Cardano is a flexible and green network built for smart deals. It runs on a light system where coin holders help keep it safe, using far less power than older, energy-hungry mining chains. The network has two layers: one moves coins, the other runs apps like games, tokens, and finance tools. This split helps it aim for speeds that could reach a million moves each second. The coin that fuels it is ADA. People can pay, save, or even lock up ADA to support the chain and earn extra coins. Many traders call Cardano a quiet giant. Ethereum still rules in smart apps, but its fees can bite. ADA sends value for pennies and shows lower carbon use, two hot themes in today’s market. Big funds now look for green stories, and Cardano fits that trend. If the wider crypto scene keeps rising, coins with clear use and strong tech often jump first. ADA also lets holders lock coins and gain rewards that beat bank rates, so fewer sell. No asset is a sure bet, yet the mix of speed, eco appeal, and fresh upgrades makes ADA look bright in the current cycle. Conclusion XRP and ADA look strong for the 2025 surge, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, targets 20,000% growth through a community-led ecosystem blending meme culture and global sports passion.

Atgūšanās sekoja pēc pieprasījuma pieauguma no ASV spot ETF un makroekonomisko prognožu uzlabošanās, palīdzot BTC atgūt pagājušās nedēļas kritumu. Šis solis arī atjaunoja interesi par Bitcoin centrēto infrastruktūru. Bitcoin Hyper — Bitcoin Layer-2, kas darbojas uz Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) gandrīz tūlītējām, zemas komisijas maksas transakcijām — turpina piesaistīt pirmspārdošanas kapitālu, jo tirgotāji meklē iespējas, kas dod peļņu, kad ķēdes aktivitāte pieaug kopā ar cenu. Kāpēc BTC cena šonedēļ ir pieaugusi ETF plūsmas kļuva izteikti pozitīvas. Spot Bitcoin ETF reģistrēja spēcīgāko dienas neto ieplūdi kopš jūlija — aptuveni 757 miljonus dolāru 10. septembrī — ko vadīja Fidelity FBTC un BlackRock IBIT. Pat konservatīvāks izsekošanas rīks parāda > 740 miljonus dolāru šajā dienā, uzsverot skaidru pieprasījuma impulsu, kas samazina spot piedāvājumu. Cenas kustība atgriezās pie 114 000 dolāriem, kad šīs plūsmas sasniedza augstāko punktu. Spot Bitcoin ETFs just logged 3 straight days of inflows, $1.15B total. Wednesday alone saw $752M, the biggest since mid-July. Institutional demand is clearly coming back, giving $BTC more fuel for upside moves. pic.twitter.com/MEQswexDbF — Tom Tucker (@WhatzTheTicker) September 11, 2025 Makroekonomika veicināja riska noskaņojumu. ASV patēriņa cenu indekss augustā pieauga vairāk nekā gaidīts, bet tirgi joprojām sagaida, ka Federālā rezervju sistēma nākamnedēļ samazinās procentu likmes, un daži pat apspriež lielāku samazinājumu, jo bezdarbnieku pabalstu pieprasījumu skaits pieaudzis līdz 263 000 — augstākais rādītājs kopš 2021. gada. Atgriezās princips “sliktas ziņas ir labas ziņas”: mērenāki darba tirgus signāli, neskatoties uz stabilo inflāciju, uzturēja cerības un atbalstīja BTC. Kriptovalūtas kopumā bija noskaņotas uz risku. Globālā kriptovalūtu tirgus kapitalizācija 24 stundu laikā pieauga par ~1–2%, pievienojot nelielu atbalstu, jo populārākās kriptovalūtas un atsevišķas alternatīvās valūtas kopā ar BTC uzrādīja pieaugumu. Konteksts ir svarīgs: kad tirgus ir stabils, ETF ieplūdes skaidrāk atspoguļojas cenā. Galvenie līmeņi, struktūra un tuvākā laika riski Tehniski, buļļi vēlas pārvērst 114 000–115 000 ASV dolārus par atbalstu un pēc tam izmēģināt zemāko 120 000 ASV dolāru līmeni; ja tas neizdosies, pastāv risks, ka Bitcoin cena samazināsies līdz 111 000 ASV dolāru līmenim.Viena makroekonomiska piezīme: ja darba tirgus vājums padziļinās, bet inflācija paliek stabila, optimisms par procentu likmju samazināšanu var pārvērsties par bažām par izaugsmi, kas parasti ir nestabilāka riska aktīviem. Tas padara nākamās nedēļas Federālās rezervju sistēmas lēmumu un formulējumu īpaši svarīgu tuvākā laika virziena noteikšanai. Viena makroekonomiska piezīme: ja darba tirgus vājums padziļinās, bet inflācija paliek stabila, optimisms par procentu likmju samazināšanu var pārvērsties par bažām par izaugsmi, kas parasti ir nestabilāka riska aktīviem. Tas padara nākamās nedēļas Federālās rezervju sistēmas lēmumu un formulējumu īpaši svarīgu tuvākā laika virziena noteikšanai. Ja ETF neto ieplūdes paliks pozitīvas arī nākamajā nedēļā, mazākās pretestības ceļš būs augšupejošs, jo likviditāte spot tirgos samazināsies un ieguvēju pārdošanas spiediens paliks vājš. Dienas noslēgums virs 115 000 ASV dolāriem stiprinātu optimistisko scenāriju, savukārt atgūstot 118 000 ASV dolāru līmeni, sāktos mērens kāpums līdz 120 000 ASV dolāru līmenim. Bitcoin Hyper — BTC ātrums, zemas komisijas maksas un iepriekšpārdošanas dinamika Ar BTC atgriežoties virs 114 000 USD, uzmanības centrā ir mērogošanas tendences. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) ir Bitcoin Layer-2, kas izstrādāts uz Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) bāzes, un tā mērķis ir nodrošināt gandrīz tūlītējus darījumus un zemas komisijas maksas, vienlaikus nostiprinot norēķinus ar Bitcoin caur kanonisko tiltu. Īsumā: Bitcoin monetārā bāze, Solana stila caurlaidspēja. Augstā līmenī Bitcoin Hyper bloķē vietējo BTC bāzes ķēdē un izveido 1:1 pieprasījumu Layer-2, lai lietotāji varētu maksāt, apmainīties un mijiedarboties ar lietotnēm ātrāk par sekundi; kad viņi ir pabeiguši, viņi atgriežas L1 BTC. $HYPER žetons atbalsta tīklu, sedzot komisijas maksas, motivējot validatorus un pārvaldot atjauninājumus, savukārt SVM darbības laiks nodrošina paralēlu izpildi, ļoti zemas komisijas maksas un nobriedušus rīkus no Solana ekosistēmas. Dizains ir paredzēts reālai lietošanai (mikromaksājumi, BTC nodrošināts DeFi n ķēdes spēles), kas L1 būtu neekonomiski. Ja ETF virzītas plūsmas uztur BTC aktīvu, projekti, kas padara Bitcoin ātrāku un lētāku, būtu pirmie, kas gūtu labumu.

Despite $120M in large wallet sales, XRP holds firm above $3, showing steady demand. RSI signals rising strength as the price holds key levels; the next breakout zone sits near $3.65. Weekly Structure Breaks XRP has moved through a key weekly resistance level, breaking above a long-standing descending trendline, according to Dark Defender. This structure had capped the price advances for months. The breakout marks the completion of a corrective phase that began earlier this year, mapped out by a five-leg A-B-C-D-E pattern on the chart. #XRP is breaking the initial weekly resistance! pic.twitter.com/HxG1vx3nOq — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) September 11, 2025 Meanwhile, the move sets the stage for a potential upward trend . Based on Elliott Wave analysis, the first wave appears to be completed, and the second has pulled back into a common retracement zone between $2.65 and $2.86. These levels match the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracements, often used to identify reversal zones before a third wave move. XRP was priced at $3.07 at press time, up 2% over the last 24 hours and 9% over the past week. Trading volume stands near $6 billion. Notably, the RSI has formed a bullish divergence, where the price made a lower low while the RSI moved higher. This type of setup often suggests that momentum is shifting. With that, attention is turning to the next key resistance around $3.65, followed by projected targets at $4.39 and $5.85, based on standard Fibonacci extensions. Daily and Intraday Outlook Daily technical analysis suggests that XRP has closed above $3.0452, a short-term resistance level. Crypto analyst Dark Defender believes a breakout from this point may provide momentum toward the $3.65 mark. This level is also being monitored by other traders as a near-term target. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined two possible paths: “Break $3.05 and surge $3.6,” or “Retrace to $2.8, break $2.9, and surge to $3.6.” Both scenarios point toward $3.60 as a key target if the market holds current strength or finds support on any short-term dip. Traders remain cautious but are positioning around these levels, with a focus on clear breakouts for new entries. The broader market, especially Bitcoin, is expected to guide short-term sentiment. Whale Activity and Market Reaction Whale wallets reportedly offloaded over $120 million worth of XRP in a 24-hour period. While this kind of activity can trigger fear among smaller holders, the price has remained stable. XRP held the $3 level and climbed toward $3.10 shortly after. Consequently, the move shows buyers are still active despite the sell-off. The market did not see the kind of reaction that often follows large wallet exits. This behavior suggests strength and steady demand at current levels.

This ease of access makes it stand out in the growing crypto presale list. Key details include a presale price of $0.006389, with over 9 million tokens already sold and more than 71,000 USDT raised. Buyers using the code GGS-30 receive 30% more presale tokens. $GGs offers multiple utilities that extend beyond simple speculation. Players can stake, participate in community-driven events, and even trade using the upcoming $GGs bot. The project illustrates how token presales can link cultural identity with practical use in Web3. USDT Raised: 71,049.52 $GGs Sold: 9,031,378.9 Price: 1 $GGs = $0.006389 These figures highlight why many see Based Eggman as a contender for the best crypto presale to buy right now. PEPE: Market Sentiment Around the Frog Icon PEPE has established itself as one of the most recognizable meme coins, often acting as a barometer for memecoin enthusiasm. This week, PEPE reclaimed the $0.00001000 psychological level with a modest 2% rise. Technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook. Resistance looms at the 50-day EMA of $0.00001062, while the 100-day and 200-day EMAs remain in decline. The RSI, however, crossed above 53, hinting at a shift in buying momentum. Similarly, the MACD’s crossover on Sunday extends the uptrend, adding weight to the view of increased trading interest. Although not part of the current presale crypto projects, PEPE remains an important reference point. Its market moves show how meme-driven assets continue to influence sentiment, even as new token presales like $GGs enter the spotlight. Conclusion: Where Memes and Presales Converge The landscape of token presales and meme culture shows how fast Web3 can adapt to community-driven ideas. Based Eggman ($GGs) positions itself within the growing demand for presale crypto tokens, offering an ecosystem that connects play, social interaction, and trading. PEPE, while not part of new crypto presales, reminds the market of the cultural power that memes continue to hold. Together, they illustrate two different but connected stories: one focused on presale crypto projects looking to establish ecosystems, and another grounded in established community momentum. For anyone exploring the crypto presale 2025 environment, these examples provide insight into how presale tokens and meme coins shape the future of participation. The lesson is clear: memes and presales are no longer separate worlds but interwoven narratives that define how communities interact with crypto today.

Key Takeaways: CleanCore has acquired over 500 million DOGE, halfway to its 1 billion-token goal. The company aims to position Dogecoin as a strategic reserve asset and payment rail. ZONE stock rebounded after a $175M raise, while DOGE gained 23% this week. The company disclosed on Thursday that it had purchased $130 million worth of DOGE, following a 285.42 million token buy earlier in the week. CleanCore Aims to Cement DOGE as a Reserve Asset The rapid accumulation reflects a deliberate strategy to position DOGE as a strategic reserve asset. “Crossing the 500 million DOGE threshold demonstrates the speed and scale at which ZONE is executing its treasury strategy,” said Marco Margiotta, CleanCore’s chief investment officer and also CEO of House of Doge, a commercial partner of the Dogecoin Foundation. CleanCore was the first publicly listed firm to announce a formal Dogecoin treasury strategy, working in partnership with both the Dogecoin Foundation and House of Doge. The company is aiming to complete its 1 billion DOGE target within 30 days. Margiotta said the broader goal is to promote DOGE’s use across payments, tokenization, and global remittance products. Earlier this month, CleanCore raised $175 million via private placement to fund its DOGE purchases. The news initially triggered a 60% plunge in ZONE stock, though the company completed the raise by September 5. As of Thursday’s close, ZONE shares traded at $3.98, before jumping 11.81% in after-hours trading to $4.45. The stock is still up over 200% year-to-date. DOGE itself has gained nearly 23% over the past week, according to CoinGecko, adding fuel to CleanCore’s aggressive treasury expansion. Meanwhile, the launch of the Rex-Osprey Doge ETF (DOJE), originally scheduled for Thursday, has been postponed. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the fund will now likely go live next week, though an exact date remains unconfirmed. Update Part 3: Another delay. Launching next week. Mid week. Prob Thur. https://t.co/Lzk2pCVo0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 11, 2025 Strategy Tops Corporate Bitcoin Holdings with 636,505 BTC Michael Saylor’s Strategy now holds 636,505 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin by a wide margin. Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings remains in second with 52,477 BTC, after adding 705 BTC in August. But new entrants are gaining ground. XXI, founded by Strike CEO Jack Mallers, has amassed 43,514 BTC , while the Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company holds 30,021 BTC. Other major players include crypto exchange Bullish (24,000 BTC), Metaplanet (20,000 BTC) , and publicly listed names like Riot Platforms, Trump Media & Technology Group, CleanSpark, and Coinbase. This wave of accumulation has fueled speculation around a supply shock. With just 5.2% of Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply left to be mined, continued corporate demand could drive prices even higher. Some firms are aiming much higher. Japan’s Metaplanet and U.S.-based Semler Scientific have set targets of 210,000 BTC and 105,000 BTC by 2027, ten to twenty times their current holdings. Outside the US, 120 public companies now hold Bitcoin. Canada, the UK, Hong Kong, Mexico, South Africa, and Bahrain are among the countries where corporate BTC ownership is growing.

51590545,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82877,1757663103,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Market Strategist Has Major XRP News for Holders,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-has-major-xrp-news-for-holders/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto shared a detailed update on XRP’s short-term outlook in a recent video posted with the message “XRP HOLDERS I GOT MAJOR XRP NEWS”. According to Steph, XRP has broken out of a falling wedge pattern and has now closed three consecutive daily candles above the trend line, which he views as a bullish signal. He outlined near-term price targets at $3.60, $4.00, and $4.64, while also suggesting the possibility of further gains if momentum continues. On a three-day line chart, Steph pointed out that the stochastic RSI is moving upward from oversold conditions. He noted that in the past few months, each time this indicator moved out of oversold territory, XRP experienced significant rallies. In addition, He observed that the Bollinger Bands are currently in a tight squeeze. Historically, such squeezes have preceded major moves, which He interprets as another bullish indicator for the near term. #XRP HOLDERS I GOT MAJOR XRP NEWS!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/g0DviZkMZH — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 10, 2025 CPI release and possible market impact Steph also discussed the upcoming consumer price index release, explaining its relevance for XRP price action. He recalled that previous CPI announcements led to notable declines in June, July, and August, with drops of around 18%, 10%, and nearly 20% respectively. Despite this pattern, He suggested that the probability now favors a rally rather than another decline. Her reasoning is based on two factors. First, XRP has already been trading in a corrective structure for over 50 days. Second, inflation appears to be under control, which raises the chance that the CPI report could come in better than expected. He explained that if this happens, XRP could see a positive reaction instead of repeating the sharp declines associated with earlier CPI releases. Exchange reserve inflows raise caution One of the most notable parts of Steph’s update focused on on-chain data from major exchanges. On September 1, exchange reserves for XRP rose sharply in a synchronized move across multiple platforms. He highlighted Binance in particular, where reserves jumped by over 610 million XRP, moving from 2.9 billion to 3.5 billion in a short period. Steph described this increase as highly unusual, both for its speed and its scale, calling it one of the largest coordinated XRP inflows He has ever seen. He explained that typically, reserves build gradually rather than in sudden spikes. While large inflows are often interpreted as bearish since they may indicate preparation for selling, He acknowledged that they could also represent strategic positioning by exchanges or market makers. Even so, he said that the size of this inflow is difficult to ignore and could point to short-term sell pressure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cycle positioning and potential risks Looking beyond short-term moves, Steph also placed XRP within the broader market cycle. He said the market appears closer to the end of the current bull run rather than the beginning, though He still expects further price gains in the coming months. He cautioned that a bearish divergence is forming, where the RSI is making lower highs while price continues to climb. According to her, this reflects momentum loss similar to what occurred in the 2020–2021 cycle, which eventually led to a broader correction. He also referred to the altcoin season index, currently at 71 and approaching 75. Based on historical data, He explained that sharp pullbacks across altcoins have often followed readings above 75. Because of this, He advised that while XRP may rally toward the $4 to $5 range, traders should closely monitor market conditions once those levels are reached. While XRP’s upside targets remain in focus, Steph noted that conditions suggest traders should remain cautious as XRP approaches higher levels in the current cycle.

However, the regular weekly event does not currently point at higher volatility. The weekly Deribit options expiry points to a less eventful weekend. Usually, the Friday expiry brings at least somewhat increased volatility, potentially sparking weekend rallies. This time around, the weekly options expiry signals a slightly bearish attitude. A total of $3.4B in open interest was set to expire on Friday, with a predominance of put options. The put/call ratio for BTC expanded to 1.3, signaling a more marked bearish attitude compared to previous weeks. Despite the imminent Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, implied volatility in the options market remains relatively stable, even showing a slight decline.

The market is already taking into account the potential for a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed, not signaling any expectations for unexpected rallies. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, a Fed price cut was most probably priced into the crypto market. During the weekly options expiry, put calls dominated, signaling emerging bearish expectations for September. | Source: CoinGlass. The other weekly events until the end of September have lower notional value. At the end of the month, around $17.7B in options are set to expire, with a predominance of call options. BTC still strong despite altcoin season The crypto fear and greed index took a few steps back, but is still in ‘greed’ territory. BTC dominance slid to 55.9% as altcoins took over with outsized pumps. Despite this, BTC still shows signs of recovery, alongside ETH. Ahead of the options expiry, BTC traded at $115,400, while ETH rallied to $4,549.37. Altcoins have more dramatic rallies, but all hinge on the solid performance of BTC and ETH. BTC open interest on all crypto exchanges is above $41B ahead of the weekend, with ETH open interest recovering above $29B. On Hyperliquid, BTC open interest has inched up again to $3.9B, while ETH reached $2.9B. BTC next step: $120K or back to $110K? Based on derivative trading, BTC is locked in a range where the most probable price moves may be limited between $111,000 and $116,000. Open interest has accrued for short positions all the way up to $120,000, but the bulk of positions is at a lower range, so a short squeeze to $120,000 is less probable. On the downside, BTC may dip to $111,000, attacking over $75B in long positions. In the past 24 hours, BTC already saw over $82M in short liquidations. The surprise ETH rally led to $92M in liquidations for the past day, as the crypto market still shows exuberance. After a month of price records, crypto assets are setting up for one of the historically slow months. This time around, the market suffers smaller drawdowns, but whales regularly take profits to roll over into better positions. For now, the BTC bull market is seen as intact, with positive macro conditions. In the short term, the market can fluctuate and cause liquidations. At the same time, volatility has fallen near an all-time low of 1.12%, with fewer events to cause cascading capitulation. Demand for spot BTC is also at an all-time peak, with more coins locked away from the market into corporate treasuries. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A recent and significant development comes from Upbit, a leading South Korean crypto exchange, which has issued an important notice regarding POKT deposits and withdrawals . This temporary suspension is set to impact users of Pocket Network tokens, and understanding the details is key for managing your digital assets effectively. What’s Happening with POKT Deposits and Withdrawals on Upbit? Upbit officially announced a temporary halt to all deposit and withdrawal services for Pocket Network (POKT) tokens. This suspension began promptly at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 16. The primary reason, as stated by the exchange, is an upcoming network upgrade for Pocket Network. Suspending services for a specific token is a precautionary measure. It ensures the safety and integrity of user funds during significant network changes. This temporary pause affects all users who hold POKT on the Upbit platform or wish to transact with it. Start Date: September 16, 9:00 a.m. UTC Affected Service: POKT deposits and withdrawals Reason: Pocket Network’s upcoming network upgrade Why the Pause? Understanding Pocket Network’s Upgrade Pocket Network (POKT) is a decentralized infrastructure protocol. It provides Web3 applications with cost-efficient access to blockchain data. Network upgrades are vital, often introducing new features, improving scalability, or enhancing security. Processing POKT deposits and withdrawals during such a critical period could lead to issues like lost transactions or incorrect balances. Suspending services helps prevent these problems. It allows the exchange to monitor the upgrade, ensure system compatibility, and verify stability before resuming operations. What Does This Mean for Your POKT Holdings?

Traders are already speculating about which tokens may deliver the most significant returns, and it is not just the usual suspects in the spotlight. While names like Cardano and Dogecoin continue to draw interest, newer projects like Little Pepe are turning heads with their performance and growing community. With its presale now in stage 12 and early buyers already sitting on 110% gains, many investors believe it has the potential to rally over 800% once Bitcoin kicks off its next big move. Cardano (ADA): Built on patience and progress Cardano ADA has always been known for playing the long game. The ADA trades around $0.82 after slipping about 2% on the last day and nearly 6% on the past week. The latest Plomin upgrade that shifts governance into a more decentralized structure has positioned Cardano as a network built for the future rather than quick wins. Analysts watching the charts suggest ADA may be building toward a breakout if Bitcoin takes the lead. Some forecasts indicate that ADA may reclaim the $3 zone if the broader market experiences a resurgence. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still fueled by culture Dogecoin DOGE has been around long enough to prove that community culture can keep a coin alive through any cycle. DOGE is trading near $0.216 with daily trading volumes topping $1.5 billion. It has been consolidating in a tight range with resistance forming around $0.24. If Bitcoin climbs toward $140,000, there is every reason to believe DOGE could break out of its range and ride the wave upward. While an 800% move would require a substantial narrative shift, the possibility is never far away with Dogecoin. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme energy with structure Among the tokens that could truly surprise the market stands Little Pepe . The presale has already raised over $24.5 million, with over 15.2 billion tokens sold out of the 15.75 billion allocated for stage 12. Tokens are selling for $0.0021; this stage is 97% filled at the time of writing. Early presale buyers from stage 1 are up 110% since the starting price of $0.0010, and even investors coming in now still have a clear 45% upside before launch at $0.0030. Little Pepe has gone beyond being another meme coin. It is listed on CoinMarketCap, has passed a Certik audit, and has managed to trend above DOGE and PEPE in ChatGPT memecoin questions between June and August 2025. That level of attention is not just numbers on a chart; it reflects real cultural relevance. Add the $777k giveaway, and the mix of humor, transparency, and utility makes LILPEPE one of the strongest candidates for outsized gains. If Bitcoin does climb to $140,000, this project has the foundation to deliver a rally that could reach or exceed 800%. Kaspa (KAS): Speed and community Kaspa KAS is trading near $0.083 after dipping slightly over the past week. Known for its fast block confirmation and innovative blockDAG technology, Kaspa has built a loyal developer community that believes in the network’s scalability. With Bitcoin leading, KAS could rally hard from its current levels as new capital flows into high-performance blockchains. Algorand (ALGO): Utility backed by science Algorand ALGO is priced around $0.23, and trading volumes show healthy activity despite 10% off its weekly highs. ALGO has always been marketed as a blockchain, which was born from academic research, with low-cost smart contracts and dApp development at its core. The bigger picture Bitcoin targeting $140,000 sets the tone for altcoins to follow. Cardano offers stability, Dogecoin offers culture, Kaspa offers speed, Algorand offers academic rigor, and VeChain offers enterprise focus. Yet the token standing out right now is Little Pepe. Its presale success, audit approval, cultural traction, and structured growth make it a strong contender for massive returns. Early-stage investors have already doubled their money; current buyers still have room to grow before the launch price. If Bitcoin truly pushes to $140,000, this project has the potential to deliver the kind of 800% rally that crypto traders dream about.

This marks a significant turnaround for the second-largest cryptocurrency after months of stagnation. Factors Behind ETH’s Surge A recent report from crypto bank Sygnum reveals that ETH’s price has surged dramatically, reaching all-time highs in August and outpacing Bitcoin in relative performance. According to the bank, several factors have contributed to this renewed bullish sentiment. Notably, the Pectra upgrade has addressed critical technical issues within the Ethereum ecosystem, enhancing its infrastructure. Related Reading: Ripple Quietly Shifts 15M XRP Post-SEC Win: Whales React as Price Slips The upgrade has expanded the staking cap from 32 to 2048 ETH, and has spiked ETH staking. This boost coincided with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarifying that protocol staking activities do not qualify as security offerings. Combined with increased stablecoin activity and the launch of tokenized securities on the Ethereum blockchain, the upgrade has further bolstered demand for ETH tokens, resulting in a new all-time high near the $5,000 mark. The bank also highlights record inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasury purchases, which mimic strategies employed with Bitcoin (BTC), as playing a significant role in driving up demand. Ethereum Faces Looming Supply Squeeze As institutional interest in Ethereum grows, the liquid supply of ETH on crypto exchanges has begun to dwindle, the report shows. Sygnum suggests that this trend raises the possibility of a supply crunch, which could lead to a significant price increase if demand continues to rise. With significant inflows into ETFs and corporate acquisitions, reserves held on exchanges have dipped to cycle lows, compounding the likelihood of a supply shock. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals What XRP Price Will Be If Ethereum Hits $25,000 Moreover, recent legislative developments in the US, including the passage of the GENIUS and CLARITY acts, have further provided clarity around stablecoins, opening doors for institutional offerings where Ethereum already leads in stablecoin and tokenization activities. Looking ahead, Ethereum appears poised for a bright future. The bank notes that with its technical upgrades and growing institutional interest, ETH’s price is well-positioned to capture a significant share of anticipated stablecoin issuance and institutional adoption trends. As liquid Ethereum reserves on exchanges dwindle and demand continues to surge, the potential for a supply squeeze looms, presenting a new opportunity for investors to capitalize on the expected new uptrend for the token. When writing, ETH trades at $4,420, surging nearly 3% in the 24 hour time frame and 87% year-to-date. With the broader market correction seen over the past week, the Ethereum price remains 10.6% below all-time high levels.

The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis.

Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0000092, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000816. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe up today? Pepe’s price strong accumulation around recent lows. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra day high of $0.000011. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000015 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A significant regulatory development occurred with PEPE’s inclusion in Indonesia’s approved cryptocurrency list on September 1, 2025. PT Central Finansial X (CFX), Indonesia’s first crypto exchange licensed by the Financial Services Authority (OJK), officially designated 1,444 crypto assets as legally tradable in Indonesia, including popular meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). PEPE Price Prediction September 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) September 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community.

Major exchange Coinbase has taken a bold step, asking a U.S. federal court to intervene and order the recovery of deleted communications. Specifically, Coinbase is seeking to retrieve deleted Coinbase SEC texts from former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler. This move underscores the ongoing tension between crypto innovators and regulatory bodies, highlighting the critical need for transparency in government dealings. Why Are These Coinbase SEC Texts So Crucial? This legal request isn’t just about a few messages; it’s about shedding light on how crypto regulations were shaped. According to reports from The Block, the SEC reportedly deleted a full year’s worth of text messages from Chairman Gensler. These crucial communications span from October 2022 to September 2023. The agency cited a new policy implemented in 2023 as the reason for this deletion. However, Coinbase views this as a significant obstacle to understanding regulatory decisions. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, has voiced strong concerns. He explained that Coinbase has been actively requesting internal SEC communications regarding crypto regulation for years. Discovering that a substantial portion of this information was reportedly destroyed has naturally raised red flags. The company believes these Coinbase SEC texts could contain vital context for the SEC’s approach to the digital asset space. What is Coinbase Asking the Court to Do About These Texts? Coinbase is not just making a simple request; they are pursuing a multi-pronged legal strategy to ensure accountability and retrieve the missing data. The exchange is asking the federal court for several key actions: Expedited Discovery: This means a faster-than-usual process to gather evidence. Coinbase wants to quickly get to the bottom of why these messages were deleted and what they contained. Sanctions Against the SEC: Sanctions are penalties imposed for misconduct during a lawsuit. Coinbase believes the alleged destruction of records warrants such measures. Submission of Relevant Text Messages: The ultimate goal is to compel the SEC to submit all pertinent text messages. This is crucial not only for the current case but also to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The implications of these deleted Coinbase SEC texts are far-reaching. The crypto industry often criticizes the SEC for a perceived lack of clear guidance and a ""regulation by enforcement"" approach. If internal communications related to policy-making are not preserved, it further complicates efforts to understand the basis for these regulatory actions. This legal battle highlights the growing demand for transparency from government agencies overseeing rapidly evolving sectors like cryptocurrency. How Do Deleted Coinbase SEC Texts Impact Trust and Regulation? The dispute over the deleted Coinbase SEC texts could have significant ramifications for the future of crypto regulation. Transparency and clear communication are foundational for building trust between regulators and the regulated entities. When key communications are deleted, it can erode that trust and lead to suspicions about the fairness and impartiality of regulatory processes. This situation also brings to light the challenges of digital record-keeping within government agencies. As more official communication shifts to digital platforms, robust policies for retention and disclosure become paramount. The SEC’s new policy, cited for the deletions, will likely face intense scrutiny in court. The outcome of Coinbase’s request could set a precedent for how government agencies handle digital communications related to emerging technologies. For market participants, this case reinforces the need for vigilance. It also emphasizes the importance of legal challenges in shaping the regulatory landscape. A favorable ruling for Coinbase could force greater transparency from the SEC and potentially lead to clearer, more predictable rules for the crypto industry. The legal tussle initiated by Coinbase to recover deleted Coinbase SEC texts from former Chairman Gensler is more than just a procedural request. It represents a critical juncture in the ongoing dialogue between the crypto industry and its regulators. The outcome will not only impact Coinbase’s specific legal battles but could also influence future standards for transparency and accountability within government agencies dealing with digital assets. As the crypto space matures, the demand for clear, consistent, and transparent regulation will only grow louder. This case serves as a powerful reminder of the industry’s commitment to pushing for a more open and equitable regulatory environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is Coinbase requesting from the court? A1: Coinbase is asking a U.S. federal court to order the recovery and disclosure of deleted text messages from former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, along with expedited discovery and potential sanctions against the SEC. Q2: Why are these deleted texts considered significant? A2: These texts are crucial because they could provide vital context and insights into the SEC’s internal discussions and decision-making processes regarding crypto regulation, which Coinbase believes were unfairly opaque. Q3: What reason did the SEC give for deleting the texts? A3: The SEC cited a new policy implemented in 2023 as the reason for deleting one year’s worth of messages from Chairman Gensler, specifically between October 2022 and September 2023. Q4: Who is Gary Gensler in this context? A4: Gary Gensler is the former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman whose deleted text messages are at the center of Coinbase’s legal request. Q5: What are the potential broader implications of this legal action for crypto regulation? A5: This case could set a precedent for transparency and accountability from government agencies regarding digital communications. A favorable outcome for Coinbase might lead to clearer, more predictable regulatory standards for the crypto industry and foster greater trust.

Grewal accused the SEC of destroying key documents, saying the agency’s own Inspector General confirms the misconduct. Coinbase, through History Associates, has asked a federal court to intervene and ensure the agency cannot repeat what it calls a “gross violation of public trust.” The Gensler SEC destroyed documents they were required to preserve and produce. We now have proof from the SEC’s own Inspector General. Today we ask the federal court to address this gross violation of public trust to ensure that it never happens again. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/DPLtHUiolj — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) September 11, 2025 Inspector General’s Findings Reveal Key Timeline Grewal noted that the SEC Office of Inspector General revealed text messages from October 2022 to September 2023 were destroyed despite long-standing information requests covering “all communications” related to crypto regulation. The report detailed how SEC officials’ text messages had been excluded from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) responses despite their potential classification as agency records. According to the filing, almost a year’s worth of then-SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s messages disappeared in September 2023, after FOIA requests but before litigation began. Messages from more than 20 other high-ranking SEC officials may also be gone, with many more at imminent risk of erasure. Coinbase Pushes for Immediate Legal Remedies Coinbase has asked the court for expedited discovery, sanctions, and the immediate production of any remaining text messages. Grewal presented this as a necessary step to hold the SEC accountable, pointing to what he described as double standards between the agency’s treatment of private firms and its own conduct. In court filings, History Associates says the SEC had known of serious record-retention and FOIA problems for two years but did not disclose them during 14 months of litigation. The filing describes the destruction of records as systemic, with major consequences for public access to information about the SEC’s internal approach to cryptocurrency policy. XRP Army Reacts The news has generated strong reactions among XRP supporters, who see the court filing and Inspector General’s findings as validation of long-held concerns. Gensler, long criticized for hypocrisy , now faces mounting scrutiny and growing calls for accountability. Several commenters urged lawsuits or criminal charges, including calls for jail time for Gary Gensler. Others described the situation as despicable or negligent, echoing frustrations about accountability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Some focused on transparency, emphasizing that public officials must be held to the same standards they impose on private firms. One commenter argued that the SEC works for citizens and should face heightened scrutiny. Allegations of destroyed records and selective disclosure threaten to erode confidence in one of the nation’s most powerful financial regulators. While the current SEC has a more pro-crypto stance , former officials must be held accountable for their actions to rebuild public trust.

By 2028, ADA/USD could reach $3.28. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $9.36 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.8996 Market Cap $32.18B Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.49M Circulating Supply 44.99B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.9063 24-hour Low $0.8736 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.73% 50-day SMA $ 0.830101 14-Day RSI 56.60 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 50%) 200-day SMA $ 0.737168 Cardano (ADA) price analysis ADA’s 1-day chart shows bullish momentum with RSI near 59 and a possible move toward $0.95 if resistance breaks. On the 4-hour chart, price consolidates at $0.90 with tightening Bollinger Bands suggesting an imminent breakout. Sustained strength may push ADA higher while failure could see a retest of $0.88. Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: Cardano tests resistance near $0.91 with bullish momentum building Cardano (ADA) is trading near $0.90 on the 1-day chart on Sept 12, showing bullish momentum as price nears the upper Bollinger Band at $0.91. The RSI at 59 signals strengthening buying pressure but not yet overbought, leaving room for further upside. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains in positive territory, reinforcing bullish sentiment. A breakout above $0.91 could target $0.95 and possibly $1.00 if momentum holds. However, rejection at the upper band may trigger a short-term pullback toward $0.85 or $0.80, where support lies. Overall, ADA shows promising bullish momentum but needs strong volume to sustain a breakout beyond current resistance levels. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano consolidates at $0.90 with cautious breakout potential Cardano (ADA) on the 4-hour chart trades around $0.90, consolidating near resistance at $0.9047. The candles hover close to the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting mild bullish momentum, though price has yet to confirm a breakout ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD line is slightly above the signal line, pointing to modest upward pressure, but momentum remains weak. Balance of Power at -0.11 signals selling strength outweighing buyers, indicating potential resistance overhead. If ADA holds above $0.89, it could retest $0.91; however, rejection may pull price back toward support levels at $0.88 or $0.86. Market volume and sentiment will determine the next decisive move. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.866599 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.873411 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.863557 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.851351 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.830101 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.745942 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.737168 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.835359 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.83673 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.847156 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.850731 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.816328 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.775577 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.744871 BUY What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? On the 1-day chart, ADA shows bullish intent as it climbs toward $0.91, testing the upper Bollinger Band. RSI around 59 indicates growing strength without being overbought, while candles maintain higher lows, suggesting resilience. If momentum holds, ADA may challenge $0.95, though rejection at resistance could trigger pullbacks near $0.85. On the 4-hour chart, ADA consolidates around $0.90, with tight Bollinger Bands hinting at a possible breakout. MACD remains slightly bullish, and steady price action signals accumulation. A successful breakout above $0.91 may invite further upside, but failure to sustain momentum could lead to a retest of $0.88. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely likely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

Understanding the Upbit ZETA Deposits and Withdrawals Suspension Upbit officially announced a temporary halt to ZETA deposits and withdrawals .

51594254,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/bitcoin-btc-reaches-116000-is-a-pullback-looming,1757668824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png,"Bitcoin (BTC) Reaches $116,000: Is a Pullback Looming?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/bitcoin-btc-reaches-116000-is-a-pullback-looming,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit the $115,700 horizontal resistance level early on Friday, plus it touched the top of an ascending channel. The price has rejected from these barriers, and given that short-term momentum has topped out, is this an ideal point to start the next downward price impulse? Bitcoin shrugs off slightly negative inflation and jobs release figures After a better than forecast PPI release on Wednesday, the CPI release on Thursday was not favourite for a repeat performance, and the resulting slightly worse than expected figure proved this. Completing Thursday’s more gloomy picture was a rise in unemployment claims from the 235K that was forecast, to the actual release figure of 263K. Nevertheless, both the US stock market and Bitcoin shrugged off these negatives with gusto, with the market no doubt mindful of the upcoming rate cut next week. The S&P 500 finished up 0.85%, while Bitcoin rose 1.35%. $BTC perfectly respects ascending channel Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that the price action has been carefully respecting first the descending channel, and then the current ascending channel. The tippy top touch of the upper trendline of the ascending channel was textbook, and if the price action is going to continue to respect this channel, it’s likely that a corrective downward price impulse will take place from here. It must also be noted that the $115,700 horizontal resistance level matches the 0.5 Fibonacci level exactly - another good reason for this rejection. Looking at possible downside targets, the 0.5 Fibonacci comes into play again. This time, looking at the Fibonacci extensions going lower, the 0.5 Fibonacci corresponds exactly with the $113,500 support. Lower still, the 0.618 Fibonacci level is at $112,850, while the deepest Fibonacci level of 0.786 comes in at $111,950. That last 0.786 Fibonacci level may coincide with the bottom of the rising channel, which would be an excellent place for the correction to peter out and a new upward impulse wave to begin. Of course, this is all conjecture, but it is based on the near-perfection of the price action as it traverses this ascending channel, respecting the top and bottom trendlines as it goes. If there is a breakdown of the channel at the bottom, the bulls will need to defend $110,800 in order to prevent the formation of a lower low. Daily chart shows indicators faltering Source: TradingView The daily chart also tends to lend its weight to a period of consolidation now. The 50-day SMA (blue line) is still on its way down, and may eventually come down to the rising 100-day SMA (green line). Although given that the $BTC price is still in an uptrend, perhaps this may only be for a potential shallow dip of the 50-day below the 100-day. The daily Stochastic RSI indicators have reached the top of their limit and so a cross back down is likely to occur. That said, these indicators could bounce around for an extended period like they did in June/July, and therefore may not signal faltering upside price momentum yet. The RSI, at the bottom of the chart, reveals that the indicator is starting to angle back down, even before reaching the downtrend line. How far down could $BTC go? Source: TradingView In the weekly chart it can be seen that if the $BTC price is rejected from the $115,700 horizontal resistance, which does look as though it will happen, the next horizontal support below is at $113,500. Also, should this correction continue, the indicator lines in the Stochastic RSI will possibly draw apart by the end of the week and not confirm a cross-up. Putting it all into context All these negatives that have been mentioned so far in this article have to be put into context from a more macro perspective. If a correction takes the price back down and the weekly candle closes below $113,500, the correction could continue. However, the very strong horizontal support at $108,000 awaits below. Even if the price did get down to this level, the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators would have reached the bottom and would be poised for the next rise to the upside. This next wave upwards of these indicators has the potential to signal enough upside price momentum for bitcoin to have at least one more big rally.

This news has certainly caught the attention of SLF token holders and the wider crypto community. Bithumb, a major player in the South Korean crypto landscape, officially announced that it will delist Self Chain (SLF) from its platform. The effective date for this delisting is set for 6:00 a.m. UTC on October 13 . For investors, this is a crucial piece of information that demands immediate attention and action. What Does a Self Chain Delisting Mean for Investors? When an exchange decides on a Self Chain delisting , it essentially removes the trading pair for that specific cryptocurrency. This means users will no longer be able to buy, sell, or trade SLF tokens on the Bithumb platform after the specified date. The primary impact is a significant reduction in liquidity for the token. For current SLF holders on Bithumb, this announcement isn’t just a minor update; it’s a call to action. You will need to move your tokens off the exchange before the deadline. Failing to do so could result in losing access to your funds, or at the very least, facing significant hurdles in retrieving them. Why Do Exchanges Delist Cryptocurrencies? Exchange delistings, while impactful, are not uncommon in the fast-paced crypto world. Several factors can lead to such decisions. Often, exchanges conduct regular reviews of the assets listed on their platforms to ensure they meet certain standards. These standards can include: Low Trading Volume: If a token has consistently low trading activity, it may not be profitable for the exchange to maintain its listing. Lack of Project Development: Projects that fail to meet their roadmap goals or show a lack of ongoing development can be flagged. Regulatory Concerns: Changes in regulations or a project’s inability to comply with new rules can trigger a delisting. Security Vulnerabilities: Any discovered security flaws or hacks can lead to immediate delisting to protect users. Community Engagement: A lack of an active and engaged community can also be a red flag for exchanges. While Bithumb’s specific reasons for the Self Chain delisting were not detailed in the initial announcement, it’s generally understood to stem from one or a combination of these factors. This decision underscores the importance of due diligence for both exchanges and investors. Actionable Steps for SLF Holders on Bithumb If you hold SLF tokens on Bithumb, taking immediate action is paramount. Here are the key steps you should consider: Withdraw Your Tokens: The most crucial step is to withdraw your SLF tokens from Bithumb to a personal wallet or another exchange that still supports SLF trading. Make sure to do this well before the October 13 deadline. Research Other Exchanges: Investigate other reputable cryptocurrency exchanges where SLF is still listed and traded. Be cautious and verify the legitimacy of any new platform. Consider Your Options: Evaluate whether you wish to hold your SLF tokens long-term, or if this delisting prompts you to sell them on an alternative platform. Understand the potential impact on the token’s price and liquidity. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from both Bithumb and the Self Chain project team for any further updates or guidance. Proactive management of your assets is always the best strategy, especially when faced with critical market changes like a Self Chain delisting . The Broader Implications of Exchange Delistings A delisting, especially from a prominent exchange like Bithumb, can have significant repercussions for a cryptocurrency project. It often leads to a decrease in trading volume, reduced accessibility for new investors, and a potential negative impact on the token’s price. For the Self Chain project, this move by Bithumb presents a considerable challenge in maintaining market presence and investor confidence. This event also serves as a reminder to the broader crypto community about the dynamic nature of digital asset listings. Exchanges play a vital role as gatekeepers, and their decisions can profoundly influence the trajectory of a cryptocurrency. It highlights the need for projects to continuously innovate, comply with regulations, and maintain strong community engagement to ensure their longevity on major platforms. Conclusion: Navigating Market Changes The announcement of the Self Chain delisting by Bithumb is a stark reminder of the volatility and evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market. For SLF holders, timely action is essential to protect your assets. For the wider crypto community, it reinforces the importance of thorough research, understanding exchange policies, and staying informed about project developments. While such news can be unsettling, it also underscores the maturity of the market as exchanges strive to maintain high standards for their listed assets. Always prioritize the security of your investments and be prepared to adapt to market changes swiftly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When is the Self Chain (SLF) delisting from Bithumb effective? The delisting of Self Chain (SLF) from Bithumb will be effective at 6:00 a.m. UTC on October 13. Q2: What should SLF holders on Bithumb do before the delisting date? SLF holders on Bithumb should withdraw their tokens to a personal wallet or transfer them to another exchange that supports SLF trading before the October 13 deadline to avoid potential loss of access. Q3: Why do cryptocurrency exchanges delist tokens? Exchanges delist tokens for various reasons, including low trading volume, lack of project development, regulatory concerns, security vulnerabilities, or insufficient community engagement. Q4: Will the Self Chain delisting affect SLF’s price?

As much as Ethereum remains a markets sentiment indicator, all focus is now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new altcoin set to shake up decentralized lending and liquidity. Mutuum Finance successfully conducted five presale rounds, and round six is live with the token price of $0.035. Investors that acquire tokens during this time will have a tremendous ROI when the coin starts public trading. Presale has 16,220 backers till date and has already raised more than $15.6 million in funds. Ethereum Hovers Steadily Amid Rumors of Rate Cut Ethereum (ETH) stands at $4,314, with trading volumes between $4,279 and $4,379 over the last 24 hours. As odds of a September rate cut are almost a done deal, ETH remains a sentiment indicator, and analysts see looser monetary conditions as spurring further inflows into digital tokens. As Ethereum finds a home in this range, market watchers are also keeping an eye on how shifting liquidity conditions can impact budding platforms like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Launches $50,000 Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is partnering with CertiK to roll out a Bug Bounty Program for security researchers, experts, and developers. The protocol compensates the users who find and report any bug against the project’s security. The payment for the reward changes based on the level of severity in each bug, with minor to major severities being compensated for. The highest amount that one can receive is $50,000 in USDT. All this does is keep the website secure, safeguarding the visitors, and gaining the trust of the investors. Besides the bug bounty, Mutuum Finance has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway to encourage early adoption, increase the user base, and encourage community engagement. Membership can reward you with one of the 10 prizes of $10,000 MUTM. Regulation of Market Risk, Volatility, and Liquidity Mutuum Finance implements liquidation rules and limits for risk and stakeholder protection as well as system stability due to a lack of liquidity. Market volatility has a direct bearing on whether the LTV ratios and liquidation levels would be riskier in character or otherwise. The system is riskier, i.e., more conservative and narrow policy, when the market is extremely volatile. The system can be stable and flexible when the volatility is low. Risk levels subsequently also dictate the level to which the reserve funds are activated, in a bid to ensure the security of the platform and keep it running under different market conditions. Mutuum Finance’s way of DeFi ensures that as the platform user you’re always in control of your assets. Through lending, users are rewarded with passive income from borrowers and lenders, and access to funds is instant by borrowing multiple assets across loan value. Building a Secure and Community Driven DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance not only operates to create a secure and scalable DeFi platform but a community-oriented, entertaining environment as well. Through its presale and ongoing campaigns, MUTM started a chain of rewards to users, incentives to investors, and long-term stability to the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trending upward as investors expect a September rate cut that could bring new liquidity into crypto markets. Stage 6 tokens are $0.035, with over 16,220 supporters and $15.6M raised, showing early conviction. Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady at $4,314, but new DeFi platforms like MUTM are positioned for even more upside as borrowing costs fall. Lock up your Stage 6 tokens now before the next presale price increase.

Instead, history shows that true breakout returns often emerge from coins few are watching, tokens quietly building communities, delivering upgrades, and securing early adoption. These opportunities often appear during periods of broader caution, when mainstream capital looks away and retail sentiment turns conservative. Today’s market fits that description perfectly. Weak labor data in the U.S. has heightened fears of slowing growth, leaving traditional equities fragile. Meanwhile, crypto majors appear stable but uninspiring, tempting traders into complacency. Yet analysts remind us that quiet conditions are exactly when the next stars are born. From Layer-1 innovation to DeFi infrastructure and meme-driven cultural branding, three underrated projects are beginning to gather momentum: Sui, Injective, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. Each highlights a different path to upside, technical efficiency, structural utility, and cultural resonance. Sui: Layer-1 efficiency rising Sui is one of the most advanced yet underappreciated Layer-1 blockchains on the market. Its parallel execution engine, which processes multiple transactions simultaneously, sets it apart from older architectures reliant on sequential validation. This means faster speeds and lower costs, both critical for mainstream use cases like gaming and social applications. Despite these advantages, Sui has not captured the same spotlight as Solana or Ethereum. Part of this comes down to timing, Sui’s rise coincided with macro headwinds that drained liquidity from altcoins. Still, developers have continued to build. The foundation has launched grants and incubator programs to support new applications, and ecosystem activity is gradually increasing. Analysts believe Sui’s undervaluation relative to its technology represents an opportunity for long-term investors. Should adoption accelerate, today’s lack of attention may look like a missed chance in hindsight. MAGACOIN FINANCE: audited, scarce, and surging The next name flying under the radar is not just another meme coin, it is reshaping perceptions of what a legitimate community-driven launch can look like. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already passed strong audits from biggest names, two of the most respected names in blockchain security. That approval gives it a level of credibility rarely seen at this stage. Scarcity has been central to its momentum. Presale rounds have sold out rapidly, reflecting rising demand against a limited token supply. Adding fuel to the fire is the exclusive PATRIOT50X code, which unlocks a 50% bonus allocation for early participants, a reward mechanism that has energized its community and reinforced urgency among buyers. Analysts increasingly frame MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare case where credibility and culture intersect. Forecasts suggest upside potential in the 35-45x range, putting it among the few tokens capable of turning modest allocations into life-changing gains. In a cycle where mining profits and large-cap growth look limited, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the strongest asymmetric opportunities. Injective: DeFi infrastructure with staying power Injective is often described as the “plumbing” of decentralized finance, a project that prioritizes functionality over flash. Its focus lies in building a platform for derivatives, trading protocols, and cross-chain liquidity, all with institutional-grade infrastructure. This approach has won it steady support from developers and financial professionals, even if it hasn’t fueled viral attention among retail audiences. What makes Injective underrated is its positioning at the center of a sector poised for growth. As regulatory frameworks for DeFi evolve, projects with robust infrastructure will be best positioned to attract capital. Injective’s interoperability also ensures it can serve as a hub for multiple chains, an advantage as the market moves toward a multi-chain reality. Analysts highlight that resilience in quieter times often signals staying power in the long run. If DeFi reclaims investor focus in the next cycle, Injective’s foundations may deliver strong returns. Why these 3 cryptos could break out Why do Sui, Injective, and MAGACOIN FINANCE deserve attention now? Sui – Scalable Efficiency: Its parallel execution model solves bottlenecks that have plagued earlier blockchains, positioning it for adoption in gaming, DeFi, and consumer apps. Undervalued today, Sui could re-rate higher once user growth accelerates. Injective – DeFi’s Core Layer: By prioritizing derivatives and cross-chain functionality, Injective is becoming the infrastructure institutions require. Its steady progress makes it a durable play on DeFi expansion. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Cultural Momentum + Legitimacy: Unlike most meme projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines audits, scarcity, and the PATRIOT50X bonus with viral cultural traction, creating a rare alignment of trust and explosive upside. Together, they embody a crucial lesson: markets reward those willing to look past the obvious. By the time the mainstream notices, the biggest multiples are already gone. These three tokens may still be flying under the radar, but they show all the hallmarks of projects that could dominate the conversation in the next bull run. Conclusion Underrated tokens often deliver the cycle’s most dramatic surprises. Sui’s efficiency-focused design, Injective’s steady DeFi infrastructure, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s unique blend of cultural branding and credibility highlight where patient capital may be positioning today. With its dual audits, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and the PATRIOT50X bonus code driving urgency, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most compelling early-stage stories. For investors seeking opportunities beyond the obvious leaders, these three projects demonstrate how hidden gems can define the next wave of crypto growth.

South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has officially declared a temporary halt on deposits and withdrawals for Zilliqa (ZIL). This crucial measure will commence promptly at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 24 . The primary reason for this suspension is an impending network upgrade, specifically an anticipated Zilliqa hard fork . It is essential for all ZIL investors and traders to understand the implications of this development to manage their assets effectively. What Exactly is a Hard Fork, and Why Does it Matter for ZIL? A hard fork in the blockchain world is a fundamental change to the network’s protocol. Think of it as an upgrade that isn’t backward-compatible. Essentially, it creates a new set of rules that all network participants must follow. If some participants don’t upgrade, they continue on the old chain, leading to a permanent split. For the Zilliqa network, this Zilliqa hard fork signifies a major step forward, introducing new features or improvements to its underlying technology. Exchanges like Upbit temporarily suspend services during such events to safeguard user funds and ensure a seamless transition. They need to update their systems to support the new chain, preventing any potential loss of funds or transaction errors that could arise from interacting with an outdated network. This proactive approach minimizes risks for traders and the exchange alike. Upbit’s Crucial Suspension: Key Dates and What to Expect The temporary suspension by Upbit is a direct response to the upcoming Zilliqa hard fork . Understanding the specifics of this halt is vital for all ZIL holders: Start Time: Deposits and withdrawals for ZIL will be suspended starting at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 24 . Duration: The suspension is temporary. It will remain in effect until Upbit confirms the stability and successful completion of the Zilliqa network upgrade. Impact: During this period, users will not be able to send ZIL to their Upbit accounts or withdraw ZIL from them. Trading of ZIL on the exchange, however, is typically unaffected by such suspensions, though it’s always wise to check Upbit’s official announcements for complete clarity. Users should plan any necessary ZIL transactions well in advance of the specified deadline to avoid inconvenience. This ensures that your assets are where you need them before the network transition begins. Preparing for the Zilliqa Hard Fork: Your Actionable Checklist As the date for the Zilliqa hard fork approaches, taking a few simple steps can help you navigate the process smoothly: Review Your Holdings: Check your ZIL balance on Upbit. Decide if you need to deposit or withdraw any ZIL before the September 24 deadline. Stay Informed: Regularly monitor official announcements from Upbit and the Zilliqa project team. They will provide updates on the hard fork’s progress and when services will resume. Understand the Risks: While hard forks are often planned upgrades, unforeseen issues can sometimes arise. Being aware of potential delays or technical glitches is part of responsible crypto investing. Taking these proactive measures will help you stay prepared and avoid any last-minute rush or complications related to the suspension. The Future of Zilliqa (ZIL) After This Network Upgrade While temporary suspensions can be a minor inconvenience, the underlying reason, the Zilliqa hard fork , is often a positive sign for the network’s future. Hard forks are typically implemented to introduce significant improvements, such as enhanced scalability, better security features, or new functionalities that can expand Zilliqa’s utility and adoption. For instance, the upgrade might pave the way for more efficient smart contract execution or improved cross-chain compatibility. These upgrades reflect the continuous development and innovation within the Zilliqa ecosystem. A successful hard fork can strengthen the network’s foundation, potentially increasing its appeal to developers and users alike. Therefore, while Upbit’s action is a short-term operational adjustment, it points towards long-term growth and evolution for Zilliqa. Conclusion: Navigating the Zilliqa Hard Fork with Confidence Upbit’s temporary suspension of ZIL deposits and withdrawals on September 24 is a necessary step to accommodate the upcoming Zilliqa hard fork . This event, while requiring a brief pause in certain services, signifies a pivotal moment for the Zilliqa network’s evolution. By staying informed, understanding the implications, and taking timely action, ZIL holders can ensure a seamless experience during this important upgrade. Always rely on official sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding your cryptocurrency assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

The malware spreads via fake recruiter ads online. Major antivirus software did not detect ModStealer malware for almost a month before reporting it. It targeted developers already working with Node.js environments. ModStealer scans for browser-based crypto wallet extensions, system credentials, and digital certificates before sending the stolen information to a command and control (C2) server. The C2 server acts as a central hub for scammers to manage compromised devices. ModStealer exploits Node.js to steal private keys According to research by 9to5Mac , ModStealer malware disguised itself on macOS systems as a background helper program to achieve persistence, ensuring it ran automatically every time the computer restarted. The infected systems had a file labeled sysupdater.dat and unusual connections to suspicious servers. Shan Zhang, chief information security officer at SlowMist, a blockchain security company, revealed that ModStealer evades detection by mainstream antivirus software and poses a significant risk to the digital asset ecosystem. He added that the malware has multi-platform support and stealth execution, which differentiates it from traditional malware. Charles Guillemet, Ledger CTO, revealed another similar attack that allowed attackers to compromise a Node Package Manager (npm) developer account in an attempt to spread malicious code, which may silently replace wallet addresses during transactions. He cautioned that such incidents show how vulnerable blockchain-related code libraries can be. “The attackers’ mistakes caused crashes in CI/CD pipelines, which led to early detection and limited impact. Still, this is a clear reminder: if your funds sit in a software wallet or on an exchange, you’re one code execution away from losing everything. Supply chain compromises remain a powerful malware delivery vector, and we’re also seeing more targeted attacks emerge.” – Charles Guillemet , Ledger CTO Zhang warned that the ModStealer malware presents a direct threat to crypto users and platforms, adding that for individual users, the compromise of private keys, seed phrases, and exchange API keys may lead to immediate losses. He also noted that mass theft of browser extension wallet data could fuel large-scale on-chain exploits and weaken user trust while increasing risks across crypto supply chains. New cyber exploits target crypto wallets data Guillemet discovered that the JavaScript ecosystem was compromised by a massive supply chain attack targeting libraries such as chalk, strip-ansi, color-convert, and error-ex. The affected packages have been downloaded more than one billion times a week, which presents a severe threat to the blockchain ecosystem. The malicious software worked as a crypto-clipper, meaning it could replace wallet addresses in network requests or modify transactions initiated via MetaMask and other wallets. The attack was discovered via a minor CI/CD pipeline build failure. The researchers later found that the malware used two strategies. The first strategy was passive address swapping, which monitored outgoing traffic requests and replaced wallet addresses with the hijacker’s controlled ones. It used the Levenshtein distance algorithm, which selects lookalike addresses, making it visually difficult to detect changes. Another method the attackers utilized was active transaction hijacking, which modifies pending transactions in memory before forwarding them for user approval once a crypto wallet is detected. This tricked users into signing transfers directly to the attacker’s wallet. Similar incidents have been reported on Cryptopolitan recently, where ReversingLabs’ research revealed another malware concealed on Ethereum smart contracts. The attack was downloaded via npm packages, including colortoolv2 and mimelib2, which acted as second-stage agents, fetching the malicious software stored on the Ethereum blockchain. ReversingLabs revealed that the malicious software bypassed security scans by hiding the malicious URLs within the Ethereum smart contracts. It was later downloaded through fake GitHub repositories, which posed as cryptocurrency trading bots. The operation was linked to Stargazer’s Ghost Network, a system of coordinated attacks that boost the legitimacy of malicious repositories. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Many investors are wondering what it will take for the digital asset to reach this significant milestone. However, according to insights from industry experts cited in a CoinDesk report, Bitcoin’s path to $120K is not without its obstacles. Understanding these key hurdles is crucial for anyone following the market. Understanding the Critical Resistance at $124,000 One of the primary challenges identified by analysts is a substantial resistance level situated around $124,000. What exactly does this mean for Bitcoin? Historically, price resistance acts like a ceiling, a point where selling pressure tends to overcome buying pressure, preventing the price from moving higher. For Bitcoin, this level has proven particularly stubborn. Data shows that above the $115,000 threshold, buying enthusiasm for Bitcoin has often weakened. Furthermore, on two separate occasions in recent monthly candles, Bitcoin briefly pushed past $124,000, only to be swiftly pulled back below it. This pattern suggests that while there’s an appetite to test higher levels, sustained momentum beyond $124,000 has been difficult to achieve. Overcoming this specific barrier is essential for Bitcoin’s path to $120K to continue. Are Interest Rate Cuts Already Priced In? Another significant factor influencing Bitcoin’s path to $120K involves the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. Many market participants have been eagerly awaiting anticipated interest rate cuts from the Fed, believing these cuts would generally be bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin. The expectation is that lower interest rates make traditional savings less attractive, encouraging investors to seek higher returns in assets like cryptocurrencies. However, experts suggest that the market may have already “priced in” these potential cuts. This means that the current value of Bitcoin and other assets might already reflect the future expectation of lower rates. Evidence for this can be seen in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which has been trading consistently within the 97-98 range. A stable DXY, despite rate cut expectations, implies that the dollar’s strength isn’t significantly weakening, which could limit the upside for risk assets that often benefit from a weaker dollar. If these rate cuts are already factored into current prices, their actual implementation might not provide the fresh impetus needed for a significant upward push. The Impact of 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yields The third hurdle on Bitcoin’s path to $120K relates to the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. This yield serves as a benchmark for borrowing costs and is closely watched by investors. When Treasury yields decline, it often makes riskier assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, more appealing. This is because the relatively safe return from government bonds becomes less attractive, prompting capital to flow into assets with higher potential, albeit higher risk. The concern now is that there might be limited potential for further significant declines in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. If yields have already dropped considerably and are nearing a floor, the “push” factor for capital to move into risk assets like Bitcoin could diminish. A scenario where Treasury yields stabilize or even begin to rise slightly would likely divert capital away from cryptocurrencies, making it harder for Bitcoin to attract the necessary inflows to propel it towards the $120,000 target. This dynamic highlights the intricate relationship between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning crypto space. Navigating These Market Dynamics Understanding these three interconnected hurdles provides a clearer picture of the challenges ahead. Bitcoin’s path to $120K is not just about internal crypto market dynamics; it is deeply influenced by broader macroeconomic factors. Investors and enthusiasts should consider these external forces when assessing Bitcoin’s short-to-medium term price potential. Resistance Levels: Keep an eye on the $124,000 mark. A decisive break above this level, with strong volume, would be a bullish signal. Monetary Policy: Monitor Federal Reserve announcements and market reactions to interest rate decisions. The impact might be less direct if cuts are already priced in. Bond Markets: Watch the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. Significant upward movements could signal headwinds for risk assets. While the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains robust for many, these immediate challenges warrant careful consideration. The journey to new all-time highs is rarely a straight line, and these hurdles remind us of the complexities involved in forecasting market movements. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does “resistance level” mean for Bitcoin? A resistance level is a price point where selling interest is strong enough to prevent an asset’s price from rising further. For Bitcoin, the $124,000 mark has historically acted as a ceiling, indicating that buyers face significant opposition at that price. How do interest rate cuts affect Bitcoin? Generally, interest rate cuts make traditional investments like savings accounts less attractive. This can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets like Bitcoin. However, if these cuts are already “priced in” by the market, their actual implementation might not lead to further significant price increases. What is the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and why is it relevant? The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) measures the dollar’s value against a basket of major currencies. A strong DXY can indicate less appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin, while a weaker DXY can suggest the opposite. Its stability in the 97-98 range suggests that rate cut expectations might already be factored into the dollar’s value. Why are 10-year U.S. Treasury yields important for Bitcoin? 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are a benchmark for safe returns. When these yields decline, riskier assets like Bitcoin become more attractive, potentially drawing in capital. If there’s limited room for yields to fall further, this “push” factor for Bitcoin could diminish, affecting its ability to attract new investment.

For those deeply entrenched in understanding macro trends, especially how they might influence assets like cryptocurrencies, the revelation that ‘short USD’ is no longer considered a ‘crowded trade’ is a significant development. What exactly does this mean for the future of the US Dollar , and how might this impact your investment strategies? Let’s dive deep into this crucial shift in market sentiment. Unpacking the Latest Bank of America Survey Findings The latest Global Fund Manager Survey from Bank of America (BofA) has delivered a compelling insight: the prevailing consensus on a weaker US Dollar has dissipated. For months, betting against the dollar, or ‘going short USD,’ was one of the most popular and widely held positions across financial markets. This ‘crowded trade’ reflected a broad expectation that the dollar would continue to depreciate against other major currencies, driven by factors such as aggressive Federal Reserve easing, burgeoning US debt, and a global economic recovery favoring risk assets. However, the BofA survey indicates a distinct change. Fund managers are now less convinced that shorting the dollar is a surefire bet. This doesn’t necessarily mean they are aggressively going long the dollar, but rather that the overwhelming conviction to short it has waned. This shift is a powerful signal, as crowded trades often become vulnerable to sharp reversals once the consensus breaks. When too many investors hold the same position, even minor catalysts can trigger a cascade of selling or buying, leading to increased volatility. Key takeaways from the BofA survey regarding the USD: Reduced Conviction: Fewer fund managers view ‘short USD’ as the most obvious or profitable trade. Diversification of Views: Market participants are now holding more diverse opinions on the dollar’s trajectory. Potential for Reversal: The unwinding of a crowded trade can lead to significant price movements, often counter to the prior consensus. Understanding USD Sentiment: A Shift in Market Psychology USD sentiment is a complex interplay of economic indicators, geopolitical events, and central bank policies. For a considerable period, the narrative surrounding the US Dollar leaned heavily towards depreciation. This was fueled by several factors: Dovish Federal Reserve: Expectations of prolonged low interest rates and quantitative easing measures designed to stimulate the US economy. Global Recovery Hopes: A belief that as other economies recovered, their currencies would strengthen against the dollar. Inflation Concerns: Fears that the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus would lead to inflation, eroding the dollar’s purchasing power. The shift observed in the BofA survey suggests that some of these underlying assumptions are being re-evaluated. Perhaps the US economic recovery is showing more resilience than anticipated, or inflation fears are proving more persistent, leading to speculation about earlier-than-expected Fed tapering. When the market consensus on a major currency like the dollar begins to fray, it signals a period of heightened uncertainty and potential for new trends to emerge. Investors must now recalibrate their expectations and consider a broader range of outcomes for the dollar’s performance. The Forex Market Landscape: Navigating New Currents The Forex market , the largest and most liquid financial market globally, is where currencies are traded. The US Dollar plays a central role in this ecosystem, influencing virtually every other currency pair. When a major position like ‘short USD’ is no longer crowded, it creates new dynamics across the entire market. How this shift might impact the Forex market: Increased Volatility: As investors unwind their short USD positions or take on new ones, currency pairs involving the dollar (e.g., EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD) could experience greater price swings. Redistribution of Capital: Funds previously allocated to short USD trades might now seek opportunities in other currencies or asset classes, potentially boosting other major currencies or emerging market assets. Emergence of New Crowded Trades: The absence of a crowded short USD trade doesn’t mean the market is devoid of consensus. New ‘crowded trades’ might emerge in other areas, such as long positions in specific commodities or short positions in other currencies. For currency traders, this period demands increased vigilance and a flexible approach. Relying on outdated consensus can be perilous. Instead, a focus on real-time economic data, central bank communications, and geopolitical developments becomes paramount. What Does ‘No Longer a Crowded Trade’ Mean for Currency Trading? The concept of a ‘crowded trade’ is fundamental in currency trading . It refers to a situation where a large number of market participants hold similar positions, leading to a high degree of correlation and often making the trade susceptible to sudden reversals. When a trade becomes too crowded, its potential for further profit diminishes, and the risk of a sharp correction increases. Why Was Short USD a Crowded Trade? Historically, the short USD trade gained popularity due to several factors: Yield Differentials: Other countries offered relatively higher interest rates or better growth prospects. Safe-Haven Unwinding: As global economic confidence improved, the need for the dollar as a safe-haven asset diminished. Trade Deficits: Persistent US trade deficits were seen as a long-term drag on the dollar. Implications of the Shift for Currency Trading: Now that short USD is no longer crowded, it suggests: Reduced Reversal Risk: The immediate danger of a massive short squeeze on the dollar is lessened, as there are fewer short positions to be covered. More Balanced Market: The market’s positioning on the dollar is likely more balanced, allowing for price movements driven more by fundamentals than by speculative positioning. Opportunities for Contrarian Plays: Traders looking for contrarian opportunities might find them, as the herd mentality has dissipated. This could mean looking for opportunities where the dollar is undervalued or overvalued based on new fundamental data. This shift requires traders to reassess their strategies. Instead of simply following the herd, a more nuanced approach, focusing on individual currency pairs and their unique drivers, will likely yield better results. Beyond the Dollar: Broader Implications of Shifting USD Dynamics The US Dollar’s role extends far beyond the Forex market. Its strength or weakness has profound implications for a wide array of other asset classes, including commodities, equities, and even the nascent cryptocurrency market. Impact on Commodities: Commodities like gold and oil are typically priced in US Dollars. A weaker dollar makes these commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies, often leading to increased demand and higher prices. Conversely, a stronger dollar can make them more expensive, potentially dampening demand and prices. The recent shift in USD sentiment , away from a universally weak dollar, could therefore introduce headwinds for commodity prices, or at least remove a significant tailwind they have enjoyed. Impact on Equities: For US-based multinational corporations, a weaker dollar can boost earnings when foreign revenues are translated back into dollars. A stronger dollar can have the opposite effect. For emerging markets, a stronger dollar can make dollar-denominated debt more expensive to service, posing risks to their economies. The unwinding of the crowded short USD trade suggests that these dynamics might now be less predictable, requiring investors to consider the currency exposure of their equity portfolios more carefully. Relevance for Cryptocurrency Markets: While often seen as a hedge against traditional finance, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are not entirely immune to dollar dynamics. A consistently strong dollar can sometimes divert capital away from riskier assets, including crypto. Conversely, a weakening dollar, especially one driven by inflation concerns, has historically been cited as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. The current shift, where the dollar’s path is less certain, means crypto investors need to pay close attention to macro signals, as the dollar’s direction could still influence sentiment and capital flows into the digital asset space. Challenges and Opportunities for Investors The dissipation of the crowded short USD trade presents both challenges and opportunities for investors across the spectrum. Challenges: Increased Uncertainty: The removal of a clear consensus can make market direction less predictable. Higher Volatility: As positions are adjusted, markets can experience greater price swings. Need for Deeper Analysis: Relying on broad macro themes alone may no longer be sufficient; granular analysis of individual assets and their drivers becomes more critical. Opportunities: Diversification: With less of a ‘one-way bet’ on the dollar, investors can explore a wider range of currency pairs and asset classes without fighting a strong market tide. Fundamental-Driven Trading: A market less driven by crowded positioning can offer better opportunities for those who base their decisions on solid economic fundamentals. Identifying New Trends: The shift allows for the emergence of new, potentially profitable trends that were previously obscured by the overwhelming short USD consensus. Actionable Insights for Navigating the New USD Landscape Given the significant findings from the Bank of America survey , what should investors be doing right now? Re-evaluate Dollar Exposure: Assess your current portfolio’s direct and indirect exposure to the US Dollar. Consider if your previous assumptions about a weakening dollar still hold true. Monitor Key Economic Indicators: Pay close attention to US inflation data, employment figures, GDP growth, and Federal Reserve statements. These will be crucial in determining the dollar’s next moves. Diversify Your Currency Basket: Instead of focusing solely on the dollar, consider diversifying across a basket of major currencies. Look for economies showing strong fundamentals and positive growth trajectories. Stay Informed on Central Bank Policies: Central bank actions (or inactions) are powerful drivers of currency valuations. Keep abreast of policy decisions from the Fed, ECB, BoJ, and others. Consider Hedging Strategies: If you have significant exposure to foreign assets, consider currency hedging to mitigate potential losses from adverse dollar movements. Look for Value: With less ‘crowded’ positioning, opportunities may arise to buy or sell currencies that are undervalued or overvalued based on their true economic fundamentals, rather than just market sentiment. Conclusion: A Dynamic Shift in the Global Financial Narrative The Bank of America survey’s revelation that short USD is no longer a crowded trade marks a pivotal moment in global financial markets. It signifies a maturation of views on the US Dollar, moving away from a one-sided consensus to a more balanced and dynamic landscape. For investors, this shift is a powerful reminder that markets are constantly evolving, and what was once a popular trade can quickly lose its luster. Adapting to these changes, understanding the nuances of USD sentiment , and adopting a flexible approach to currency trading will be key to navigating the new currents in the Forex market .

Crypto Investment Giant Galaxy Digital Makes Large SOL Purchase! Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-solana-season-coming-crypto-investment-giant-galaxy-digital-makes-large-sol-purchase-here-are-the-details/,"Crypto investment giant Galaxy Digital made a big impact on the market by purchasing Solana (SOL) for approximately $530 million in the last 24 hours. Galaxy Digital's $530 Million Solana Move: Is “Solana Season” Beginning? According to Arkham Intelligence data, the company transferred 2.31 million SOL from Binance, Bybit, and Coinbase wallets through various transactions. While there has been no official confirmation from Galaxy, this move strengthens the “Solana Season” narrative. This development also supports a significant investment Galaxy recently made, where the company led a $1.65 billion private equity round in Nasdaq company Forward Industries alongside Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital. With this initiative, Forward is transforming into a digital asset treasury company focused on Solana. Three firms committed more than $300 million in the related round. Forward's shares have risen 135% in the past five days. Lookonchain suggested Galaxy was accumulating SOL for Forward, but it remains unclear whether the $530 million purchase was directly linked to the company. Nevertheless, the move points to a new corporate trend where public companies are turning to a “reverse merger” strategy to build crypto treasurys. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz stated that the crypto market has entered “Solana season,” highlighting strong momentum and positive regulatory signals. Similarly, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated that institutional buying and expectations for a spot Solana ETF are driving the token upward. Solana gained 6 percent in the last 24 hours, reaching $236.83, bringing its market value to $126.4 billion and surpassing BNB to become the world's fifth-largest crypto asset. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, a significant announcement from a major South Korean exchange has caught the attention of many. We’re talking about the recent Coinone delisting of two specific cryptocurrencies: KAI and FRONT. Understanding the Coinone Delisting Announcement South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinone made an important announcement regarding its trading pairs. The exchange confirmed that it will officially delist KAI and FRONT tokens. This action is scheduled to take place at 6:00 a.m. UTC on October 13. For investors holding these specific assets, this news is certainly noteworthy. It signals a change in the availability of these tokens on one of the prominent platforms in the Asian market. Understanding the implications of such a move is essential for managing your digital assets effectively. What Does a Cryptocurrency Delisting Really Mean? When a cryptocurrency exchange decides to delist a token, it essentially means that the exchange will no longer support trading for that particular asset. This includes ceasing buy and sell orders, and often, deposits and withdrawals will also be affected. There are various reasons why an exchange might undertake a Coinone delisting . These can range from concerns about the project’s viability, low trading volume, regulatory pressures, or a failure to meet the exchange’s listing standards. For KAI and FRONT, Coinone’s specific reasons, while not fully detailed in the initial announcement, align with typical exchange review processes. Key aspects of a delisting: Cessation of Trading: You will no longer be able to buy or sell the delisted asset on that specific exchange. Withdrawal Period: Exchanges usually provide a grace period for users to withdraw their tokens to an external wallet. It is critical to adhere to this timeframe. Market Impact: Delisting from a major exchange can impact the token’s liquidity and price across other platforms. Immediate Impact on KAI and FRONT Holders For individuals currently holding KAI or FRONT on Coinone, the most critical step is to act promptly. The announcement specifies a clear deadline for the Coinone delisting . Actionable Insights for Holders: Check Your Wallet: Verify if you hold KAI or FRONT tokens on your Coinone account. Withdraw Your Assets: It is imperative to withdraw these tokens from Coinone before the October 13 deadline. Failing to do so might result in the permanent loss of access to your funds on that platform. Consider Alternatives: Research other exchanges or decentralized platforms where KAI and FRONT might still be traded. Store Securely: If you plan to hold onto these tokens, transfer them to a secure personal wallet (hardware or software) where you control your private keys. This situation underscores the importance of staying vigilant and proactive in the dynamic crypto space. Always monitor announcements from the exchanges you use. Navigating the Delisting Process: What’s Next? Once KAI and FRONT are delisted, their presence on Coinone will be completely removed. This means no trading pairs, no order books, and eventually, no withdrawal options from the exchange. The challenge for holders often lies in finding new avenues for trading or securely storing their assets. While a Coinone delisting might seem like a setback, it also serves as a reminder for investors to diversify their holdings and not solely rely on a single exchange for specific assets. Remember, the crypto market is known for its volatility and rapid changes. Keeping up-to-date with exchange policies and project developments is a fundamental part of responsible cryptocurrency investing. Final Thoughts on the Coinone Delisting The announcement from Coinone regarding the delisting of KAI and FRONT is a significant event for the respective token communities and Coinone users. It highlights the ever-evolving nature of cryptocurrency exchanges and their stringent listing requirements. For affected investors, the key takeaway is the urgent need to take action by withdrawing assets before the specified deadline. This proactive approach ensures the safety of your digital funds and allows you to explore other options for your KAI and FRONT holdings. Stay informed, stay prepared, and always prioritize the security of your investments in this exciting digital frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does Coinone delisting KAI and FRONT mean for me? A1: It means that after 6:00 a.m. UTC on October 13, you will no longer be able to trade (buy or sell) KAI and FRONT tokens on the Coinone exchange. You must withdraw your tokens before this deadline. Q2: Why did Coinone decide to delist these cryptocurrencies? A2: Exchanges delist tokens for various reasons, including low trading volume, failure to meet listing criteria, project viability concerns, or regulatory issues. While Coinone’s specific reasons for KAI and FRONT were not fully detailed, they typically stem from a review of the asset’s performance and compliance. Q3: What should I do if I have KAI or FRONT tokens on Coinone? A3: You should immediately withdraw your KAI and FRONT tokens from your Coinone account to a personal cryptocurrency wallet or another exchange that supports these assets before the October 13 deadline. Q4: Can I still trade KAI and FRONT after the Coinone delisting? A4: Yes, you might be able to trade KAI and FRONT on other cryptocurrency exchanges or decentralized platforms that still support these tokens. You will need to research and identify such platforms. Q5: What happens if I don’t withdraw my tokens by the deadline? A5: If you fail to withdraw your KAI and FRONT tokens from Coinone by the specified deadline, you risk losing access to them on the Coinone platform. It’s crucial to act before the deadline to secure your assets. Q6: How can I stay informed about future delisting announcements? A6: Always monitor the official announcements section of the cryptocurrency exchanges you use, subscribe to their newsletters, and follow their official social media channels for real-time updates.

FTX and Alameda have reportedly redeemed about 192,000 SOL tokens, valued at roughly $44.9 million. The tokens could be distributed to several wallets before being transferred to exchanges in the coming weeks. “They redeemed 192,000 $SOL from staking, which will likely be distributed and transferred to multiple addresses later today, as usual. Most of these addresses receiving SOL will subsequently transfer the SOL to Coinbase or Binance,” EmberCN wrote . The redemption follows a withdrawal of just under 191 SOL from staking pools a month ago. Per blockchain records on Solscan, the estate still has 4.18 million SOL staked. Billions in Solana already liquidated According to data from Solana’s transactions explorer, the FTX-Alameda staking address has redeemed and transferred a total of 8.98 million SOL since November 2023. The total amount obtained from the transactions was worth $1.2 billion, at an average sale price of $134 per SOL. The estate still holds approximately 4.18 million SOL, currently valued at around $977 million, staked under the estate’s control. Most of the tokens are subject to a four-year vesting schedule. Due to the restrictions, the estate has been selling them gradually through private auctions at discounts to the market price. Buyers in those auctions have included crypto firms such as Galaxy Digital and Pantera Capital. The staked coin redemptions have not negatively affected Solana’s market price. According to CoinGecko, the token went up 6.2% in the past 24 hours to reach $237.71 as of 8:50 AM BST Thursday. Over the past week, Solana has gained more than 14%, recording its lows at $199 on September 6. The beleaguered exchange will make its next round of creditor repayments on September 30, though the estate has not disclosed the size of the payout. BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer are the designated distribution partners to process the repayments. The estate began repaying creditors earlier this year after securing court approval for its redistribution plan. So far, approximately $6.2 billion has been returned to customers across two prior distributions. In February, creditors received $1.2 billion, followed by a $5 billion payout in May. Top exchange turned bankrupt still in US court’s watch FTX was the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume before its collapse in November 2022. The firm’s downfall began after scores of customers and investors, including Binance, rushed to withdraw funds and dented holes in its balance sheet. The company became insolvent and filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. Founder and chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried was later convicted of defrauding customers and investors of more than $11 billion in 2023. The court sentenced him to 25 years in prison, and he’s currently serving his sentence at a transfer facility in Oklahoma. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Tuesday, joint liquidators for failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer, filed a legal notice with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to depose Bankman-Fried under Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 3AC co-founder Zhu Su is accusing him of improperly liquidating $1.5 billion of the fund’s positions without proper justification. Associate Ryne Salame, a former FTX executive, has also been accused of using insider information to front-run trades against customer positions. Those trades allegedly allowed him to cash out more than $1 billion before the exchange collapsed. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The token has reached Phase 6 of its presale, raising $15,600,000 and attracting 16,220 holders since launch. Its current price is $0.035, a 250% increase from the first phase entry at $0.01. Phase 6 is already underway and selling out quickly, with Phase 7 set to raise the price by 14.3% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is projected to launch at $0.06, which translates to returns ranging between 300% and 500% for those participating now. Consequently, many are naming it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Borrowing And Liquidity Safeguards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been structuring its protocol around lending efficiency. The borrow interest rate is being determined by utilization, meaning interest charges increase when liquidity is low, prompting repayments and encouraging new deposits. This balance ensures pools remain active without locking up idle assets. Moreover, the protocol is supporting stable rate borrowing for users seeking predictable repayment costs. While these stable rates start higher than variable ones, they offer security against sudden market spikes. In addition, the platform has designed a liquidation process to preserve solvency. If collateral values drop below thresholds, liquidators can purchase discounted assets to repay part of the debt. This mechanism keeps borrower positions safe and shields the protocol from imbalance. Security And Presale Progress The security record of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is strengthening confidence in its presale. CertiK has completed an audit, awarding a 95.00 score and confirming no vulnerabilities in its contracts. Moreover, Mutuum Finance has unveiled a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with four reward tiers, incentivizing ongoing security testing by external security researchers. Community participation is also being spurred with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners are projected to split the reward pool with the winning $10,000 MUTM tokens. Phase 6 is an important time point as the tokens keep selling at a rapid pace. The $0.06 launch price means those who get in at $0.035 are in for solid returns once the token lists. Roadmap Utility And Long-Term Value The protocol design of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) includes multiple safeguards that aim to secure demand beyond its presale. Enhanced collateral efficiency is being applied to stable pairs where users can take out more loans against correlated assets like stablecoins while retaining a low level of systemic risk. Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation triggers are being adjusted against volatility, so that lending conditions are safer in different asset classes. Moreover, the platform is planning a strong price discovery system with Chainlink oracles in combination with fallbacks feeds and aggregated data sources. Market volatility remains an ever-present challenge, but Mutuum Finance is embedding reserve factors and liquidity incentives to sustain balance during sharp price movements. These technical foundations are coinciding with aggressive growth. The presale price increases across phases, ending at $0.06, indicate a structured approach to valuation. The team’s progress in audit completion, security programs, and community engagement is building trust ahead of launch. Looking Ahead To 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been combining security, structured lending models, and clear presale growth to stand out in the current crypto market. The presale has already raised more than 15 million, and more than 16,000 holders are in the mix. Current buyers at $0.035 are pegged for 300% to 500% returns at launch, indicating high levels of early support. Moreover, some of the initiatives such as the leaderboard rewards, bug bounty, and giveaway illustrate active community focus. For those asking what crypto to buy in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to get talked about more and more. Its presale momentum, audited framework and lending mechanics are shaping its position as one of the best cryptos to buy now.

51595708,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=820702,1757671229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51595708.jpeg,"Dogecoin RSI Signal Returns—Last Time It Sparked A 1,700% Rally",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-rsi-signal-returns-last-time-1700-rally/,"Dogecoin is approaching a familiar inflection on the monthly chart that previously preceded its most explosive advances, according to a new high-timeframe analysis from Kevin (Kev Capital TA) published on September 11. The analyst argues that a fresh stochastic RSI (stoch RSI) cross to the upside on the monthly timeframe—now forming but not yet above the 20 threshold—echoes the technical regime that fueled Dogecoin’s prior cycle blow-offs. Dogecoin Explosion Imminent? “Back in February 2017, Dogecoin got a V-shaped stock RSI cross above the 20 level and it went on another rally… 1,852%,” he said, adding that a subsequent monthly cross “produced a very nice 1,751% gain” before the market ultimately topped. The setup, he contends, is again coalescing into Q4. The framework is deliberately simple: pair the monthly stoch RSI with the monthly RSI and an anchored trend structure. In the 2015–2017 cycle, sustained stoch RSI crosses above 20 were the dividing line between failed bear-market feints and true bull-cycle advances. By contrast, a 2019 impulse rally faded because “the stock RSI never really got a durable cross to the upside,” occurring amid a still-dominant bear regime, he noted. In the 2020–2021 cycle, a new stoch RSI bull cross above 20 “goes on its major bull market rally, which was the biggest rally Dogecoin has ever been on.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.50? This Channel Break Could Be The Catalyst Kevin says the present cycle has followed a cleaner sequence than prior ones. After a confirmed monthly stoch RSI bull cross earlier in the cycle, Dogecoin delivered an initial advance “roughly 280%,” then, following a corrective phase, another monthly cross powered a “November-December rally” of about “497%.” The market then reset again. Today, he sees that process restarting: “We are getting a monthly stock RSI cross again. However, we have not yet crossed the 20 level. So this is the very beginning stages of a potential rally for Dogecoin.” He emphasizes that historically, “you don’t even get your most bullish price action until the stock RSIs are above the 80 level,” calling the current moment the “first or second inning.” Beyond momentum, the analyst highlights a three-part structural confluence he considers critical on the monthly chart. First, the RSI itself has repeatedly crossed back above its moving average at inflection points; second, each of those RSI/MA recaptures “has coincided with a stock RSI cross to the upside”; third, price has defended a long-running trend line on a series of higher lows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Adam And Eve Pattern Teases Explosive Breakout: Here’s The Price Target After a brief deviation below, “we’re now breaking back above the trend line and the [RSI] MA at the same time after holding the 50 level,” which he describes as a textbook double-bottom reaction. He stresses that monthly closes still matter—“we still have… more than half a month to go… this is not guaranteed”—but the multi-indicator alignment is intact. In his words, “we’re talking about a combination of indicators and technicals that have never failed before,” provided the macro backdrop doesn’t flip adverse. Macro Conditions Need To Align Macro is the caveat and, potentially, the accelerator. Kevin frames US monetary policy as the decisive driver of the crypto risk cycle: “Monetary policy… that’s the earnings report for the crypto market.” He argues that inflation has been range-bound on a year-long view while labor data “continues to soften,” a mix he believes anchors expectations for rate cuts “this month… and… in November and December.” If that path holds and the Federal Reserve’s tone is dovish at the upcoming FOMC, he expects Bitcoin dominance to drift lower and for “alt season” dynamics to reassert, with Dogecoin positioned to “outperform over Bitcoin.” Conversely, a hawkish turn or a renewed inflation drift higher would be a “major hiccup” for the setup. Seasonality and timing also figure in his risk management guidance. September remains “seasonally weak,” and with the FOMC roughly a week away from his recording date, he anticipates choppier, indecisive price action in the near term while markets “sit back and wait for the tone of Powell.” The higher-timeframe roadmap, however, remains his anchor: monthly uptrend structure, RSI reclaim over its MA, stoch RSI in early-stage turn, and the historical tendency for major Dogecoin expansions to ignite only after those momentum gauges push well into overdrive. “These charts are telling us right in our faces that Dogecoin is preparing for a bigger move higher… the pathway is laid,” he said. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.261.

51595791,579749,1757671248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51595791.jpeg,World’s Largest Solana Treasury Is Here—$1.65 Billion Fuel For SOL Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/worlds-largest-solana-treasury-1-65-billion-fuel/,"A $1.65 billion war chest for Solana is now live in public markets. Forward Industries (NASDAQ: FORD) closed one of the largest PIPE financings in crypto to date—funded entirely in cash and stablecoins—to establish what sponsors call “the world’s largest Solana digital asset treasury strategy,” with proceeds earmarked primarily to purchase SOL and then actively deploy it across staking, lending and other on-chain strategies. The deal was led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital; the trio collectively subscribed for more than $300 million. As part of the transaction, Multicoin’s Kyle Samani was appointed chairman of Forward’s board, while Galaxy President/CIO Chris Ferraro and Jump Crypto CIO Saurabh Sharma joined as board observers. Galaxy And Partners Build Largest Solana Treasury Galaxy framed the move as infrastructure-first, not passive exposure. In a newsroom post, the firm wrote: “This will create the world’s largest Solana digital asset treasury strategy , which will use the proceeds for the purchase of SOL… This initiative is not about passive exposure. It is about building institutional-grade infrastructure, deploying capital at scale, and demonstrating Solana’s unmatched ability to support the full spectrum of financial activity—from trading and settlement to staking, lending, and beyond.” Forward’s SEC-filed press release codifies the mechanics. It confirms the $1.65 billion in gross proceeds, the use of net proceeds “primarily to purchase SOL,” and the governance changes, including Samani’s elevation to chairman. The filing also itemizes a roster of additional participants across funds and founders, and discloses that Cantor Fitzgerald served as lead placement agent with Galaxy Investment Banking as co-placement agent and advisor. Sponsors are explicit that Forward will operate the treasury, not just hold it. Galaxy’s note describes an “alpha generation” approach designed to compound SOL-per-share faster than simple token appreciation, leveraging Galaxy’s prime and validator stack, Jump’s trading and infrastructure edge (including the Firedancer client effort), and Multicoin ’s strategy design. Forward’s release mirrors that ambition: “By establishing a Solana treasury, Forward Industries is positioning itself to benefit from one of the fastest-growing blockchain networks… through staking, lending, and market making strategies.” Two execution variables will shape market impact. First is purchase routing: as PIPE proceeds are converted to SOL via a mix of OTC and exchange execution, the cadence and venue choice will determine how much pressure reaches visible spot books versus being absorbed bilaterally. Second is inventory utilization: staking raises headline yields but reduces liquid float; lending and market-making recycle inventory into liquidity pools, affecting borrow rates, basis and depth around key levels. In all cases, a capitalized, mandate-driven public-company buyer represents a durable incremental bid for SOL—one that tends to register first in derivatives funding, borrow and staking-rate regimes before settling into spot. On-chain flow watchers are already tracking execution footprints. Lookonchain reported late Thursday via X: “Galaxy Digital is helping Forward Industries acquire $1.65B worth of $SOL… In the past 12 hours, Galaxy Digital has withdrawn 1,452,392 $SOL ($326M) from exchanges,” citing Arkham entity data and linking to Forward’s SEC exhibit. Early Friday morning, Lookonchain added: “Galaxy Digital just bought another 706,790 SOL($160M). In the past 24 hours, their total buy has been a massive 2,159,182 SOL($486M).” Market reaction has been quick. SOL is up about 6% over the past 24 hours, leading major caps on the day at press time.",Solana|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana news|Solana price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 10:00:48

The DigiTap presale has already ignited excitement because it blends real-world utility with huge growth potential. DigiTap is the world’s first omni-bank, a platform that unites fiat banking and crypto under one roof. It’s a functioning ecosystem designed to scale and perfect for a new era of flexible, borderless finance. Aside from having a working product, it is smart contract audited, KYC-friendly, and highly secure with 2FA, biometric logins, and multi-sig wallets. This is highly significant given the recent $1.4 billion ByBit hack . In August 2025 alone, over $173 million was lost across a variety of crypto hacks and phishing incidents. Only legitimate presales should be considered. The Case for 100x Returns Why do analysts believe DigiTap could deliver 100x ROI, as the best crypto to invest in today? The answer lies mainly in its tokenomics and timing. Scarcity-Driven Value —TAP has a fixed supply of 2 billion and integrates multiple burn mechanisms. Every transaction generates revenue, with 50% used to buy back and burn TAP. Over time, this reduces supply, resulting in consistent upward pressure on price. Sustainable Staking Rewards —DigiTap offers up to 124% APR during presale, dropping to sustainable levels post-launch. Rewards come from a pre-allocated pool, not endless minting. Massive Market Opportunity —the digital payments market is projected to reach $18.7 trillion by 2030, and DigiTap is tapping into one of the fastest-growing sectors in finance. Add in the fact that 78% of crypto users want seamless fiat ramps, and it’s clear why demand could surge. Finished Product —many projects raise millions but struggle to ship. DigiTap flips this script. The app is already live, meaning users can experience the bank–crypto bridge today. That readiness sets DigiTap apart from presale competitors chasing hype coins. Aside from incentives and timing, it has a huge market use case. The world is fed up with traditional financial systems. Excessive fees, no support, costs for everything, frozen cards, and no interoperability will no longer be tolerated by people who want to spend and travel in a borderless world. People want more control over their finances through one unified platform. Who Benefits from DigiTap? DigiTap has a slew of use cases. Anybody who makes payments can benefit from the app. Classes of people who might be interested in this application include: Freelancers & SMEs saving up to 6.2% on cross-border payments. Nomads & travelers seeking borderless banking. Privacy-conscious professionals protecting wealth. Crypto newcomers who are intimidated by wallets and keys (but comfortable with a banking-style interface). This broad user base positions DigiTap as more than a niche app. It’s a mainstream contender for global adoption. Unlike many crypto platforms that either ignore regulations or compromise on user privacy, DigiTap balances both and even builds on legacy frameworks. Its offshore banking integration allows for regulated privacy and asset protection, an offering virtually no competitor can match. For investors considering the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2025, DigiTap presents a rare chance to enter a project that is both regulatory-ready and privacy-first. DigiTap Presale Momentum is Growing If you’re wondering what is the best cryptocurrency to buy right now, DigiTap’s combination of real-world utility, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and staking yields makes it a strong candidate. The narrative is straightforward: DigiTap already works. It’s not a roadmap dream. It’s a live product with global scalability, supported by tokenomics designed to fuel growth. In an industry hungry for the next 100x project, DigiTap has the fundamentals to deliver.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis September has so far been a fantastic month for Bitcoin, with the token up nearly 6.5%. Yesterday’s fat green candle saw the token reclaim the $115K level, putting it on course to capture $117K – the next major resistance level, where the token previously nosedived nearly 9%. Even better, key momentum indicators are now flashing bullish on the daily BTC chart. For instance, the 10 EMA has just crossed above the 20 EMA, signaling that Bitcoin is firmly in bullish territory. That said, it wouldn’t be surprising if the token takes a small breather now. After all, the price is a long way out from the 20, 50, and even the 10 EMA on the daily chart – which usually indicates a pullback could be in store. This, in fact, would be another bullish signal, as it would set Bitcoin up nicely for an explosive breakout once the rate cut announcement takes place next week. From Accumulation to Acceleration: Bitcoin Hyper’s Moment September 12, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 $BTC, known as ‘sharks’, have hit an all-time high . These mid-tier holders added 93K $BTC over the past month, signaling strong conviction and a potential setup for a major price move. With ETF demand surging and exchange reserves at record lows , Bitcoin’s supply squeeze is intensifying. Historically, this kind of accumulation has preceded bull runs. If the trend continues, $BTC could be gearing up for its next breakout. For Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , now in presale, this is the perfect storm. Offering sub-second transactions, dApp access via wrapped $BTC, and real scalability, $HYPER is built to accelerate Bitcoin’s rise. If BTC hits $150K–$200K as predicted, and Bitcoin Hyper delivers on its Layer-2 roadmap, $HYPER could be the next 1000x crypto . Get in before the breakout for just $0.012895 a token Analysts Predict ETH to Touch $6800 by Year End – Why Bitcoin Hyper Could Outperform September 12, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Strong accumulation trends indicate that ETH’s sideways trading will soon make way for a parabolic run. While CryptoQuant charts show strong long-term positioning in ETH, the CME open interest data points toward growing institutional demand. ETH may be heading into another crypto rally, potentially sending its price to $6800 by year-end, according to crypto analyst PelinayPA . While the alt season is predicted to be dominated by Ethereum, another top crypto has been stealing its thunder. Over the last few days, Bitcoin Hyper has been attracting strong whale demand, as its upcoming Bitcoin layer-2 solution sparks FOMO. Price predictions hint at a 28x gain from its final presale price, hitting $0.32 by the end of 2025.

September 12, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Dogecoin just ripped 22% this week, climbing to $0.2621 after CleanCore Solutions dropped over $125M into $DOGE , and ETF hype hit a new high. Rex-Osprey’s upcoming ETF , ticker $DOJE, now expected to launch next Thursday, has prediction markets betting hard on $DOGE hitting $0.30 in response. While $DOGE courts institutional love, $MAXI is grinding in presale with over $2M raised and a community that trades like it lifts – hard and heavy Unlike $DOGE with its infinite supply and slow PoW chain, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is built for degens who demand more from their memes: capped supply (150.24B), staking with 156% APY, verified audits, and the advantage of Ethereum’s fast PoS chain. Is this the next crypto to explode ? Projecting a potential ROI of 774% by the end of the year, $MAXI price predictions suggest it just may be. Presale’s live with tokens going for a low $0.000257. Don’t skip this rep. Solana Gets a $1.65B Cash Infusion As $SNORT Becomes the Next Crypto to Explode September 12, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Medical device company Forward Industries has made a colossal $1.65B bet on Solana ($SOL). It’s a strategic private placement endorsed by crypto heavyweights like Galaxy Digital , a move that saw Forward Industries’ stock soar 6%. The institutional money is a clear vote of confidence, arriving as Solana’s market indicators are flashing green. Technical charts are forming a pattern that often precedes a major breakout, with some daring to forecast a leap to $1K . And while everyone’s talking about Solana’s rally, it’s not surprising that it’ll bring attention to a nifty tool that aims to make trading a whole lot easier, which starts on the Solana network. It’s the Snorter Bot, powered by its Snorter Token ($SNORT) . It’s a powerful trading tool enabling sniping of new tokens, copy trading, and reduced transaction fees, really putting power back in the hands of everyday investors. You could see a potential return of 802% if you invest at today’s price and it reaches our end-of-2025 $0.94 price prediction.

South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has issued an important announcement concerning the Polygon network . Effective 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 16, Upbit will temporarily suspend all deposits and withdrawals for assets operating on the Polygon network . This crucial step is in preparation for a planned hard fork on the network, ensuring the security and stability of user funds. Understanding such updates is vital for anyone engaged in the dynamic world of digital assets. Why is Upbit Suspending Polygon Network Services? A hard fork is a significant upgrade to a blockchain’s protocol. Imagine a major software update that requires all participants to adopt new rules. For the Polygon network , this upcoming hard fork aims to introduce improvements and enhancements, ensuring its continued efficiency and security. Exchanges like Upbit temporarily halt services during such events to safeguard user assets. This proactive measure prevents potential issues from transactions occurring across two different versions of the blockchain during the transition. It’s a standard, responsible practice in crypto, prioritizing the safety of your digital holdings. What Does the Polygon Network Hard Fork Mean for You? If you hold assets on Upbit that utilize the Polygon network , this suspension directly affects your ability to move those funds. Here’s what you need to know: During the Suspension: You cannot deposit new assets via the Polygon network to your Upbit account. Withdrawals of existing Polygon network assets from Upbit will also be unavailable. Trading of these assets on Upbit will likely continue as normal, as the suspension only affects transfers in and out. Your assets are safe. The suspension is a precautionary measure, not an indication of any compromise. It’s a temporary pause on transfer functionalities while the network undergoes essential upgrades. Navigating the Upbit Suspension: Actionable Steps While temporary, proactive steps help manage your crypto holdings. Consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Check Upbit’s official announcements for updates on the hard fork progress and when services for the Polygon network are expected to resume. Plan Ahead: If you planned to move Polygon network assets around September 16, adjust your schedule. Complete urgent transfers before the suspension or wait until services are restored. Review Your Portfolio: Use this opportunity to review your crypto portfolio. Understanding where your assets are held and on which networks prepares you for similar future events. These simple steps help avoid unexpected disruptions to your crypto activities. The Future of the Polygon Network and Upbit Services Hard forks, while causing temporary disruptions, are vital for blockchain evolution. The Polygon network remains a crucial layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions. These upgrades are essential for its long-term viability and growth. Once the hard fork is successfully implemented and the network stabilizes, Upbit is expected to swiftly reinstate deposit and withdrawal services. This temporary inconvenience paves the way for a more robust and efficient Polygon network , ultimately benefiting its users. Staying informed empowers you as a crypto participant, reflecting Upbit’s commitment to user security during network transitions. In essence, Upbit’s temporary suspension of Polygon network deposits and withdrawals is a necessary step for a smooth hard fork transition. While it requires a brief pause, it underscores the exchange’s dedication to a secure trading environment. Keep an eye on official announcements for service resumption, and rest assured your assets remain protected throughout this essential upgrade. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a hard fork for the Polygon network? A hard fork is a significant, backward-incompatible upgrade to the Polygon network protocol, implementing new features and enhancing performance. All network participants must update their software. Q2: When will Upbit resume Polygon network services? The suspension starts Sept. 16, 9:00 a.m. UTC. Resumption will be announced by Upbit after the Polygon network hard fork is stable. Monitor official Upbit channels for updates. Q3: Are my Polygon network assets on Upbit safe? Yes, your assets are safe. The suspension is a precautionary measure by Upbit to protect funds during the hard fork transition, preventing potential issues.

As of Friday, September 12, 2025 (mid-session), the ledger had burned 190 XRP in transaction fees; even if the day fills out, it will remain abnormally light. For context, Thursday, September 11 finished at just 549 XRP, already one of the weakest daily prints of 2025 and consistent with the downtrend you see on the one-year “XRP burned as fees” chart, as per data retrieved by Finbold from XRPscan . XRP 1-year burned as fees chart. Source: XRPscan To understand why this matters, remember how XRP’s fee mechanics work. Every XRP Ledger transaction destroys a tiny amount of XRP (the “base fee,” 10 drops = 0.00001 XRP) and that fee scales up temporarily when the ledger is under load. When activity is quiet, the fee reverts to the minimum; when the ledger gets busy, it nudges higher to deter spam. In other words, the total XRP burned is a real-time proxy for both transaction count and moment-to-moment congestion. When burn collapses, it usually means fewer transactions and fees sitting near the minimum. What drove the massive spike on December 2, 2024? The towering outlier on December 2, 2024, when the ledger burned ~17,339 XRP in a single day. Two overlapping forces explain that surge. Protocol change that day: XRPL validators approved a 90% reduction in the ledger’s reserve requirements (the XRP you must lock to open an account or hold certain objects), and the change took effect on December 2. While the base per-transaction fee did not change, the reserve cut triggered heightened on-chain housekeeping, account actions, trust-line adjustments, and liquidity shuffles, which pushed activity (and thus aggregate burn) sharply higher around the switchover. Likewise, the same day, XRP was breaking to a multi-year price high ($2.50) after a strong run, which tends to pull trading and settlement on-chain. That combination, a structural ledger change plus a price/volume spike is exactly the recipe that produces a one-day burn extreme. 2025 reveals a clean downtrend in network load From spring into late summer 2025, your one-year chart shows lower highs and lower lows in daily burn. Reading through the fee model, that pattern says two things at once. Firstly, the ledger is rarely hitting congestion thresholds that would push the per-transaction fee above 10 drops, and secondly, aggregate transaction counts have faded versus the bursts seen around the AMM launch cycle and the December reserve change. That backdrop explains today’s ultralow readings. Because the XRP Ledger destroys a sliver of XRP on every transaction, the burn metric remains one of the cleanest, low-latency gauges of usage on XRPL. If activity re-accelerates, whether due to market volatility, feature upgrades, or renewed DEX/AMM flows, you’ll see it first in a rising burn baseline and more frequent congestion bumps as the dynamic fee ratchets above 10 drops. Conversely, if the baseline stays pinned near today’s levels, it signals that utility demand is subdued and fees are clearing at the floor.

MVRV Data Suggests Yes,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoins-bull-market-redefining-itself-as-staircase-style-mvrv-data-suggests-yes/,"Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has once again slipped below its 365-day simple moving average (SMA365), which has raised questions about whether the current cycle is deviating from historical norms. A new report now suggests that the market is evolving into a “staircase-like” bull cycle defined by gradual corrections. Has Bitcoin Outgrown Parabolic Runs? Traditionally, during bull markets, MVRV tends to stay above this level except in cases of extreme “Black Swan” events. This trend largely held until 2024, when the introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs and a surge in institutional inflows appeared to alter market dynamics. That year, MVRV dipped under SMA365 twice, but each time rebounded quickly and coincided with Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs. CryptoQuant found that the market is now facing a third test of this pattern. Analysts note that today’s US inflation data supports expectations for three Federal Reserve rate cuts before the end of 2025, which is a dovish outlook that could provide the catalyst for MVRV to reclaim higher ground. If history repeats, this could set the stage for fresh highs before year-end. Market observers suggest that Bitcoin’s bull cycle has pivoted toward a more “staircase-like” structure, with measured advances and corrections, rather than the sharp parabolic rallies seen in past cycles. Derivatives Signals Healthier Market Structure A similar trend is seen across derivatives as activity in this sector takes center stage in the Bitcoin market. In fact, Glassnode found that futures and options are helping absorb selling while guiding price action. For instance, the Volume Delta Bias, which tracks deviations of cumulative volume delta from its 90-day median, rebounded at $108K and indicated broad seller fatigue across platforms such as Binance and Bybit. Even as prices saw a modest uptick, the 3-month annualized futures basis remains under 10%, hinting at steady leverage demand and a market leaning toward accumulation rather than speculative extremes. The immediate test lies at $114,000, a level seen as crucial for restoring market confidence and drawing in new inflows. If BTC manages to hold this level, it could affirm the strength of this bull phase, while a drop below risks renewed stress for short-term holders, and ultimately exposes downside targets around $108,000 and $93,000, respectively.

At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $168 billion. TLDR: The crypto market saw a 1.5% rise on Friday morning (UTC); 92 of the top 100 coins stand green, including all top 10 coins, with SOL leading; BTC and ETH are up to $115,350 and $4,548, respectively; ’The market is entering a volatility contraction’; ’Inflationary pressure may be creeping back in’; US BTC spot ETFs recorded inflows of $552.78 million, while US ETH ETFs took in $113.12 million; ’The smart money appears to be rotating back into BTC’; Galaxy Digital has reportedly acquired 2.31 million SOL; Gemini Space Station’s IPO saw $425 million on Thursday; Caution persists among investors, but there is a notable increase in bullish sentiment. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have increased over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) appreciated another 1.1% at the time of writing, currently trading at $115,350. This is the smallest increase in the category. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 1y Ethereum (ETH) is up by 2.3%, now trading at $4,548. It’s the third-best gainer in the category. The best performer is Solana (SOL) , which is up 7.1%, now trading at $238. It’s followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) , having gone up 4.8%, currently standing at $0.2617. When it comes to the top 100 coins, 92 are up at the time of writing. One of these recorded a double-digit increase. Provenance Blockchain (HASH) is up 29.9% to $0.04028. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) follows with 9.6%, trading at $0.03791.

Notably, Gemini Space Station’s initial public offering (IPO) saw $425 million late Thursday, becoming one of the strongest debuts for a digital asset platform. The IPO was reportedly over 20 times oversubscribed. Crypto exchange @Gemini saw its IPO explode with $425M raised and demand 20x supply, making it one of crypto’s hottest market debuts. #Gemini #CryptoIPO https://t.co/gAsT2EN1JK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 12, 2025 ‘Smart Money Rotating Back Into BTC’ Nick Forster, founder at on-chain options platform Derive.xyz, noted that the markets spiked on the expected news of 2.9% US CPI data. However, they “quickly cooled before reverting to broader trends. Still, the print signals inflationary pressure may be creeping back in, particularly under the weight of new tariff regimes.” That said, both BTC and ETH have increased “despite the brief CPI-induced turbulence.” Under the surface, Forster writes, “ETH’s implied volatility has hit multi-week lows across the board. The current term structure shows compressed pricing for all expiries, a classic sign that the market is entering a volatility contraction. Historically, these don’t last long. When vol expands again, it tends to do so sharply.” On the other hand, ETF flows are showing a divergence, he says. ETH inflows “have slowed considerably,” and BTC institutional buying spiked. “The smart money appears to be rotating back into BTC, possibly taking a breather from ETH beta after its recent run.” Meanwhile, the probability of BTC hitting $125,000 by the end of October has jumped from 40% to 52%, while the chance of ETH hitting $6,000 in the same period fell from 23% to 19%. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Friday morning, BTC trades at $115,350. Over the last 24 hours, the coin saw movement between the low of $113,496 and the high of $116,309, dropping slightly to the current level. The coin is now just 7.1% away from its all-time high of $124,128 recorded 29 days ago. Bitcoin is consolidating near $114,497. A firm move above $115,411, the price could continue climbing further to $117,150 and $118,617. A drop below that level could lead to a pullback to $113,000 or $110,000. Bitcoin Price Chart.

It’s now down 8.4% from the ATH of $4,946. It’s up 4.6% in a week and down 2.2% in a month. ETH could continue climbing towards its ATH. A breakout above $4,600 could lead to $4,750 and $4,900. On the other hand, it may slide back to $4,400 and $4,200. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 1y Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has seen another increase within the neutral zone over the past day. The crypto fear and greed index went up from 47 yesterday to 50 today . This is also a rise from 40 since the beginning of this year. This indicates persistent healthy caution among investors, but also a continual rise in bullish sentiment.

Some 4.18 million SOL, worth an estimated $977 million, still remains staked. Notably, Galaxy Digital has reportedly acquired 2.31 million SOL , valued at nearly $536 million. The tokens were transferred to Galaxy from Binance, Bybit, and Coinbase wallets. Galaxy Digital just bought another 706,790 $SOL ($160M). In the past 24 hours, their total buy is a massive 2,159,182 $SOL ($486M). https://t.co/OFLLaSJQdS pic.twitter.com/RUoK7NXZMM — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 12, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? The crypto market has increased over the past day, as the stock market recorded some record highs on its previous day of trading. By the closing time on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up by 0.85%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.36%. Thursday’s US consumer inflation data was as expected, while the Producer Price Index released a day earlier showed that wholesale prices surprisingly dropped in August. The data boosted the stock market, with the expectation of rate cuts next week. Is this rally sustainable? The market is still consolidating, but the current rally may persist in the short term. That said, further pullbacks are likely before the next significant pullback expected by investors, traders, analysts, and industry insiders alike.

Crypto investing experts are now keeping a keen eye on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fast-changing DeFi project that is performing well with its novel lending mechanism and enticingly high returns. This tiny altcoin, which is worth just $0.035, has been invested in by more than 16,220 investors. While the near-term future of XRP remains mired in regulation battles and overall sentiment in the markets, Mutuum Finance has emerged in the milieu of price prediction as the project with the most clearly delineated path to outsized returns, with some even estimating a 25x return on investment. XRP Price Prediction Snapshot Ripple (XRP) is at $2.97 with intraday movement of $2.94–$3.03. Ripple remains in a fragile consolidation area within the range of $2.80–$3.05, where a decisive move above $3.05 can unlock $3.40–$3.50 in the short term. Analysts anticipate that with increasing regulatory certainty and institutional inflows, particularly via ETFs, XRP will continue to spearhead gains into the $4–$8 range in later 2025. As XRP continues along this trajectory, investor attention is also on novel decentralized finance possibilities, including Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 FOMO Investors are presently purchasing MUTM tokens at $0.035 in Stage 6 presale. Holding on until Stage 7 will cost an additional 14.3% per token. The token has been amassed by over 16,220 investors thus far and has drawn over $15.6 million in funding, a clear indication of strong market demand and interest. Price Discovery Real-time price data is needed to make borrowing, lending, and liquidation secure. Mutuum Finance uses chainlink oracles to feed the system with market prices in USD and native tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite feed data, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange rates are also used by the system for valuations to be as accurate during times of stress. Volatility in the market is communicated to collateral management within the protocol. Mutuum Finance makes a distinction in Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation levels according to the stability of each token. The allowance and value to borrow are increased for stronger and more stable tokens, and riskier tokens are assigned lower values. Reserve multipliers are distributed proportionally over a range of 10% for low-volatility assets to 35% for risk assets, giving room for a default protection margin without diversification constraint participation. The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol allows users to make active control of their capital with passive lending and borrowing, with the potential of allowing borrowers to borrow over stacks of securitised assets. System stability algorithm and interest rate optimisation algorithm are built into the system, with the potential of enabling the system to be efficient and long-term capital utilisation. Risk and Liquidity Management The protocol actively controls market volatility and liquidity to enable the closure of problematic positions. Exposure to risk is needed within established boundaries, and liquidation parameters are established. Collateral assets such as ETH and stablecoins may offer extra levels of Loan-to-Value, and riskier assets are funded by lower ones. Reserve factors are pro-rata assigned to all classes of tokens to control asset opportunity vs. risk in a way to maximize overall protection of protocol holdings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the preferred option for investors looking for oversized returns over Ripple (XRP). Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, with Stage 7 to increase by 14.3% to $0.04. Already, over 16,220+ buyers have invested over $15.6M, demonstrating strong market demand. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, Chainlink oracle integration, and advanced risk/liquidity controls, MUTM provides innovation and security. With XRP stuck at $2.97 with not much short-term wiggle room, analysts foresee MUTM to deliver 25x ROI as it becomes the star of DeFi. Be a part of Stage 6 today before prices increase in the upcoming round of presales.

The project team acknowledged concerns regarding its non-native nature to HYPE. The Ethereum-based protocol’s decision followed a series of active discussions between the project team, validators, and the community, which raised several concerns about its alignment with Hyperliquid’s ecosystem. Three key things were picked from the discussion, including Ethena not being a Hyperliquid-native project, it operates additional product lines outside its USDH stablecoin , and its ambitious extension beyond a single partner. Native Markets wins community support over Ethena Guy Young, founder of Ethena, acknowledged that the community’s concerns were valid, and they accepted the pushback. He confirmed that they were stepping down to allow validators to direct their support to something else. He also extended congratulations to the Native Markets project, which secured the community’s backing. The last few days have been incredible to witness. I've never seen a community rally around and engage with passion like this before. Following direct discussions with individuals in the community and validators we have taken onboard some of the concerns, namely: -Ethena is not… — G | Ethena (@gdog97_) September 11, 2025 Ethena acknowledged that Native Markets’ success showed the ethos of the Hyperliquid community, where emerging players can gain trust and traction regardless of size, background, and financial resources. The firm defended Native Markets’ credibility, which had received criticism over questions of credibility. The Ethereum-based protocol message showed that Native Markets’ platform-level playing field allows any project to win community support when it shows vision and commitment. Young expressed gratitude towards those who supported its proposal , describing it as a privilege and a testament to the growing quality of teams in the space. He also acknowledged other teams’ proposals as further proof of the ecosystem’s rising standards. The Ethena project team reiterated that the company roadmap remains unchanged, emphasizing that it will continue to build new products in collaboration with native teams. In the previous plan, Ethena downplayed the role of T-bill yields, stressing that taking small returns in a declining interest rate environment was the least interesting part of its proposal. The team, however, reiterated its focus on building advanced products and infrastructure to strengthen Hyperliquid. “We are simply going to do everything we said we would; we will be putting our full force behind making that a success, despite the outcome here.” -Guy Young, founder of Ethena The Ethereum-based protocol reaffirmed its competitive stance in the market and promised to continue striving to outpace rivals through product innovation. Ethena’s USDe hits $13.12B market cap, maintaining third position USDe, Ethena’s stablecoin, has increased its market cap to $13.12 billion, with a circulating supply of 13.19 billion USDe. The stablecoin has maintained position three against other issuers behind Tether USDT and USDC by market cap. Tether USDT leads with a circulating supply of approximately 169 billion USDT, followed by USDC’s approximately 72 billion. However, not everyone is convinced of Ethena’s strategy. Cryptopolitan reported recently that the S&P Global flagged USDe as carrying higher risk scores due to its dependence on derivatives. Chaos Labs also raised concerns over possible rehypothecation and liquidity strains if funding rates go outside the normal range. USDe uses strategies that combine stablecoin issuance with DeFi yield loops. Some on-chain protocols, such as Aave and Pendle, have enabled recursive lending, which increases returns for issuers like USDe. It allows users to deposit USDe, borrow against it, and redeploy the proceeds into additional yield-generating positions, compounding the proceeds. Hyperliquid’s token HYPE on the other hand has recorded a price increase of 3.52% today, trading at $56.25. It has a market cap of 18.78 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $614 million. The token has a circulating supply of 333.92 million HYPE according to CoinMarketCap data .

With Solana gaining serious ground and on-chain activity rising rapidly , Mike Novogratz has endorsed the blockchain, claiming that its design sets it apart for financial market dominance. Solana Gains Big Endorsement From Mike Novogratz The Solana blockchain is taking the spotlight and receiving notable attention in the blockchain sector, with many prominent figures heavily endorsing the network. Mike Novogratz , a billionaire and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Galaxy Digital, has thrown his weight behind the blockchain, placing it ahead of other major chains in the financial landscape. Offering his insights on Solana, Novogratz boldly described it as a blockchain uniquely suited for the demands of financial markets globally. The CEO made the bold declaration in a recent interview on the CNBC SquawkBox, shared by CryptosRus on the social media platform X. His latest bullish remarks support the blockchain’s growing reputation among big investors and businesses. Furthermore, it shows that blockchain is becoming increasingly seen by seasoned traditional market experts as the foundation of future capital markets. Novograts, who is well-known for his optimistic views on transformational digital assets, emphasized Solana ‘s cost-effectiveness, scalability, and speed as crucial benefits that establish it as an infrastructure layer for financial markets. As highlighted by the Galaxy Digital CEO, the total transactions executed on the Solana blockchain on a daily basis are about 14 billion. According to the billionaire, this exceeds the total transactions recorded in equities, bonds, commodities, and foreign exchange (FX). “So you’ve got a blockchain that’s fast enough and tailor-made for financial markets,” Novogratz added. Amidst this heightened activity and interest in Solana, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Chairman, Paul Atkins, is advocating for building on-chain. In the meantime, Novogratz is confident that the SOL blockchain will lead the future of financial systems. Galaxy Digital On A Massive SOL Buying Spree Prior to Mike Novogratz’s bold declaration, Galaxy Digital has doubled down on SOL with its latest purchases. In another X post , CryptosRus reported that the company is buying the altcoin at an unprecedented rate, signaling robust conviction in its long-term potential. Data shared by CryptosRus shows that the firm purchased 430,000 SOL valued at approximately $97 million in a 1-hour time frame. Meanwhile, Galaxy has ramped up a total of 1.35 million SOL, worth a staggering $302 million in a 12-hour time frame. This massive accumulation by Galaxy Digital reflects the rising institutional interest in SOL despite recent market fluctuations. While the buying spree highlights fresh confidence in SOL’s ecosystem, it is cementing its position as a leader in the dynamic digital asset sector.",Solana|Bonds|CNBC SquawkBox|Commodities|CryptosRus|equities|Foreign Exchange|FX|Galaxy Digital|mike novogratz|Paul Atkins|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana Blockchain|Solana ecosystem|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 11:30:52

Beide Werte profitieren von niedrigen Zinsen, Inflation und weltweiten Unsicherheiten. Doch während Gold seit Jahrtausenden glänzt, stellt Bitcoin die spannende, digitale Alternative dar. Gold ist seit Jahrtausenden der Inbegriff von Sicherheit. Nun mischt sich mit Bitcoin ein digitaler Herausforderer ein, der immer öfter als „Gold des 21. Jahrhunderts“ bezeichnet wird. Beide glänzen – im wörtlichen wie im übertragenen Sinn – gerade mit neuen Rekorden, während die US-Notenbank über Zinssenkungen nachdenkt. Doch wie ähnlich sind sich die beiden Wertspeicher wirklich, und wer hat die besseren Karten für die Zukunft? BTC schießt über 115.000 Dollar Bitcoin sorgt wieder einmal für Aufsehen: Mit einem Sprung über 115.000 Dollar erreichte die Kryptowährung sogar ein Tageshoch von 116.317 Dollar. Anleger jubeln über den fast dreiprozentigen Wochengewinn – doch nicht alle konnten sich freuen. Über 354 Millionen Dollar an gehebelten Positionen wurden ausgelöscht, was viele Trader teuer zu stehen kam. Besonders Short-Seller, die auf fallende Kurse gesetzt hatten, verloren dabei kräftig. Bitcoin’s gold correlation implies a potential rally toward $167K–$185K in the months ahead. – Tephra Digital pic.twitter.com/vjKks7v0yT — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 8, 2025 So zeigt sich einmal mehr, wie nervenaufreibend der Kryptomarkt sein kann. Die starken Bewegungen bringen Chancen, aber auch große Risiken. Während Gold über Jahrhunderte seinen Wert stetig gehalten hat, ist BTC da nochgegen quasi ein junger, wilder Herausforderer. Und doch gilt er für viele bereits als digitaler Wertspeicher der Zukunft. Die Fed als Spielmacher Im Zentrum der aktuellen Rallye steht die US-Notenbank Federal Reserve. Am 17. September entscheidet sie über die nächsten Zinsschritte , und die Märkte rechnen fest mit einer Senkung um 25 Basispunkte. Sogar mehrere Schritte nach unten noch in diesem Jahr sind denkbar. Manche Optimisten spekulieren sogar auf eine Halbierung des Leitzinses. Der Grund: Die US-Wirtschaft schwächelt, vor allem am Arbeitsmarkt. Weniger neue Jobs und korrigierte Zahlen haben den Druck erhöht. Präsident Donald Trump nutzt die Gelegenheit, um Fed-Chef Jerome Powell zu attackieren und fordert noch schnellere Zinssenkungen. Für Anleger bedeutet das: Mehr billiges Geld, das oft in Aktien, Gold – und eben BTC fließt. Diese Lage lässt manche Experten schon von 250k für BTC träumen. Gold glänzt wie seit Jahrzehnten nicht Während BTC digitale Höhen erklimmt, erlebt Gold seinen eigenen Rekordmoment. Inflationsbereinigt steht der Preis erstmals seit den 1980er-Jahren über 3.610 Dollar pro Unze. Mit aktuell rund 3.635 Dollar scheint das Edelmetall so gefragt wie lange nicht. Analysten sprechen vom „Traumszenario“: steigende Inflation plus sinkende Zinsen – besser könnte es für Gold kaum laufen. Ein Blick in die Geschichte zeigt: Gold war immer dann besonders stark, wenn Unsicherheit herrschte. Ob Kriege, Wirtschaftskrisen oder Währungsabwertungen – wer Gold hielt, hatte ein Polster. Heute setzen auch viele Zentralbanken wieder verstärkt darauf. Vor allem Länder wie China, Indien, Russland und die Türkei kaufen massiv Gold, um weniger abhängig vom US-Dollar zu sein. Bitcoin – das Gold der digitalen Generation? Genau hier kommt Bitcoin ins Spiel. Während Gold seit Jahrtausenden glänzt, ist Bitcoin erst 2009 entstanden – und doch nennen viele ihn schon „digitales Gold“. Der Grund: Auch BTC ist knapp, er kann nicht beliebig vermehrt werden. Das macht ihn für viele Anleger zu einem Schutz gegen Inflation, ähnlich wie Gold. Doch es gibt Unterschiede. Gold ist schwer, physisch und oft im Tresor. BTC dagegen ist grenzenlos, jederzeit handelbar und braucht nur eine digitale Wallet. Historisch gesehen war Gold der sichere Hafen, doch BTC bietet eine neue Art von Freiheit – mit mehr Risiko, aber auch mehr Chancen. Und während Goldkäufer früher Münzen oder Barren horteten, speichern junge Anleger ihre BTCs lieber auf dem Smartphone. Blick in die Zukunft Was also bringt die nächste Zeit? Sollte die Fed die Zinsen weiter senken, könnte sowohl Gold als auch Bitcoin profitieren. Gold wirkt dabei wie der Fels in der Brandung, während Bitcoin die Wellen reitet. Doch Vorsicht ist geboten: Technische Indikatoren deuten darauf hin, dass BTCs Höhenflug auch ins Wanken geraten könnte. Anleger stehen daher vor einer spannenden Wahl. Wer Sicherheit sucht, bleibt beim klassischen Gold. Wer mutiger ist und an die digitale Zukunft glaubt, sieht in BTC eine moderne Alternative. Vielleicht werden beide Werte am Ende nicht Konkurrenten, sondern zwei Seiten derselben Medaille: der Suche nach einem sicheren Hafen in unsicheren Zeiten. Bitcoin Hyper – wenn Bitcoin endlich Turbo fährt Bitcoin ist sicher wie ein Tresor, aber im Alltag oft so langsam wie eine Brieftaube. Genau hier kommt Bitcoin Hyper ins Spiel: ein Layer-2, das Bitcoin Beine macht. Mit Hyper wird aus gemütlichem HODLn echtes Handeln – blitzschnell, günstig und vielseitig. Ob Zahlungen, DeFi oder Gaming: durch die Brücke zwischen Bitcoin und Hyper lassen sich BTC im Handumdrehen ins Ökosystem holen und dort frei bewegen.

Looking back to July 2024, a consistent pattern emerges where bitcoin tends to form a bottom for the month within the first 10 days of each month. The notable exceptions were February, June and August 2025, when the lows came later in the month, but even then, the market experienced a correction within those first 10 days before resuming its broader trend. Speculatively, the reason bitcoin often puts in its low within the first 10 days of the month could be tied to institutional portfolio rebalancing or the timing of key macroeconomic events that tend to cluster early in the month. ""It’s worth noting that several futures and options markets expire on the final day of the month or the first day of the next, this can lead to short term volatility and a subsequent lull in trading activity as traders either rollover trades or reposition entirely,” said Oliver Knight, deputy managing editor, data and tokens, at CoinDesk. Of course, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, but as Q4 approaches it is worth noting that this quarter has historically been bitcoin’s strongest, delivering an average return of 85%. October in particular has been especially favorable, with only two losing months since 2013.",Markets|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-12 11:37:36

The asset recorded a 1.13% increase in the past 24 hours, suggesting that investors are positioning themselves ahead of the official go-live. Although modest, the rise shows that the market is reflecting the potential impact of today’s development. Investors and analysts are expected to closely monitor how the ETF performs once trading begins.

Winner Announced!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/popular-altcoin-hyperliquid-hype-announces-withdrawal-from-project-winner-announced/,"Decentralized cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Hyperliquid (HYPE) announced last week that it plans to launch its own native stablecoin, USDH. Accordingly, Hyperliquid announced that it will hold an on-chain vote on the issuance of its stablecoin USDH. The selected project will win the right to issue a native USDH stablecoin compatible with Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid will provide the branding and USDH token, while the team selected through the vote will be responsible for the issuance and operations. Related News: A Critical Move from the Cryptocurrency Exchange Favored by Giant Whales! It Will Launch Its Own Stablecoin! - Voting Has Beginned! As anticipation for Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin continues, Ethena (ENA), the team behind the USDe synthetic dollar protocol, has announced that it has withdrawn its bid to issue Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin. Ethena Labs has withdrawn its proposal to issue Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin, acknowledging concerns raised in direct conversations with community members and validators. Ethena Labs founder Guy Young said that community concerns that Ethena was not a Hyperliquid-specific team, had other product lines, and did not limit its goals to a single partner exchange were valid, and therefore the proposal was withdrawn. Ethena's withdrawal marks a significant shift in the bidding process, which has already received bids from numerous teams to issue Hyperliquid's upcoming native stablecoin, USDH. With Ethena eliminated, prediction markets on Polymarket give Native Markets a 92% chance of winning, with Paxos in second place at around 7% at the time of writing. Ultimately, Ethena’s withdrawal not only gave Native Markets the near-certain winner, but also highlighted the advantage local projects have in decentralized governance processes. *This is not investment advice.

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, every major transaction tells a story. Recently, a significant Ethena ENA deposit caught the attention of market watchers, signaling potential shifts. An address, widely believed to be linked with the Ethena protocol, moved a substantial 5 million ENA tokens, valued at approximately $3.81 million, directly to the Binance exchange. What’s Behind the Latest Ethena ENA Deposit? This particular Ethena ENA deposit is not an isolated incident. Onchain-Lense, a reputable analytics firm, reported that this same address has collectively deposited an astonishing 44 million ENA to Binance over the past two weeks. Such large movements naturally spark curiosity and speculation within the crypto community. Understanding these transfers requires a look at the bigger picture. Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol, offering a crypto-native, censorship-resistant, and scalable stablecoin solution. Its native token, ENA, plays a vital role in its ecosystem, often associated with governance or protocol incentives. Why Do Large ENA Deposits Matter to the Market? When significant amounts of a token like ENA are moved to an exchange, it can have several implications. Primarily, it often suggests an intent to sell, which could potentially increase selling pressure on the token. However, there are other strategic reasons behind a large Ethena ENA deposit : Liquidity Provision: Projects sometimes deposit tokens to exchanges to provide liquidity for market makers, ensuring smooth trading. Treasury Management: Protocols may need to rebalance their treasuries, converting assets for operational costs or other strategic investments. Airdrop Distribution: While less likely for ongoing deposits, initial exchange deposits can relate to token distributions. Market Making Activities: Ethena might be engaging in market making to maintain a healthy trading environment for ENA. The cumulative 44 million ENA moved in such a short period underscores the scale of these operations. This pattern suggests a deliberate, ongoing strategy rather than a one-off event. What Are the Potential Impacts of This Ethena ENA Deposit? For investors and traders, monitoring these on-chain movements is crucial. A continuous influx of tokens to exchanges could, in theory, lead to increased supply available for sale, potentially impacting ENA’s price. Conversely, if these are strategic moves for liquidity, the impact might be neutral or even positive in the long run by fostering a more robust market. It is important to remember that correlation does not always imply causation. While a large Ethena ENA deposit might precede price volatility, it is just one factor among many. Broader market sentiment, Ethena’s protocol developments, and overall demand for stablecoins also play significant roles. Keeping an Eye on Future Ethena ENA Deposits For those interested in ENA’s trajectory, closely following on-chain analytics platforms like Onchain-Lense provides valuable insights. Understanding the flow of tokens helps in making informed decisions. Traders often use such data to anticipate market movements and adjust their strategies accordingly. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor ENA Price Action: Observe how ENA’s price reacts following these deposits. Follow Ethena Announcements: Official statements from Ethena can clarify the purpose of these large transfers. Analyze Market Depth: Check exchange order books for significant buy or sell walls that might absorb or exacerbate selling pressure. Ultimately, the repeated large Ethena ENA deposit to Binance highlights the transparency and dynamism of the blockchain ecosystem. It empowers individuals with data to better understand the forces shaping their investments. In conclusion, the recent Ethena ENA deposit of $3.81 million, part of a larger 44 million ENA transfer over two weeks, is a noteworthy event. While the immediate implications are subject to interpretation, such movements are key indicators of a project’s operational and market strategy. Staying informed about these on-chain activities is essential for navigating the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethena?

This trend follows talk of a major surge for XYZ, reaching as high as 40,000%. What makes XYZ attractive enough to draw these major investors away from established options? The following article explores the reasons driving this bold shift. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Shiba Inu’s Big Bark: How a Meme Coin Eyes Real Use in the Next Rally Shiba Inu, or SHIB, is a fun coin born in August 2020 by the hidden creator Ryoshi. Like Dogecoin, it began as a joke, yet it runs on the busy Ethereum road and can plug into many apps. The maker printed one quadrillion coins. Half went to Vitalik Buterin, who then gave some to India’s Covid Relief and burned the rest. This act drew big eyes to SHIB. Now the team builds ShibaSwap for trading and plans an art market for digital art tokens and a vote-based club for holders. Memes still pump life into the market, and SHIB rides that hype. Yet it also has tools that Dogecoin lacks. Its link to Ethereum lets builders add new parts fast, and burns help curb supply. If the next bull run favors low-cost coins with clear stories, SHIB could shine again. Big caps like Bitcoin may set the pace, but small coins often move harder when money flows in. Still, SHIB is already up from its lows, so fresh gains need more burns, app launches, and a calm wider market. Fans watch quietly, waiting for the next bark. From Meme to Mainstream: Why Dogecoin Still Wags the Crypto Tail Dogecoin began in 2013 as a light-hearted spin on Bitcoin, starring a smiling Shiba Inu. Its makers, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, wanted fun, not fame. They set no coin limit and let 10,000 new DOGE flow out every minute. The joke caught fire. In 2021, tweets from Elon Musk and a rising crypto tide pushed its value above $50 billion, placing the meme coin among the market giants. The story proved that an online crowd can turn laughter into serious money. Under the hood, DOGE runs on the same proof-of-work style as Litecoin, so blocks arrive fast and fees stay low. Its endless supply keeps the price per coin small, perfect for tips, gifts, and micro-payments. Today, rumors of Musk adding DOGE to his X platform stir fresh buzz. Bitcoin is creeping toward a new peak, and meme coins are back on trend, yet few match Dogecoin’s name power.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $2.29. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $3.72 and an average forecast price of $3.58. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The EOS ecosystem has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 in the near future? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.479 (+2.57%) Market Cap $762.17M Trading Volume $965.26K Circulating Supply 1.59B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4027 (Nov 04, 2024) 24-hour High $0.4875 24-hour Low $0.4625 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction 0.524052 (9.43%) Price Volatility 4.59% 50-Day SMA $0.511902 14-Day RSI 42.22 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.596441 EOS price analysis: Positive market sentiment pushes EOS price toward $0.48 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed an upward market trend toward $0.48.

The EOS price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The EOS/USD value has increased to $0.479 in the past 24 hours. If buyers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a further increase in price levels to retest the resistance of $0.493. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 16% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS near $1. Why is EOS up? Following the recent support around the $0.462 level on the EOS price chart, buyers gained control and took the price to $0.479. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.726 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed last year was $1.34 in December; EOS is striving to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the price trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the start of 2028 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again after 2031, which makes it a good option to buy EOS, though accurate predictions are nearly impossible in the crypto market. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $3.72 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 90th-ranked cryptocurrency. It also experienced strong bullish sentiment in November last year, when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $3.88 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings, as per historical data. It peaked at around $3.27, gaining significant market capitalization, and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April, and in May, EOS was changing hands at $0.94 when the market sentiment turned bullish. In mid-July 2025, EOS recovered to $0.625. However, at the start of September, EOS is trending near $0.47 after a price drop, as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-12 11:45:00

51600011,580108,1757677861,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51600011.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): This Next Gen Crypto Is Ready to Explode After a $38K Whale Buy,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-next-crypto-to-explode-after-38k-whale-buy/,"No arguments here, or anywhere for that matter. Bitcoin is the king of crypto. Likened to gold as it’s valuable and a great long-term investment, but it’s not without its drawbacks. It’s slow, only being able to handle a handful of transactions per second, which feels like the pain of a dial-up modem in today’s world of instant payments. If you were to try and buy a coffee with $BTC, you’d be waiting for minutes, and the transaction fee would be more than the coffee itself, especially when the network’s busy. This is exactly what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is trying to solve. It’s not here to replace Bitcoin; it wants to give it a turbo charge. Hyper is building a Layer-2 on top of Bitcoin’s main network. This new layer increases speed and capacity to a place needed for everyday use, DeFi, and all the cool stuff happening in the crypto world. The Blockchain Trilemma To understand why Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is such a big deal, you have to know about the blockchain trilemma . This is the idea that a blockchain can only achieve two of three key properties at once: decentralization, security, and scalability. Bitcoin chose to prioritize security and decentralization. That’s why it’s so robust and censorship-resistant. But the trade-off was scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is changing Bitcoin’s core; it’s building a lightning-fast add-on right beside it. This allows the network to handle all the smaller transactions, while Bitcoin’s main chain remains secure and reserved for the large, high-value transfers. This hybrid model is what could truly unlock Bitcoin’s potential. For a full breakdown of the Bitcoin Hyper project, click here. Why the Whales Want In It’s one thing to have a good idea, but another altogether to get large investors to believe in it. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is doing both. It’s already raised over $15M in its presale, and a lot of that money is coming from the whales. Just yesterday, we saw three big buys: a whopping $16.9K , $11.1K , and $10.1K and then today a further $10.1K . When you see big chunks of cash being thrown into a project, it’s a big sign that smart money thinks it’s got legs. This kind of confidence from big buyers not only validates the project but also creates a lot of buzz for everyone else watching. Beyond the raw numbers, Hyper’s tokenomics are a major draw. It has a total supply of 21B tokens, a direct nod to $BTC’s own 21M supply, signalling a shared commitment to scarcity. For whales, the presale is a strategic move to get the token at a discounted price before it goes live on major exchanges. However, it’s not whale exclusive, and you should be getting in on it too. The Bitcoin Hyper Solution: Speed and Smart Contracts Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) answer to the Bitcoin problem is pretty clever. It’s creating a Layer-2 network that uses the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . Instead of trying to change Bitcoin itself, it’s building a new, high-speed chain right next to it. You can move your regular Bitcoin onto this new chain and suddenly, your slow, clunky Bitcoin becomes lightning-fast. The SVM allows thousands of transactions per second with super low fees. This is all made possible by the Canonical Bridge . It’s a secure two-way system. When you deposit your $BTC to the bridge, it’s locked up securely on the main Bitcoin chain. In return, an equal amount of ‘wrapped’ $BTC is minted on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2. This wrapped $BTC is now what you use for transactions, and it’s fully redeemable for your original $BTC at any time. This means you can use your $BTC for quick payments, or even better, developers could start building all kinds of dApps, DeFi projects, and more. It’s a way to give Bitcoin a massive jolt of new energy, turning it from a static asset into a dynamic force that can compete with modern blockchains. It’s a crazy thought, but Bitcoin could become even more dominant than it already is, all thanks to projects like this. Zip in and grab your Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) for $0.012895 . Don’t miss the chance to also take advantage of the 73% staking rewards. Stuck? Let us help you with our ‘How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER)’ guide. A Look Under the Hood: The Roadmap and What’s Next The team behind Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has a clear roadmap laid out, which is a good sign for any crypto project. First up, they’ve focused on getting the tech right. They’ve already gone through several stages of development, including smart contract audits and building a devnet (a testing environment for developers). This is a crucial step showing they’re serious about security and functionality before the big launch. The next major milestone is the mainnet launch, and then they’ll focus on ecosystem expansion. This means building out the Canonical Bridge that securely connects Bitcoin to their new network, and making it easy for developers to start building. Bitcoin Hyper’s long-term plan includes a focus on a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) . This means that eventually, you, the $HYPER token holder, will have a say in the project’s future. You’ll be able to vote on key decisions, from new features to how the network’s treasury is used. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) isn’t just trying to fix a problem; they’re trying to build a new community and a new, more useful future for Bitcoin. Something we think stands a good chance of success, so much so that in our price prediction, we think it could reach $0.32 by the end of 2025 . That’d give you an astounding 2381% ROI if you invested today. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before making any investment.

51600077,580136,1757678050,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51600077.jpeg,"4 Meme Coins With 100x Potential, According to Grok",https://bitcoinist.com/4-meme-coins-100x-according-to-grok/,"The TOTAL chart, which tracks crypto’s total market capitalization, has been slowly but steadily printing one green candle after another. It’s up nearly 7% this month, perfectly in line with market expectations of a full-blown crypto rally on the back of an upcoming Federal Reserve rate cut. Now, how do you make the most of this rally? By investing in the best meme coins . Of course, a sizable chunk of your portfolio should be in blue-chip cryptos, but allocating a reasonable portion to hype-fueled meme coins could be what sets you up for an early retirement. To help you identify the next cryptos to explode , we turned to Grok, which is every bit as wild yet calculated as its master, Elon Musk. This, combined with its direct integration with X, makes Grok the perfect AI tool for studying real-time updates, including price movements, technical breakouts, and online chatter, to zero in on the best cryptos to buy now . Here are Grok’s top 4 picks. 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Dogecoin-Inspired Meme Coin Gunning for 1000x Returns Maxi Doge ($MAXI) isn’t your average ‘cute’ animal-themed meme coin. It realized early that if it wants to become the next 1000x crypto , it’ll have to do things differently. That’s why Maxi hit the gym. With bulked-up muscles and protein shakes in his veins, Maxi is a never-before-seen, fierce and intimidating meme coin mascot. And that’s worked perfectly in its favor so far. The project has already pulled in over $2M from early investors, proving that crypto degens are hungry for a raw, wild meme coin. Sure, $MAXI might not have any underlying value or utility, but its mind-boggling mission – to overthrow Dogecoin as the most popular meme coin on the planet – has certainly stirred up conversations in the industry. And $MAXI plans to keep the hype growing. It has reserved 40% of its total token supply for marketing purposes, including PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and social media blitzes. What’s more, buying $MAXI will also unlock holder-only events like weekly trading competitions and leaderboard prizes. And to offer everyday traders a real shot at making whale-like returns, $MAXI also plans to get listed on futures platforms. This would allow $MAXI traders to increase leverage and make the most of the token’s volatility. 1 $MAXI is currently priced at just $0.000257. And according to our $MAXI price prediction , this wild coin could hit $0.0024 by this year’s end, offering a potential 830% ROI. Visit Maxi Doge’s official website to learn more about the origin of its hatred for Dogecoin. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – New Telegram Trading Bot for Sniping Meme Coin Liquidity Don’t be swayed by Snorter Token ($SNORT) ‘s wholesome aardvark mascot; it’s actually a new cryptocurrency project deeply rooted in utility and seriousness. Under the hood, Snorter is changing the meme coin trading space through its cutting-edge trading bot. Based on Telegram, Snorter Bot lets you place buy/sell limit and stop orders in advance – well before liquidity kicks in on a new Solana meme coin. The result? Retail participants can finally undercut institutional players who’ve typically scooped up all the available liquidity. And that’s not all. Snorter is also highly secure, thanks to robust safeguards against front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and even sandwich attacks. It also features a handy copy-trading function, which lets you mimic the trades of professional meme coin traders in real time. According to our $SNORT price prediction , the token could reach $0.94 by the end of 2025. So, a $100 investment today could turn into $900 within months. Moreover, buying $SNORT also unlocks a slew of exclusive perks, including: Reduced trading fees: just 0.85% vs. 1.5% for non-holders Staking rewards, currently yielding 120% No daily sniping limits Advanced analytics for better trading decisions Currently in presale, Snorter Token has already raised over $3.86M, with each token available for just $0.1041. Check out Snorter Token’s official website to explore all the benefits of its trading bot. 3. nubcat ($NUB) – Viral Cat-Themed Meme Coin Prepping for Another Massive Rally If you’re tired of dog-themed cryptos dominating the meme coin space, nubcat ($NUB) – a cat-themed coin – offers a much-needed breath of fresh air. Despite having no utility or intrinsic value, $NUB’s 1,000%+ climb over the past couple of months is proof of just how powerful community-backed meme coin rallies can be when momentum shifts in their favor. But $NUB isn’t as bare-bones as it might seem. A full 75% of its total token supply has been reserved specifically for liquidity management, which makes it safer by design – this arrangement helps protect against foul play. On the charts, $NUB is now testing a critical resistance zone – the same one that triggered a massive 95% drawdown the last time price reached it. This time, however, with momentum on its side, $NUB looks well-positioned to sustain its current rally and continue climbing toward its all-time high of $0.219982. It’s already up over 38% in just the past week, currently trading around $0.03547. Interested? You can buy $NUB on MEXC or any of the other exchanges where it’s listed. 4. SPX6900 ($SPX) – S&P 500 Based Meme Coin That Blends Serious Finance with the Meme Culture SPX6900 ($SPX) is what you get when Wall Street’s serious suits meet crypto’s chaotic meme culture – a perfect cocktail of finance and fun. Inspired by the popular S&P 500 index, SPX6900 blends virality and speculative energy with the seriousness of Wall Street finance. Not long ago, the token formed a new all-time high at $2.2793 on July 28. After that, however, it slipped into a mild downtrend, likely due to profit booking. However, recent momentum (+23% in the last seven days) has pushed $SPX to break out of its long-standing downward-sloping trendline, and it may be on track to reclaim its ATH in the coming weeks. It’s also worth noting that $SPX is backed by strong support at $1.03-$1.05, which is also where the latest bounce came from. It’s now trading at $1.43, and you can buy $SPX through the KuCoin crypto exchange . Quick recap: Grok’s top picks for the best meme coins to watch now include Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , nubcat ($NUB), and SPX6900 ($SPX).

Up 15.6% already this week, the leading layer 1 could be in the midst of a huge breakout. How high can $SOL go? $SOL bursts through resistance and ascending trendline Source: TradingView The weekly chart for the $SOL price is quite a mouth-watering one. Not only has the price burst through the $220 resistance, potentially turning it into support at the end of this week, but it has also pierced through the ascending trendline which stretches back to May this year. As can be seen in the chart, the last major resistance is the top of the weekly candle closes back in November 2024 and January 2025 respectively. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are nearly topped out, but there is a little way still to go before they reach their limit, and there’s nothing to stop the indicators continuing to bounce along the top for an extended period of time. Very high time frame shows $SOL about to close above all major supports Source: TradingView The very high time frames are not used by traders, and even longer term investors may not often refer to them. The 2-month time frame chart above makes for very interesting viewing. It shows that the main support/resistance level for this time frame is in fact the $200 level. It can also be observed that this 2-month candle is already way beyond this level, basing off of it as major support. Fibonacci extension levels taken from the 2021 top down to the 2022/2023 bottom give the 0.786 Fibonacci level as corresponding with the major support, while the extension level out to 1.618 shows a target of $414. SOL/BTC approaches multi-year downtrend line Source: TradingView Finally, the reason for holding an altcoin in the longer term is if it is out-performing $BTC. The weekly chart above for SOL/BTC shows that a big W pattern has sent SOL/BTC towards the multi-year descending trendline. If SOL/BTC can burst through this, and reverse the downtrend by making a higher high above 0.003 BTC, who knows how far the $SOL price could go over this final stage of the bull market.

Bitcoin remains the benchmark for institutional capital, with ETFs fueling steady inflows, while Ethereum continues to benefit from staking adoption and the growth of tokenized assets. Below these two giants, XRP and Solana have both retained strong positions as leading altcoins, each offering utility and community strength that few others can match. Yet stability does not always equate to excitement. Many long-term holders of XRP and Solana are beginning to acknowledge that while their assets remain vital, the days of dramatic 50× or 100× returns are likely over. That realization is pushing capital toward earlier projects, where risk is higher but potential multiples are far greater. This search for asymmetric upside has quietly placed new entrants under the spotlight. One of those is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts now say is being discussed in the same breath as XRP and Solana, not as a rival, but as a complementary bet on the future. Solana’s expanding role in retail and DeFi If XRP represents institutional credibility, Solana has become synonymous with retail energy and innovation. Its low fees and lightning-fast speeds have powered one of the most vibrant ecosystems in crypto, from NFTs and gaming to decentralized finance. The network’s latest upgrade, Alpenglow, has further solidified its technical edge, slashing finality times and ensuring Solana can handle mass-scale adoption. Solana’s cultural presence has been equally impressive. It has emerged as a hub for younger investors who gravitate toward its blend of speed, affordability, and community-driven development. This has helped Solana weather downturns and bounce back faster than many of its peers. Yet Solana’s success comes with a trade-off: its mainstream visibility makes future multiples smaller compared to earlier cycles. While it remains a critical player, many Solana holders recognize that pairing it with a smaller, high-upside project could unlock far greater portfolio growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: momentum building toward 15,000% ROI potential This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE captures attention. Unlike XRP and Solana, which have already achieved significant adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early stages, the very phase where exponential multiples are possible. Analysts are projecting potential returns of up to 15,000% ROI, a figure that recalls the legendary rallies of past altcoin cycles. Momentum is a critical driver here. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale rounds have sold out rapidly, underscoring how demand is running far ahead of supply. Its branding has resonated across cultural lines, engaging not only crypto-native investors but also those new to digital assets. This crossover appeal is rare and often a hallmark of tokens that later achieve breakout status. For XRP and Solana investors accustomed to steadier growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides something different: a high-reward allocation with the potential to transform modest investments into outsized returns. Its trajectory reflects how credibility and cultural energy can align to create a powerful narrative. In a market still searching for its next breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being framed as a rising star. XRP’s position in the next cycle XRP has always been a unique asset, defined as much by its battles as by its innovations. Its multi-year confrontation with the US SEC tested the patience of its community, yet its ultimate recognition as a non-security marked a turning point. This outcome restored confidence among institutional players who had previously hesitated to engage with XRP. Today, its utility in cross-border payments and settlement continues to attract banks, remittance firms, and fintechs that value efficiency. Still, analysts caution that XRP’s growth trajectory is more evolutionary than explosive. Its infrastructure is already embedded across multiple markets, and while adoption can expand further, the likelihood of exponential returns diminishes as an asset matures. For XRP investors, the token remains a solid cornerstone in a balanced portfolio. Yet many are now seeking higher-risk, higher-reward allocations elsewhere to complement their XRP holdings. Why XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are in focus Why are these three assets commanding so much attention right now? XRP anchors portfolios with stability and real-world utility, though its mature status caps explosive returns. Solana captures retail energy through innovation and cultural adoption but is already widely recognized, limiting extreme upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE brings exponential potential, with analysts highlighting projections of 15,000% ROI as demand accelerates. Together, they illustrate the logic behind diversification. Investors recognize that holding only established assets may reduce risk but also limits reward. Balancing established names with high-upside newcomers offers the chance to benefit from both security and speculation in the same portfolio. The psychology of diversification Investor psychology plays a powerful role in these allocation shifts. Holders of XRP often feel a strong emotional connection to the token, forged through years of defending it during legal battles. Solana’s investors, meanwhile, identify with the culture of innovation and experimentation that defines the network. Adding MAGACOIN FINANCE to the mix reflects a pragmatic recognition that no single asset can deliver all desired outcomes. In practice, diversification isn’t about replacing one coin with another. Instead, it’s about creating balance, combining stability, growth, and speculation to maximize opportunity. For many investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the speculative edge that complements their more established holdings. This blend of security and ambition mirrors broader trends across markets, where investors seek both safety and the chance for transformative upside. Conclusion XRP and Solana remain two of the most important players in the crypto space, each offering distinct strengths, stability, adoption, innovation, and cultural reach. But for investors seeking outsized returns, the conversation increasingly includes earlier projects capable of explosive growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with projections of up to 15,000% ROI, rapid presale sellouts, and cultural branding that resonates far beyond crypto’s core audience, is emerging as one of 2025’s rising stars. For XRP and Solana holders, it is less a competitor and more a complement, an early-stage allocation that could transform portfolios in the years ahead.

Recognised as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now , Nexchain is drawing whale attention due to its AI-powered Layer 1 blockchain and hybrid consensus model. The testnet launched last month, providing live validation of its performance, while a new roadmap released on September 5 details key milestones. Investors can also take advantage of the Whitepaper v2.0 and Docs update scheduled for September 15. From presale crypto tokens to token presales, Nexchain is emerging as a notable project in the 2025 crypto presale landscape, standing out among crypto coins on presale and crypto presale projects. Nexchain: NEX coins staking – passive income and network support Nexchain provides multiple ways for participants to engage with the ecosystem, including staking NEX coins. By locking tokens in smart contracts, investors support the hybrid consensus that combines Proof-of-Stake and AI-driven optimisation. This approach secures the network while generating steady rewards for stakers. Stage 27 of the presale has NEX priced at $0.108, with $10,178,244 raised out of a total $11,025,000 target. Between September 5–15, participants can also use the bonus code “wp50” to receive a 50% advantage when acquiring presale crypto tokens. Nexchain’s staking system reflects both technical innovation and investor-centric tokenomics, making it an appealing option in the crypto presale list. The testnet launched last month confirms its ability to process transactions at high speed without overloading the network. With the new roadmap released on September 5 and the upcoming Whitepaper v2.0 and Docs update on September 15, Nexchain shows clear plans for expansion and interoperability. This makes it one of the top crypto presales for those seeking new crypto token presale opportunities and token presales in 2025. Cardano market insights: trading, upgrades, and volume Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.8895, reflecting a 2.5% gain on the day. Its market capitalisation stands at $31.78 billion, while trading volume has declined by 28.74% to $1.25 billion. Despite short-term fluctuations, ADA’s fundamentals remain strong, underpinned by consistent blockchain upgrades and an expanding ecosystem of decentralised applications. Investors following top crypto presales and new token presale opportunities may notice that ADA’s slower, steadier growth contrasts with the rapid adoption observed in presale crypto projects like Nexchain. While trading volumes have temporarily dipped, the network’s technical improvements and staking incentives continue to draw interest from long-term holders seeking sustainable returns. Ripple token insights: patterns and institutional interest Ripple (XRP) continues to maintain resilience, trading in a range of $2.95–$3.10. Technical analysts have identified a “cup-and-handle” pattern, suggesting potential for short-term breakouts, with resistance targets near $3.80. Historical fractals from 2017 imply that, with adoption and regulatory clarity, XRP could see significant upside, although institutional momentum remains a key factor. Trading activity remains robust, highlighting XRP’s ongoing appeal among long-term crypto holders. For those observing presale crypto projects and token presales in 2025, the rotation from XRP to new crypto token presale initiatives like Nexchain reflects evolving market dynamics. While XRP maintains core support levels, Nexchain’s AI-enabled blockchain and staking opportunities offer investors exposure to emerging technologies and web3 crypto presale innovations. Nexchain presale summary and key takeaways for investors Nexchain’s presale demonstrates why it has become a focal point for crypto whales and early investors. With Stage 27 tokens priced at $0.108 and $10,178,244 raised, the platform combines hybrid consensus, AI optimisation, and staking rewards to create a sustainable network ecosystem. The testnet launched last month validates the network’s performance, while the new roadmap released on September 5 and the Whitepaper v2.0 plus Docs update coming September 15 provide clarity on future milestones. For investors seeking the best crypto presale to buy right now, Nexchain offers unique exposure to AI-driven blockchain technology. The presale crypto tokens , bonus code opportunity from September 5–15, and ongoing staking rewards make it an attractive project in the 2025 crypto presale list. While Cardano and XRP maintain relevance for long-term holders, Nexchain highlights the evolution of token presales, crypto presales, and new token presale strategies in web3.

In 2025, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to enjoy strong followings, while newer entrants such as Pepe (PEPE) and FLOKI have shown how fast meme-driven projects can capture investor interest. Now, AlphaPepe (ALPE) is gaining momentum, with early growth indicators that analysts say resemble the early days of SHIB and PEPE. Rapid presale traction AlphaPepe’s presale has already surpassed $130,000 in commitments, drawing attention from both retail investors and meme coin enthusiasts. The presale has been structured to maximize transparency: tokens are distributed instantly upon purchase, and the project received a 10/10 BlockSAFU audit score , giving buyers an added layer of confidence. What has impressed analysts most is not just the fundraising pace, but the community engagement around the presale. AlphaPepe has been trending on X (Twitter) and building an active Telegram base, both key signals of grassroots momentum. Community-first approach Meme coins live or die by the strength of their communities, and AlphaPepe is already prioritizing engagement through unique gamification features. One such initiative is its USDT prize pool system, rewarding larger presale buyers with bonus opportunities. The first pool has already paid out over $800 to top holders, with blockchain transaction proofs posted publicly on AlphaPepe’s socials to reinforce transparency. In addition, the team recently launched a $100,000 token giveaway campaign on Gleam, further amplifying community involvement. These incentives, combined with viral branding centered on AlphaPepe’s muscular frog mascot, have quickly attracted attention across crypto circles. Balancing meme culture with utility While AlphaPepe taps into the cultural power of memes, the project’s roadmap indicates ambitions beyond hype. Planned utilities include: An Alpha Trading Bot to provide holders with access to automated tools. NFT rewards for top holders, adding a collectible layer to community incentives. Realistic staking rewards up to 85% APR, offering strong yields without undermining tokenomics, unlike some meme projects that overpromise unsustainable returns. Analysts highlight that this balance of meme culture and tangible utility could help AlphaPepe maintain traction long after its presale concludes. Comparisons with SHIB and PEPE AlphaPepe’s early trajectory has prompted comparisons with Shiba Inu’s SHIB Army and Pepe’s viral breakout. Both projects leveraged community hype to deliver exponential returns: Shiba Inu turned small investments into life-changing wealth during its 2021 rally. Pepe surged to multi-billion-dollar market caps within weeks of launch in 2023. While AlphaPepe is still in its infancy, its combination of transparent presale mechanics, early community excitement, and sustainable tokenomics has led some analysts to suggest it could follow a similar path of growth in 2025. Analyst outlook As the presale continues to accelerate, AlphaPepe is positioning itself as a potential breakout meme coin for 2025. Analysts caution that meme coin markets remain highly volatile, but note that early signs — strong fundraising, transparent operations, and rising community traction — are aligning with patterns seen in past meme coin successes. For investors who missed the early days of Shiba Inu or Pepe, AlphaPepe is increasingly being discussed as a possible “second chance” opportunity. Conclusion AlphaPepe’s presale momentum and growing community presence suggest it could be among the meme coins to watch in 2025. With transparency measures, gamified rewards, and a roadmap blending meme culture with utility, the project is quickly gaining visibility. Whether AlphaPepe can match the scale of SHIB or PEPE remains to be seen, but its early progress has already placed it firmly on the radar of meme coin investors.

Both agree the global liquidity cycle is “late,” still advancing but increasingly mature, with its eventual peak most likely pushed into 2026 by policy engineering, bill-heavy issuance, and rising use of private-sector conduits. The investment implication running through the conversation is unambiguous: long-duration assets—crypto and technology equities—remain the primary beneficiaries of ongoing currency debasement, yet the endgame is now visible on the horizon as a wall of debt refinancing and inflation risk approaches. How Long Will The Liquidity Cycle Push Crypto Higher? Howell’s high-level assessment is stark. “We’re late. It’s not inflecting downwards yet—we’re still in an upswing—but… the liquidity cycle is about 34 months old. That’s pretty mature.” In his framework, cycles typically run five to six years. Pal’s Everything Code—a synthesis of demographics, debt, and the policy liquidity needed to roll that debt—arrives at a similar destination, albeit with a slightly shorter cadence and a crucial timing nuance. “My view is it’s been extended,” Pal says, adding that the peak “normally would have finished sometime this end of this year, but it feels like it’s going to push out.” Howell places the likely turn “around about early 2026,” with his model’s latest estimate at March 2026, while Pal is “in the camp of Q2” 2026. The difference is tactical; the thrust is the same: the late-cycle rally can run further, but investors are now operating inside the final act. At the center of that act is what Howell calls a structural transition “from Fed QE to Treasury QE.” The US Treasury’s heavy tilt to short-dated bills over coupons lowers the average duration of paper held by the private sector. “Very crudely, we tend to think that liquidity is equal to an asset divided by its duration,” Howell explains. Reducing duration mechanically boosts system liquidity. That issuance profile also corrals volatility and creates powerful bid auras: banks gladly absorb bills to match deposit growth, and, increasingly, so do stablecoin issuers managing cash to T-bill ladders. “If any credit provider buys government debt—particularly short-dated stuff—it’s monetization,” Howell notes. The result, in Pal’s summary, is that policymakers have shifted from balance-sheet expansion to a more complex “total liquidity” regime, where banks, money funds, and even crypto-native entities become the delivery rails of debasement. Related Reading: Elliott Management Warns Of ‘Inevitable Crypto Collapse’ Linked To White House Support The debate over near-term Fed liquidity hinges on reserves and the Treasury General Account. The quarterly refunding blueprint has telegraphed a rebuild of the TGA toward the high-hundreds of billions. Howell is unconvinced it happens quickly or fully, because draining that much cash would risk a repo spread spike, something the Fed and Treasury appear determined to avoid. “Everything I hear… is they want to manage that liquidity. They don’t want to pull the rips on the markets,” he argues, adding that the Fed has effectively been targeting a minimum level of bank reserves since last summer’s stress-test changes. “The Federal Reserve controls bank reserves in aggregate completely,” Howell says. Even if the TGA edges higher, “you can find other ways of injecting liquidity… through Treasury QE or getting the banks to buy debt.” Global Liquidity Remains Strong The global overlay is every bit as important. Europe and Japan, as Howell frames it, are net-adding liquidity; China has moved decisively to ease via the PBoC’s toolkit—repos, outright OMOs, and medium-term lending—after a stop-start attempt in 2023. Chinese 10-year yields and term premia have started to firm from depressed levels, which, paradoxically for asset allocators, “can be good” if it signals escape from debt-deflation toward reflation and a commodity up-cycle. “If you get this big Chinese stimulus continuing… that should mean stronger commodity markets,” Howell argues, with Pal adding that a revived China would restore the missing engine of the global business cycle even as liquidity remains the dominant market driver. Japan is the outlier with a fascinating twist. Disaggregating term premia shows the selling is concentrated in the ultra-long end, not the belly or front of the curve. Howell’s inference is a duration rotation rather than a full-curve sovereign dump—“a switch from bonds into equities”—consistent with mild-inflation regimes that favor stocks. Why tolerate it? Howell floats two possibilities: Japan “actually want[s] some inflation,” which quietly erodes debt burdens, and, more speculatively, “the Japanese are being told to ease monetary policy by the US Treasury,” keeping the yen weak to pressure China. He is careful to caveat, but the pattern—persistent yen weakness despite strong equity inflows—fits the policy-coordination narrative that Pal has long emphasized. The U.K. and France, by contrast, look like textbook supply-shock sovereigns. Here, term premia have risen across the curve, reflecting heavy issuance, swelling welfare-state obligations, and weak growth. Howell highlights that the U.K.’s “underlying term premium [is] up over 100 basis points in the last 12 months,” a move that cannot be waved away as a single budget misstep. The policy menu is narrow: higher taxes, eventual spending restraint (likely only enforced by a crisis or an IMF-style conditionality), and, ultimately, some form of monetization—whether relabeled QE, regulatory loosening to stuff more gilts into bank balance sheets, or de-facto yield-curve management. “Let’s not say never for [monetization] because that’s almost inevitably what’s going to happen,” Howell says. Hovering over all of it is the dollar. On Howell’s preferred real trade-weighted lens, the dollar remains in a secular up-channel with a cyclical correction in train. Rest-of-world balance-of-payments data still show net inflows to the dollar system. Pal and Howell agree that the administration wants a weaker dollar cyclically to ease the refinancing of the roughly half of global debt that is dollar-denominated, even if the dollar remains “fundamentally strong” as the world’s primary collateral system. That’s the paradox Pal underscores: “A weaker dollar allows people to refinance their debts… That ends up being the debasement of currency, even though you get dollar inflows.” Related Reading: Crypto At Risk — JPMorgan Warns Fed Cut Could Spark Crash In that debasement regime, both men argue, long-duration, liquidity-sensitive assets lead. “You’ve got to start thinking about how to invest in the monetary inflation world,” Howell says. Pal is explicit about the winners: technology and, crucially, crypto. He frames both as living within “log trend channels” that extend higher as cycles are elongated by policy engineering. The 2021 crypto blow-off, in his telling, was a sunset cycle; this time, the extension lengthens the price runway. Gold also fits the mosaic, but with a twist in its driver set. Pal observes that gold has decoupled from real rates and is now “highly correlated with financial conditions,” poised to break from a wedge if the dollar weakens and rates ease. Crypto stablecoins occupy a pivotal, and underappreciated, role in the architecture. Howell calls them a “conduit” for public-sector credit creation, while warning that deposits migrating from banks to stablecoins can curb traditional credit growth. Pal widens the lens: stablecoins are effectively a “fractionalized eurodollar market down to individual level,” giving any household in any jurisdiction access to dollar liquidity and, by extension, democratizing the demand base for US bills. It is not lost on either man that Europe is scrambling for its own digital-money answer, even if politics likely forces a central-bank-led route. The risks now crowd the 2026–2027 window. The COVID-era terming-out of corporate and sovereign debt will need to be rolled in size at meaningfully higher coupons. Howell also flags a cash-flow squeeze emanating from the corporate capex boom: “US tech companies [are] currently investing, what is it, a billion dollars a day in IT and infrastructure… over a couple of years that’s going to take about a trillion dollars out of money markets.” That drains liquidity even as profits rise. His historical analogue is the late-1980s sequence—rising yields, commodities firming, a policy signal misread, then an abrupt liquidity turn that cracked equities. He is not forecasting a crash, but he is clear that “we’re nearer the end than… the beginning.” For now, neither man is bearish on the next three to six months. Pal’s Global Macro Investor financial conditions index points to an expansion, and Howell expects “pretty decent Fed liquidity” to persist as authorities avoid repo stress and lean on duration management. “Through year end… generally I think it’s okay,” Howell says. “We will get wiggles… but the trend is intact and continues for a while.” The operative phrase is his earlier one: steady as she goes—into the liquidity endgame. Crypto sits squarely in that cross-current, the prime expression of monetary inflation even as the calendar inexorably advances toward a refinancing test that will decide whether today’s engineered extension ends in a soft plateau or a sharper turn. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.95 trillion.

The protocol has dismissed earlier reports on social platforms that claimed the breach affected its whole network. Web3 security platform ExVul Defender posted on X Friday that the attacker began moving funds two days ago. They reportedly sourced initial liquidity from a mixer before interacting with the THORChain network, making their first transactions at 06:41:47 AM UTC on Wednesday. Correction: This incident involved a user's personal wallet being exploited, and is not related to @THORChain . 🙏 https://t.co/mACcL1WkPt — THORChain (@THORChain) September 12, 2025 On Etherscan, the wallet address, in conjunction with THORChain, has issued three bounty offers within two days of the hack, but so far, the attacker has not replied. ZachXBT: Victim is THORChain co-founder JP Replying to PeckShield alert’s X post, blockchain security sleuth ZachXBT identified the victim as John-Paul Thorbjornsen, also known as JP, co-founder of both THORChain and wallet application Vultisig. The wallet likely belongs to @jpthor who had a private wallet compromised due to a fake meeting scam a few days ago. JP is one of the people whose has greatly benefited financially from the laundering of DPRK hacks/exploits. So it’s a bit poetic he got rekt here by DPRK. pic.twitter.com/T57RRJ0bbf — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) September 12, 2025 According to ZachXBT, JP’s personal wallet was drained of about $1.35 million during a Telegram meeting call scam orchestrated by North Korean hackers on Tuesday. JP, and platforms linked to him, have previously been linked to financial benefits from laundering activity tied to DPRK-linked hacks , including the $1.5 billion in Ethereum tokens Bybit exploit executed in late February. “JP is one of the people who has greatly benefited financially from the laundering of DPRK hacks and exploits,” ZachXBT wrote. “So it’s a bit poetic he got rekt here by DPRK.” Blockchain records from September 9 reveal a series of fund movements from the theft address, which could have been an attempt to obscure the trail of funds. The first transfer involved 6,233,015 THORChain tokens, which were moved out of the compromised wallet three days ago. Almost immediately afterward, another transaction placed 6,233,180 tokens into an address flagged as “Fake_Phishing1347722,” a label associated with laundering and phishing-related obfuscation. Still within the day, the attacker moved 6,333,180 tokens through THORChain, followed by another 6,333,333 tokens, possibly cycling large sums onto different addresses, alongside a smaller payment of 1,250,000 tokens was sent. The largest cluster of stolen funds, amounting to 2,778,345 tokens, eventually landed in the Kyber protocol, likely exchanged to create layers of separation from the original source. Currently, the majority of stolen funds worth $1.218 million have been sitting at 0x7abc09ab94d6015053f8f41b01614bb6d1cc7647 , ZachXBT said in his investigations Telegram channel. Did THORChain benefit from the Bybit hack laundering? Data from Arkham Intelligence shows hackers behind the Bybit attack moved at least 209,384 ETH, worth about $480 million, into Bitcoin. This was more than 50% of the estimated 400,000 ETH stolen from the exchange. Blockchain researchers tracked close to $1.2 billion in illicit crypto, about 85% of the Bybit hack lost funds, moving through THORChain. Within the first few days of the incident, at least $240 million of the Bybit proceeds were washed through THORChain and swapped into BTC, Arkham reported. Some competitors worked with authorities to restrict suspicious transactions, but THORChain’s operators did little to naught to block addresses, despite formal requests from the FBI and other agencies. Wallet applications built on the network, including Asgardex and Vultisig continued to process the activity without interruption. Blockchain security firms suggested that the network’s validators and wallet developers, many of whom are publicly identifiable and operate in jurisdictions with strict anti-money laundering requirements, claimed fees of more than $12 million for laundering the funds. “The protocol keeps running and swapping despite chaos. It’s doing great, actually,” Thorbjornsen said, supposedly defending its operations. At the time, THORChain recorded its largest-ever single day of trading, with more than $737 million worth of tokens swapped across the network. Get seen where it counts.

This follows over a year of antitrust bickering, which was triggered by complaints from rival platforms. As a result, the European Commission on Friday accepted commitments regarded as binding from Microsoft. The commitments are in relation to Microsoft being required to sell versions of its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites without Teams as Cryptopolitan previously reported . Rival platforms raised concerns over Microsoft’s dominance The investigation began in 2023 when Slack, which was then owned by Salesforce , complained to the Commission that Microsoft unlawfully bundled Teams with its dominant productivity software. Another company, Alfaview, a German videoconferencing firm also joined the action, complaining that the arrangement gave Microsoft an unfair stranglehold on the market. By June 2024, EU regulators had issued a preliminary finding that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance, forcing the tech giant to present a series of proposals aimed to defuse the case, which were subsequently tested by the Commission in a market consultation. With the commitments from Microsoft, the saga has finally come to a close as Slack and Alfaview have since withdrawn their complaints. Under the deal, Microsoft will sell Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites without Teams at reduced prices, while continuing to offer versions that include the chat tool. However, customers with long-term contracts will have the option to switch to “Teams-free” suites without penalty. Microsoft has also committed to ensure that competing communication platforms can integrate with Microsoft’s software, and to give users the right to export their Teams data if they wish to move to rival services. The concessions will remain binding for seven years, and in the case of data portability and interoperability, for a full decade. “With today’s decision, we make binding for seven years or more Microsoft’s commitments to put an end to its tying practices that may be preventing rivals from effectively competing with Teams.” Teresa Ribera, the Commission’s executive vice-president for competition. “Organisations big and small across Europe and around the world rely heavily on videoconferencing, chat and collaboration tools, especially since the coronavirus pandemic,” she said. Microsoft made a series of commitments Microsoft , which first suggested an unbundling plan in May, has steadily improved its offer in recent months. Part of the commitments includes raising the price gap between suites with Teams and those without by 50%, and ensuring that online advertising for Microsoft 365 packages clearly shows the equivalent version without Teams. “We appreciate the dialogue with the Commission that led to this agreement, and we turn now to implementing these new obligations promptly and fully.” Nanna-Louise Linde, Microsoft’s vice-president for European government affairs. The company added that it was committed to addressing concerns “in a way that serves customers and supports a competitive environment.” Europe has long been wary of dominant platforms using their size and reach to stifle competition. In this case, officials were concerned that Microsoft’s tactics could freeze out innovative challengers in the booming market for remote-work tools. For Brussels, the case is about ensuring that the post-pandemic workplace is not dictated by one player. For now, Microsoft has secured breathing space. But its rivals, emboldened by the Commission’s willingness to act, are unlikely to ease the pressure any time soon.

According to data retrieved by Finbold from on-chain intelligence from Arkham, BlackRock’s Ethereum position fell from 3.78 million ETH worth $16.82 billion on September 5 to 3.66 million ETH worth $15.91 billion on September 12. That marks a reduction of 115,950 ETH, equating to more than $913 million in value within just seven days. BlackRock’s Ethereum holdings. Source: Arkham Ethereum’s share of BlackRock’s crypto exposure dropped from 16.7% to 15.7%, a clear tilt away from the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. BlackRock boosts its BTC holdings In contrast, BlackRock added to its Bitcoin position. Holdings rose from 747,470 BTC ($83.53 billion) to 751,400 BTC ($85.62 billion) over the same period. An increase of 3,930 BTC, worth more than $2.09 billion, expanded Bitcoin’s dominance within the fund’s crypto portfolio from 83.2% to 84.4%. The portfolio moves coincided with BlackRock’s overall crypto assets climbing back above the $100 billion mark, reaching $101.53 billion on September 12. This recovery was largely powered by Bitcoin’s week-on-week rally of 1.97%, as well as gains in smaller positions like SPX (+23.28%) and TUA (+61.15%). Ethereum, meanwhile, faced headwinds, slipping 2.43% in price to $4,345 and triggering over $900 million in unrealized losses across BlackRock’s ETH allocation. Despite this trim, Ethereum remains BlackRock’s second-largest crypto holding, well ahead of other assets in its portfolio such as IMAGE ($561,000) and JOE ($6,880).

Market data confirm that the token settled at $3.05912, firmly above the resistance that has repeatedly capped price advances over the past seven weeks. This move, highlighted by prominent market analyst Cryptoinsightuk on X, signals a potential shift in momentum as traders eye higher levels. According to the analyst, the minimum target following this breakout is $3.60, a price zone not seen since mid-July. $3.00 as the Critical Psychological Pivot Despite this encouraging close, the $3.00 mark remains a fierce battleground. Technical traders recognize round numbers as psychologically important, and XRP’s repeated tests of this level underscore its role as both a magnet for liquidity and a potential springboard for the next move. $XRP closed its first daily candle since July 21st above this downwards trendline. Minimum target here is $3.60 https://t.co/QMmkQpIiCq pic.twitter.com/eVer3UGSOM — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 12, 2025 Bulls need to defend the trendline on any pullback and convert $3.00 into solid support to validate the breakout’s strength. Until that happens, market watchers expect continued volatility and intraday retests of the former resistance line. The Case for a $3.60 Minimum Target Cryptoinsightuk’s $3.60 objective aligns with major technical factors. That price corresponds to a cluster of previous highs from mid-July, when XRP last staged a sharp rally. Breaking through to that region would represent a measured move from the descending trendline and signal that the bullish trend is firmly intact. Other chart analysts have also identified the $3.50–$3.70 range as a logical next resistance zone , reinforcing the credibility of the target. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Volume and Confirmation Signals For the breakout to gain lasting traction, analysts emphasize the need for strong trading volume and a decisive daily close above $3.10. High volume would confirm that institutional and retail participants are committing to the move. Conversely, a weak-volume push could invite a rapid pullback, particularly if broader crypto market sentiment cools. Traders are also watching for a “retest and hold” pattern, where the price revisits the former trendline and bounces—an important sign that it has flipped from resistance to support. Macro Factors and Market Outlook Beyond pure chart analysis, macro currents in the crypto market will shape XRP’s trajectory. Institutional interest, regulatory headlines, and broader risk appetite continue to drive liquidity across digital assets. Positive developments in these areas could accelerate XRP’s advance toward $3.60 and beyond, while unexpected market shocks could dampen momentum. XRP’s first daily close above the descending trendline since July 21 marks a meaningful technical breakout. With Cryptoinsightuk setting a minimum target of $3.60, attention now turns to the crucial $3.00–$3.10 zone for confirmation. A successful defense of this level, backed by rising volume, would strengthen the bullish narrative and position XRP for its next leg higher.

Fund holdings hit 6.7M ETH, with large wallets accumulating 20.6M ETH during the rally. Technical breakout and institutional demand strengthen Ethereum’s momentum as it approaches the $5,000 level. Ethereum Daily Outlook Shows Bullish Setup Ethereum closed the day with a bullish candle, supported by stronger conditions in ETHBTC. CRYPTOWZRD said , “$5,000 is the next Daily resistance. Above $5,000 I expect FOMO buying pressure and a rally towards the $5,780 resistance target or higher.” They added that $4,000 remains the key support on the downside. Intraday moves have been volatile but bullish . A breakout above $4,500 opened the way for targets at $4,765 and higher. CRYPTOWZRD noted that holding above $4,500 is crucial, while slipping under $4,500 or $4,000 could bring back volatility and bearish risk.

A move back below that level would weaken the breakout and could return the price action to earlier ranges. Support is visible between $4,210 and $4,275, where several higher lows have formed. This area now represents a key base for buyers if price tests lower levels again. Institutional Demand Continues to Grow Ethereum demand has been supported by rising institutional and holder activity. CryptoBusy shared that fund holdings of ETH have reached an all-time high of 6.7 million tokens. The increase accelerated through 2025 as the price moved above $4,000, reflecting stronger inflows from ETFs and structured investment products. Balances among larger wallets have also grown, reaching 20.6 million ETH across addresses holding between 10,000 and more than 100,000 ETH. CryptoBusy noted, Ethereum demand hits new highs.

WLFI tokens will produce fees from their own liquidity pools on Ethereum, BSC, and Solana. Those fees will be sent back to the market, boosting the token’s valuation. The platform aims to protect WLFI with other tools, after receiving criticism for freezing whale wallets to prevent selling, as covered earlier by Cryptopolitan. WLFI expects the burns to start from next week, starting another stage of the project. Previous rumors have suggested a rather high burn rate of up to 1M tokens per day, but this will depend on DeFi activity. The WLFI token is now the main focus of the project, as it makes up the bulk of the platform’s holdings. World Liberty Fi now holds $9.8B in assets, of which WLFI makes up around $9.2B . While the token is tradable and listed on multiple chains and exchanges, the end goal is still to encourage holding, voting, and using WLFI for DeFi. Whale starts building WLFI stash New demand for WLFI is growing slowly, as whales accumulate in the post-ICO market. One buyer withdrew WLFI from BitGet, storing $35.71M tokens valued at $7.15M. A newly created wallet withdrew 35.71M $WLFI , worth $7.15M, from #BitGet .

Some buyers had privileged access and could cash out more readily. In general, whale traders are somewhat bearish on WLFI. Currently, Hyperliquid carries 12 positions on the token, of which seven whales are shorting WLFI. The biggest position is a short sale with a notional value of $3M . So far, WLFI has not seen any dramatic pumps and has traded sideways for a relatively long period. Despite launching at the start of an altcoin season, WLFI is still in early price discovery. The Justin Sun wallet freeze also affected the project, sparking fears of not being able to cash out of WLFI. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Is Approval Coming?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-worlds-giant-dtcc-has-made-an-exciting-decision-for-xrp-and-two-altcoins-is-approval-coming/,"The SEC has not approved any altcoin ETFs other than Bitcoin and Ethereum to date. Currently, ETF applications for altcoins like XRP and Solana (SOL) are pending before the SEC. At this point, while altcoin ETFs are expected to be approved one after another in the coming months, an important development has occurred. Accordingly, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) reported that it has listed the Fidelity Solana (SOL) ETF, Canary Hedera (HBAR) ETF, and Canary XRP (XRP) ETF on its website. This listing has created excitement in the cryptocurrency community as it signals that these ETFs may soon be approved by the SEC. Nate Geraci, Head of Asset Management at NovaDius, who is monitoring DTCC's listing, said: “DTCC listing the Fidelity SOL ETF and Canary XRP & HBAR ETFs means *nothing* from a regulatory perspective. It all depends on the SEC.” A DTCC listing is generally considered a positive signal for an ETF considering launch. However, a DTCC listing is independent of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scrutiny and does not guarantee listing. DTCCs play a crucial role in the American ETF market. When an ETF is added to the DTCC list, it means that an intermediary bank has requested a DTCC designation for that ETF fund, and the DTCC may execute this action at an unspecified future date following SEC approval. According to Bloomberg, the XRP and Solana ETFs have a 95% probability of approval, while the HBAR ETF has a 90% probability. While the SEC's deadline to approve or reject XRP and Solana is October, the SEC has so far postponed all altcoin-related ETF applications until the deadline. *This is not investment advice.

For those immersed in the world of cryptocurrency and cutting-edge innovation, understanding where the next wave of disruptive tech is heading is crucial. While AI often steals the spotlight, a profound shift is occurring in robotics that signals a ‘golden age’ – one that savvy investors and tech enthusiasts should not overlook. The Astounding Growth of Robotics Startups: More Than Just AI Hype Rewind to 2015, and the scene for early-stage robotics startups was starkly different. Seth Winterroth, now a partner at Eclipse Ventures, recalls a time when promising teams fresh from top universities like Waterloo, CMU, or MIT struggled to secure institutional venture capital . Most VC funding in Silicon Valley was flowing into mature application layers, leaving hardware-heavy robotics in the shadows. Fast forward a decade, and the narrative has completely flipped. The market for robotics has matured significantly. Hardware and software capabilities have advanced dramatically, becoming both more powerful and more affordable. This confluence of factors has ignited investor interest, leading to an unprecedented surge in funding. Crunchbase data reveals that investors poured a staggering $6 billion into robotics startups in the first seven months of 2025 alone. This trajectory suggests that 2025 funding totals will eclipse those of 2024, positioning robotics as one of the few non-AI categories experiencing such a boost. Unpacking the Venture Capital Surge: Why Investors are Pouring Billions While the recent advancements in AI are certainly a tailwind, the current boom in robotics startups isn’t solely attributable to it. Many long-term investors in the sector point to an earlier, pivotal moment: Amazon’s acquisition of Kiva Systems in 2013. According to Winterroth, this event was ‘the acquisition that launched 1,000 robotic startups.’ This initial wave, spanning roughly 2011 to 2016, attracted a new generation of engineers and entrepreneurs to the sector. Though many of these early ventures didn’t succeed commercially, they fostered invaluable learning and talent. As Kira Noodleman of Bee Partners explains, this decade of ‘trial and error’ helped startups refine their understanding of market needs and achieve product-market fit. Failures became lessons, informing the next cohort of founders about what customers truly sought from automation. Beyond market maturation, the declining cost of hardware has been a critical enabler. Fady Saad, a general partner at Cybernetix Ventures, notes that building robots today is significantly cheaper than five years ago. Advances in sensor technology, computing power, and battery life have converged, making full-stack robotics solutions more viable and attractive to venture backers. This cost reduction allows companies a clearer path to scale, fundamentally changing the investment calculus. Beyond the Hype: The True Impact of AI in Robotics It’s impossible to discuss the future of robotics without acknowledging the role of AI. However, it’s crucial to differentiate between AI as a contributing factor and AI as the sole driver. While AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), can be instrumental in training robots, a key distinction lies in data sources. LLMs primarily train on online information: This is excellent for language and abstract reasoning. Robots interact with the real world: Their training requires physical data, which is more complex to capture and process. Emerging Real-World Models: Companies like Nvidia are actively building ‘world models’ specifically for robot training, bridging this gap. Saad predicts that fully capturing and training robots on comprehensive real-world data, especially for those interacting closely with humans, will take more time. So, while AI significantly enhances robot capabilities, it’s one piece of a larger, evolving puzzle, not the singular force behind the current investment surge. Strategic Investment in Industrial Automation: Where the Future Lies The momentum in robotics is swelling, but not all segments are equally mature or attractive to investors. For Winterroth, Saad, and Noodleman, certain sectors stand out due to their clear need for advanced solutions and tangible ROI: Manufacturing: A long-standing adopter, facing labor shortages and efficiency demands. Warehousing: Revolutionized by automation for logistics and fulfillment. Construction: A challenging environment ripe for robotic assistance. Healthcare & Surgical: Precision, consistency, and assistance in critical procedures. Elder Care: A growing need for in-home assistance due to aging populations and labor shortages. Noodleman emphasizes the ‘low-hanging fruit’ of repetitive tasks, such as machine tending, where human labor is becoming scarce or uneconomical. The philosophy has shifted from ‘lights out manufacturing’ (zero humans) to augmenting human workers. Vertically-focused robotics companies, those deeply embedded in a specific industry, often gain access to richer real-world and physical data, giving them an edge over horizontal players. Navigating the Challenges: The Reality of Consumer Robotics and Humanoids While the broader robotics market is booming, some areas remain challenging for investors. Consumer-focused robots, and particularly humanoids, face significant hurdles. Saad voices skepticism about widespread consumer adoption of robots in homes anytime soon, noting that even non-humanoid consumer robots have struggled. The example of iRobot, a pioneer in consumer robotics with its Roomba, is telling. Despite its initial success, iRobot has largely failed to replicate that triumph with subsequent products like pool cleaning or lawn-mowing robots. The commercial success of intricate models like humanoids is still years away, requiring significant breakthroughs in cost, safety, and perceived utility for the average consumer. Despite these challenges in specific niches, the overall influx of venture capital into robotics is a net positive. It drives innovation, expands the potential customer base, and validates the long-term viability of the sector. As Winterroth concludes, ‘Ten, 15 years ago, it was questionable whether or not there was going to be a large and thriving marketplace for these types of solutions. Now, there’s a lot of customer awareness.’ The current landscape is one of growing customer awareness, technological maturity, and a robust investment environment. The compounding effect of past learnings, coupled with ongoing innovation, positions robotics as a truly transformative force. This isn’t just about AI; it’s about a foundational shift that promises to reshape industries and daily life, making the future of robotics a compelling narrative for investors and innovators alike.

Bitcoin (BTC) shed recent sluggishness to break the $115,000 barrier and move to its current level. BTC is up over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $115,661 after briefly crossing the $116,000 mark and reaching an intraday high of $116,287. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) rallied to cross the $4,500 level, with the price up almost 3% in the past 24 hours. The altcoin traded around $4,400 on Wednesday, crossing $4,500 and moving to $4,545. Ripple (XRP) is up over 2%, trading around $3.07, while Solana (SOL) has surged over the past 24 hours, up nearly 8%, trading around $239. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 4%, while Cardano (ADA) is up 2.10%, trading around $0.904. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. Gemini Raises $425 Million In Oversubscribed IPO Gemini’s initial public offering raised $425 million on Thursday, making it one of the strongest debuts for a digital asset platform. Gemini priced 15.2 million shares at $28 each, above its earlier guidance of $24 and $26. The final pricing indicates robust investor demand even after the exchange lifted its proposed range from $17 to $19 last week. New orders were halted ahead of pricing after the book filled at speed. “Gemini raised $425 million in an initial public offering, pricing its stock above a marketed range and shrinking the number of shares, according to a person familiar with the matter.” Gemini and its underwriters capped proceeds at $425 million, even though it could have raised $433 million. Nasdaq also committed to purchasing $50 million worth of stock in a private placement at the IPO price. The deal also sets aside 10% of shares for long-standing users, employees, and close associates. It also sets aside up to 30% for retail investors on platforms like Robinhood, SoFi, and WeBull. Dow Jones Rises After Latest Data US stocks continued pushing higher on September 11 as Wall Street digested the consumer price index (CPI) numbers for August. Data showed that consumer prices rose 0.4%. However, despite the outlook, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 170 points. The rise is significant after trading was subdued all week. Investors also pumped capital into the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. The benchmark index, which jumped to record highs, continued going higher, rising beyond 6,500. The Nasdaq Composite also rose 0.3%. Latest inflation data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the consumer price index (CPI) for August rose 0.4% against an expected 0.3%. However, the data aligns with the forecasted annual inflation rate of 0.29%. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% in August and 3.1% annually. The numbers were in line with forecasts, boosting investor sentiment. BlackRock Considering ETF Tokenization BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is exploring avenues to tokenize exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the blockchain after the strong performances of its spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to sources, Bloomberg is considering tokenizing funds with exposure to real-world assets (RWAs). However, the asset manager will need to navigate several regulatory hurdles for any such move to materialize. ETFs have become a popular investment vehicle, and now outnumber publicly-listed stocks. ETF tokenization could allow them to be traded beyond standard market hours and be used as collateral in DeFi applications. BlackRock already manages the world’s largest tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which holds $2.2 billion in assets across Ethereum, Avalanche, Aptos, Polygon, and others. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down during the ongoing session after breaching $115,000 on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied on Wednesday following the release of key data, rising over 2% to cross $113,000 and settle at $113,983. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose 1.37%, crossing $115,000 and settling at $115,540. The current session sees the price marginally down, trading around $115,252. Consumer price index (CPI) is at its highest level since January. However, jobless claims also registered a sharp jump, rising to 263,000 against the expected 235,000. “Weekly jobless claims just hit 263,000. That's the highest weekly number since October 2021.” Ongoing concerns about labor market weakness have strengthened the chances of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Markets believe there is an 11% chance the rate cut will be more than the expected 0.25%. The Koebeissi letter noted in a post on X that markets are pricing in a larger rate cut, “Markets are now pricing in 75 basis points of rate cuts by year-end. While CPI inflation continues to rise, the labor market is simply too weak to ignore. Next week will be a big week.” Prominent crypto market commentators believe a rate cut is all but imminent, with one popular trader stating, “PPI much lower than expected, CPI as expected. Conclusion: Inflation is not as bad as expected - bring on the rate cut later this month. News now behind us, time to resume the scheduled programme: higher.” Bitcoin trader BitBull stated that BTC had flipped the $113,500 resistance into support, adding that this could open the door to new all-time highs. “BTC has reclaimed a very crucial level. The $113,500 level, which acted as resistance, has now been flipped into support. Now the next key level for Bitcoin is to reclaim $117,000 level, and a new ATH will be confirmed.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday (August 29), dropping nearly 4% to $108,378. The price recovered on Saturday, rising 0.41%, but was back in the red on Sunday, falling 0.53% to settle at 108,247. Price action was positive on Monday as BTC rose almost 1% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,240. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rallied, increasing 1.84% to cross $111,000 and settling at $111,247. BTC posted a marginal increase on Wednesday, rising 0.46% to $111,756. Despite the positive sentiment, the price lost momentum on Thursday, dropping to an intraday low of $109,321 before settling at $110,720. Source: TradingView BTC rallied to an intraday high of $113,390 on Friday but could not stay at this level. As a result, it fell to $110,670, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Price action was mixed over the weekend, with BTC falling 0.41% on Saturday and settling at $110,212. It recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 1% to reclaim $111,000 and settle at $111,129. Buyers retained control on Monday as BTC reached an intraday high of $112,940. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to $112,072, ultimately rising 0.85%. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping 0.47% to $111,549. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $113,000 and settle at $113,983. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose 1.37% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,540. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $115,123. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has reclaimed the $4,500 level as its steady climb continues. The altcoin rose 2.57% on Thursday and settled at $4,460. Buyers retained control during the ongoing session, helping ETH cross $4,500 and move to its current level of $4,522. ETH has traded in a narrow range for the past two weeks, entering a consolidation period after setting a new all-time high of $4,956 on August 24. ETH holders are assessing the possibility of further bullish momentum as the S&P 500 reached a new all-time high on Thursday. ETH futures are currently trading at a 5% premium compared to standard spot markets. This indicates low demand from leverage buyers. Futures premiums typically range between 5% and 10% in neutral market conditions. Even the August rally past $4,800 failed to ignite sustained bullish sentiment among traders. The bearish trend also coincides with 10 consecutive days of net outflows from Ethereum ETFs. The trend reversed on Monday, followed by $216 million in inflows on Tuesday and Wednesday. However, it failed to generate market momentum, casting doubt on the altcoin’s ability to reach $5,000 this year. Despite ETH’s sluggish momentum and low on-chain activity, investors continue to scoop up the asset and shore up their reserves. BitMine Immersion Tech purchased 202,500 ETH over the past week, according to Strategic ETH Reserve Data. The investment vehicle holds over $9.1 billion in ETH. ETH registered a notable drop on Friday (August 29), falling over 3% to $4,362. The price recovered over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Saturday and Sunday to settle at $4,394. However, it returned to bearish territory on Monday, dropping 1.79% to $4,315. ETH registered a marginal recovery on Tuesday before rising almost 3% on Wednesday to cross $4,400 and settle at $4,453. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH registered a sharp fall on Thursday, dropping 3.47% to $4,299. The price faced volatility on Friday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as ETH registered a marginal drop on Saturday before rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $4,306. The altcoin started the current week with only a marginal increase, rising to $4,308. Price action remained subdued on Tuesday as ETH rose to $4,310. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose almost 1% to $4,348. Sentiment improved on Thursday as ETH rose 2.57% to cross $4,400 and settle at $4,460. The current session sees the price up 1.30%, trading around $4,518. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis There is significant bullish sentiment around Solana (SOL) as it continues its ascent. The altcoin has traded in positive territory all week and breached $230 during the ongoing session. SOL is up over 4% during the ongoing session, trading around $238. Solana’s performance has pushed its market capitalization to $129 billion, helping it surpass Binance Coin (BNB) to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. Daily trading volumes have also spiked, indicating heightened investor activity. Analysts and market watchers believe crucial technological upgrades and upcoming ETFs could push SOL even higher. Upcoming ETF approvals could lead to capital inflows, while improvements in transaction speed could enhance network adoption. Crypto commentator Lark Davis highlighted the bullish momentum around SOL, stating that ETF approvals, treasury purchases, and technological upgrades were major catalysts. “SOL feels like it's lining up for the trade of the cycle. Bitwise's CEO Matt Hougan thinks SOL could be in a position similar to when BTC was at $40,000 and ETH was at $1,600. Meaning, Solana’s bullish tailwinds could ignite a 3X in price within a short matter of time.” SOL price action was bearish last weekend as it fell over 4% on Friday (August 29) and settled at $205. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell 1.17% to $202. SOL continued falling on Sunday, dropping 0.99% and settling at $200. Sellers retained control on Monday as the price fell almost 2%, slipping below $200 and settling at $197. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, SOL recovered on Tuesday, rising over 6% to reclaim $200 and settle at $209. The price continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising 0.60% to $210. Selling pressure returned on Thursday as SOL fell over 4% to $202. The price rallied to an intraday high of $210 on Friday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $203, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Source: TradingView SOL started the weekend in the red, dropping 1.55% to $200. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to $206. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rose nearly 4% and settled at $214. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as SOL rose 1.48% and settled at $217. The price continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising over 3% to cross $220 and settle at $223.

In the past week, shark wallets filled up with 65,000 BTC, surpassing the buying of ETFs and treasuries. Shark wallets are one of the biggest accumulators of BTC. In the past week, those wallets absorbed 65,000 BTC, surpassing ETFs and treasury purchases . For the past week, ETFs added an estimated 17,767 BTC, while companies added 12,573 BTC. More BTC is flowing into wallets holding 100-1,000 coins, on demand for self-custody and silent accumulation. | Source: Newhedge While there may be an overlap between corporate wallets and shark wallets, the larger inflows suggest a period of silent accumulation, not linked to any widely known organization or corporation. Shark wallets signal accumulation before BTC rallies Shark wallets have grown in both number and absolute holdings in the past year. Based on CryptoQuant data, shark wallets are the biggest factor for a supply squeeze. For the past 12 months, over 3,000 new shark wallets were created, for a total of 16,430 shark addresses in September. Accumulation in those wallets also accelerated in the past few days. In total, shark wallets hold around 3.8% of the BTC supply, as a mix of potential corporate entities, retail, and whales, with the intention of trading or holding. Treasury-building whales may be showing some signs of fatigue , but this does not affect shark wallets, which accelerated their buying in September. According to CryptoQuant , shark wallets boost two major trends – outflows from exchanges and long-term holding. Medium-range buyers suggest some of the coins on exchanges may be sent to self-custodied wallets for long-term storage. Even for treasuries, the cut-off BTC ownership is now up to 83 BTC , close to the range of the smaller shark wallets. Regular sharks are thus getting close to the range of treasury holders, adding to the narrative of long-term storage value for BTC. BTC flows out of exchanges, but Binance deposits grow The total supply of BTC available on exchanges has fallen further to 2.4M coins. This includes all markets, even smaller platforms with a worse reputation. BTC withdrawals may be due to demand for self-custody or a shift to derivative trading. Spot exchanges hold a little over 1M BTC , comparable to the reserves of corporate buyers. The buying in the past year is seen as adding to the supply squeeze, as whales and long-term holders have not shown capitulation, except for limited strategic selling. Reserves are at an all-time low, with miners also holding onto their recently produced coins. Buying behavior can also switch within days. Previously, BTC and crypto showed a dominance of market takers for sale orders. However, as BTC showed signs of recovery, market taker volume switched to buying , loading up on available coins. The 2025 bull market comes with increased institutional and whale activity. There are still no decisive signs of retail activity, which were observed during the last stages of previous bull markets. Based on the spot market heatmap, traders are also ready to buy the dip, establishing a strong support around $112,000 per BTC. While some traders paid attention to altcoins , BTC sees silent accumulation in preparation for the next expansion cycle.

BITO with Bitcoin Futures offers an attractive income-focused alternative to spot Bitcoin ETFs, with ultra-high yield (e.g., 52%) and monthly distributions. BITO features a relatively lower volatility and active options for risk management, such as PUT protection and income enhancement. BITO is well-suited for investors seeking great total returns with exposure to Bitcoin's upside in 2025 and beyond, with flexibility to manage risk and income actively. Introduction The rate-cut cycle is bullish for Bitcoin. The Fed is very likely to cut the rate in September, and possibly more cuts are to come later in 2025 and 2026. The Fed could restart the rate cut cycle, which was initiated about one year ago when the Fed had a 50bps cut, but has kept the rate unchanged since. I expect Bitcoin to receive strong tailwinds, and the crypto market could move upward. One way to play this trend is to buy ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ), which is a Bitcoin futures tracking ETF and a good alternative to the direct spot coin ETFs. BITO's income focus is also attractive to income investors and growth investors who might feel more comfortable receiving an immediate outcome from investing in cryptocurrency. There are also some interesting features of the BITO ETF that are available for investors to explore and manage the risks as well as the total return. BITO ETF Overview BITO is an income ETF actively managed by ProShares. BITO is actually the first ETF in the US that is tied to Bitcoin, according to its official website . The ETF deploys Bitcoin Futures contracts to generate income with a current yield estimated at 52.00%. The ETF portfolio is not complicated. The details of the holdings are shown below. BITO ETF Holdings (ProShares) We can see that CME Bitcoin futures contracts account for over 95% of the weight. This represents the bulk of the ETF's exposures in Bitcoin. The fund uses a yield-rolling strategy to generate income by selling expiring contracts and buying new ones. This is different from some of the Bitcoin income ETFs that are based on selling covered call options to receive the option premium. However, it is interesting to note that the future contracts could generate ultra-high yield (e.g., 52%), pretty much comparable to option income ETFs. On the other hand, the distributions vary greatly over time, as shown below. I suspect the volatility of Bitcoin has certain impacts on the future contracts, causing such variances. BITO Dividend History (SA) The distribution rates, however, have been consistently in high double digits, mostly ranging from 30% to 90%. BITO's expense ratio is 0.95%, which is the lowest in the following selected group of peer ETFs using the option-income strategy. Two of them were recently covered by my previous ratings. Note that, given the limited time period specified to include the newer ETFs, BITO has the best total returns. The first 3 are actually pretty close at around 55% for the past 10 months. I believe that the small difference in the expense ratio may play some role here because the others have higher expense ratios, as indicated in the list. BITO and other Bitcoin ETFs (SA) BITO was started on October 18, 2021. It has grown to an ETF with an AUM of $2.7 billion, which is quite a significant size in the Bitcoin space. It Is The Right Time To Invest In Bitcoin For The Rate-Cut Cycle I have provided the analysis of the long-term outlook for the Bitcoin market in my previous write-ups. The point is that the bitcoin market could grow to be a multifold bigger market than the current $2.2 trillion. This is the key fundamental thesis for a long-term investment. On the other hand, the high volatility of Bitcoin and its early speculative hype a few years ago have kept many investors on the sidelines of this huge market. However, the upcoming rate-cut cycle, which may start this month according to the recent market consensus, should serve as a ""green"" light for those investors who still believe in the long-term prosperity of currency digitalization. Keep in mind that lower rates tend to weaken the US dollar, which could lift the demand for Bitcoin as a non-sovereign alternative. The Bitcoin futures should also benefit accordingly. The Increasing Crypto Adoption Is A Strong Tailwind The crypto adoption process from the institutions has been picking up momentum in 2025, driven by factors like regulatory clarity and the pursuit of efficiency and innovation from utilizing blockchain technology. From the investment perspective, I think the Bitcoin volatility has been converging to more market-driven behavior, other than the ultra speculative nature observed in the Bitcoin market in the early years. I believe this is one of the reasons why Bitcoin is even viewed as the beta to the broader equity market by a highly influential Wall Street strategist, Fundstrat's head of research, Tom Lee. He actually suggested that Bitcoin could "" get to $200,000 before year-end."" This would be a huge catalyst for the Bitcoin market. My view is that, regardless of the actual price target, it is the bullish trend that will matter the most to the ETFs like BITO, which lives on the monetization of the Bitcoin volatility. In many ways, the income ETF may serve as a more reasonable holding for this type of risk asset class. For example, if the rate-cut cycle does not progress as expected, investors will have the ultra-high income already collected, and investors will also have much flexibility in hand to determine when and how to reinvest the income. BITO Is A Popular Income Alternative The recent August 2025 executive order has eased regulatory restrictions on including cryptocurrency in 401(k) plans. This will undoubtedly open the door for crypto investments for retirement investments, such as pension funds, etc. I believe that the ETFs with a crypto income yield focus could be among the favorites. For individual investors, BITO appears to be a more interesting solution for a few reasons below. My research shows that the BITO ETF actually appears to be more popular than some of the larger Bitcoin spot ETFs, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). The trading volume for BITO is over 9 million shares, while GBTC is about 1.7 million (the recent trading day), but with a much larger AUM of $19.81 billion, almost 8 times BITO's AUM. The volatility is lower for BITO, which is a plus for the volatile bitcoin market. In addition, there are actively traded options for BITO. The following is a snapshot of the weekly option chains. We see that the volumes are good for trading. BITO Option Chain (SA) Note that the options can be used to generate extra income by selling covered calls. More importantly, investors can use the PUT options to place protection if needed. The protective PUTs are often good hedging tools against the market drawdowns. This is particularly handy for this type of ETF that would perform very badly under the bearish scenarios. Such a safety feature may prove very important for a retirement investment. The total return of the BITO ETF has been very good for the past year, as shown below. BITO has been tracking the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF( IBIT ) closely. Keep in mind that IBIT, with AUM over 80 billion, is one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin ETF Total Returns (SA) From the above chart, one can also observe the ""equity beta"" nature of the Bitcoin ETF as mentioned earlier. Both Bitcoin ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 index significantly in the past 12 months. Risks And Caveats As an ETF of Bitcoin Futures, BITO gains and losses are treated as 60% long-term gain and 40% short-term gain regardless of the holding time, under the Section 1256 tax code. Notice that the short-term gain may result in high tax liabilities. This could be very undesirable for investors, especially considering the high-yield nature. I have my BITO positions in my Roth IRA account to avoid such an issue. The BITO is less volatile than the spot coin ETF. Nevertheless, it is still on the high end of the ETF volatility spectrum. The ETF is considered a risky asset class. The macro backdrop for Bitcoin has turned more supportive over the last 12 months or so. But the uncertainty in the rate cut and the progress of the institution adoption remains high. These unknown factors may cause the drawdowns or even a downtrend for Bitcoin. These tend to cause substantial NAV erosions for the BITO ETF. Closing Thoughts Bitcoin may enter a bull trend thanks to the rate-cut cycle and the increasing institutional adoption. The income approach of Bitcoin can be a good alternative for Bitcoin investment. I start a BUY rating on BITO and recommend it to investors who are interested in playing the possible bullish trend of Bitcoin in 2025 and for the longer term. Individuals who would like to actively manage the risk and income using the ETF's weekly active options may find the ETF a more manageable holding.",BITO,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-12 13:36:23

Az írás pillanatában azonban a bikák ismét visszatérnek a piacra. A nagyobb piaci kapitalizációval rendelkező altcoinok többsége napi szinten viszonylag gyenge teljesítményt mutat, de számos közepes és kisebb token jelentős növekedést tapasztal. A Bitcoin ismét a 113 000 USD felé tart A legnagyobb kriptovaluta az elmúlt napokban fokozott eladói nyomásnak volt kitéve a 113 000 USD szint körül. Emlékeztetőül: múlt pénteken, az Egyesült Államok legfrissebb foglalkoztatási jelentésének közzététele után, pontosan erre a szintre ugrott, sőt rövid időre át is lépte azt. Azonban azonnal visszautasítás következett, és kevesebb mint egy óra alatt több mint háromezer dollárt zuhant. Néhány napos konszolidációt követően 110 500 USD körül a bikák ismét támadásba lendültek – először hétfőn, majd kedden erőteljesebben –, és a Bitcoin árfolyamát 113 200 USD-ig emelték. A forgatókönyv azonban megismétlődött, a medvék ismét átvették az irányítást, és megakadályozták az áttörést. Az azt követő órákban a digitális eszköz 110 800 USD-ig esett (a Bitstamp tőzsdén), mielőtt a bikák ismét visszatértek volna. Szerdán reggel újabb emelkedést indítottak, amely majdnem visszanyomta a BTC-t a 113 000 USD szint közelébe az írás pillanatában. A CoinGecko adatai szerint piaci kapitalizációja 2,25 billió USD alá csökkent, míg az altcoinok feletti dominanciája 56,1%-on áll. Ezek az alty rakétaként emelkednek Amint fentebb említettük, a nagyobb piaci kapitalizációjú altcoinok többsége az elmúlt 24 órában nem tudott jelentős mozgásokat felmutatni.

Bitcoin Hyper (HYPE) ma a legnagyobb figyelmet kapta, lenyűgöző, 33%-os növekedéssel, amellyel átlépte a 0,037 USD szintet. További jelentős emelkedést könyvelhetett el az IP (+21 %), PUMP (+14 %) és MNT (+12,5 %) is, amelyek zárják a kétszámjegyű nyereséget elérő klubot.

An address directly associated with Circle, the issuer of the popular stablecoin USDC, has made a substantial purchase. This strategic move involved acquiring 80,000 HYPE tokens, valued at an impressive $4.6 million. This development, first brought to light by the astute on-chain analyst MLM, suggests a deeper strategy at play. It aligns with ongoing testing of USDC on the HyperEVM mainnet. This active testing phase could very well pave the way for a native USDC launch on the network in the near future, marking a crucial step for both Circle and HyperEVM. Understanding the Strategic Circle HYPE Investment When an entity as prominent as Circle makes such a considerable acquisition, it’s rarely a random event. This particular Circle HYPE investment signifies a clear interest in the HyperEVM ecosystem. The analyst’s observations are critical here, as they connect the dots between the HYPE token purchase and the broader USDC integration efforts. Circle, known for its commitment to expanding USDC’s reach across various blockchain networks, continuously seeks new avenues for growth and utility. This investment in HYPE tokens is a strong indicator of their confidence in HyperEVM’s potential. It suggests that Circle views HyperEVM as a viable and valuable platform for its stablecoin. What Does HyperEVM Bring to the Table? HyperEVM is a burgeoning blockchain network that aims to offer a scalable and efficient environment for decentralized applications (dApps). The prospect of a native USDC launch on HyperEVM is a game-changer. Here’s why: Enhanced Liquidity: A native USDC would significantly boost the network’s liquidity, making it more attractive for traders and investors. Increased Utility: Developers on HyperEVM could seamlessly integrate USDC into their dApps, expanding their functionality and appeal. Broader Adoption: The presence of a major stablecoin like USDC often acts as a magnet, drawing more users and projects to the network. Reduced Friction: Native integration means fewer bridges and less complexity for users moving USDC to and from HyperEVM. The current USDC testing on the HyperEVM mainnet is a vital precursor to this potential launch. These tests ensure stability, security, and seamless operation before a full rollout. This diligent approach underlines Circle’s commitment to reliability, which is a cornerstone of the EEAT policy. The Broader Implications of This Circle HYPE Investment Circle’s strategy is consistently about extending USDC’s footprint to as many blockchain ecosystems as possible. This approach solidifies USDC’s position as a leading digital dollar and provides users with more choices for fast, low-cost transactions. The Circle HYPE investment fits perfectly into this overarching vision. For the HyperEVM community, this is undeniably positive news. It validates the network’s technology and its potential to attract significant players in the crypto space. The infusion of a widely trusted stablecoin like USDC can accelerate HyperEVM’s development and user growth, fostering a more robust and dynamic ecosystem. Furthermore, such strategic investments by major stablecoin issuers often trigger a ripple effect. Other projects and institutional investors might take note, potentially leading to further capital inflow and innovation within the HyperEVM network. This move could therefore be a catalyst for broader ecosystem development. What’s Next for USDC and HyperEVM After This Investment? While a native USDC launch is not yet confirmed, the signals are strong. If it proceeds, we can anticipate a period of rapid growth for HyperEVM. Users can expect: More accessible and efficient stablecoin transactions. New dApps and financial services leveraging native USDC. Increased overall activity and trading volume on the network. This Circle HYPE investment is more than just a transaction; it’s a statement. It underscores the continuous evolution of the crypto landscape, where stablecoins play a pivotal role in connecting diverse blockchain networks. As the digital economy matures, strategic integrations like this become increasingly important for fostering interoperability and widespread adoption. The coming months will be crucial in observing how these developments unfold. The crypto community will be watching closely to see the full impact of Circle’s strategic interest in HyperEVM and its HYPE token. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Stablecoins The recent Circle HYPE investment is a compelling indicator of the stablecoin giant’s strategic direction. It highlights a proactive approach to expanding USDC’s presence and solidifying its role as a foundational asset across emerging blockchain networks. The ongoing USDC testing on HyperEVM, coupled with this significant token purchase, paints a clear picture of potential future integration. This development is not just about a single transaction; it represents a forward-looking step that could unlock new possibilities for HyperEVM and its users. As the digital finance ecosystem continues to evolve, strategic alliances and native integrations will remain key drivers of innovation and accessibility. Keep an eye on HyperEVM, as it might soon become a new hub for native USDC activity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the significance of the Circle-linked address buying HYPE tokens?

According to a Financial Times report , the UK’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder with over £200 million in crypto reserves made the revelation despite its shares plummeting 73% from their mid-June peak. Founder Andrew Webley told the publication that “ there’s one that’s very attractive, there’s one that I’ve got my sights on at the moment, “ though he declined to name the acquisition target. The Bristol-based firm would “certainly consider” snapping up other companies for their Bitcoin at a discount, Webley explained, as some crypto treasury companies now trade below the value of their Bitcoin holdings. Pleased to see The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F) covered in the @ft today UK’s biggest bitcoin buyer eyes struggling rivals and FTSE 100 berth https://t.co/XPYg7ARjRl — Andrew Webley (@asjwebley) September 12, 2025 Strategic Accumulation Amid Market Turbulence Smarter Web has undergone a dramatic transformation from its origins as a website design business, pivoting heavily toward Bitcoin accumulation throughout 2025 under what the company calls “The 10 Year Plan.” The firm currently holds 2,470 Bitcoin worth approximately £200 million, having crossed the 2,000 BTC milestone in July after purchasing 225 additional coins for £19.9 million. This aggressive strategy has generated what the company describes as a 49,198% year-to-date Bitcoin yield, positioning Smarter Web among the top 25 global corporate Bitcoin holders despite maintaining just £500,000 in remaining treasury cash. The company’s accumulation efforts have been financed through innovative debt structures, including the UK’s first Bitcoin-denominated convertible bond worth $21 million issued to Paris-based TOBAM in August. Unlike traditional convertible bonds, this structure denominates the principal repayment amount in Bitcoin while keeping the conversion share price fixed at £2.05, representing a 5% premium to the stock’s closing price at the time. Smarter Web Company’s Stock Performance (Source: Google Finance ) Webley acknowledged the dramatic valuation swings, telling the publication that “we probably got overvalued and now we’re almost certainly undervalued,” while expressing concern for shareholders who have experienced the volatility. Despite the share price correction, the company briefly achieved a £1 billion market capitalization over the summer and has gained approximately 150% year-to-date, outperforming all but one company in the FTSE 350. The firm appointed Albert Soleiman, former CFO of trading group CMC Markets, as chief financial officer last week as it pursues institutional investor interest and FTSE 100 ambitions. UK Treasury Company Wave Meets Market Skepticism Smarter Web’s acquisition strategy emerges within a broader wave of UK-listed companies adopting Bitcoin treasury models, with at least nine firms announcing similar strategy in recent months. These companies have followed the playbook pioneered by Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which has accumulated over 638,460 BTC and achieved a market capitalization exceeding $90 billion since first purchasing the cryptocurrency in 2020. The UK movement includes firms ranging from AI services provider Tao Alpha, which disclosed plans to raise £100 million for Bitcoin purchases, to natural resources company Panther Metals, whose shares surged 81% after buying a single Bitcoin. However, market analysts have raised concerns about the sustainability and strategic clarity of the crypto treasury trend as hundreds of companies worldwide race to accumulate digital assets. Eric Benoist, tech and data research specialist at Natixis CIB, warned that “the story is starting to become less attractive to mainstream investors,” noting that “there’s still no clear end game to this strategy.” The broader corporate Bitcoin treasury movement has seen over 325 entities accumulate 3.71 million Bitcoin collectively, as per BitcoinTreasuries data , even though some industry observers question whether the market has reached saturation. Source: BitcoinTreasuries Galaxy Digital’s Michael Novogratz had previously suggested that the market may have reached “peak treasury company issuance,” while VanEck’s Matthew Sigel warned that companies issuing shares near their Bitcoin net asset value risk creating “erosion” rather than capital formation. If executed well, Smarter Web’s acquisition strategy could bring a new paradigm in the space, potentially allowing successful treasury companies to consolidate Bitcoin holdings from struggling competitors at favorable valuations. The approach mirrors historical debt-financed asset acquisition strategies, where savvy investors have borrowed in depreciating currencies to purchase scarce assets during market downturns.

According to an official announcement on Binance's X social media account, trading will open on September 13, with eligible users able to claim their token airdrop through the Binance Alpha Points system on the Alpha Events page immediately after trading begins. The launch follows a successful pre-seed funding round led by Wave Digital Assets, a digital asset manager with over $1 billion in assets under management. STBL represents the governance token of a unique stablecoin ecosystem founded by Reeve Collins, co-founder of Tether. At the core of the ecosystem is USST, a stablecoin backed by real-world assets (RWA), including tokenized Treasury bonds and money market funds. The revolutionary ""yield splitting"" mechanism allows users to receive two assets when minting USST: the stable token itself and YLD — a token representing the right to yield from deposited assets. This means holders can utilize their funds in DeFi strategies without losing yield from the underlying assets — an innovation that could change the game in the stablecoin market. The project's tokenomics provides for a maximum emission of 10 billion STBL tokens, which will be used to govern protocol parameters, reserves, and reward distribution within the ecosystem. The STBL launch on Binance Alpha comes at a critical moment in the stablecoin market's development, as investors seek transparent and yield-generating alternatives to traditional stable coins. The project is positioned as ""institutional-grade stablecoin infrastructure,"" aimed at attracting institutional investors through a combination of on-chain governance transparency and reliable real-world asset backing. The Binance Alpha listing opens several key opportunities for investors. First, early access to the governance token of an ecosystem that could become the next generation of yield-bearing stablecoins. Second, participation in the airdrop through the Alpha Points system provides an opportunity to obtain tokens on favorable terms. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a recent announcement on the platform's X account, it was revealed that trading will commence on September 13. Following the launch, users who qualify can obtain their token airdrop via the Binance Alpha Points system accessed on the Alpha Events page. The Significance of STBL STBL is more than just a governance token; it represents a fundamental shift in the stablecoin paradigm, created by Reeve Collins, a Tether co-founder. The ecosystem centers around USST, a stablecoin supported by real-world assets such as tokenized Treasury bonds and money market funds. This ecosystem introduces a pioneering ""yield splitting"" mechanism, enabling minters of USST to receive both the stablecoin and YLD—a token that signifies entitlement to yields from the assets used. This dual-benefit system allows for engaging in decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies while capturing earnings from the base assets. Such innovations could significantly influence the stablecoin landscape. Project Tokenomics and Market Opportunities The STBL tokenomics envisages a cap of 10 billion tokens which will play critical roles in managing protocol parameters, reserve holdings, and distributing rewards within its ecosystem. This launch by Binance Alpha arrives at a pivotal time for the stablecoin industry, especially as market participants are on the lookout for yield-generative, transparent alternatives to traditional options. Labeled as ""institutional-grade stablecoin infrastructure,"" the project is tailored to attract institutional investors by merging on-chain governance transparency with solid asset backing. For investors, this listing means early access to a promising governance token and a chance to participate in potentially lucrative airdrops via the Alpha Points system.

The financial world opened its trading day with a fascinating display of divergence as US stock indexes presented a truly mixed picture. This immediate split in performance has naturally drawn significant attention, prompting investors and analysts alike to ponder the underlying forces at play. While two of the major benchmarks saw slight declines, one managed to push ahead, signaling a nuanced market environment rather than a uniform trend. Unpacking the Initial Moves: S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq At the opening bell, the S&P 500, widely regarded as a barometer for the broader market, registered a modest dip of 0.02%. This index tracks 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, so even small movements can reflect widespread sentiment. Similarly, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, which focuses on 30 significant U.S. companies, experienced a 0.15% decline. These slight downturns often suggest a degree of caution among investors, perhaps influenced by recent economic data or specific corporate news. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, managed to climb by 0.21%. This upward momentum highlights a continued appetite for innovation and high-growth sectors, even when other parts of the market appear to be struggling. Such a mixed opening for US stock indexes is not unusual; it frequently indicates a market in a state of re-evaluation, where different sectors respond uniquely to various economic and corporate catalysts. What’s Fueling the Divergence in US Stock Indexes? Understanding the reasons behind these mixed signals is crucial for any investor. Several key factors typically influence the performance of US stock indexes : Economic Indicators: Reports on inflation, employment figures, and consumer spending can significantly sway market sentiment. Stronger-than-expected inflation might prompt concerns about interest rate hikes, while robust job growth could signal economic resilience. Corporate Earnings: The financial health of individual companies plays a massive role. Strong earnings reports from major tech firms can bolster the Nasdaq, while disappointing results from industrial giants might weigh on the Dow and S&P 500. Interest Rate Expectations: The Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates is a constant market mover. Expectations of higher rates can make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth and impacting valuations across all indexes. Geopolitical Landscape: Global events, from international trade relations to political stability, can introduce unexpected volatility. These external factors often create uncertainty, leading to cautious trading behaviors. These elements intertwine, creating a complex web of influences that shape how each major index performs on any given day. The Broader Impact: Why These US Stock Indexes Matter to Every Investor The performance of US stock indexes extends beyond mere numbers on a screen; it provides a pulse on the broader economic health and investor confidence. When markets are mixed, it can signal a period of sector rotation, where capital moves from one industry to another based on perceived growth opportunities or risks. For instance, if investors are flocking to tech stocks (boosting Nasdaq), they might be pulling funds from more traditional, value-oriented companies (potentially impacting the Dow). Moreover, traditional market movements can indirectly influence other asset classes, including alternative investments. A generally cautious sentiment in the stock market might lead some investors to seek safer havens, while others might view it as an opportunity to diversify into less correlated assets. This dynamic interplay underscores the interconnectedness of the global financial system, making the performance of major US stock indexes relevant to a wide spectrum of financial participants. Navigating Uncertainty: Strategies for Monitoring US Stock Indexes In an environment characterized by mixed signals, investors must adopt a strategic approach. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Regularly follow financial news, economic reports, and company earnings announcements. Understanding the ‘why’ behind market movements is critical. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies can help mitigate risks associated with specific market downturns. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are a natural part of market cycles. Focusing on long-term financial goals can help temper reactions to daily market volatility. Re-evaluate Risk Tolerance: Periodically assess your comfort level with risk. A mixed market might prompt a re-think of your investment strategy to align with your personal financial goals. By implementing these strategies, investors can better position themselves to navigate the complexities and opportunities presented by the ever-evolving landscape of US stock indexes . Conclusion: What Lies Ahead for US Stock Indexes? Today’s mixed opening for the US stock indexes underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of financial markets. While some sectors demonstrate robust growth, others face headwinds, creating a nuanced picture for investors. This period of divergence demands careful observation and informed decision-making. The coming days and weeks will undoubtedly bring more data and corporate news, which will further shape market sentiment and potentially reveal a clearer trend. Staying educated and maintaining a well-thought-out investment strategy remains paramount in these fascinating times. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when US stock indexes open mixed? A1: A mixed opening means that while some major indexes (like the Nasdaq) are up, others (like the S&P 500 and Dow) are down. It indicates divergent sentiment across different market sectors or types of companies, rather than a uniform market direction. Q2: Why is the Nasdaq often stronger when other indexes are down? A2: The Nasdaq Composite is heavily weighted towards technology and growth companies. These companies can sometimes perform well even when broader economic concerns weigh on more traditional industries, as investors remain optimistic about innovation and future earnings potential. Q3: How do interest rates affect US stock indexes? A3: Higher interest rates can make borrowing more expensive for companies and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth. This can lead to lower corporate profits and reduced investor appetite for stocks, generally putting downward pressure on all US stock indexes . Q4: Should I be concerned about a mixed market opening? A4: A mixed opening is a normal part of market cycles and doesn’t necessarily warrant immediate concern. It’s an indication that different parts of the economy are performing differently. Investors should focus on their long-term goals and a diversified portfolio rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. Q5: How can I stay informed about US stock indexes? A5: To stay informed, regularly read reputable financial news sources, follow economic data releases (like inflation and employment reports), and keep track of corporate earnings announcements. Many financial platforms offer real-time market data and analysis. Q6: Does the performance of US stock indexes impact cryptocurrency markets? A6: While not directly correlated, there can be indirect influences. Broad market sentiment, investor risk appetite, and liquidity in traditional financial markets can sometimes spill over into alternative asset classes like cryptocurrencies.

But first, let’s rewind the clocks to last weekend when the primary cryptocurrency was struggling a lot. At the time, the asset, perhaps living up to the bearish September projections , failed to maintain above $112,000 and tested the $110,000 support on a couple of occasions on Saturday and Sunday. The bulls ultimately managed to defend that level and went on the offensive as the week progressed. At first, BTC climbed to $111,500 on Monday and beyond $113,000 on Tuesday, but it faced immediate rejections, the second of which pushed it south below $111,000 once again. However, bitcoin bounced off once again and jumped to $114,000 on Wednesday and Thursday, ahead of the CPI announcements from the United States. Once that data came out, and it became known that reality and expectations met in an almost perfect match, BTC reacted with instant volatility that drove it up and down by a grand in each direction. Overall, though, the stats were regarded as bullish since the US Federal Reserve is expected to lower the key interest rates next week. Consequently, bitcoin jumped once again and surged to a multi-week peak of $116,400 earlier this morning. It has lost some momentum since then and sits around $115,000 as of press time, which means that it has gained over 1.6% on a weekly scale. This pales in comparison to some altcoins, which have charted double-digit gains, such as DOGE, SOL, and HYPE. In fact, HYPE skyrocketed to a new all-time high this week at over $57. BNB also set a record of its own at $910. Other massive weekly gainers include MNT, M, and, of course, MYX (1,260% surge since last Friday!).

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the visionary founders of Gemini, have made an audacious forecast: Bitcoin $1 Million within the next decade. This isn’t just a hopeful wish; it’s a deeply considered outlook from figures who have been at the forefront of the digital asset revolution for years. Their insights, shared in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, offer a compelling glimpse into what they believe is Bitcoin’s inevitable trajectory. What Fuels the Bitcoin $1 Million Vision? At the heart of the Winklevoss brothers’ prediction is their powerful analogy: Bitcoin as ‘Gold 2.0’. Tyler Winklevoss passionately argues that Bitcoin is poised to displace traditional gold as the premier global store of value. This isn’t merely about a new digital asset; it’s about a fundamental shift in how we perceive and secure wealth in the modern era. Consider these key points: Digital Scarcity: Like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply, capped at 21 million coins. However, unlike gold, its scarcity is provable and unalterable through its underlying code. Portability & Divisibility: Bitcoin can be sent across the globe in minutes and divided into tiny fractions, making it far more practical for everyday use and international transfers than physical gold. Decentralization: No single government or entity controls Bitcoin, offering a level of censorship resistance and independence that gold, often subject to confiscation, cannot match. If Bitcoin successfully captures even a significant portion of gold’s multi-trillion-dollar market capitalization, the path to Bitcoin $1 Million becomes clearer. The brothers believe this transition is not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’ driven by Bitcoin’s superior characteristics for the digital age. Are We Still in Bitcoin’s Early Innings? Tyler Winklevoss used a compelling baseball analogy to describe Bitcoin’s current market position. He suggested that we are still in the very early stages of this technological and financial revolution. Imagine looking back a decade from now; today’s prices might seem like a mere whisper of what’s to come. This perspective encourages a long-term view for investors. While market volatility is a natural part of any nascent asset class, the underlying fundamentals supporting Bitcoin’s growth remain robust. Factors contributing to this long-term optimism include: Growing Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign nations are increasingly exploring and investing in Bitcoin. Technological Advancements: Innovations like the Lightning Network are enhancing Bitcoin’s scalability and utility for micro-transactions. Increasing Public Awareness: As more people understand Bitcoin’s value proposition, its network effect strengthens, driving further adoption and demand. The journey to Bitcoin $1 Million is anticipated to be a marathon, not a sprint, requiring patience and a belief in its transformative power. Navigating the Path to Bitcoin $1 Million: Challenges and Opportunities While the prospect of Bitcoin $1 Million is exhilarating, it’s important to acknowledge that the journey won’t be without its challenges. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving globally. However, these hurdles are often viewed as temporary growing pains for a revolutionary technology. For those considering their position in this evolving market, here are some actionable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Embrace the ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) philosophy, focusing on Bitcoin’s long-term potential rather than short-term price fluctuations. Diversification: While Bitcoin may be a cornerstone, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Education: Continuously learn about Bitcoin’s technology, its role in the global economy, and market trends. The Winklevoss brothers’ prediction serves as a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s potential to reshape the financial world. As the digital economy continues to expand, the demand for a decentralized, secure, and globally accessible store of value like Bitcoin is only set to grow. The Winklevoss brothers’ bold prediction of Bitcoin $1 Million within a decade paints a vivid picture of a future where digital assets dominate. Their ‘Gold 2.0’ thesis highlights Bitcoin’s superior attributes for the modern age, suggesting an inevitable shift in global wealth storage. While the path ahead may have its ups and downs, their insights encourage a long-term, optimistic view, positioning current times as just the beginning of Bitcoin’s remarkable journey. It’s a testament to the enduring belief in Bitcoin’s power to revolutionize finance and empower individuals worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the core reason the Winklevoss brothers predict Bitcoin $1 Million? A1: They believe Bitcoin will replace gold as the primary global store of value due to its superior digital properties, such as provable scarcity, portability, and decentralization. Q2: What does ‘Gold 2.0’ mean in the context of Bitcoin? A2: ‘Gold 2.0’ refers to Bitcoin’s role as an improved, digital version of gold. It offers the same store-of-value properties but with enhanced features like easier transferability, divisibility, and resistance to censorship, making it more suitable for the digital age. Q3: How realistic is the Bitcoin $1 Million prediction? A3: While ambitious, the prediction is based on Bitcoin potentially absorbing a significant portion of gold’s market capitalization. Many analysts and proponents share a long-term bullish outlook, though market dynamics and adoption rates will play a crucial role. Q4: What challenges might Bitcoin face on its way to $1 Million? A4: Potential challenges include market volatility, evolving regulatory environments, technological scaling issues (though solutions like the Lightning Network are addressing these), and competition from other digital assets. Q5: What does the ‘early innings’ analogy imply for investors? A5: It suggests that Bitcoin’s full potential is yet to be realized, and current prices may be considered low in the grand scheme of its long-term growth trajectory. It encourages a long-term investment strategy rather than focusing on short-term gains or losses. Did you find this deep dive into the Bitcoin $1 Million prediction insightful?

Daily trading volume also rose more than 5% to $54.13 billion, fueled by steady institutional inflows and greater liquidity, both of which signalled renewed confidence among short-term traders and long-term holders alike. With a volume-to-market-cap ratio of 2.36%, the so-called digital gold remains dominant in the market, its future outlook remaining bullish on multiple grounds. The question is: just how high can Bitcoin go this year and by the end of the decade? To shed light on these projections, Finbold examined forecasts from leading voices in the crypto market for the flagship digital asset over the next four years. Bitcoin price prediction 2026 At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $115,090, up nearly 1% on the daily chart and seemingly well positioned for growth from a technical perspective. BTC price. Source: Finbold Namely, the asset has reclaimed the $114,000 resistance level, which now acts as support. Likewise, it is trading firmly above key simple moving averages ( SMA ), with the 7-day SMA at $112,158 and the 200-day SMA at $102,081. Momentum indicators are likewise positive, the relative strength index ( RSI ) sitting at 58.08, reflecting neutral momentum, and the moving average/convergence divergence ( MACD ) rising histogram (663.57) pointing to accelerating bullish strength. In a September 8 interview with CNBC , Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee claimed Bitcoin could easily get to $200,000 before year-end as the world’s largest crypto began to recover. “ Crypto typically does really well in the fourth quarter, so I think Bitcoin can easily get to $200,000 before year-end. I know it’s a big move—it’s almost a double.” On September 11, Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz commented on Lee’s prediction in another interview . “From his lip to God’s ears,” he said, approving of the $200,000 price target. “I think, probably, we have another big surge up towards the end of the year in Bitcoin, as the Fed starts the cutting cycle. This kind of crypto idea just keeps gaining momentum,” Novogratz added. On the same day, analyst Peter Brandt agreed in a post on X with similar year-end peak projections, adding further support to the fact that most bullish predictions see an early 2026 price target nearly double that at the time of writing. This is what I think https://t.co/3JDdIJSW13 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) September 11, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction 2028 While 2026 forecasts are already staggering, more long-term predictions are even more incredible, sometimes in the seven digits ballpark. For example, Arthur Hayes, an American entrepreneur and co-founder of BitMEX, has predicted multiple times this year that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2028. During his Bitcoin 2025 talk , for instance, he highlighted how the U.S. government will be forced into even greater debt issuance, money printing, and inflationary policies, all of which can contribute to crypto rallies. “ Where do I get this idea that Bitcoin could hit a million dollars? So if we think about QE for poor people, banks lending more into the real economy, I estimate that that could be up to $3 trillion of bank credit that’ll be created between now and 2028.” Standard Chartered, a British multinational bank, projected the cryptocurrency could climb to $200,000 by the end of 2025 and upward of $500,000 by 2028. “The latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach the $500,000 level before Trump leaves office as it attracts a wider range of institutional buyers,” said Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research. The outlook is built on the premise that persistent macroeconomic uncertainty will push investors to reallocate capital into Bitcoin as a digital alternative to gold . What’s more, Bitcoin’s next halving is scheduled for early to mid-2028. With the rate of new coins entering circulation reduced, buying pressure is expected to rise ahead of the event as supply tightens. Bitcoin price prediction 2030 Projections looking even further ahead, toward the end of the decade, highlight just how overly optimistic numbers can get. Cathie Wood, for example, CEO of ARK Invest, an American asset management firm, gave her bear, base, and bull Bitcoin cases for 2030 at $300,000, $710,000, and $1,500,000 per BTC in the company’s Big Ideas 2025 Recap . “Many people know us for our bull case $1.5 million, and we actually think the odds have gone up that our bull case will be the right number because of what is becoming the institutionalization of this new asset class. So many institutional investors are now looking at Bitcoin and thinking that they need to add it to their asset allocation because its return profile looks so much different,” said Wood. Late in August this year, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the world’s largest cryptocurrency could hit $1 million by 2030, citing clear regulations as crucial for widespread adoption. “Regulatory clarity is finally emerging, the US government is keeping a BTC reserve, there’s a growing interest for crypto ETFs, among many other factors.” I think we'll see $1M per bitcoin by 2030. Regulatory clarity is finally emerging, the US government is keeping a BTC reserve, there's a growing interest for crypto ETFs, among many other factors. (Not financial advice of course, it's impossible to guarantee) pic.twitter.com/w5EfcYFvVp — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) August 20, 2025 Jack Dorsey, the former Twitter chief and founder of Block, who has repeatedly argued that Bitcoin will become the internet’s native currency, has also expressed opinions about a potential $1 million price target. As early as May last year, Dorsey said the price would hit “at least a million” in an interview with Mike Solana. In September of the same year, Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), went even further, predicting that Bitcoin could trade at $5 million in the long-term.

With billions of tokens already sold and interest growing across the best crypto project growing ahead of Q4 2025, Pepeto is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about meme projects of 2025. In traditional finance, IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) allow early investors to acquire shares before public listing. In the crypto sector, ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and presales serve a similar role, giving access to tokens at the lowest price prior to broader availability.

ETOR's Q2 2025 showed solid revenue growth and strong user gains, yet thin margins and profit volatility keep the stock from being a clear buy. Valuation is fair at 20x forward earnings, reflecting both growth potential and risks; holding is preferable to buying at current levels. Future upside depends on successful diversification beyond crypto, consistent user growth, and execution in wealth and banking products. I see eToro Group ( ETOR ) as a fast-growing fintech that is making good moves, but I do not think the stock is a clear buy right now. The company showed strong momentum in 2025, with net contribution up 26 percent from last year and assets under administration rising to $17.5 billion. Management is betting on tokenization, AI investing tools, and wealth products, all of which could fuel growth if customers take to them. The stock has had a rough ride. After climbing to $80 in June, it has dropped more than 40 percent and now trades just above its low for the year. Part of that pullback was the usual cooling-off after the IPO price , but it also reflects doubts about how steady earnings will be. Most of the company’s revenue still depends on crypto trading, which is unpredictable. I don’t think the story is broken, but at more than 20 times forward earnings, it is not cheap enough to jump in. For now, I think holding makes more sense than buying. Q2 2025 2025 Financial and Product Highlights (ETOR 6-K) What eToro is Building eToro began in 2006 and has grown into a platform where people can trade stocks, crypto, commodities, currencies, and options. What makes it different is its social features, like copy trading, and extras such as eToro Academy for education and eToro Money for payments and banking. Lately, the company has worked to expand beyond trading. In the second quarter of 2025, the company rolled out 24/5 U.S. equity trading, launched AI-based portfolios, introduced tokenized stocks, and rolled out retirement and savings products in France. Management is building across four areas: trading, investing, wealth, and neo-banking. If this works, it could smooth out the ups and downs of trading revenue. The company has also been buying its way into growth. Picking up Spaceship in Australia pushed funded accounts up 14 percent to 3.63 million. Choosing Singapore as a regional hub signals a push into Asia. In my view, this is smart positioning, though running so many initiatives across markets will not be easy. New Launches (Q2 2025 Investor Presentation) The Market Backdrop In my view, the industry feels crowded and is heavily shaped by investor mood. When markets are lively, volumes spike; when they are quiet, volumes fall. Robinhood ( HOOD ) already blends stocks, crypto, and basic cash features, and Coinbase ( COIN ) is starting to head in that direction too, with plans for tokenized equities and spending tools. For eToro, two shifts are especially important. The first is tokenization, which could change how people access assets. eToro has already launched tokenized stocks and added more crypto options, showing it wants to lead in this area. The second is wealth management, where the company has started retirement and savings products in Europe and recurring investment features in the UAE. These services bring steadier income that does not depend as much on trading hype. In my opinion, Coinbase is the strongest in crypto, Robinhood is more visible in U.S. retail trading, while eToro’s appeal lies in its global reach and social features. If it can get people to use its different services together, that could give it an edge. But diversification takes time and carries its own risks. Looking at the Numbers The second quarter of 2025 showed both progress and limits. Revenue was $2.09 billion, up from $1.85 billion a year ago. Net income came in at $30.2 million, about flat because of IPO costs. On an adjusted basis, net income was $54.2 million, up from $44.2 million, and adjusted EBITDA jumped 31 percent to $72 million. Cash stood at nearly $1 billion plus another $200 million in short-term investments. The balance sheet looks strong. Margins remain thin. Net margin was 1.4 percent, and adjusted EBITDA margin was about 3.4 percent. Revenue grew about 13 percent year over year, which highlights steady progress. Analysts see earnings per share rising from $2.19 in 2025 to $2.42 in 2026 and $2.85 in 2027. That would be solid progress, but the path depends heavily on how active crypto trading remains. The company is also planting seeds in other areas, like wealth products, tokenized assets, and AI-driven portfolios. These newer lines are still small today, yet over time, they could play a bigger role in supporting growth and reducing the reliance on crypto alone. Revenue (Q2 2025 Investor Presentation) How the Stock is Priced At $42.63, eToro is trading at about 6 times trailing earnings, but on forward numbers, the multiple jumps above 20. Price-to-book sits near 2.6. These numbers tell me the market is giving the company some credit for growth but not treating it like a sure thing. When I stack eToro up against its peers, the differences are pretty clear. Robinhood carries a forward P/E north of 70, while Coinbase is closer to 40. Both of those companies are much bigger, with market caps above $100 billion for Robinhood and above $80 billion for Coinbase, compared with less than $4 billion for eToro. Scale alone gives them more investor confidence. Profitability is the big gap. eToro’s net margin is barely above 1 percent, while Robinhood posts 50 percent and Coinbase 43 percent. That explains why investors are cautious. Even with solid revenue growth, thin margins make it hard to argue for a premium valuation. Return on equity is more encouraging at around 27 percent, which puts it in the same ballpark as peers. EPS growth has been strong, rising nearly 10 percent year-over-year in the most recent quarter. Net Margin (Author, Alpha Vantage) All told, I think the market has this one priced about right. A forward multiple above 20 does not look like a bargain when profits are so slim. To me, fair value falls between $40 and $55, which is exactly where the stock sits now. For the shares to climb higher, eToro will need to show that its earnings can hold up without depending so much on crypto’s ups and downs. What the Market Thinks Sentiment toward the stock feels uneasy. The IPO got attention, but the early enthusiasm faded, and the shares dropped into the low 40s. Investors want proof of stability before assigning a higher value. Even when the second-quarter numbers came in ahead of expectations, with adjusted EPS at $0.56 versus $0.51, the stock still slipped . That shows me investors are looking for consistency, not one-off beats. Recent headlines about tokenized stocks, AI portfolios, and a new Singapore hub are encouraging, but they also raise the bar for execution. On top of that, reports that eToro may pursue larger acquisitions with its $1 billion cash pile add both opportunity and risk. The overall market tone feels cautious. People want eToro to prove it can perform across different market conditions. Key Risks Crypto made up most of the company’s revenue in the latest quarter, so any downturn in prices or trading volumes would hit it hard. Regulation is another uncertainty. With operations in 75 countries, the company faces many sets of rules, and tokenization faces unclear regulation. Competition is tough, and costs to attract and keep users could rise. Finally, the push into wealth and banking is a big challenge, and it will take real investment and strong delivery. Together, these risks could quickly shift investor sentiment, especially since the valuation leaves little safety net. Looking Ahead Over the next year, I think the main story will still be crypto. Trading activity will rise or fall depending on how the market feels, and that will have a big impact on revenue. At the same time, eToro is rolling out new products like tokenized U.S. stocks, 24/5 equity trading, and AI portfolios. These updates help shape the brand and bring in attention, but I do not expect them to move the numbers in a major way right away. What I will be watching is whether funded accounts keep climbing at a double-digit pace, because steady user growth would show the platform is gaining ground even when crypto cools. Looking two to three years out, analyst forecasts put earnings per share at about $2.85 by 2027, up from $2.19 in 2025. That growth assumes eToro gets more out of its new offerings. Wealth products in Europe, recurring investments in the UAE, and acquisitions like Spaceship in Australia are all small steps toward building a more reliable income. If those products start generating meaningful cash flow, the business could become less sensitive to the ups and downs of crypto. The new hub in Singapore also gives eToro a way into Asian markets, but building trust there will take time. Over a longer horizon, eToro wants to be more than a trading app. If tokenized assets gain regulatory backing and customers adopt them, the company could establish itself as a leader in that space. Pair that with AI tools and wealth services, and you could see eToro turn into a fintech platform with multiple recurring revenue streams. The challenge is that execution matters more than the idea. Rolling out products is easy compared with getting people to use them in large numbers. If crypto stays the focus for too long, the diversification story may not stick. For me, the short run comes down to whether crypto trading stays active. In the middle years, I want to see if wealth products and new markets add real revenue. In the long term, the bigger question is whether eToro can break free from being viewed as mainly a crypto platform. The company has the chance, but investors will need to see proof before the stock is priced as anything more than a high-risk, high-reward play. Possible Paths If crypto weakens, trading volumes could shrink, user growth could slow, and earnings could fall below $1. That would make the current price look high. If conditions hold steady, steady growth in users and profits could keep the stock between $40 and $55. If tokenized assets, AI portfolios, and wealth offerings catch on while crypto stays strong, earnings could grow faster than expected and push the stock back toward $70 to $80. To me, the chances of these outcomes balance out, which is why holding feels like the best choice right now. Final Take I see eToro as a fintech with strong potential but real risks. The company is innovating quickly and growing its user base, but its dependence on crypto and its still-untested move into wealth and banking keep profits uneven. At more than 20 times forward earnings, the stock does not offer much margin of safety. For now, patience looks like the smarter move. It makes sense to wait, either for clear signs that new products are working or for the stock to fall to a cheaper level. Until then, holding is the approach I prefer.",ETOR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-12 14:03:02

The Next BIG Bounce Is Imminent,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-behaving-like-a-boss-the-next-big-bounce-is-imminent/,"Respected market watcher STEPH IS CRYPTO recently spotlighted a powerful setup on X, describing XRP as “behaving like a boss” on the weekly chart and warning that the “next BIG bounce is imminent.” The analyst stresses that XRP’s present price movement is crucial, as it persists within a vital support range marked in his graphical analysis. Weekly Support Holding Strong The weekly XRP/USDT chart shows the token consolidating within a well-defined green support band. This range, visible in the shared chart, has repeatedly attracted buyers since July’s rally. #XRP behaving like a boss on the weekly. The next BIG bounce is imminent! pic.twitter.com/RHAb61SQMy — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 12, 2025 Latest market data places XRP in the low $3.00 zone, where consistent bids indicate a robust base-building phase. Such stability at a major support level often precedes sharp directional moves. Patterns and Potential Breakout Levels Independent chart analysts note that XRP is trading within a narrowing triangle, a technical formation that frequently resolves with a significant breakout. Key levels to monitor are a decisive close above the $3.10–$3.20 range and a high-volume surge past $3.40. Historical price behavior suggests that clearing these barriers could open a path toward $3.60 and beyond. These metrics align closely with STEPH IS CRYPTO’s outlook and provide traders with clear confirmation targets. Market Conditions Supporting Momentum The broader crypto market is also turning more favorable. Renewed risk appetite, buoyed by expectations of looser monetary policy and increasing institutional interest, has lifted liquidity across major altcoins. Analysts report stronger capital inflows and improved bid depth, creating a market environment where a confirmed breakout in XRP could accelerate quickly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Strategic Takeaways for Traders While the setup is enticing, traders looking to act on this signal should watch for a weekly close above the triangle’s upper trendline, accompanied by rising volume. Position sizing remains crucial: partial entries into strength and protective stops just below the green support band help manage downside risk if the pattern fails. Outlook Steph Is Crypto’s analysis captures a technically compelling moment for XRP. With price action locked inside a sturdy weekly support range and momentum indicators aligning, the token is poised for a decisive move. A breakout above the $3.10–$3.40 corridor, backed by solid volume, would validate the “next BIG bounce” scenario and could send XRP sharply higher in the weeks ahead.

Recently, a significant shift has been observed among Bitcoin short-term holders , signaling a crucial moment for the market. For the first time in four months, these investors have begun selling their Bitcoin at a loss, a phenomenon often termed “capitulation.” This development, highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor gaah_im, suggests a temporary weakening of confidence among speculative investors who are particularly sensitive to price volatility. What exactly does this mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem? Understanding Bitcoin Short-Term Holders and Capitulation Who exactly are Bitcoin short-term holders , and why does their behavior matter so much? Generally, these are investors who have held their Bitcoin for less than 155 days. They are often seen as more speculative, reacting quickly to price movements, and are less resilient to market downturns compared to long-term holders. When these investors start selling their assets below their purchase price, it’s known as capitulation. Capitulation is a term that describes a period of intense selling pressure, where investors, often out of fear or exhaustion, give up hope and sell their holdings at a loss. This action often marks a potential bottom or a significant turning point in a market cycle, as the weakest hands are flushed out. For Bitcoin short-term holders , this recent selling spree at a loss indicates that the recent price corrections have tested their conviction, pushing some to exit their positions to prevent further losses. What Triggered This Shift Among Bitcoin Short-Term Holders? The recent capitulation among Bitcoin short-term holders didn’t happen in a vacuum. Several factors could contribute to such a significant shift in market sentiment. The overall macroeconomic environment, including interest rate hikes and inflation concerns, often influences risk appetite across all financial markets, including crypto. Moreover, recent Bitcoin price fluctuations and periods of consolidation might have worn down the patience of these more volatile investors. Market Volatility: Bitcoin has experienced periods of heightened volatility, leading to sharp price drops that can quickly erase gains for short-term positions. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties can lead investors to de-risk, pulling capital from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Profit-Taking by Others: While short-term holders are selling at a loss, long-term holders might be taking profits, adding to selling pressure and further impacting short-term sentiment. This dynamic creates a challenging environment where quick gains are harder to come by, forcing Bitcoin short-term holders to re-evaluate their positions. Implications for the Broader Bitcoin Market When Bitcoin short-term holders capitulate, it typically has several key implications for the wider market. While it signals temporary weakness and fear, it can also be a cleansing event, removing over-leveraged positions and creating a healthier foundation for future growth. Potential for a Market Bottom: Historically, periods of significant capitulation have often preceded market bottoms, as the selling pressure from weak hands subsides. Shift in Ownership: Assets often transfer from short-term, speculative hands to long-term, conviction-driven investors during such phases, strengthening the market’s underlying structure. Reduced Speculative Pressure: With fewer short-term traders, the market might experience less impulsive buying and selling, potentially leading to more stable price action in the immediate future. However, it’s crucial to remember that market recoveries are not instantaneous. The path forward might still involve periods of consolidation and testing of support levels before a sustained uptrend can emerge. Navigating the Current Landscape: What Should Investors Consider? For those looking at the market, understanding the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders offers valuable insights. While the current environment presents challenges, it also highlights potential opportunities for long-term investors. Focus on Long-Term Conviction: If you believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition, periods of short-term capitulation can offer attractive entry points. Risk Management is Key: Always invest within your risk tolerance. Volatility remains a constant in the crypto market. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics and broader market analysis to gauge sentiment and identify potential shifts. This period serves as a reminder that patience and a clear investment strategy are paramount in navigating the often-turbulent waters of cryptocurrency. Conclusion The recent capitulation among Bitcoin short-term holders marks a pivotal moment, reflecting a temporary dip in speculative confidence. While this can be unsettling, it’s a natural part of market cycles, often paving the way for more robust, long-term growth. By understanding these dynamics, investors can approach the market with greater clarity and strategic foresight. The crypto landscape is continuously evolving, and informed decisions are always the most powerful tool in your investment arsenal. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does “capitulation” mean in the context of Bitcoin? Capitulation refers to a period where investors, often due to fear or exhaustion, sell their assets at a loss. For Bitcoin, it means that many holders are selling their coins for less than what they paid for them, typically indicating a significant market downturn or bottoming process. 2. Who are Bitcoin short-term holders? Bitcoin short-term holders are investors who have held their Bitcoin for less than 155 days. They are generally more reactive to price changes and are often considered more speculative than long-term holders. 3. Is Bitcoin short-term holder capitulation a bad sign for the market? While it indicates current weakness and fear, historically, significant capitulation events have often preceded market bottoms. It can be seen as a “cleansing” event, removing weak hands and setting the stage for future recovery, though the immediate aftermath can still be volatile. 4. How does this impact long-term Bitcoin investors? Long-term investors, who hold Bitcoin for more than 155 days, are typically less affected by short-term price swings and capitulation events. In fact, these periods can sometimes present opportunities for long-term holders to accumulate more Bitcoin at lower prices. 5. How often do Bitcoin short-term holders capitulate? Capitulation events among Bitcoin short-term holders are not constant but occur periodically during significant market downturns or corrections. The recent event is notable because it’s the first time in four months, highlighting the intensity of the current market pressure. Share Your Insights!

According to SoSoValue data, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the charge with $366.2 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $134.7 million. Bitwise’s BITB added $40.43 million, while smaller contributions came from VanEck, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton. Source: SoSoValue Institutional Appetite Revives as Bitcoin, Ether ETFs Post Heavy Inflows The latest figures mark the fourth consecutive day of positive flows for U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. Across those four sessions, inflows reached a cumulative $1.7 billion, reversing the weakness seen at the start of September when funds briefly posted their first weekly outflows since June. On August 29, spot bitcoin ETFs shed $126.64 million , trimming total assets under management to $139.95 billion. Since then, sentiment has shifted sharply, with fresh inflows boosting total net assets to $149.64 billion, representing 6.57% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Cumulative net inflows since launch have now reached $56.19 billion. Trading activity has also been robust, with volumes hitting $2.83 billion on Thursday. Market watchers note that September is traditionally one of Bitcoin’s weakest months, but the recent streak of inflows suggests a renewed institutional appetite. Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $115,455 at the time of writing, up 1.04% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum products have also regained momentum after a rocky start to the month . Spot ether ETFs recorded $113.12 million in inflows on Thursday, led by Fidelity’s FETH with $88.34 million. Bitwise’s ETHW contributed $19.65 million, and Grayscale’s ETHE added $14.58 million, while Franklin’s EZET and Grayscale’s Ether Mini Trust posted smaller inflows. A $17.39 million outflow from BlackRock’s ETHA partly offset the gains but was not enough to derail the overall positive trend. Together, Bitcoin and Ether ETFs attracted more than $660 million in a single day, signaling a resurgence of institutional demand. Ethereum (ETH) traded at $4,517 at press time, up 2.87% in 24 hours. The broader crypto market gained 1.81%. The inflows follow a week of key U.S. economic releases that bolstered investor sentiment. Inflation data came in softer than expected, while labor statistics revisions pointed to a weaker jobs market . 105 of 107 economists expect the Fed to cut rates 25 basis points on September 17 as Bitcoin surges above $116,000, targeting $140,000. #Bitcoin #RateCut #Fed https://t.co/iulmtuVc8z — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 12, 2025 Markets are now widely anticipating a 25 basis-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve on September 17, a shift that has fueled optimism across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Crypto Funds See Mixed Flows as SEC Weighs New ETF Proposals Digital asset investment products recorded $352 million in outflows last week, according to CoinShares, even as softer U.S. payroll data strengthened expectations of a September rate cut. Trading volumes fell 27% from the prior week, signaling a cooling of investor appetite. Still, year-to-date inflows remain strong at $35.2 billion, slightly ahead of last year’s pace. Source: Coinshares Regional flows were split, with the U.S. seeing $440 million in redemptions while Germany and Hong Kong attracted inflows of $85.1 million and $8.1 million, respectively. Bitcoin remained resilient, pulling in $524 million. Ethereum, however, drove the overall outflows, losing $912 million across seven straight trading days. Despite this, cumulative ETH inflows for the year stand at $11.2 billion. Solana and XRP continued steady streaks, attracting $1.16 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively, over the past 21 weeks. Data from HODL15Capital shows bitcoin ETPs now hold more than 1.47 million BTC, or about 7% of the capped supply, with U.S. ETFs accounting for 1.29 million BTC. BlackRock’s IBIT leads with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with nearly 200,000. Bitcoin ETPs have amassed over 1.47 million BTC, accounting for roughly 7% of the cryptocurrency’s fixed 21 million supply. #Bitcoin #ETPs https://t.co/4xyi1EEzE1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 2, 2025 Globally, bitcoin ETPs have added 170,000 BTC so far in 2025 , worth $18.7 billion, though August brought net outflows of $301 million as investors rotated into ether funds, which drew $3.95 billion. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing 92 crypto ETF applications , including multiple Solana and XRP products. Franklin Templeton’s proposals for both tokens were delayed until November 14, while BlackRock’s Ethereum staking amendment was pushed to October 30. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 95% approval probability for Solana and XRP ETFs this year, with prediction markets putting Solana’s odds near 99% .

After Nepal’s prime minister abruptly resigned on Tuesday, which collapsed the nation’s government, the military imposed a curfew across Kathmandu, restricted public gatherings, and assumed control of the streets. Young activists have now turned to Discord after the country’s leadership issued an eviction notice to Meta in a social media crackdown about a week ago, as covered by Cryptopolitan. “The Parliament of Nepal right now is Discord,” said Sid Ghimiri, a 23-year-old content creator in Kathmandu. He said national television stations have been broadcasting excerpts from chatrooms, while Nepali news sites are live-streaming sessions from the server. Gen Z tells military to appoint Karki through Discord The Discord server was launched by Hami Nepal, a civic organization active during the week’s anti-corruption protests. In four days, the server grew to more than 145,000 members, most of them young Nepalis. “The point was to simulate a kind of mini-election,” explained Shaswot Lamichhane, a recent high school graduate and one of the moderators. He said the initiative was not intended to represent the entire country but to suggest an interim leader who could oversee elections. More than half of Nepal’s population of 30 million is now connected to the internet, according to World Bank data. That connectivity fueled protests of Gen Z citizens angered about corruption and a social media ban of 26 platforms including Facebook and YouTube, culminating in the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Many Nepalis rushed to download VPN services to evade government restrictions spearheaded largely by young demonstrators, many in their 20s, who flooded the streets of Kathmandu last Monday. Their demand was for the government to restore access to banned social media platforms and hold leaders accountable. Downloads of Proton VPN surged 6,000% in three days, according to the Swiss-based company. Fears of an internet shutdown also drove a spike in use of Bitchat , a Bluetooth-based messaging app created by billionaire tech entrepreneur Jack Dorsey. there when you need it https://t.co/gbTxEPgEjP — jack (@jack) September 10, 2025 Members debated several potential candidates, including influencer Rastra Bimochan Timilsina, young politician Sagar Dhakal, Dharan mayor Harka Sampang, and social entrepreneur Mahabir Pun. A Discord server with over 145,000 members had a heated debate over Nepal’s interim leadership, but many rallied behind 73-year-old former chief justice Karki. According to the South China Morning Post, Army chiefs met with Discord organizers earlier this week, asking them to propose a nominee for interim prime minister. A manifesto drafted by Gen Z activists with contributions from other citizens was released through social media for public feedback on the same day, compiled in 36 hours. Nepal’s constitution has an emergency clause to be used in times of crisis to appoint an interim leader. But the process is largely opaque, so it is unclear if the army will formally endorse the Discord-backed choice. Some Gen Z citizens feel the vote was flawed The Discord server had more than 40,000 active members, but only 7,713 votes were recorded before moderators closed the polls after Karki crossed the 50% threshold. Some participants asked if the process had enough moderators and votes to uphold the essence of democracy, impartiality. “With her affiliation to political leaders, how do we know she will remain independent?” asked one Gen Z member who participated in the chat. He proposed that Karki should take a public oath to guarantee her neutrality. “We do not have definite leaders to represent us,” said Samdip Yadav, a 23-year-old graduate in Kathmandu. “At times it felt like a random social media call. It happened so quickly. But the discussions showed that young people want their voices heard, even if the format was disorganized.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Tech|Discord|NEPAL,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|RESEARCH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-12 15:19:23

CEO Paolo Ardoino has unveiled exciting plans to launch a new U.S.-based stablecoin, to be known as USAT stablecoin . This move signals a bold new chapter for Tether and the broader digital asset landscape, aiming to deepen its roots within the American financial system. What Exactly is the USAT Stablecoin? Tether’s decision to introduce the USAT stablecoin marks a strategic expansion into the highly competitive U.S. market. Unlike its globally dominant counterpart, USDT, this new digital asset will be specifically designed to operate under stringent U.S. regulatory frameworks. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that attempts to peg its market value to some external reference, like the U.S. dollar, to minimize price volatility. The primary goal is to provide a stable medium of exchange within the often-volatile crypto ecosystem, making digital transactions more predictable. This initiative aims to offer a transparent and compliant option for users seeking stability in their digital transactions. It represents Tether’s commitment to innovation and adapting to evolving regulatory environments worldwide, particularly as global regulators focus more on digital asset oversight. Why Launch Another Stablecoin, and Why Now? The launch of the USAT stablecoin comes at a crucial time for the crypto industry. The stablecoin market is under increasing scrutiny, particularly regarding reserve transparency and robust regulatory compliance. By creating a distinct, U.S.-centric stablecoin, Tether is directly addressing these concerns, aiming to build greater trust and acceptance. This strategy allows them to cater specifically to the needs of the U.S. financial system and its participants, including institutional investors and traditional financial institutions. A U.S.-based stablecoin could potentially unlock new opportunities for broader adoption and seamless integration with established finance. It offers a clear, regulated bridge for companies and investors looking for a dollar-pegged digital asset without navigating the complexities of offshore regulations. Paolo Ardoino has consistently emphasized the importance of a compliant and robust stablecoin for the future of digital finance, stating that the new offering will meet stringent U.S. standards. What Benefits Could the USAT Stablecoin Bring? The introduction of the USAT stablecoin could offer several compelling advantages for users and the wider crypto market, enhancing its appeal and utility: Enhanced Regulatory Clarity: Operating within U.S. regulatory guidelines may instill greater confidence among institutional investors and traditional financial entities, fostering wider adoption. Increased Trust and Transparency: With a specific focus on U.S. compliance, the USAT stablecoin could set new benchmarks for transparency in reserve attestations and operational practices, ensuring investor protection. Broader Adoption: A U.S.-centric stablecoin could facilitate easier integration with U.S. banks and payment systems, expanding its utility beyond crypto-native applications into everyday commerce. Diversification for Users: It provides another reliable stablecoin option, allowing users to diversify their digital asset holdings and choose assets that best fit their risk profile and regulatory preferences, offering more choice. Navigating the Challenges Ahead for USAT Stablecoin While the prospects for the USAT stablecoin are undeniably promising, the path forward is not without its hurdles. The stablecoin market is highly competitive, with established players like USDC and new entrants constantly vying for market share. Regulatory approval processes can be complex and time-consuming, requiring significant resources and ongoing compliance efforts from Tether. Tether will need to demonstrate unequivocally that the USAT stablecoin meets all U.S. legal and financial requirements, which is a rigorous undertaking. Building trust in a new product, even from a well-known entity like Tether, will be paramount to its success. However, Tether’s extensive experience with USDT provides a strong foundation and valuable insights for this new venture, positioning them well for the challenges ahead. The announcement of the USAT stablecoin is more than just a new product launch; it signifies a maturing crypto market that is increasingly embracing regulation and aiming for broader financial integration. Tether’s bold move could redefine stablecoin utility and adoption within the United States, offering a powerful tool for digital commerce and finance. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, initiatives like the USAT stablecoin are crucial in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative, decentralized world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about Tether’s new USAT stablecoin: Q1: What is the main difference between USAT stablecoin and USDT? A1: The primary difference is that USAT stablecoin will be specifically designed to operate under U.S. regulatory frameworks, targeting the U.S. market, whereas USDT operates globally under different jurisdictions. Q2: When is the USAT stablecoin expected to launch? A2: While Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has announced plans, a specific launch date for the USAT stablecoin has not yet been publicly confirmed. It will depend on regulatory approvals and development timelines. Q3: How will the USAT stablecoin be regulated? A3: The USAT stablecoin is intended to adhere to stringent U.S. regulatory standards.

While both funds were expected to be milestones for their respective communities, the handling of them by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows the gulf between experimental products and the more established spot BTC and ETH ETFs already trading in the country. SEC Extends XRP ETF Deadlines as DOGE Fund Faces Short Delay On September 10, the SEC extended its review of the Franklin XRP ETF, moving the final decision deadline from September 15 to November 14, 2025. The regulator cited the need for more time to evaluate comments and potential risks. It marks the second extension since the product was first filed in March, leaving 15 XRP ETF applications in limbo. However, even with the delay, bettors on Polymarket have assigned more than a 90% chance of approval by year-end, suggesting that investors are still confident Ripple will secure its own ETF before 2025 is done. While XRP awaits clarity, attention has shifted to Dogecoin. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF (DOJE), initially meant to hit the market on September 12, is now scheduled to launch mid-next week, likely September 18. Recent data from Santiment shows whales have been accumulating the OG meme coin in anticipation of the ETF, with holdings by wallets containing between one and ten million DOGE reaching a four-year high. Different Structures, Different Outcomes The SEC’s approach highlights a key divide in how crypto ETFs reach the market. For example, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are organized as grantor trusts under the Securities Act of 1933. This ‘33 Act framework is now the industry standard for physically backed crypto products, but it involves a lengthy review process that includes a formal comment period. Meanwhile, according to industry expert James Seyffart, the Dogecoin product is structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, allowing it to use a unique framework as a Registered Investment Company (RIC), which is different from the standard setup used by the more established crypto ETFs. Its strategy involves gaining spot market exposure through a Cayman Islands subsidiary, a legal innovation designed to help bypass regulatory constraints. This alternative arrangement can allow for faster time-to-market and different operational mechanics, such as the ability to hold derivatives alongside spot assets. The regulatory arbitrage explains why a fund for Dogecoin, an asset originally created as a joke, might trade in the U.S. before one for XRP, which has a more developed ecosystem and legal precedent.

51608411,580419,1757690896,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51608411.jpeg,Is Altcoin Season Heating Up? Ethereum Break $4.5K As Investors Look for Best Altcoin to Buy,https://bitcoinist.com/is-altcoin-season-heating-up-ethereum-break-4-5k/,"For years, crypto traders have waited for the elusive altcoin season – a period when coins other than Bitcoin deliver the market’s strongest returns. Recent data suggest the next cycle may already be underway; but with shifting market structures, regulatory uncertainty, and volatile liquidity dynamics, traders will need to tread carefully. What Counts as Altcoin Season? According to CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index , the threshold is simple: if 75% of the top 100 non-stablecoin tokens outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days, it’s officially altcoin season. If fewer than 25% outperform, the market is in Bitcoin season. In general, Bitcoin season is the default – with a massive $2.2T market cap, the rest of the crypto market is always playing catch-up. The Altcoin Season Index offers a quantitative way to cut through hype. It smooths returns across a rolling 90-day window, avoiding the noise of day-to-day volatility. In practice, though, it tends to lag behind sentiment shifts; altcoin rallies often begin before the index confirms them. Recent Market Momentum The past two months have seen notable movement. In August, the Altcoin Season Index jumped from 39 to 58. Bitcoin dominance began to ease from its summer highs, historically a precursor to altcoin outperformance. Large-cap altcoins led the charge. Ethereum ($ETH) has closed the gap with Bitcoin, holding strong above $4K; it currently trades at $4.5K with a $500B market cap. while tokens like Chainlink ($LINK), Uniswap ($UNI), and several exchange tokens ($OKB, $CRO) have also gained ground. Meme coins also haven’t been left behind; the total meme coin market cap is up 8% over the month. Altcoin seasons rarely happen in isolation. Institutional flows, political shifts, and macroeconomic conditions all play a role. But, as always with crypto, sentiment plays a huge role. While the Altcoin Season Index relies on technical analysis, the sentiment-based Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits exactly in the middle, perfectly balanced behind optimism and fear. It’s a strangely uncertain-but-confident market, worried about inflation and macroeconomic pressures but still eagerly looking for the next big thing. That’s where these three projects come in. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Solana ($SOL), and the Snorter Token ($SNORT). Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Hybrid Layer 2 Expands Bitcoin’s Reach to DeFi and Beyond Take Bitcoin’s strength and stability and add in a dash of Solana’s programmability and speed. The result is Bitcoin Hyper , a Layer 2 solution that uses a Bitcoin Canonical Bridge to move Bitcoin to the new Layer 2, creating wrapped Bitcoin that can be used for DeFi, staking, and more. The project opens the door for Bitcoin to grow beyond a mere store-of-value asset. With use cases for Bitcoin already expanding, Hyper could send the world’s leading crypto even higher. The presale flew past $15M earlier in the week as investors realized just how much potential $HYPER has. Check out our price prediction, which shows that the token could go from its current $0.012905 to $0.32, a 2000%+ increase. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to learn more. Solana ($SOL) – Altcoin Darling Sees Treasury Movement Gain Speed Solana continues to outperform in 2025, fueled by the growing Solana treasury movement. The latest boost came from Forward Industries’ massive $1.65B private placement to further its $SOL acquisitions. $SOL is up over 20% in the past month and currently trades over $240. Solana treasuries have a key advantage over their Bitcoin counterparts: yield generation. Solana’s programmability and DeFi integration mean Solana treasuries can provide long-term yield for investors. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Navigate Solana’s Meme Coin Madness with Snorter Bot The Snorter Bot gives traders a critical advantage when it comes to the wild-and-woolly world of Solana meme coins. No more guessing at which tokens could make big moves – and no more wondering how to find the next big thing. Snorter Bot gives traders automated sniping tools, protection from rug pulls and honeypots, and even limit orders and copy trading. Deploy Snorter to sniff out the low-cap meme coin gems before they make it to major exchanges. With the $SNORT token, traders get even lower rates on Snorter Bot trades and cheaper swaps. The $SNORT token is currently in presale at $0.1041, but our price prediction shows the potential for that to increase to $1.92 by the end of next year. What is Snorter Bot? It’s a meme coin trader’s best friend. Check out the presale page for the latest. The index suggests that the market is somewhere in the middle of the Bitcoin-altcoin cycle. Will it evolve into a full-blown altcoin season – and how high will $HYPER , $SOL, and $SNORT go if it does?

Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 80.59 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Technical indicators favor the bullishness of the market, and the price charts also project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.00016, which is approximately 700% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk up? Bonk gained a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its price increased to $0.00002548. The overall bullish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a positive direction, resulting in the recent gains. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.00002754. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense sell-off below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.00005752 by the end of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by the end of 2027. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.00016 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price. Recent news/opinion on Bonk BONKfun, a platform linked to Solana and Bonk, has partnered with Donald Trump-linked World LibertyFi to serve as the official USD1 launchpad on Solana. BONKfun has helped increase the demand for the BONK meme coin and has an 80% share of new token launches on the Solana blockchain.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043.

In March, BONK dipped to $0.00000959, but it recovered to $0.0000122 in April and $0.000021 in May. In June, Bonk corrected down to $0.00001201, but in July 2025, it became bullish again and reached $0.00004072. In the middle of August, BONK was trending near $0.00002374, and at the start of September, Bonk is trading near $0.000020, as the current Bonk sentiment is negative.",Crypto Price Predictions|Bonk,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|ICO|TRADING|BONK|MARKET|WALLET|SOL|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-12 15:29:00

This pivotal shift from their previous expectation of just two cuts signals a potentially major change in the economic landscape, with implications for everything from your mortgage to the cryptocurrency market. What exactly does this mean, and why is Deutsche Bank’s updated prediction drawing so much attention? Understanding the Impact of Fed Rate Cuts When the Federal Reserve decides on Fed rate cuts , it directly influences the cost of borrowing across the entire economy. Essentially, these cuts make money cheaper. For consumers, this could translate to lower interest rates on loans, credit cards, and mortgages. For businesses, it means less expensive capital for expansion and investment. Historically, periods of anticipated or actual Fed rate cuts often lead to increased market liquidity. This environment can sometimes fuel investor confidence, potentially benefiting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. However, the exact impact depends on various other economic factors. Deutsche Bank’s Crucial Forecast: A Deeper Look Deutsche Bank’s latest projection marks a notable adjustment. Previously, the bank anticipated only two Fed rate cuts , specifically in September and December. Their revised forecast now adds an earlier cut, suggesting a more aggressive easing of monetary policy than initially thought. This change reflects their analysis of evolving economic data, likely including inflation trends and employment figures, which suggest the Fed might have more room to maneuver. This updated outlook from a major financial institution provides a significant signal. It implies that the global economy might be heading towards a period of more accommodative monetary conditions sooner rather than later. Such a move by the Fed could aim to stimulate economic growth and prevent a slowdown. What Do These Anticipated Fed Rate Cuts Mean for Your Finances? The prospect of multiple Fed rate cuts has several key implications for your financial well-being: For Borrowers: You might see lower interest rates on new loans, making it a more favorable time to refinance a mortgage or take out a personal loan. This can reduce monthly payments and overall borrowing costs. For Savers: Unfortunately, lower rates can mean reduced returns on savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs). It might encourage looking for alternative investment opportunities. For Investors: Stock Market: Lower borrowing costs can boost corporate profits, potentially supporting stock valuations and leading to market rallies. Cryptocurrency Market: A ‘risk-on’ environment, often associated with lower interest rates, could see investors more willing to allocate capital to digital assets, potentially driving prices up. Bonds: Existing bond prices may rise as new bonds are issued with lower yields, offering capital gains to current bondholders. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed financial decisions in the coming months, whether you’re planning a major purchase or adjusting your investment portfolio. The Road Ahead: What Factors Could Influence Future Fed Rate Cuts? While Deutsche Bank’s forecast is significant, it’s important to remember that the Federal Reserve’s decisions are primarily data-dependent. Key economic indicators will continue to shape their policy, and any shift in these could alter the path of Fed rate cuts : Inflation Data: The Fed’s primary mandate is price stability. If inflation remains stubbornly high, it could temper the pace or number of Fed rate cuts , as the Fed would prioritize controlling rising prices. Employment Reports: A strong labor market, characterized by low unemployment and robust job creation, might give the Fed less urgency to cut rates. Conversely, signs of weakness could accelerate the process to support economic growth. Global Economic Conditions: International economic trends, geopolitical events, and global supply chain disruptions can also play a role in the Fed’s deliberations, influencing their assessment of the domestic economic outlook. Therefore, while Deutsche Bank’s projection offers a strong indication, the actual trajectory of interest rates will ultimately hinge on the evolving economic landscape and the Fed’s interpretation of incoming data. Conclusion: Deutsche Bank’s revised forecast for three Fed rate cuts this year represents a notable shift in the economic outlook. This expectation of cheaper money could have wide-ranging effects, from encouraging borrowing and investment to influencing market sentiment across various asset classes, including the dynamic cryptocurrency space. As we move forward, closely monitoring the Fed’s communications and incoming economic data will be essential for navigating these potential changes and understanding their full impact on your finances and the broader economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Fed rate cuts? A1: Fed rate cuts refer to the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate. This action makes borrowing money cheaper for banks, which then passes on these lower rates to consumers and businesses through various loans, aiming to stimulate economic activity. Q2: Why did Deutsche Bank revise its forecast for Fed rate cuts? A2: Deutsche Bank revised its forecast from two to three Fed rate cuts likely based on its analysis of evolving economic data, such as inflation trends, employment figures, and overall economic growth indicators, suggesting a greater need or opportunity for monetary policy easing. Q3: How might Fed rate cuts impact the cryptocurrency market? A3: Generally, Fed rate cuts can create a “risk-on” environment. Cheaper money and increased liquidity might encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, the actual impact also depends on broader market sentiment and specific crypto market dynamics. Q4: When are these three Fed rate cuts anticipated by Deutsche Bank? A4: While Deutsche Bank previously expected cuts in September and December, their revised forecast now includes an additional, earlier cut, making it three total for the year. The exact timing of the first cut is not specified beyond being earlier than previously thought. Q5: What factors could prevent the Federal Reserve from implementing these anticipated Fed rate cuts? A5: The Federal Reserve’s decisions are primarily data-dependent. Factors such as persistent high inflation, a surprisingly robust labor market, or unforeseen global economic shocks could lead the Fed to delay or reduce the number of anticipated Fed rate cuts .

The recent integration of Chainlink’s oracle network with prediction market platform Polymarket has fueled optimism, adding a fresh layer of utility that could support higher valuations. Market analysis sets $30 as an immediate target, with long-term projections pointing toward the $50–$52 range if momentum holds. Chainlink breaks out above key trendline After weeks of consolidation, the price of Chainlink (LINK) has surged above a key downtrend line. Rand @crypto_rand · Follow $LINK triggering the bullish reversal here. Clean breakout over the downtrend resistance.Eyes on the $30 and $50 ranges as next targets ⚡️ 12:08 PM · Sep 11, 2025 197 Reply Copy link Read 11 replies The token has stabilised near the $22–$24 range, a zone that now acts as a crucial pivot point. At the time of writing, LINK traded around $23.56 with a market cap of nearly $16 billion, making it the thirteenth largest cryptocurrency. If LINK maintains this ground, buyers could drive the price toward the $30 level, a psychological and technical milestone. Volume activity has reinforced the bullish outlook, with trading volume climbing sharply during the breakout, signalling conviction among investors and reducing the likelihood of a false move. Polymarket taps Chainlink for trusted data The price rally comes as Chainlink deepens its role in decentralised markets. Polymarket, a Polygon-based prediction platform, has partnered with Chainlink to strengthen the accuracy and speed of its market resolutions. By integrating Chainlink’s oracles, Polymarket aims to reduce tampering risks and ensure outcomes are based on high-quality, tamper-proof data. This integration is already live on the Polygon mainnet, with an initial focus on asset pricing markets. Both parties plan to expand into additional prediction categories, including more subjective questions that have traditionally relied on voting. By automating resolutions with Chainlink’s Data Streams, Polymarket can now settle outcomes as soon as events expire, a significant improvement over earlier systems. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov highlighted the importance of the collaboration, saying that reliable oracle data transforms prediction markets into trustworthy, real-time signals that institutions and individuals can rely on. Chainlink’s reserve growth adds long-term support On-chain data also underscores confidence in Chainlink’s future. The network’s reserve has grown to over 280,000 LINK, with more than 43,000 tokens added recently. This buildup, funded through both off-chain enterprise adoption and on-chain service usage, serves as a unique support mechanism for the ecosystem. Investors have welcomed the reserve expansion as a sign of sustainability. Combined with technical strength, the increase has improved sentiment and reinforced the perception of LINK as a long-term play. Futures market data further supports this view, with more than 70% of traders currently holding long positions. While such an imbalance introduces liquidation risks during sharp pullbacks, it highlights the strong conviction that LINK’s rally can extend. Chainlink price prediction Technical charts show that LINK must clear resistance between $28 and $32 before higher targets come into view. Once this barrier is broken, the cryptocurrency could climb toward $50–$52 in the medium to long term. Directional indicators already show bullish momentum, and if volume inflows continue, the path toward these targets becomes increasingly realistic. In the short term, market signals are mixed, with volatility indicators showing potential swings. $30 remains the key level to watch, with support sitting near $19.53, which offers a solid base if profit-taking slows the rally.

At the same time their company Gemini Space Station entered the U.S. stock market with strong demand for its shares. The twins, who founded Gemini in 2015 when Bitcoin traded around $380, linked their forecast with the debut of their exchange on the Nasdaq. Tyler said, “it’s still very much the bottom of the first inning, because we see bitcoin trading at $1 million dollars a bitcoin, if it disrupts gold. And we think Bitcoin is gold 2.0.” He added, “we think there’s easily a 10x from here. It’s still really early. And I think we’ll be sitting here 10 years from now looking back and saying, ‘Wow, today was really early.’ I think few people actually listened back then, so hopefully more people listen today.” Gemini prices shares and sets cap on proceeds Gemini’s initial public offering priced at $28 per share late Thursday, higher than the earlier expected range of $24 to $26, according to Bloomberg. That put the company’s valuation at about $3.3 billion. Tyler said, “we’ve come a long way,” during the same CNBC interview . Demand for shares far outstripped supply. People familiar with the sale told Bloomberg that Gemini drew more than 20 times the orders for the shares available. The company and its bankers decided to stop taking new requests and set an unusual cap on proceeds at $425 million. Without that cap, Gemini would have raised up to $433 million based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The sale included an extra investment from Nasdaq, which committed $50 million in a private placement at the time of the IPO. That deal came on top of the capped proceeds and was first reported by Reuters. Investors drive up crypto listings amid White House support The company had already raised the proposed share price before the final sale, moving the range up from $17 to $19 per share to $24 to $26. At the top of that range, Gemini’s value would exceed $3 billion, Reuters reported. The final price at $28 showed how strong the interest was from investors. The IPO added to a streak of crypto listings. Earlier this week, Figure Technology raised $787.5 million in an upsized offering. CoinDesk owner Bullish and stablecoin issuer Circle also boosted their sales earlier in the year. The backdrop for these deals included new regulatory wins under President Donald Trump’s White House, more companies using crypto, and rising inflows from exchange-traded funds. Together those factors pushed the sector’s value above $4 trillion. Gemini’s shares started trading Friday under the ticker GEMI on the Nasdaq. The lead bookrunners for the IPO were Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, who guided the offering through the heavy demand. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

In a significant move, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has initiated a civil forfeiture complaint, seeking a substantial USDT seizure . This action targets approximately 580,000 USDT linked to the founder of an Iranian drone firm, sending a clear message about the increasing scrutiny of digital assets in illicit finance. Why is the US DOJ Pursuing This USDT Seizure? The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed a civil forfeiture complaint. This legal action aims to seize a considerable sum of Tether (USDT) from a key individual. The target is the founder of SDRA, a company reportedly involved in providing drone technology to the Iranian military. Decrypt, a reputable crypto news outlet, brought this development to light, emphasizing the ongoing global efforts to disrupt funding for sanctioned entities. SDRA’s Alleged Role: SDRA is accused of being a crucial supplier of drone technology to the Iranian military, an entity subject to international sanctions. Sanctions Evasion Concerns: The use of Tether (USDT) in this context raises serious questions about attempts to bypass traditional financial sanctions and hide transactions. Global Implications: This case highlights the intricate challenge of monitoring and enforcing financial regulations within the decentralized and borderless cryptocurrency landscape. What Does This USDT Seizure Mean for Digital Asset Holders? This isn’t an isolated incident; it signifies a growing trend in global enforcement. Governments worldwide are actively enhancing their capabilities to trace, freeze, and seize digital assets that are linked to illicit operations. For individuals and businesses holding cryptocurrencies, this development underscores the critical importance of due diligence and understanding the provenance of their digital funds. Expect to see several key impacts: Increased Transaction Scrutiny: Authorities will likely intensify their monitoring of cryptocurrency transactions, especially those involving cross-border movements or connections to high-risk jurisdictions. Advanced Investigative Tools: Law enforcement agencies are continually investing in sophisticated blockchain analytics tools. These tools help identify suspicious patterns and illicit activities within the vast network of digital transactions. Calls for Regulatory Clarity: This case could further fuel discussions for clearer, more comprehensive regulations around stablecoins like USDT. The aim is to prevent their misuse in international transactions that violate sanctions. How Does This USDT Seizure Impact Global Sanctions Enforcement? The civil forfeiture complaint against the Iranian drone firm founder represents a pivotal adaptation of sanctions enforcement for the digital age. Historically, sanctions focused on freezing bank accounts or physical assets. However, as malicious actors increasingly leverage cryptocurrencies, authorities are compelled to evolve their strategies. This aggressive move by the DOJ sends a resounding message: digital assets are not a safe haven from legal action. It reinforces the need for international cooperation to combat financial crime in an interconnected digital economy. The successful execution of such a USDT seizure could establish a significant precedent, paving the way for similar actions in future cases involving cryptocurrency-related illicit finance. The U.S. DOJ’s determined pursuit of this USDT seizure from an Iranian drone firm founder marks a critical juncture in the global fight against illicit finance. It vividly illustrates the evolving landscape where digital assets are facing intensified scrutiny from authorities worldwide. This action serves as a stark reminder that the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies does not grant immunity from legal repercussions. It also reinforces the urgent need for heightened vigilance and robust compliance frameworks across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping the digital asset space and institutional adoption. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Seizures 1. What exactly is USDT? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin. This means its value is pegged to a fiat currency, specifically the U.S. dollar, on a 1:1 basis. It aims to offer the stability of traditional currencies with the flexibility of digital assets. 2. Why is the DOJ specifically targeting USDT in this case? USDT is one of the most widely used stablecoins globally. Its liquidity and ease of transfer across various blockchain networks make it attractive for both legitimate and, unfortunately, illicit transactions, including attempts to circumvent financial sanctions. 3. How does the U.S. Department of Justice seize digital assets like USDT? The DOJ typically works with cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers, or uses court orders to compel custodians to freeze and transfer assets. They also leverage advanced blockchain analysis to trace funds and identify wallets associated with illegal activities. 4. What is the broader significance of this particular USDT seizure? This seizure highlights the increasing sophistication of law enforcement in tracking and confiscating digital assets used in illicit schemes. It signals a strong commitment from authorities to extend traditional financial regulations into the cryptocurrency domain, especially concerning national security and sanctions compliance. 5. How can legitimate crypto users protect themselves from involvement in illicit activities? Legitimate users should always conduct thorough due diligence on their transaction counterparts, use reputable exchanges, and be aware of “Know Your Customer” (KYC) and “Anti-Money Laundering” (AML) regulations. Avoid engaging with unverified sources or transactions that seem too good to be true. Stay informed on critical developments shaping the crypto landscape.

The chart breaks down account percentages, balances, and valuations across key dates from 2013 to 2025, with an additional projection based on a potential $10 XRP price. The data illustrates how the thresholds to enter the top ranks of XRP holders have changed dramatically over time. In 2013, an account needed a balance of just 50,025 XRP to sit within the top 1%. At that point, the cost was $750 when XRP traded at $0.015. By September 2025, the same balance required an investment of $141,071 with XRP at $2.82. JUST IN: $XRP *UPDATED* RICH LIST!

To reach the top 0.10%, an account must hold at least 350,491 XRP. In early 2013, that position could be secured for $5,257. Four years later, in September 2017, it took $77,108 to join that tier. By 2021, the value surged to $417,084, and as of September 2025, the cost reached $988,385. The top 0.01% on the XRP rich list represent only 691 accounts, demonstrating this change on the highest scale. That threshold requires at least 6,692,587 XRP. When XRP traded at $0.015, the value stood at $100,389. In 2017, it had climbed to $1,472,369, and by 2021, it was $7,964,179. Four years later, in 2025, the total has risen to $18,873,095. Looking Toward the Future The chart also provides a hypothetical scenario in which XRP reaches $10 . At that level, the top 0.01% balance would be valued at $66,925,870. Even the 1% threshold of 50,025 XRP would translate to $500,250. Lower tiers reflect the same trend, with the 5% threshold of 8,370 XRP equating to $83,700 in value.

Top voices expect a steady climb toward $2 once the $1.25 resistance is broken. However, while ADA continues to build bullish setups, global experts are increasingly pointing to another PayFi project, Remittix (RTX) , as the best crypto investment of 2025. Cardano News: ADA Price Predictions Heat Up Fresh Cardano news shows that ADA trades near $0.87 after defending key support levels around $0.76. Analysts tracking the charts see a clear ascending channel intact, with upside targets forming at $1.05 and $1.25 in the short term. Cardano Price Chart | Source: Shelby via X Futures activity has surged, with open interest topping $2.5 billion, the highest since 2021. Grayscale’s ETF plan is fueling the bullish case, which includes staking ADA directly within its upcoming Cardano fund. Analysts agree that ADA looks primed for growth, though projections are generally in the 2–4x range for the coming cycle. If momentum continues, experts project breakout targets at $2.08 and even $3.13, representing significant upside from current levels. Remittix: The PayFi Project Breaking New Ground While ADA sets up for potential gains, many experts believe the asymmetric upside lies with Remittix (RTX) . Built to revolutionize global payments, Remittix allows users to send 40+ cryptocurrencies directly into bank accounts across 30+ countries, with transfers settling in under 24 hours. The utility doesn’t stop there: ● Remittix Pay API enables businesses and freelancers to accept crypto but receive fiat instantly.● Privacy by design ensures payments appear as standard bank transfers.● Q3 Wallet Beta, debuting September 15, will put the technology directly in users’ hands.

With liquidity locked for 3 years and a full Certik audit completed, investors treat RTX as a rare mix of innovation and security. Why Analysts Call RTX the Best Crypto To Buy Now Experts are tipping RTX as one of the top crypto investments of 2025. Here’s why: ● Massive Market: Cross-border payments exceed $183 trillion annually.● Utility-First: 40+ cryptos in, fiat out, seamless for retail and businesses.● Exchange Listings: BitMart and LBank confirmed and more CEXs are expected.● Community Growth: Alongside the $250,000 Giveaway, Remittix has launched a new Referral Program.

51609913,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=806777,1757692450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51609913.jpeg,Trump threatens new oil sanctions on Moscow after failed peace talks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-run-out-of-patience-with-putin/,"US President Donald Trump has said that he is running out of patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin. To that end, he has threatened Moscow with new economic sanctions because peace talks with Ukraine have faltered. In an interview, Trump said , “It’ll be hitting very hard on with sanctions to banks and having to do with oil and tariffs also.” Trump’s statement comes after Russia said negotiations with Ukraine were on pause, even after Trump’s push following a meeting with Putin last month for direct talks between the Russian leader and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The next plan that Trump has to frustrate Putin is to urge allies in the Group of Seven to impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil. India is the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne oil, mostly shipped on tankers under sanctions by the European Union, the United States, and Britain. Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Chris Wright went to Brussels for talks to finalize the terms of a deal that Trump and von der Leyen made for the EU to buy an extra $750 billion worth of gas, oil, and nuclear fuel from the US. Oil price jumps 2% after drone attack Ahead of Trump tariffs, the price of oil is up 2% after a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian port stopped loadings. This was more than enough to counteract worries about oversupply and lower US demand risks. According to reports , oil loading operations had to stop overnight because of the drone attack on Primorsk, a port in the northwest of Russia that is one of the country’s biggest oil and fuel export hubs. “Those attacks on Russian energy infrastructure have room to drag down Russian crude and refined product exports,” said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo. Also, SEB Research analyst Ole Hvalbye said, “Strong sanctions could potentially overshadow the underlying oversupply outlook.” Brent crude futures rose $1.02, or 1.5%, to $67.39 a barrel by 1328 GMT, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained $1.08, or 1.7%, to $63.45. The standards for Brent and WTI both went down by 1.7% and 2%, respectively. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency released its monthly report. It said that this year’s planned output increase by the OPEC+ group. It is made up of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners, such as Russia, which would cause the world’s oil supply to rise faster than expected. On the supply side, Adani Group, India’s biggest private port operator, has said that it won’t let tankers from Western countries into any of its ports. This could cut off Russia’s oil supplies. US tariff earnings make up less than 10% in August As the summer ended, President Trump’s tariffs continued to bring in billions of dollars for the US. In August, customs taxes brought in about $29.5 billion. The latest monthly report from the US Treasury Department, which came out Thursday afternoon, showed the final numbers for the month. They confirmed another record after July’s total of $27.7 billion. Since June’s total of $26.6 billion and May’s total of $22.2 billion, these new numbers are the most recent in a line of steps upward. With Tuesday’s report, the overall income for the fiscal year now stands at about $165.2 billion. The fiscal year for the government ends on September 30. The news release from Tuesday also said that the government made more than $344 billion in August. This means that tariff earnings made up less than 10% of the total. However, the government spent even more money that month. That went over $689 billion, leaving a $345 billion gap every month. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Tether’s New USAT Token Hines, who previously led the Presidential Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, began advising Tether in August, following a brief tenure at the White House. Under his leadership, Tether US will be headquartered in Charlotte. In conjunction with Hines’s appointment, the stablecoin issuer is introducing a new token called “USAT,” which will operate under the recently signed GENIUS Act, which aims to provide a new regulatory framework for the fast-growing stablecoin sector in the country. While the firm’s USDT, the largest stablecoin by trading volume, continues to serve global markets, USAT is specifically designed to cater to businesses and institutions that require compliance with US regulations. The launch of USAT will utilize Tether’s proprietary tokenization platform, Hadron. Anchorage Digital will serve as the issuer of USAT, while Cantor Fitzgerald has been designated as the reserve custodian and preferred primary dealer. Paolo Ardoino Highlights USAT Token’s Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized the importance of the firm’s new USAT token, highlighting its role in building trust and improving accessibility in the digital economy. Ardoino added: For over a decade, Tether – as the creator of the stablecoin industry – has issued USDT, the backbone of the digital economy, and today the US dollar stablecoin for hundreds of millions of underserved people living in emerging markets, proving that digital assets can deliver trust, resilience, and freedom on a global scale Ardoino reiterated Tether’s dedication to ensuring the dollar remains central in the digital age, stating, “USAT is our commitment to ensuring that the dollar not only remains dominant, but thrives.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Breaking News Ticker|Bo Hines|crypto news|Tether|Tether CEO|Tether news|Tether Paolo Ardonio|Tether US stablecoin|Tether USAT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 15:55:15

While the crypto world waits for institutional approval, retail traders and early-stage investment funds are already searching for the next breakout altcoin of 2025. This move from pure speculation to tangible value is becoming a clear trend. The excitement around a DOGE ETF shows how fast institutional news can move markets, but it also highlights the need for projects strong enough to stand on their own. As the market grows more volatile, many investors are choosing assets with a clear purpose and a path toward widespread adoption. That is why Remittix's new cross-chain DeFi project is catching the eye of Pepe Coin holders who are used to chasing the next big wave. Dogecoin’s ETF Fueled Comeback This week’s buzz around a potential Dogecoin ETF has reignited interest in meme coins, but experienced investors are shifting their focus to a project with real-world utility that could be on the verge of a major breakout. Talk of a DOGE ETF has sent waves through the market, pushing Dogecoin’s price higher. Analysts say institutional inflows could legitimize the meme coin and drive it to new highs. Now trading around $0.24, some predictions see DOGE climbing toward $1 or beyond if the ETF wins approval. The logic is simple: institutional access could bring fresh capital and more stability to a token long known for wild price swings. But until regulators give the green light, many investors remain cautious. Pepe Coin Looking for Another Breakout Pepe Coin holders are watching closely, hoping for a repeat of its explosive 2022 rally. The token has seen small gains recently, but without a clear use case, its price is still tied heavily to social sentiment and viral hype. Pepe Coin currently trades near 0.0000105 dollars. Forecasts for 2025 are upbeat but carry a major warning: without real-world utility, long-term sustainability is uncertain. That is exactly why more investors are now turning to projects with stronger fundamentals. The Remittix Revolution Is Marching Ahead Remittix is not chasing hype. It is built with purpose, aiming to bridge decentralized finance and traditional banking. While other projects are caught up in ETF rumors and viral trends, Remittixis targeting the $19 trillion global remittance industry. With its wallet set to launch in Q3 2025, it will allow instant crypto-to-bank transfers across over 30 countries, delivering faster and cheaper cross-border payments. This is more than a token; it is building real infrastructure. Analysts have even called it XRP 2.0, a bold claim but one grounded in the project’s strong roadmap and working products. Unlike many speculative ERC-20 tokens, Remittix is centered on actual utility. It remains undervalued simply because the market has yet to catch on. Now is the moment to enter, before it becomes mainstream. ● Real-world utility designed for actual use● Cross-chain DeFi infrastructure for borderless payments● Security audited by CertiK for maximum safety● Deflationary tokenomics built for long-term value● Over $25,2 million dollars raised, making it one of the fastest-growing launches of 2025 This is not about chasing hype, it is about getting in early on a project with the potential to reshape international payments. The momentum is already building. Seize Your Share of the $250,000 RTX Giveaway The numbers speak volumes.

At this point, many top analysts are saying that SOL is poised for a big rally and that everything is ready for the Solana season. One of them was renowned cryptocurrency analyst Scott Melker, known in the cryptocurrency community as Wolf of All Streets, who argued in an analysis shared on his X account that Solana could return to the spotlight after months of silence. The analyst said the final quarter of 2025 could be exciting for Solana, and SOL is poised for a major rally in the coming weeks. Melker noted that Solana has lagged behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, but positive developments behind the scenes have put SOL in an excellent position for upward momentum. He said the three main narratives that could fuel Solana's rise are the network's transaction speed advantages, growing treasury initiatives, and potential ETF inflows. As bullish expectations for Solana grow, some data related to Solana has also been on the rise. Accordingly, futures open interest and DeFi (decentralized finance, DeFi) metrics have risen alongside the increased capital inflows into the Solana market. At this point, Solana futures open interest increased by approximately 25 percent in three days, while Solana DeFi TVL also reached an all-time high, with each of the eight protocols exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Solana futures open interest rose nearly 25% in three days, from $1.49 billion to $1.87 billion. On the same day, DeFi deposits (TVL Total Locked Value) in the Solana ecosystem reached an all-time high for the first time, with eight protocols each reaching over $1 billion.

Even with news of US PPI reports, BTC maintained above this level, and trading activity on the Binance platform experienced a notable surge. PPI Report Sends Bitcoin Taker Volume Skyrocketing Over the past few days, Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was a bit down, as BTC’s price struggles with bearish pressure. However, recent macroeconomic news and conditions have greatly ignited the key metric to levels not seen in quite a while. Darkfost, a market expert and author, has reported a massive surge in Bitcoin taker buy volume on Binance, signaling heightened trading activity and renewed market momentum. Such a sharp uptick highlights a shifting mood as traders position themselves around important price levels and demonstrates vigorous engagement from both buyers and sellers. It is worth noting that the BTC taker buy volume on Binance saw this dramatic increase following the release of the United States Producer Price Index (PPI) data on Wednesday. After the PPI data was published, the crucial metric that measures investors’ trading recorded a staggering $500 million in taker volume. What’s interesting about this $500 million surge in taker volume is that the massive figure was achieved in just 1 minute. Darkfost highlighted that the surge reflects a sudden and significant change in trading sentiment, demonstrating how susceptible cryptocurrency is to macroeconomic triggers. Given that liquidity frequently flows straight into Binance’s derivatives market , this further emphasizes the close connection between cryptocurrency and macroeconomics. In the end, this correlation shapes price action in the short term and captures the immediate response of global investors. US PPI Data Surpasses The Expectations Of Analysts In the X post, Darkfost noted that the recently released report carries the first data providing insights into the evolution of US inflation following the recent revisions to the NFP. This event unexpectedly eliminated 910,000 job creations, which was more than expected, raising further questions about the strength of the labor market. According to the market expert, the PPI results were far better than anticipated, with a CORE PPI YoY of 2.8% and a MoM reading of -0.1%. While clearly beating forecasts from analysts, this data further reinforces the idea that inflationary pressures might be beginning to subside. As a result, the markets immediately reacted on the upside, with Bitcoin in particular. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate bullish action, with its price now trading at $115,374. While the crypto asset’s price has increased by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, its trading volume is slowly turning bearish, declining by more than 6% within the same time frame.",Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume on Binance|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CORE PPI YoY|Darkfost|NFP|PPI|Producer Price Index,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 16:00:53

Alongside high-profile coins like Hedera, attention is also being given to newer ones like Remittix (RTX) , which have blockchain technology along with utility in payments in real life. Mature networks continue to be valued for their speed and stability, but pressure is growing for projects with real-world adoption and immediate usability. This is where discussions of comparisons between utility-first tokens and old altcoins are shaping investment. Stellar (XLM) and Hedera Market Overview Stellar, XLM is trading at $0.3864, a 4.56% increase, with a market capitalization of $12.51 billion and a daily volume of $270.72 million, an 11.89% rise. Such figures further support the project's sustained role as a blockchain aimed at making cross-border value transfers fast and transparent. Hedera, meanwhile, is at $0.2336, a minor 0.52% day high. Its market capitalization is $9.98 billion and enjoys trading volumes of $242.23 million, up by 6.85% in the last 24 hours. The network has gained popularity because of its hashgraph consensus and growing number of enterprise partnerships, cementing its place as a reliable participant in the shifting digital economy. Stellar and Hedera collectively indicate the maturity of successful crypto initiatives. Yet as investors weigh scalability against practical application, attention repeatedly comes to be addressed by newer entrants like Remittix that bring blockchain functionality straight into the payment space. The Remittix Presale Momentum Unlike traditional networks, Remittix (RTX) has already attracted investor attention by establishing itself in the $19 trillion global payments space. At a price of just $0.1080 per token , the project has so far raised $25,2 million+ and over 658 million tokens have been sold. Its selling point is sending crypto straight into main street bank accounts in 30+ countries with low gas fees. Recent news entails confirmation of upcoming listings on BitMart and LBank, top centralized exchanges. The partnerships are expected to bring substantial liquidity and exposure when the presale period elapses. In addition, Remittix has rolled out a $250,000 Giveaway and a special 15% USDT referral program, giving participants an alternative way to earn benefits through the presale period. What’s Fueling Remittix’s Adoption Surge The firm just announced plans for its beta wallet launch later this Q3 2025, developed with a mobile-first approach and real-time FX conversion. The wallet will facilitate international transactions for businesses, individuals and independent contractors by bridging the gap between traditional banking and decentralized money. ● Utilization in the actual world: Transfers of cryptocurrencies to banks in over 30 countries● Strong security: Audited by CertiK for transparency and trust● Growth momentum: $25,2 Million+ already raised in the presale● Community incentives: 15% USDT referral rewards and contests Placing itself among the best crypto presales 2025 by focusing on solving real-world payment issues, Remittix DeFi is appearing stronger than ever. Unlike hype coins, RTX is founded on real-time functionality and is among the new altcoins worth keeping an eye on in today's competitive market. Although Stellar, XLM and Hedera remain key players in the crypto world, the arrival of nascent utility projects such as this indicates the manner in which investor demand is evolving. From its focus on low gas cost crypto payments, seamless incorporation into banking frameworks and a presale that is already picking up significant steam, Remittix demonstrates the type of innovation that many now eagerly await from the next big altcoin 2025.

XRP Army Responds",https://timestabloid.com/would-you-sell-xrp-at-34-130-or-2150-xrp-army-responds/,"When crypto influencer Amonyx posed the question on X—“Would you sell your XRP at $34, $130, or $2,150?”—the XRP Army quickly delivered a flurry of thoughtful replies. Their answers highlighted a clear theme: conviction in XRP’s long-term value , tempered by realistic assessments of market mechanics. As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.03, with a market capitalization of approximately $181 billion, providing a sharp contrast to the speculative figures in question. Holders Speak Out Many respondents argued that selling isn’t the only—or even the best—path to profit. Mike declared, “Never sell, but I will take a loan out when it’s above $1,000 to invest,” illustrating the growing trend of leveraging crypto holdings instead of liquidating them. Omar Parkop advised keeping XRP while offloading other utility coins such as HBAR, XLM, and ADA “to get out of the rat race.” Another user, simply identified as L, echoed the sentiment: “No, not when I can borrow against it.” In contrast, KaDa injected a dose of realism, noting that a $2,000 XRP price would imply absorbing the total money supply of the planet, adding that even $20 would be insanely good for the asset. Would you sell $XRP at $34, $130, or $2150? — Amonyx (@amonbuy) September 12, 2025 Borrowing vs. Selling The discussion underscores a growing preference for borrowing against crypto holdings rather than selling them outright. Established platforms such as Nexo now allow users to post XRP as collateral for fiat or stablecoin loans, providing access to liquidity without triggering taxable events. While this approach preserves potential upside, it also introduces risks such as margin calls and counterparty exposure that investors must manage carefully. The Math Behind $2,150 Skeptics like KaDa have strong reasons for doubt. With a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, a $2,150 price tag would push XRP’s market capitalization toward $200 trillion—far beyond the total global money supply and multiple times larger than the combined value of the world’s stock markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These staggering numbers explain why many analysts see four-digit XRP targets as implausible without unprecedented structural changes in global finance. Institutional Context Recent institutional partnerships, including Ripple’s collaborations with major banks and custodians, continue to expand XRP’s utility for cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. Notably, European banking giant BBVA recently partnered with Ripple to integrate digital-asset-based payment rails, showing that real-world adoption is advancing—albeit gradually. Takeaway for Investors Amonyx’s viral post demonstrates that the XRP Army is not just about unbridled optimism. Whether one chooses to sell at milestones like $34 or $130, borrow against holdings to fund investments, or simply hold through market cycles, the prevailing sentiment is to plan deliberately. Investors must weigh the lure of outsized gains against the realities of market liquidity, collateral risks, and personal financial goals. In the end, the choice to sell or not, remains as individual as each XRP holder’s conviction. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A savvy individual, who initially invested $10 million into 2.5 billion PUMP tokens, has recently begun to realize substantial gains, marking a noteworthy event in the digital asset space. Unpacking the PUMP Token Profits Strategy This investor’s journey, tracked by the blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, highlights a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investing. Just hours ago, a portion of their massive holdings—specifically 250 million PUMP tokens—was deposited to Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. This move signals the initial phase of profit-taking, turning digital assets into tangible returns. Initial Investment: $10 million for 2.5 billion PUMP tokens. First Profit-Taking Move: 250 million PUMP deposited to Binance. Current Holdings: Still a colossal 2.25 billion PUMP tokens. Realized Gains: Profits currently exceed an impressive $5 million. Such a substantial deposit to an exchange often precedes a sale, allowing the investor to convert their tokens into stablecoins or fiat currency. This action is a classic example of how large holders, often called “whales,” manage their portfolios to lock in gains after a significant price appreciation. What Does This Mean for PUMP Token’s Future? When a large investor begins to sell, it naturally raises questions about the market’s direction. While some might interpret this as a bearish signal, it is essential to consider the context. The investor still retains a vast majority of their initial purchase, suggesting continued confidence in PUMP’s long-term potential. This partial profit-taking could be a prudent risk management strategy, securing initial capital or early gains while letting the rest ride. Moreover, the market’s ability to absorb such a large sell-off without a dramatic price collapse can indicate underlying strength. It shows that there is sufficient demand from other buyers willing to acquire PUMP tokens at current prices, which is a positive sign for the token’s ecosystem. Navigating the Volatility: Lessons from PUMP Token Profits The story of these PUMP token profits offers valuable lessons for all crypto participants. Firstly, it underscores the significant volatility and potential for rapid gains (and losses) in the altcoin market. Secondly, it emphasizes the importance of a clear exit strategy. Knowing when and how to take profits is as crucial as knowing when to enter a trade. For individual investors, observing the actions of large holders can provide insights, but it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Each investor’s financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals are unique. Diversification and thorough research remain paramount. The Impact of Whale Activity on PUMP Token Profits The movements of large investors, or “whales,” can significantly influence market sentiment and price action, especially in newer or smaller cap tokens like PUMP. Their buying can fuel rallies, and their selling can trigger corrections. However, sophisticated investors often employ strategies that minimize market impact, such as selling in smaller batches over time, rather than a single massive dump. The fact that this investor deposited 250 million PUMP to Binance, rather than the entire 2.5 billion, suggests a measured approach aimed at optimizing their PUMP token profits without crashing the market they are still heavily invested in. This calculated move is a hallmark of experienced crypto traders. Summary: A Glimpse into Strategic Crypto Investing This recent development with the PUMP token investor provides a fascinating look into the world of high-stakes cryptocurrency trading. It illustrates the incredible potential for gains, the strategic thinking involved in profit-taking, and the delicate balance between securing returns and maintaining market stability. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, understanding these dynamics becomes increasingly important for anyone looking to navigate its exciting, yet unpredictable, waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about large investor activities and PUMP token profits : Q1: What is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A: A “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price with their trades. Q2: How do investors typically take profits from cryptocurrencies? A: Investors often take profits by selling a portion of their holdings on a cryptocurrency exchange, converting them into stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) or fiat currency (like USD). This can be done in stages to minimize market impact. Q3: Does a large investor selling PUMP tokens always mean the price will drop? A: Not necessarily. While large sales can put downward pressure on prices, the market’s ability to absorb the sell-off and the investor’s remaining holdings are crucial factors. Partial profit-taking can also be a healthy risk management strategy. Q4: What is Lookonchain? A: Lookonchain is a blockchain analytics platform that tracks and reports on significant transactions and wallet movements within various cryptocurrency networks, providing insights into “whale” activity and market trends. Q5: Should I copy the trading actions of large investors? A: While observing large investors can offer insights, it’s generally not advisable to blindly copy their moves. Their financial goals, risk tolerance, and access to information are often very different from individual investors. Always conduct your own research.

A quarterly STAR50 reshuffle is expected to trigger over 8 billion yuan in passive outflows, yet demand for Cambricon remains strong. The AI chip designer’s stock more than doubled in August, pushing its share of the tech-focused benchmark above the 10% cap for a single stock. The spike triggered the adjustment and stirred worries about near-term swings, but many investors view the reshuffle as routine rather than a change in the outlook. Cambricon fell 14% last week on profit-taking and rebalancing fears, then rebounded, gaining 10% this week. Even after the moves, the company’s valuation stands out. It trades at 521 times trailing earnings versus about 50 times for Nvidia, according to LSEG. Portfolio managers and analysts say the technical cutback is unlikely to derail China’s AI run. Beijing’s push for technology self-reliance is expected to speed sector growth and let China mirror parts of the U.S. AI upswing. “Maybe some investors will use it as a reason to take profit, but I don’t think that will affect the long-term trend,” or the positioning of fundamentals-driven active funds, said Shihao Li, research analyst at CLSA, as mentioned in a Reuters report. China’s AI trade has helped power the domestic bull market Gains have been supported by state backing for home-grown innovation, the DeepSeek breakthrough, and large AI spending by Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu. Globally, enthusiasm has lifted the Nasdaq to records, aided by Nvidia’s 32% rise this year. Cambricon shares have risen 113% in 2025, with most of that jump coming last month after it posted a first-half profit. “There is now more optimism that China’s AI industry has passed a turning point, and entered a self-sustaining cycle of rising investment and higher profitability,” said Tilly Zhang, analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. “The narrative that China can replicate at least part of the U.S. AI boom no longer seems so far-fetched.” Founded in 2016, the Beijing chipmaker listed on Shanghai’s STAR Market in 2020. It has since gone from a niche player to a market leader. The mainland tech rally is in its twelfth month. Onshore stocks have closed the gap with offshore peers, lifting Shanghai stocks to levels last seen a decade ago. The CSI AI Index has jumped 60% so far this year, outpacing the roughly 15% rise in the CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite. Cambricon’s rise has raised valuation questions The company issued a risk warning last month as its market price raced ahead. Its latest results showed first-half revenue leaping to 2.9 billion yuan, from 64.8 million yuan a year earlier, with a swing to about 1 billion yuan in profit. As Cryptopolitan reported previously, Cambricon’s revenue jumped 4000% ahead of Nvidia’s earnings. For the full year, it projects operating revenue between 5 billion and 7 billion yuan. “Investors are torn between hoping Cambricon can succeed in replacing foreign AI chips and avoiding blowing up a speculative bubble,” said Abraham Zhang, chairman of China Europe Capital. For now, the focus is on whether the company can sustain profitability and meet demand for its AI processors. Guangdong-based hedge fund manager Xu Qiongna said that although Cambricon looks far pricier than Nvidia , rapid growth tied to China’s drive to swap out foreign technologies could make the multiple easier to defend. Tang Yibing, a portfolio manager at Bosera’s STAR 50 Index Fund, said performance across the tech complex depends more on industry trends and earnings delivery than index mechanics. The STAR50 has gained 5% this week.

Martinez, a well-known crypto analyst, highlighted Solana’s breakout from what chart technicians call a cup-and-handle pattern, a formation that often signals the start of a long-term rally. In his chart, Martinez marked $1,314.41 as the main technical target, using Fibonacci retracement levels to project Solana’s upside. The pattern reflects a multi-year basing structure: Solana’s deep decline in 2022 and 2023 formed the “cup,” while the sideways consolidation of 2024 and early 2025 formed the “handle.” According to Martinez, the breakout above resistance near $220 validates the structure and opens the way to much higher levels if momentum persists. Novogratz, speaking on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box"" Thursday, l aid out a sweeping bull case for Solana and crypto more broadly. He began by pointing to treasury companies tied to both ETH and SOL, which he said are raising billions of dollars and bringing “lots of energy and money” into the digital asset ecosystem. He then pivoted to bitcoin, predicting the world’s largest cryptocurrency should see a surge toward the end of the year. But his most detailed remarks focused on Solana and the changing regulatory landscape. Novogratz said U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has made clear that he wants all markets to move on-chain, citing a speech earlier in the week where Atkins declared, “On-chain capital markets and agentic finance are on the horizon, and the world is watching.” As part of that backdrop, Novogratz flagged Nasdaq’s proposal to the SEC to allow tokenized securities to be traded directly on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Combined with the new U.S. stablecoin framework, he argued, crypto finally has both the technology and the regulatory clarity to serve as financial market infrastructure. On the technology side, Novogratz emphasized Solana’s raw capacity, saying the blockchain can handle 14 billion transactions per day — enough, in his words, “to process all the transactions in equities, fixed income, commodities and foreign exchange combined.” He went on to call Solana a blockchain that is ""tailor-made"" for financial markets. Adding it up — scalable infrastructure, a pro-blockchain regulatory stance and billions in new institutional inflows — Novogratz concluded that “this is the season of SOL,” a moment when Solana is positioned to take a leading role as capital markets shift on-chain. Technical Analysis Highlights (Sept. 11 15:00 – Sept. 12 14:00 UTC) According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, SOL gained about 6% in the 24-hour period, climbing from $227.14 to $240.02, with trading volumes reaching 3.66 million contracts. The token broke above eight months of resistance at $220, hitting $240 for the first time since January as institutional buyers added exposure. The strongest rally occurred in the final hour of trading (13:14–14:13 UTC on Sept. 12), when SOL advanced another 1% from $239.92 to $241.17. The most dramatic breakout came just after midnight UTC on Sept. 12, when volume surged to 3.66 million contracts — nearly triple the 24-hour average of 1.46 million. Support was established around $225.50 during early consolidation, while resistance emerged at $240.08, where several rallies initially stalled. Heavy trading volume at $228.78 (3.66 million contracts) confirmed that level as a key support zone. The busiest trading window was 14:09–14:11 UTC, with 214,368 contracts changing hands — nearly six times the typical hourly average. A fresh support level has now formed near $241.17, suggesting buyers are willing to defend higher prices even after the breakout.

Top Rising Altcoins in 2025",https://bitzo.com/2025/09/is-the-market-sleeping-on-ondo-hype-and-sui-top-rising-altcoins-in-2025,"As the crypto spotlight often remains fixed on Bitcoin and Ethereum, a new wave of altcoins is quietly gathering strength. Projects like Ondo (ONDO), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Sui (SUI) are showing remarkable momentum, hinting at their potential to become breakout stars in 2025. Much like Outset PR ’s data-driven approach to uncovering overlooked opportunities and amplifying client stories, these tokens are leveraging strong fundamentals, unique use cases, and growing ecosystems to position themselves ahead of the next altcoin surge. This article explores their trajectories and why the market may be underestimating their value. Ondo (ONDO) Shows Positive Momentum Amidst Market Fluctuations Source: tradingview Ondo (ONDO) is currently priced between 85 and 98 cents, taking a solid stance after a notable 18% rise in just a week. With its recent performance, Ondo gains investor interest, eyeing the nearest resistance mark at $1.05. If it surpasses this threshold, it could aim for the next level at $1.17, suggesting room for about a 20% rise from its current price. Despite this potential, Ondo faces its nearest support at 79 cents, where buyers might step in if it dips. The coin's recent trajectory and increased attention hint at promising growth prospects, though its movement remains tied to broader market trends.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) Eyes New Peaks Amid Strong Momentum Source: tradingview Hyperliquid's price is bouncing between nearly $44 and $49. It’s close to pushing past the first resistance level, around $51. If that happens, it could target its next hurdle, which is about 15% higher. Over the past week, Hyperliquid has jumped over 23%, and it has surged by about 290% in six months. This shows a strong growth trend. Although it's below the 10-day and 100-day moving averages, the coin's Relative Strength Index sits at a neutral spot, indicating room for further upward movement. If Hyperliquid maintains its current momentum, it might soon challenge levels not far from $56, creating potential growth opportunities for those watching this dynamic market. Sui Coin Shows Steady Stability Amid Mixed Price Movements Source: tradingview Sui price is currently between three to nearly three and a half dollars. It has climbed over ten percent in the past week. This reflects a bounce back despite a dip of nearly seven percent over the last month. Short-term growth looks promising, given its steady march upwards by over fifty percent in six months. If it breaks the nearby resistance at a little over three and a half dollars, it might touch four dollars. However, a fall below the three-dollar mark could push it to a lower support level close to two and a half dollars. Technical indicators suggest watching further movements closely. Conclusion ONDO, HYPE, and SUI exemplify the kind of under-the-radar projects that often set the stage for the next big cycle in crypto. ONDO’s DeFi innovations, HYPE’s rapid growth, and SUI’s steady expansion all highlight the diversity of opportunities beyond the major players. Just as Outset PR ensures brands break through noise with tailored, insight-driven campaigns, these altcoins are carving distinct identities that could reward early believers.

Cryptocurrency markets are buzzing again, fueled by a cocktail of volatility, speculation, and undeniable innovation. In a world where meme coins can shake the market overnight, timing and entry points are everything. The last 24 hours paint a contrasting picture. Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE climbed 0.77% to $55.14, continuing its momentum after VanEck’s ETF filing. Meanwhile, Stellar’s XLM rose 1.22% to $0.3882 as tokenized markets gained traction. Against this backdrop, a different kind of story unfolds: BullZilla, a project rewriting presale mechanics, surges past milestones and teases staggering ROI potential. As analysts evaluate the Next 100x crypto presale, BullZilla ($BZIL) positions itself as more than just another entrant. It carries features designed to drive relentless upward momentum, while established players like Hyperliquid and Stellar strengthen their market cases. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Presale Built for Relentless Momentum The Bull Zilla presale has turned into a spectacle for those scanning the market for the Next 100x crypto presale. Unlike projects that stagnate between fixed stages, BullZilla’s Mutation Mechanism ensures the price increases either every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours. This progressive system eliminates hesitation and fosters a consistent sense of acceleration. At the current stage, aptly named “Dead Wallets Don’t Lie,” the presale has already secured over $360,000 in contributions. More than 24.7 B billion tokens have been sold, with over 1,200 holders. The price sits at $0.00004575, and investors know the next hike, 14.55% higher at $0.00005241, triggers in just two days. For early participants, the modeled ROI from this point to the projected listing price of $0.00527 is an eye-catching 11,422%. Here’s a snapshot of the presale so far: Metric Detail Current Stage 2nd (Dead Wallets Don’t Lie) Current Price $0.00004575 Presale Raised $360,000+ Token Holders 1,100+ Tokens Sold 24.7 B Billion ROI to Listing 11,422% ROI for Early Joiners 695% $1,000 Buys 21.857M Tokens $45,000 Buys ~983M Tokens Upcoming Price $0.00005241 (+14.55%) BullZilla ’s Massive Presale Allocation, 50% of its total 160B supply, ensures retail investors, not just insiders, can ride its ascent. Add the Roarblood Vault, a referral system paying both code owners and buyers with 10% token bonuses, and the community grows organically with real incentives. How to Join BullZilla’s Presale Accessing BullZilla is straightforward, ensuring anyone can participate in what is increasingly being seen as the Next 100x crypto presale: Set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Acquire Ethereum (ETH) from an exchange like Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet. Connect your wallet to the official BullZilla presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL, confirm the transaction, and secure your allocation. Tokens become claimable once the presale ends. With referral bonuses unlocked two weeks after presale, loyalty and word-of-mouth drive its reach. The HODL Furnace, offering a 70% APY staking system, adds another layer of appeal for long-term believers. Hyperliquid ($HYPE): Riding the ETF Wave Hyperliquid’s growth narrative gained new momentum as VanEck confirmed its filing for a U.S.-based staking ETF tied to the HYPE token. In the last 24 hours, HYPE rose 0.77% to $55.14, reinforcing the token’s rally that has already seen it climb more than 20% in a week. Charts reveal a steady uptrend with short consolidations, suggesting accumulation ahead of further gains. With billions in trades executed on Hyperliquid’s decentralized exchange, the project has proven its ability to challenge established players. The ETF prospect, combined with rumors of a potential Coinbase listing, sets the stage for HYPE to join the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. VanEck has even floated the idea of allocating ETF profits toward HYPE buybacks, a mechanism that could strengthen its tokenomics and sustain investor demand. If such measures align with continued volume growth, Hyperliquid may become one of the defining stories of 2025. Stellar ($XLM): Powering Tokenized Capital Markets While HYPE dominates the derivatives conversation, Stellar continues to reinforce its reputation in cross-border and tokenized finance. Over the last day, XLM climbed 1.22% to $0.3882, tracking renewed optimism in regulated tokenized markets. Its collaboration with Frankfurt-based fintech 21X has created the first fully regulated blockchain exchange for tokenized securities and stablecoins. This exchange, backed by Germany’s BaFin and the European Securities and Markets Authority, enables atomic settlement of stocks, bonds, and real-world assets within seconds. Chart patterns for Stellar show renewed strength above support, with analysts noting potential resistance near the $0.40 level. Institutional adoption remains the core driver. By serving as the infrastructure for tokenized assets projected to exceed $30 trillion in trading volume by 2030, Stellar cements its role as more than a remittance coin; it becomes a backbone of capital markets. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BullZilla sets itself apart from both Hyperliquid and Stellar in one key respect: its presale-driven growth engine. While Hyperliquid rides the ETF narrative and Stellar powers institutional tokenization, BullZilla delivers a structure where every dollar raised tightens supply and boosts token value. For those seeking the Next 100x crypto presale, the window to enter BullZilla before its next price hike is narrowing fast. With referral rewards, 70% staking APY, and modeled ROIs exceeding 11,000%, the project already stands out as the best crypto to buy today among early-stage plays. The digital economy never sleeps, and neither does opportunity. The roar of BullZilla’s presale is a reminder that conviction, mechanics, and timing remain the ultimate catalysts.

Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov described the deal as a “pivotal milestone,” adding that resolving markets with tamper-proof computation and high-quality data transforms prediction markets into reliable signs “the world can trust.” The integration marks the beginning of a broader collaboration between the two companies, with plans to expand beyond asset-pricing into more subjective prediction categories. The agreement comes at a time when Chainlink has accelerated its expansion into traditional finance and government-linked data services. On August 11, the firm partnered with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to provide on-chain foreign exchange and precious metals rates through its Data Streams, using ICE’s Consolidated Feed sourced from over 300 marketplaces. Two weeks later, Japanese financial giant SBI Group revealed a collaboration with Chainlink to develop crypto tools for banks and institutions in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, with an initial focus on tokenized bonds and stablecoin reserves.

With nearly $100 billion in total value locked in DeFi secured by its oracles and trillions of dollars in transaction value supported to date, Chainlink continues to assert itself as the backbone of decentralized data infrastructure. Polymarket Cleared by U.S. Regulators as Platform Eyes Major Expansion The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in July closed their investigations into Polymarket without taking enforcement action . The probes, launched in late 2022, examined whether the New York-based platform continued to allow U.S. users access after agreeing to block them under a prior settlement. The regulatory closure marks a turning point for Polymarket, which has since secured clearance to re-enter the U.S. market. On September 3, the CFTC granted a no-action letter covering event contracts through QCX LLC and QC Clearing LLC, entities Polymarket acquired earlier this year in a $112 million deal. The relief provides a framework for offering compliant prediction contracts, shielding participants from enforcement tied to swap reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Polymarket has rapidly scaled into the largest prediction market globally, processing more than $8 billion in wagers, including $2.5 billion during the 2024 U.S. election cycle. In the first half of 2025 alone, users placed around $6 billion in bets.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, understanding the infrastructure powering the next generation of AI models is crucial, as these advancements often drive innovation and investment opportunities across the tech spectrum. A new player, Micro1, is making waves, recently securing a significant $35 million Series A funding round at a staggering $500 million valuation. This move positions them as a formidable contender in the specialized field of AI data labeling , directly challenging established giants like Scale AI. The Evolving Landscape of AI Data Labeling: Why the Shift? The foundation of any powerful AI model lies in the quality and quantity of its training data. For years, Scale AI dominated this crucial sector, providing human contractors to label and generate data for some of the world’s leading AI laboratories. However, a significant shift occurred following Meta’s substantial $14 billion investment in Scale AI, which also saw Scale AI’s CEO take on a role at Meta. This development sparked concerns among other major AI labs , including OpenAI and Google, who reportedly planned to reduce or cut ties with Scale AI. The primary apprehension revolved around potential conflicts of interest and the possibility of their proprietary research data inadvertently benefiting a competitor like Meta. While Scale AI denies sharing confidential information, the market reaction was clear: a vacuum was created, and new opportunities emerged for agile startups ready to fill the gap. This dramatic shift has underscored the critical need for reliable and unbiased AI data labeling services, creating a fertile ground for agile startups like Micro1 to thrive. The demand isn’t just for volume anymore; it’s for precision, expertise, and a trusted partnership that safeguards intellectual property. Micro1’s Astounding Ascent: A Deep Dive into its Funding and Vision At just three years old, Micro1 has demonstrated remarkable growth and strategic prowess. The recent $35 million Series A funding round, which valued the company at an impressive $500 million, highlights strong investor confidence. The round was spearheaded by O1 Advisors, a venture capital firm co-founded by Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, both former executives of Twitter. Their involvement brings not only capital but also invaluable experience and strategic guidance to Micro1. Under the leadership of its 24-year-old CEO, Ali Ansari, Micro1 has achieved an astounding annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $50 million, a significant leap from $7 million at the start of 2025. While this is still a considerable distance from larger competitors like Mercor, which boasts over $450 million in ARR, and Surge, which reportedly generated $1.2 billion in 2024, Micro1’s growth trajectory is undeniable and speaks volumes about its market penetration and adoption among top-tier clients. This substantial Micro1 funding round is a testament to the market’s confidence in their unique approach and rapid execution. Adding further strength to its leadership, Adam Bain has joined Micro1’s board of directors, alongside Joshua Browder, the founder and CEO of the AI legal assistant DoNotPay. Bain’s perspective on the industry’s direction is clear: “Really the only way models are now learning is through net new human data. Micro1 is at the core of providing that data to all frontier labs, while moving at speeds I’ve never seen before.” This statement reinforces the critical role Micro1 plays in the current AI development paradigm. Outmaneuvering the Giants: Micro1 as a Potent Scale AI Competitor Scale AI initially carved its niche by offering a cost-effective solution for data labeling, leveraging a global workforce of relatively low-skilled contractors. This model was effective for foundational AI model training. However, the demands of advanced AI labs have evolved significantly. Ali Ansari points out that today’s AI models require high-quality data labeling from domain experts – individuals with specialized knowledge such as senior software engineers, doctors, and professional writers. This shift created a new challenge: recruiting and vetting such highly qualified individuals at scale. Micro1 addressed this head-on by developing its proprietary AI recruiter, Zara. Zara is designed to interview and vet candidates, whom Ansari refers to as ‘experts,’ ensuring they possess the necessary domain knowledge and expertise. Micro1 proudly states that Zara has successfully recruited thousands of experts, including professors from prestigious institutions like Stanford and Harvard, with plans to add hundreds more each week. This innovative approach positions Micro1 as a formidable Scale AI competitor , not just by offering similar services, but by providing a higher echelon of data quality and expertise. Furthermore, the market for AI training data continues to evolve. Many AI labs are now interested in developing ‘environments’ – virtual workspaces where AI agents can be trained on simulated tasks. Micro1 is already building new offerings in this ‘environments’ space, demonstrating its agility and foresight in meeting future demands of the AI industry. Key Players in the AI Data Services Market Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial. Here’s a brief comparison of some major players: Company Key Focus ARR (Latest Reported) Valuation (Latest Reported) Noteworthy Micro1 High-quality, expert-driven AI data labeling & training, AI recruiter Zara $50M $500M Rapid growth, strategic funding, focus on domain experts Scale AI General AI data labeling, data for autonomous driving Confidential ~$13B (2021) Early market leader, Meta investment controversy Mercor AI data services >$450M Confidential Established larger player Surge AI data services ~$1.2B (2024) Confidential One of the largest reported players by ARR Powering the Future: The Critical Role of AI Training Data for Leading AI Labs The development of cutting-edge AI models by industry titans like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google is inherently dependent on robust and diverse AI training data . This data acts as the fuel for machine learning algorithms, allowing them to learn, adapt, and perform complex tasks. Without high-quality, meticulously labeled data, even the most sophisticated AI architectures would falter. Micro1’s success in attracting and working with leading AI labs , including Microsoft and several Fortune 100 companies, underscores its capacity to meet these demanding requirements. The nature of the AI data services business is such that it’s challenging for any single company to handle all of an AI lab’s diverse data needs. This reality creates a dynamic market where multiple providers can thrive, ensuring a healthy competitive landscape and plenty of business opportunities for innovative players like Micro1. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for AI Data Providers? Maintaining Data Quality at Scale: As AI models become more nuanced, the precision required for data labeling intensifies. Providers must continuously innovate their quality control mechanisms. Ethical Sourcing and Bias Mitigation: Ensuring that data is ethically sourced and free from biases is paramount to developing fair and equitable AI systems. This requires rigorous processes and diverse expert pools. Adapting to New AI Paradigms: The rapid evolution of AI, from traditional machine learning to agent-based systems and simulated environments, means data providers must constantly adapt their offerings and expertise. Recruiting Top Talent: The demand for domain experts will only grow. Companies like Micro1, with their AI-driven recruitment tools, are well-positioned to attract and retain this specialized workforce. Join 10k+ Tech and VC Leaders at Disrupt 2025!

Besides deterministic markets with a clear and final outcome, Polymarket and Chainlink are also looking into ways to make Chainlink more useful for settling prediction markets with more subjective questions. This would make them less reliant on social voting systems and even lower the risk of an outcome. The two firms will marry well, given that Polymarket uses Polygon by default. Polygon will focus on delivering faster and cheaper transactions by processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain. Chainlink, on the other hand, will provide an oracle network that connects smart contracts on the blockchain with real-world external data. Chainlink uses decentralized oracle networks to provide predictable data sources that help solve Polymarket outcomes. The integration joins Chainlink Data Streams, which provides low-latency, timestamped, and verifiable oracle reports, with Chainlink’s Automation, which lets markets settle automatically and on time on the blockchain. Polymarket’s decision to integrate Chainlink’s proven oracle infrastructure is a pivotal milestone that greatly enhances how prediction markets are created and settled. When market outcomes are resolved by high-quality data and tamper-proof computation from oracle networks, prediction markets evolve into reliable, real-time signals the world can trust. Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink. The infrastructure makes it possible for asset pricing markets, like Bitcoin price forecasts, to be settled almost instantly based on a set date and time. As such, while Polygon is Polymarket’s chain by default, Chainlink will be sending data to settle the markets into the Polygon chain in production. Meanwhile, Polymarket is getting ready to handle more users, especially because it added Donald Trump Jr. to its advisory board after securing investment from 1789 Capital. This has tied the prediction market more closely to US politics. Also, as reported by Cryptopolitan, Polymarket completed the $112 million acquisition of QCEX, a CFTC-licensed exchange and clearinghouse. This has given the freedom to re-enter the US market. The company also announced an official partnership with X to launch an integrated product that delivers users data-driven insights and personalized market recommendations. Chainlink reserve keeps the price of LINK steady Chainlink (LINK) said its on-chain reserve has grown to more than 280,000 LINK. The reserve first described in an announcement on August 7 is designed to accumulate LINK using off-chain revenue from enterprises and on-chain service fees. Chainlink confirmed that 43,034 LINK was added on September 11, bringing the total reserve to 280,048 LINK. This follows a September 4 allocation of 43,937 LINK, which pushed reserves above 237,000 LINK at that time. RESERVE UPDATE Today, the Chainlink Reserve has accumulated 43,034.62 LINK.

According to Chainlink’s data, the amount of LINK that was collected in Q2 2025 increased 309% month-over-month. Early accumulation has already added more than $1 million worth of LINK to the reserve. Meanwhile, the price of $LINK is up 4%, currently trading at $24.49 in the last 24 hours.

Gains of nearly 1% in the past 24 hours come as fresh corporate adoption makes headlines. Shares of Nasdaq-listed fashion retailer Mogu jumped as much as 76% after it disclosed a $20 million allocation into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The company which sells clothing and accessories online said the move was to diversify its treasury and expand for next gen AI services. Its stock has been struggling since peaking at $37 in 2021 and went up to $7 before dropping to $4.40. Mogu joins the growing list of companies that are adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, following the footsteps of MicroStrategy which now holds 638,460 BTC worth over $73 billion. The trend shows corporate demand for digital assets as a hedge and a way to get attention in the market.

In the center of all that attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol quickly rising in the market with its revolutionary model of lending and growing ecosystem that is placing it at the pinnacle of most talked-about tokens this month. Mutuum Finance presale is in Phase 6 and is currently priced at $0.035. The project has over $15.6 million in total funds raised and over 16,220 token holders. Dogecoin (DOGE) shows there is still room to rise but investors looking for bigger gains are looking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Dogecoin Maintains at $0.24 Amidst Shift in Meme-Coin Sentiment Dogecoin (DOGE) is at $0.2404, having traded between $0.2371 and $0.2483 intraday. While DOGE is settled in the $0.24 area, general market interest in use-case-focused DeFi projects would appear to be increasing, drawing increasingly more attention away from meme-based tokens and onto newly emerging platforms such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance is already in stage 6 presale where the token can be found at a price of $0.035. The project has already acquired more than 16,220 token holders and has already raised over $15.6 million. FOMO is spreading quick. Early birds will be making life-changing profits. Defining the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance will lead the pack when DeFi takes centre stage. It is accessible to retail and institutional investors. Mutuum Finance is taking gigantic strides with its revolutionary smart contract concept and focus on security and scalability. Mutuum finance also has a $100,000 giveaway where 10 users were to be rewarded with $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. The campaign shows the project’s initiative in building a long-term and loyal user base. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance, in partnership with CertiK is inviting interested participants to identify bugs and potential weaknesses that could be exploited by bad actors. There is a $50,000 USDT reward to be shared by all participants. Rewards will be labeled as critical, major, minor and low and will be paid in a decreasing order. Anyone can join in. This reflects how seriously Mutuum Finance is concerned about security on their platform. Strong oracle infrastructure enable price discovery. Prices of assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX are provided by Chainlink data feeds. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain DEX stats ensure accuracy in the case of timely and correct valuations for collateral management and liquidation protocol. This decentralized finance newcomer utilizes Loan-to-Value assumption to put into action in collateral ratio limits and shifting liquidation risk to risky work and compensating liquidators. Reserve factor is a proxy to keep interest content in force for what is really equivalent to a buffer against default and adverse market condition to put more reserve at risk on risk assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are September’s two best tokens under $0.50, but the momentum is heavily behind MUTM. Mutuum Finance has fast gained footing in the market despite being a newcomer. In just months, investors have poured in over $15 million into the project, hoping for huge bull run returns. Demand continues to rise as more buyers show interest in the crypto. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is hovering below $0.25 but with potential to break out during the next big leg up. While the two coins stand out as top buys below $0.50, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart with strong utility focus and early-stage FOMO.

Reports have disclosed that the firm’s tokenized money market product, known as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund or BUIDL, is already live on the Ethereum network and works with firms such as Securitize and BNY Mellon for transfer agent and custody roles. BlackRock Tokenized Fund Partners And Setup According to filings and industry reports, the BUIDL fund is backed by cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Transfer agent duties are being handled by Securitize while custody services are provided by BNY Mellon. Other infrastructure providers named in reports include Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase and Anchorage Digital. The fund pays yields to token holders on a daily basis using blockchain rails, and it is being positioned as a bridge between classic cash-like instruments and programmable token holdings. JUST IN: BlackRock plans to tokenize ETFs following success with $BTC fund. pic.twitter.com/yQD0E4VjpX — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) September 11, 2025 The Push Toward Tokenized ETFs Executives have been quoted as saying tokenization could scale far beyond a single fund. Reports have put a potential addressable market figure as high as $10 trillion if a broad array of assets and ETFs are moved on-chain over time. Industry trackers also show that the total value locked in tokenized real-world assets passed $10 billion in recent months, a sign that the market is no longer purely experimental. BlackRock’s activity has prompted comparisons with other large asset managers, such as Franklin Templeton, which have also launched tokenized offerings. Market Benefits And Practical Limits Proponents say tokenized ETFs could allow fractional ownership and round-the-clock transferability, and they could speed settlement in some cases. Reports say tokenization may also boost transparency since ownership records can be viewed directly on the chain. At the same time, uncertainty remains over how tokenized ETF shares will interact with existing market structures such as APs and market makers, and whether on-chain trading will be treated the same as exchange trading under US securities rules. Regulatory And Custody Questions Remain Regulators, custodians and auditors face hard choices about legal rights, disclosure and investor protections for tokenized securities. On the basis of sector coverage, firms continue to sort out custody architectures and legal wrappers that provide enforceable claims on the underlying assets to token holders. Various jurisdictions might draw different conclusions, which would impede cross-border adoption or confine rollouts to individual markets. Bitcoin Fund Success Spurs Speculation Over Tokenized ETFs BlackRock’s investigation into tokenized ETFs is a follow-up on the success of its Bitcoin fund, already attracting robust inflows and market interest. The firm’s success in that department is now generating speculation that its next move will be to take pieces of its multi-trillion-dollar ETF business on-chain. Should the transition occur, it would represent one of the biggest steps so far by a global asset manager towards investment products based on blockchain.

Feroli noted that some members wanted a larger rate cut, but none favored leaving rates unchanged. He also noted that the Fed's dot plot projections are expected to project another rate cut after 2025. Meanwhile, the probability of a US government shutdown this year has risen to 54%, the highest in months, according to data from prediction market Kalshi. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has warned that Democrats are prepared to deplete government funds if Republicans refuse to accept demands for health care spending. Related News: Billionaire Mike Novogratz's Surprising Announcement: “We've Entered the Solana Season” Meanwhile, TD Securities strategists argued in a note that the dollar could appreciate in the short term if the Fed cuts interest rates by 25 basis points but delivers cautious forward-looking messages. The strategists noted that markets are pricing in successive rate cuts, but the Fed could limit these expectations by highlighting inflation risks. It was noted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to emphasize that the rate cuts are not tied to a predetermined path and that data will be closely monitored. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin, the pioneer of digital currency, offers unmatched security and market dominance, while Ethereum powers decentralized applications and continues to fuel innovation across DeFi and NFTs. Much like how Outset PR leverages data-driven strategies to help brands stand out in competitive markets, both BTC and ETH are navigating shifting dynamics that could define their growth trajectory for the rest of the year. This article examines which of these two giants may carry the stronger outlook going forward. Ethereum Flirts with Resistance, Eyes Next Big Leap Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently trading between four thousand one hundred eighty-three and four thousand four hundred sixty-one dollars. It's edging close to the key resistance level of four thousand six hundred sixteen dollars. If it breaks past this point, it might aim for the next milestone at four thousand eight hundred ninety-four dollars. This would be an increase of around ten percent from its current range. Recent movements show a slight dip over the past month but a whopping rise of over one hundred thirty percent in the past six months. With its growing momentum and decent RSI, Ethereum has a strong potential for another surge.

Let Outset PR Tell Your Story With Verifiable Impact Bitcoin Shows Steady Gains, Eyeing Resistance Levels Ahead Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently trading between approximately $107,822 and $113,952. The cryptocurrency is showing a modest climb this week, with a 3.80% increase. After recent fluctuations, its performance over the last six months has soared by over 36%. Traders are keeping a close eye on the key resistance level just below $117,000. If Bitcoin continues on its upward path, it might aim for the second resistance near $122,889. While short-term movements have been mixed, the longer-term potential indicates possible growth as new highs are reached. As usual, the market will decide if these gains hold, but optimism remains regarding upward momentum. Conclusion As 2025 progresses, both Ethereum and Bitcoin present compelling cases for investors, albeit for different reasons. Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its reliability and store-of-value status, while Ethereum’s momentum stems from its utility-driven growth and expanding use cases. Just as Outset PR tailors strategies to highlight client strengths, investors must weigh which asset’s fundamentals align more closely with their goals.

Over 50% of traders are in the money, potentially easing selling pressure. PUMP has responded to the revival of the Pump.fun ecosystem. The token rallied to $0.0064, recovering its initial all-time peak. The main driver behind PUMP was the news of an imminent listing on Binance, bringing higher liquidity and a wider pool of investors.

The token was hit by whale sales, coinciding with a slow period on Pump.fun. After meme production and trading picked up again, Pump.fun pivoted to earnings distribution, increasing its creator rewards ten times. The Pump.fun team wallet is now transferring SOL for additional buybacks to support the price. In the past day, Pump.fun made its biggest buyback in history, reinjecting 98.2% of the day’s revenues. The launch of Project Ascend kicked off a new Pump.fun season, riding on the general recovery of the Solana ecosystem. The token also appreciated after ongoing buybacks, as the Pump.fun team acquired over 6.35% of the token supply over the course of a few weeks. During that time, Pump.fun has not sold SOL, but has reinjected it into the ecosystem. PUMP listing on Binance sets up hopes for an airdrop The listing of PUMP on Binance did not follow the usual path for most tokens. PUMP launched without an additional airdrop campaign. Pump.fun users have long awaited an airdrop based on trenches trading. Currently, not all PUMP is distributed, and the team can arrange a large airdrop. The additional distribution of tokens may happen at any moment. The market anticipates this development, which would boost fees for Binance and increase PUMP trading. On Polymarket, the predictions for a PUMP airdrop in September are accelerating, with volumes and odds picking up. Looks like someone knows something $Pump airdrop coming in september? pic.twitter.com/WZSfbWFnDx — 0xMarioNawfal (@RoundtableSpace) September 12, 2025 Other Solana projects have also chosen September for an airdrop. Additionally, more PUMP will be unlocked from the community allocation reserves , increasing the anticipation for the airdrop. The Binance listing may also invite more selling, as at least one whale moved coins to the exchange to realize up to $592K in additional profits. The trenches are back, Pump.fun app becomes more popular Pump.fun sees consistent trenches action, with over $40M in daily volumes and over 20K token launches daily. Daily fees also returned to levels not seen since the January meme frenzy, breaking above $6M daily. Pump.fun also expands its activity on a mix of active token minting and responses to current events. The platform also saw increased usage of its mobile app, moving up the ranks based on downloads and usage. In the past three days, the Pump.fun rose up the ranks, from position 165 to 110. Potentially, Pump.fun may bring mass adoption through app-based meme trading. Get seen where it counts.

Bitcoin surged closer to $120,000, Ethereum maintained momentum on ETF flows, and traditional markets wobbled. But beneath the noise, a lesser-known utility presale token is quietly gaining ground, drawing early interest from traders who believe the biggest moves won’t come from Bitcoin or Ethereum this quarter. CPI Surprise Pushes Investors Toward Risk Assets The August Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a 0.4% monthly rise and a 2.9% annual increase, rattling markets. Stocks slipped, yields spiked, and traders once again turned to crypto as a hedge against inflation’s persistence. Bitcoin’s rally dominated headlines, but presale chatter has intensified—particularly among U.S. retail investors looking for tokens that aren’t just hedges, but emerging opportunities with built-in utility. Why Utility Presale Tokens Are on the Radar Unlike typical altcoins or meme tokens that launch without functional backing, utility presale tokens are designed with clear in-platform use cases from day one. This model appeals to investors who want the high-upside dynamics of presales but prefer tokens with a purpose beyond speculation. Presales also tend to benefit during moments of macro volatility. When traditional markets wobble, the allure of “ground floor” opportunities becomes irresistible, particularly if the project promises community rewards, scalability, or future integrations. MAGAX: A Different Kind of Presale Play One presale generating quiet buzz is Moonshot MAGAX , a utility token blending meme-driven energy with AI-powered functionality. While it may not yet be a household name, its structure sets it apart. MAGAX integrates Meme-to-Earn incentives where community engagement translates into rewards, adds an AI utility layer that emphasizes fairness and smarter participation, and adopts a deflationary model with periodic burns and capped supply. For traders familiar with the empty promises of many meme coins, MAGAX’s utility-driven angle is refreshing. It’s not positioning itself as just another speculative altcoin—it’s aiming to be a token people can actually use while still enjoying the viral energy meme coins are known for. Inflation, IPO Buzz, and the Shift to Presales The U.S. inflation print wasn’t the only headline moving markets this week. Wall Street is still buzzing over Gemini’s IPO, a reminder that institutional attention is flowing back into the crypto sector. Historically, these moments have been fertile ground for presales. When the big tokens capture headlines, early movers look for undiscovered projects that could become tomorrow’s narrative. MAGAX fits neatly into this trend—especially for U.S. retail investors who want exposure before listings drive up entry prices. Why Early Movers Are Paying Attention Several factors are fueling FOMO around MAGAX. Presale stages are selling out faster than expected, with whale wallets already spotted accumulating. By tapping into meme energy while offering actual utility, MAGAX appeals to both retail enthusiasm and long-term vision. With capped supply and a deflationary model, scarcity could amplify once listings arrive. In crypto, perception often matters as much as fundamentals. And right now, perception is shifting—from MAGAX being a niche project to being “the presale token to watch.” What Comes Next for MAGAX The path forward will depend on execution. Can MAGAX convert early presale hype into sustainable adoption? Will major exchanges take notice once presale stages close? And can its AI-driven fairness tools resonate with users beyond crypto-Twitter buzz? If momentum holds, 2025 could mark the year MAGAX transitions from an overlooked presale into a utility token with viral reach. But if execution falters, it risks being another presale lost in the noise. Don’t Sleep on Presale Utility - Get 5% Bonus Tokens NOW The CPI surprise has reminded traders that volatility creates openings. Bitcoin and Ethereum may dominate mainstream headlines, but the real edge often comes from identifying tomorrow’s breakout stories while they’re still flying under the radar. For some investors, MAGAX presale represents exactly that: a presale token with utility baked in, scarcity by design, and meme culture firepower fueling community growth. In crypto, waiting often means watching gains happen without you. And for MAGAX, curiosity today could turn into full-blown FOMO tomorrow.

Coinbase, a leading crypto exchange, has officially announced a pivotal MATIC to POL conversion . This upgrade is set to take place between October 14 and 17, 2025, marking an important step in the evolution of the Polygon ecosystem. For many, this news brings questions about what this transition entails and how it will impact their digital assets. What is the MATIC to POL Conversion and Why is it Happening? The core of this announcement is the planned shift from Polygon’s current native token, MATIC, to a new token called POL. This isn’t just a simple token swap; it represents a foundational upgrade to the entire Polygon network, known as Polygon 2.0. The new POL token is designed to power a more robust, scalable, and interconnected ecosystem. POL’s Purpose: POL is envisioned as a ‘hyperproductive’ token, enabling validators to secure multiple chains within the Polygon ecosystem, including the Polygon PoS chain, zkEVM, and future Layer 2s. Enhanced Security and Scalability: This upgrade aims to provide greater security through a shared staking mechanism and improve the network’s overall scalability, allowing for more transactions at lower costs. Future-Proofing: The move to POL prepares Polygon for a future where it can support a vast network of interconnected blockchains, fostering innovation and wider adoption. Coinbase’s decision to facilitate this MATIC to POL conversion ensures that its users can seamlessly participate in Polygon’s future without needing complex manual interventions. This proactive approach underscores the exchange’s commitment to supporting major network upgrades. How Will the MATIC to POL Conversion Impact Coinbase Users? For Coinbase users, the good news is that the process is designed to be straightforward and automatic. Coinbase will handle the conversion of all eligible MATIC tokens to POL tokens on behalf of its users. This includes not only spot holdings but also staked MATIC assets, which is a crucial detail for many long-term holders. What does this mean for you? Automatic Process: You generally won’t need to take any direct action to convert your MATIC to POL on Coinbase. The exchange will manage the technical aspects. Staked Assets Included: If you have MATIC staked through Coinbase, these assets will also be converted to POL, ensuring continuity for your earning potential. Seamless Transition: The goal is a smooth transition, minimizing disruption to your portfolio and participation in the Polygon ecosystem. It’s important to remember that while the conversion is automatic, staying informed about any specific announcements from Coinbase regarding the exact procedures or potential temporary service interruptions around the conversion dates is always a wise approach. This ensures you are fully prepared for the upcoming MATIC to POL conversion . Preparing for the MATIC to POL Conversion: Essential Steps While Coinbase aims for a hands-off experience for its users, a few proactive steps can help you feel more confident and prepared for the upcoming MATIC to POL conversion . Being informed is your best strategy. Here’s what you can do: Stay Updated: Regularly check official announcements from Coinbase and the Polygon Foundation. These will provide the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the conversion process and timeline. Review Your Holdings: Take a moment to verify your MATIC holdings on Coinbase well in advance of the conversion dates. This includes both your spot balance and any staked assets. Understand the Timeline: Note the October 14-17, 2025, window. While you won’t need to perform manual actions, knowing when the conversion is happening can help you plan for any potential temporary limitations on MATIC transactions or withdrawals around those dates. Consider Your Strategy: If you have MATIC held on other exchanges or in self-custody wallets, you will need to research their specific conversion plans or take manual action to convert your tokens. Coinbase’s automatic conversion applies only to assets held on its platform. By taking these simple steps, you can ensure a smooth experience during this significant upgrade. The proactive measures by Coinbase aim to make the transition as effortless as possible for its user base. The Future of Polygon: Beyond the MATIC to POL Conversion The MATIC to POL conversion is more than just a token swap; it’s a cornerstone of the ambitious Polygon 2.0 vision. This upgrade is designed to transform Polygon into the “internet of blockchains,” a network of interconnected Layer 2 solutions powered by zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. What does this mean for the broader ecosystem? Interoperability: POL will facilitate seamless communication and value transfer between various Polygon chains, creating a unified and highly efficient network. Decentralization and Security: The new staking mechanism with POL aims to enhance the network’s decentralization and overall security posture, benefiting all users and developers. Innovation Hub: A more scalable and interconnected Polygon is expected to attract more developers and projects, fostering a new wave of decentralized applications (dApps) and innovations. This strategic move positions Polygon for sustained growth and leadership in the blockchain space. The transition to POL is a testament to the network’s commitment to continuous improvement and its long-term vision for a decentralized future. Coinbase’s support in this crucial conversion highlights its confidence in Polygon’s trajectory.

Amidst these developments, a new utility token is making waves in the presale phase, capturing the attention of savvy investors. While major cryptocurrencies often grab the limelight during economic uncertainties, it's the presale tokens that are now drawing significant attention, especially those with practical utility and robust economic models. The Appeal of Utility Tokens During Economic Fluctuations The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed a substantial monthly and annual increase, causing traditional stocks to dip and bond yields to rise. This environment has made cryptocurrencies an attractive hedge against ongoing inflation concerns. In the shadows of the major players, presale tokens, particularly those with built-in utility like Moonshot MAGAX , are gaining traction. Unlike many speculative tokens, MAGAX offers real-world applications from the outset, adding intrinsic value beyond mere speculation. What is Driving Interest in MAGAX? Amidst this buzz, MAGAX stands out due to its unique blend of features. It combines meme appeal with AI-driven functionalities, aiming to offer more than just a speculative asset. This token provides Meme-to-Earn incentives, making community engagement potentially rewarding. Furthermore, its deflationary nature and limited supply could enhance its value over time, making it an attractive option for early investors. Strategic Moves and Future Opportunities The buzz around utility tokens like MAGAX is not just about current gains but also about their potential for future growth. As Wall Street gears up with events like Gemini's IPO, the spotlight on presales grows, highlighting opportunities for early investors to capitalize before these tokens hit mainstream exchanges. The strategic accumulation by large-scale investors (""whales"") and the rapid sell-out of presale stages suggests a growing confidence in MAGAX’s market potential. Positioning Ahead: The MAGAX Token’s Trajectory The future of MAGAX hinges on its ability to sustain the initial hype through effective execution and adoption. Its performance in upcoming listings and the broader user engagement with its AI enhancements will be critical. Successful navigation through these phases could set MAGAX apart in a crowded market, transitioning from an under-the-radar presale to a mainstream utility token. Conclusion: Why MAGAX Deserves Attention Now With its compelling utility features and a market ripe for innovative presales, MAGAX presents a unique opportunity for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios. Given the ongoing economic shifts and the increasing appeal of cryptocurrencies as an inflation hedge, getting in early on tokens like MAGAX could be a wise move. Discover more about the MAGAX presale and consider whether this unique token fits into your investment strategy. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This monumental surge has captivated investors and analysts alike, signaling robust growth within the Binance ecosystem and the broader digital asset landscape. For many, this record-breaking performance is a testament to BNB’s enduring utility and strategic position in the crypto market. What Powers BNB’s Ascent to a New All-Time High? Understanding the forces behind BNB’s impressive climb is crucial for anyone following the crypto market. BNB, the native cryptocurrency of the Binance blockchain, plays a pivotal role within one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. Its utility extends far beyond mere trading, making it an indispensable asset for many users. Binance Ecosystem Growth: The continuous expansion of Binance’s services, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Binance Launchpad, and various DeFi initiatives, directly boosts BNB’s demand. Token Burn Mechanism: Binance regularly conducts token burns, permanently removing BNB from circulation. This deflationary mechanism reduces supply, often leading to price appreciation when demand remains strong. Transaction Fee Discounts: Users holding BNB can receive discounts on trading fees on the Binance exchange, providing a tangible benefit that encourages adoption and retention. Participation in Launchpad Projects: BNB is frequently required for participation in new token sales on Binance Launchpad, creating consistent demand from investors seeking early access to promising projects. Navigating the Market: What Does This BNB All-Time High Mean for You? The achievement of a BNB all-time high naturally sparks questions about its implications. For current BNB holders, this is a moment of significant validation, reflecting potential gains and increased portfolio value. However, new investors might wonder if it’s too late to join the rally or what factors could sustain this momentum. Increased Investor Confidence: A new all-time high often boosts confidence, attracting more capital into the asset and potentially fueling further growth. Market Bellwether: BNB’s performance can sometimes act as an indicator for the health of the altcoin market, reflecting broader sentiment towards digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Future Utility Expansion: Binance continues to innovate, suggesting potential new use cases for BNB that could further cement its value proposition. This includes developments in NFTs, GameFi, and enterprise blockchain solutions. Are There Any Challenges on the Horizon for BNB After its Peak? While the celebration of a new BNB all-time high is well-deserved, it is equally important to acknowledge potential challenges. The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and even strong assets like BNB are not immune to price fluctuations. Understanding these risks is vital for informed decision-making. Regulatory Scrutiny: As a centralized exchange token, BNB is often subject to evolving regulatory landscapes across different jurisdictions. Changes in regulations could impact its operations and value. Market Competition: The blockchain space is highly competitive, with new platforms and tokens constantly emerging. BNB must continually innovate to maintain its edge. Broader Market Downturns: A significant correction in the overall crypto market, often led by Bitcoin, can drag down even high-performing altcoins. Sustaining Momentum: What’s Next for BNB After the All-Time High? Looking ahead, the focus shifts to how BNB can sustain its remarkable momentum following this BNB all-time high . The underlying strength of the Binance ecosystem, combined with strategic initiatives, will likely play a crucial role in its continued success. Investors and users will be watching closely for future developments. Continued Innovation: Binance’s commitment to developing new products and services, particularly within DeFi and Web3, will be key to expanding BNB’s utility. Community Engagement: A strong, active community is vital for any successful cryptocurrency. Binance’s efforts to engage its user base contribute to BNB’s resilience and adoption. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with other projects and traditional finance entities can expand BNB’s reach and utility, opening new avenues for growth. Conclusion: A New Era for BNB The achievement of a $910 BNB all-time high is more than just a number; it represents a significant milestone in the journey of one of the crypto world’s most influential assets. It underscores the power of a robust ecosystem, strategic tokenomics, and unwavering community support. As BNB continues to evolve, its performance will remain a key indicator for the health and innovation within the broader cryptocurrency market. This monumental surge truly ushers in a new era for BNB, cementing its position as a dominant force. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is BNB’s primary use case? BNB is primarily used to pay for transaction fees on the Binance exchange and Binance Smart Chain, participate in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and access discounts on trading fees. What contributed to BNB reaching its new all-time high? Several factors contributed, including the growth of the Binance ecosystem, its token burn mechanism, increasing utility within DeFi, and strong market demand. Is BNB a good investment after reaching an all-time high? Investing in cryptocurrency always carries risk. While BNB has shown strong performance, potential investors should conduct thorough research, understand market volatility, and consider their financial goals before making investment decisions. How does the BNB token burn work? Binance regularly conducts token burns, permanently removing a portion of BNB from circulation. This deflationary measure aims to reduce supply and potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens over time. What are the risks associated with holding BNB? Risks include market volatility, potential regulatory changes impacting Binance’s operations, and competition from other blockchain platforms. Did this article shed light on BNB’s incredible journey?

The video was shared by crypto influencer Xaif (@XaifCrypto), who highlighted the update for the XRP army. Geraci, president of The ETF Store and a well-known industry commentator, opened the conversation by referencing a set of filings from January that sought approval for multiple leveraged crypto ETFs . These products include exposure to XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and even meme tokens such as Bonk. Huge XRP Update Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, says recent leveraged ETF filings covering $XRP are READY to launch “These are all just about ready to go” from an effectiveness standpoint pic.twitter.com/VdqBsF1w0A — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) September 11, 2025 Tuttle’s Assessment of the Filings In response to Geraci’s question about where the filings currently stand, Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, indicated that progress has been significant. He described the ETFs as “just about ready to go from an effectiveness standpoint.” His comment suggests that regulatory clearance is imminent, even if formal approval has not yet been announced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While Geraci acknowledged that some details could not be disclosed, Tuttle’s remarks give clarity to a process that has often appeared opaque to investors tracking crypto-related ETF applications. Implications for XRP For XRP, the update carries particular significance. XRP remains one of the most popular and widely used digital assets, with investors often watching regulatory moves closely given its high-profile legal history in the U.S . The prospect of a leveraged ETF tied to XRP signals that demand has grown beyond traditional spot or futures products. It also positions XRP alongside other major cryptocurrencies packaged into structured investment vehicles. Leveraged ETFs enable market participants to amplify exposure, offering the potential for higher returns, but also increasing risks. By placing XRP within this structure, issuers signal confidence that sufficient market interest exists to sustain liquidity and investor activity.

The Race for Spot XRP ETFs In addition to the leveraged ETF filings, multiple companies have also filed for spot XRP ETFs, showing the broad appeal XRP has among traditional investors. The SEC’s decision deadlines for most of these applications are in October , and the final months of 2025 could be a major turning point for XRP. The digital asset is finally receiving the attention it deserves, and with regulatory clarity and an incoming wave of institutional investment, XRP could reach levels never seen before.

The step reverses part of the emergency tightening that took the key rate to 21% to fight inflation. Officials moved after complaints from business leaders that high borrowing costs were hurting activity. Even after the cut, the bank warned of persistent price pressures. It said inflation eased somewhat in July and August but remains high at 8.2%. The bank said, “Inflation expectations have not changed considerably in recent months.” It added, “In general, they remain elevated.” “This may impede a sustainable slowdown in inflation.” The gap between easier policy and tough inflation language shows frictions in the economy. The central bank is trying to restrain prices while the finance ministry injects cash through defense orders and military recruitment bonuses that have lifted growth, wages, and prices over the 3 1/2-year war against Ukraine. Russia’s economic growth slows sharply in Q2 On an annual basis, growth slowed to 1.1% in the second quarter, down from 1.4% in the first quarter and from 4.5% at the end of last year. Compared with the prior quarter, second-quarter output fell 0.6%. From January to July, the deficit stood at 4.9 trillion rubles, up from 1.1 trillion rubles a year earlier. According to the Kyiv School of Economics, which tracks Russia’s budget and oil revenues, spending reached 129% of the plan. Oil and gas takings fell 19% from a year earlier, in part due to slack global oil prices. Despite sanctions and the loss of most gas sales to Europe, the economy has held up better than expected. Joblessness is at a record low, and household incomes are rising. To finance the deficit, the government has sold ruble bonds to domestic banks, which have been eager buyers expecting rates to keep falling. UK hits Russia’s oil revenues with new sanctions Cryptopolitan reported recently that Russia launched its biggest strike in months on Ukraine, hitting a key government building. Hours later, the Trump administration and the EU signaled new sanctions together . Meanwhile, the UK announced 100 new sanctions targeting Russia’s revenues and its “shadow fleet,” unveiled in Kyiv by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. London said it follows the largest air attack of the war on Ukraine, with more than 800 missiles and drones fired in a single night. Officials said Russia launched 6,500 drones and missiles in July alone, 10 times the level a year ago, with recent strikes hitting the Ukrainian cabinet of ministers, damaging the British Council and EU delegation buildings in Kyiv, and violating Nato airspace over Poland. On Friday, sanctions were imposed on 70 additional ships in the “shadow fleet.” Another 30 entities and individuals accused of supplying electronics, chemicals and explosives used to manufacture missiles and other weapons systems were also targeted. Those targeted include China-based Shenzhen Blue Hat International Trade Co. and its Russian co-owners, Elena Malitckaia and Alexey Malitskiy, along with Turkey-based MastelMakina İthalat İhracat Limited Şirketi and its chief executive, the Azerbaijani national Shanlik Shukurov. “International action to increase economic pressure on Russia and to cut off critical cash flows, which he desperately needs to pay for this illegal war is vital. These sanctions form the next stage in the UK’s leading efforts to ramp up economic pressure alongside our security support and our work alongside the coalition of the willing for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” Cooper said.

Regulatory frameworks (like MiCA), multilingual markets, shifting media and search-algorithms, and audience fragmentation all mean that scaling via PR needs a smart, data-driven approach. The agencies below are among the most capable of navigating this landscape as of late 2025. 1. Outset PR The first place goes to Outset PR because of its demonstrated ability to monitor media performance, adapt strategy, and deliver verifiable results. Outset PR’s Key Strengths Include: Data-driven and regionally aware: Outset PR consistently monitors regulatory changes (like MiCA), algorithm updates (e.g. Google’s), and SEO shifts affecting crypto-media visibility. It has recently presented reports on media performance across Western and Eastern Europe. Regulatory sensitivity: Outset PR tracks how MiCA and national regulations impact media outlets, so they can advise clients on content strategy (tone, compliance, disclaimers, legal risk) ahead of enforcement. Boutique-level approach: Outset PR takes a personalized approach rather than relying on generic packages or mass outreach. Each campaign is meticulously designed to align with the client's unique objectives, budget, and developmental phase. Outset PR Recent Case Studies Client Challenge / Goal What Outset PR Did Results Step App Expand reach in UK & US; improve token engagement and user acquisition. Produced traffic-driving content targeting these markets; amplified through crypto & generalist media. ~138% rise in value of their FITFI token; significantly increased user engagement.

Ankr Become more recognized in a crowded Web3 infrastructure space. Multi-channel campaign including press, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Telegram. 500+ articles over 4 months; significant lift in brand awareness among developer & infrastructure audiences. Best Fit Projects with somewhat larger budgets aiming for sustained European/global visibility.

Good relationships with mainstream media, reliable reputational management. Case Examples / Notes While specific recent case studies in Europe are less detailed in public domain, the agency is often cited in top 10 lists for its stability and credibility. Best Fit Projects requiring solid narrative, corporate credibility, executive visibility. Use cases where trust, regulatory compliance, and clarity of messaging matter above hype. 5. FINPR Agency Overview More boutique / performance-oriented; deeper specialization in DeFi / NFT / crypto startup workflows. Typically more cost-efficient compared to large global agencies, with specialized expertise. Case Examples / Notes Though fewer large published case studies are in the open, multiple rankings show them as delivering good ROI for smaller-to-mid sized campaigns. Best Fit Startups or smaller projects that need strong crypto-native outreach without the highest agency fees. Campaigns with specific goals: token launch, presale, NFT drop, or community / influencer amplification. Top 5 Crypto PR Agencies Here’s a comparison to help you choose which agency might suit your project best, depending on size, budget, goals, and regional focus. Agency Typical Budget Range* Regional Strengths in Europe Key Services / Differentiators Best Use Case Outset PR Mid to upper-mid; flexible depending on scope Strong across Western Europe; growing presence in Eastern Europe; multilinguism; regulatory awareness (MiCA etc.) Media analytics & reporting, compliance-informed content strategy, localization, token narrative development, high reliability in regulatory transition periods When you need to balance exposure + legal/regulatory safety; projects targeting multiple European markets; need to adapt fast to media/SEO shifts MarketAcross Upper-mid to large Excellent institutional / infrastructure exposure; solid presence in central & western Europe; ties to event media; strong reach Full-stack PR + content marketing + influencer/KOL; success-based metrics; strong for large announcements & continuous campaigns Protocols, infrastructure projects, staking/payout programs; long-haul brand building; when SEO + readership metrics matter Coinbound Mid Good global + European reach via influencers + crypto media; strong in popular markets (UK, Germany, etc.) Influencer campaigns + content + PR; speed + visibility; retail / community focus NFT/gaming/social projects; projects needing fast community / user growth; less regulatory intensity needed Melrose PR Mid to upper-mid More crossover with fintech / traditional finance media in Europe; good for corporate/Web3 hybrid stories Executive positioning; mainstream media; reputation management; thought leadership When credibility, investor trust, regulatory perception are key; enterprise‐grade projects FINPR Agency Lower-mid to mid Strong in niche crypto/deFi/NFT sectors; flexible budget; likely more cost-effective in smaller European markets Focused crypto native services; influencer + community; may offer more specialized targeting Early-stage projects, niche defi/NFT drops; when maximizing yield per euro spent; lean campaigns * “Typical Budget Range” is indicative; actual costs depend on scope (number of markets, languages, content volume, influencer / KOL spend, etc.). Key Insights & Takeaways for Web3 Projects Scaling in Europe Watch regulatory shifts closely: Reports from Outset PR show that regulatory pressures like MiCA are already affecting media outlets, especially crypto-native ones. If your content strategy isn’t aligned (disclaimers, careful language, avoiding “investment promotion” issues), you risk your media placements being delayed, suppressed, or worse. Diversify media channels: With crypto media under pressure in many regions, generalist tech / finance outlets are more stable; also influencer / KOL / social can compensate for losses in search or crypto-native media. SEO & content quality matter more than ever: Google algorithm changes (e.g. in March 2025) penalized thin content or duplicated / low differentiation content. Content that offers insights, analysis, localized relevance, or multilingual support is less vulnerable. Localization helps: Projects that adapt content into local languages (German, Spanish, French, etc.) and adjust for cultural/regulatory context tend to fare better in audience growth and media visibility. Track performance and adjust: Use data (media reach, traffic, engagement) to adjust strategy; what worked a year ago may underperform now in certain regions.

This impressive bounce-back by Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has sent ripples of optimism across the digital asset landscape. For many investors, this recovery signals renewed strength and potential for further gains. But what exactly is fueling this resurgence, and what does it mean for the future of Ethereum? What’s Powering the Current ETH Recovery ? Ethereum’s journey back to the $4,600 mark isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a testament to several underlying factors converging to create positive momentum. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone following the crypto space. Strong Fundamentals: Ethereum continues to be the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and countless decentralized applications (dApps). Its utility and adoption are steadily growing. Network Upgrades: Ongoing developments, particularly the shift to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Consensus Layer and Execution Layer upgrades), aim to improve scalability, security, and energy efficiency. These upgrades instill confidence in the network’s long-term viability. Decreasing Supply: With the implementation of EIP-1559, a portion of transaction fees is burned, effectively reducing the supply of ETH over time. This deflationary pressure can contribute to price appreciation as demand increases. Broader Market Sentiment: A general positive sentiment in the wider cryptocurrency market often lifts major assets like Ethereum. When Bitcoin shows strength, ETH recovers often follows suit. These combined elements create a robust foundation, allowing ETH recovers efforts to gain traction and sustain upward movement. Why is the $4.6K Level Significant for ETH ? The $4,600 level isn’t just another price point; it holds both technical and psychological importance for traders and investors. Reclaiming it suggests a shift in market dynamics and a renewed bullish sentiment. Technical Resistance Turned Support: Historically, price levels that act as strong resistance can, once broken, transform into strong support. Successfully moving past $4,600 indicates that this level could now serve as a floor, preventing sharper declines. Psychological Milestone: Round numbers and previous highs often act as psychological benchmarks. Surpassing such a level can boost investor confidence, attracting new capital and reinforcing bullish sentiment. Validation of Strength: For many, the ability of ETH recovers to push past this mark validates its inherent strength and resilience in a volatile market. It suggests that underlying demand remains robust. This achievement is not merely about a number; it’s about what that number represents in terms of market belief and technical validation for Ethereum’s trajectory. Navigating Challenges and Future Opportunities for Ethereum While the current rally is encouraging, it’s essential to consider the road ahead. Ethereum, like any major asset, faces its share of challenges and opportunities that could influence how ETH recovers in the long run. Challenges: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Price swings can be sudden and significant, requiring investors to remain vigilant. Competition: Other layer-1 blockchains are constantly emerging, offering alternatives to Ethereum with different scaling solutions and fee structures. Regulatory Scrutiny: The evolving regulatory landscape globally could impact how cryptocurrencies are traded and used. Opportunities: Continued DeFi and NFT Growth: As these sectors expand, Ethereum’s role as the leading platform will likely strengthen. Scalability Improvements: Future upgrades, including sharding and rollups, promise to significantly enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs, addressing current pain points. Institutional Adoption: Growing interest from institutional investors could bring substantial capital and stability to the Ethereum ecosystem, further aiding the ETH recovers narrative. Understanding these dynamics is key to making informed decisions as the market evolves. Actionable Insights for Investors as ETH Recovers For those looking to engage with the Ethereum market, observing key indicators and maintaining a strategic approach is vital, especially when ETH recovers and shows strong momentum. Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on network activity, gas fees, and the number of active addresses. These metrics can provide insights into real-world adoption and demand. Follow Upgrade Progress: Stay informed about the progress of Ethereum’s network upgrades. Successful implementations are positive catalysts. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Ethereum is a strong asset, a diversified crypto portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set clear entry and exit strategies. By staying informed and disciplined, investors can better navigate the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of cryptocurrency. The recent rally, seeing ETH recovers the $4,600 level, is a significant moment for Ethereum and the broader crypto market. It underscores the network’s enduring strength, driven by robust fundamentals, continuous innovation, and growing adoption. While challenges remain, the opportunities for Ethereum appear vast, promising continued evolution and potential growth. As the digital economy expands, Ethereum’s foundational role is likely to solidify, making its journey a compelling narrative to watch. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does “ETH recovers $4.6K” mean? This phrase indicates that the price of Ethereum (ETH) has successfully climbed back up to and surpassed the $4,600 price point after a period of being below it. It signifies a positive price movement and renewed market confidence. What factors contributed to ETH’s recovery? Several factors, including strong fundamentals, ongoing network upgrades (like the transition to Ethereum 2.0), the deflationary mechanism of EIP-1559, and overall positive sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market, have all played a role in the recent ETH recovers trend. Is $4,600 a new all-time high for ETH? No, while $4,600 is a significant level, Ethereum’s all-time high has been above this mark. Reaching $4,600 again demonstrates strong recovery and the potential to retest previous highs. What are the future prospects for Ethereum? Ethereum’s future prospects remain strong due to its dominant position in DeFi and NFTs, continuous scalability improvements, and increasing institutional adoption. However, market volatility and competition are ongoing challenges. Is it a good time to invest in ETH now that it has recovered? Investment decisions should always be based on thorough personal research and risk assessment. While the recovery is positive, the crypto market remains volatile.

The most popular platform for building decentralized applications is Ethereum. This is because of its smart contract architecture. However, as the industry moves on, Ethereum’s greatest threat may not be other Layer-1 blockchains but Layer-2 solutions. New networks, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, have emerged to lower transaction costs and increase throughput. They now handle a large chunk of the network’s activity. In addition to this, they also offer up their own tokens and ecosystem. The growth of the crypto sector, it creates new possibilities for investors. Many crypto analysts are asking questions such as whether Ethereum can retain dominance in a scalability-oriented and user-friendly market. In addition, analysts are also questioning whether MAGACOIN FINANCE presale token can capture any investment attention with new presale tokens. The rise of Layer 2 ecosystems In the last 2 years, Layer-2 adoption has risen immensely. A marked increase in daily active users and total value locked (TVL) on networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism, with Ethereum mainnet functioning more as a settlement layer than an execution environment. This shift demonstrates the power of Ethereum. Its level of security and decentralization makes it unmatched in the market. However, the transition raises questions regarding value capture. If most of the actions mostly happen in Layer 2s, will the choice of asset itself remain ETH, or will value shift into Layer 2s? At least for now, Ethereum is likely to maintain its position on account of certain upgrades including danksharding and more work on rollup scaling. Yet competition from its own ecosystem shows investors have to pay attention to changing behaviour. The presale commanding attention As the crypto market eyes its next growth cycle, Ethereum continues to anchor long-term strategies, while meme coins like PEPE show signs of renewed hype. But it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing the spotlight, with analysts projecting up to 72x upside in 2025 and short-term gains of 100% to 140% if current momentum holds. Presale rounds have already sold out rapidly, confirming intense retail demand, while whale-backed inflows add another layer of confidence. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from typical meme-driven projects is its emphasis on transparency, backed by independent audits, combined with cultural branding that resonates with communities beyond crypto’s core. This rare blend of legitimacy and hype is why analysts increasingly list MAGACOIN FINANCE among the strongest breakout candidates of the next cycle. Meme coins regain momentum As the crypto market looks towards its next growth cycle, long-term strategies often focus on Ethereum, but meme coins like PEPE are showing renewed signs of hype. According to analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE can surge as much as 72x in 2025 and deliver short-term gains of 100% to 140% from current levels if the run continues. The presale rounds are sold out in no time, indicating a strong retail demand, while inflow backed by whales is another confirmation. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not like your typical meme project. It focuses on transparency through independent audits and cultural branding that extends beyond crypto’s core. The combination of legitimacy and hype makes it a frequent occurrence for analysts to list MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the strongest breakout candidates. Positioning ahead of the breakout Investors creating portfolios for 2025 must not choose between Ethereum, meme coins, or presales, but rather balance across all. Ethereum remains the backbone of the market, offering stability and a promise for the long term. Moreover, it remains crucial for DeFi, NFTs, and institutional uptake. PEPE has the energy, often retail driven, that ignites altseason. MAGACOIN FINANCE is giving investors the speculative edge to earn a huge early upside that may rival some of the biggest gains in crypto. They combine their efforts to devise a strategy to ride out the next wave. Conclusion: three forces shaping the next cycle Although Ethereum scaling networks will challenge its dominance in the future, no network has its level of security and developer support. Coins like PEPE show that culture and speculation are woven into crypto’s DNA and act as the fuel for altcoin rallies. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a presale gem with predictions for a 34× ROI and a 140% near-term price upswing — a key differentiator from other presales, alongside token legitimacy. A potential increase in value or price is predicted by a breakout. For those investors planning for the next breakout wave, in cycle, infrastructure, culture and early-stage opportunity are the three key forces at work.

The world of decentralized finance is buzzing with exciting news: prediction market leader Polymarket is making headlines with a monumental new funding round. This development signals a significant leap forward for the platform, which is now reportedly valued at an astounding three times its previous assessment. This substantial Polymarket funding is set to reshape the landscape of online forecasting and market prediction. What’s Driving This Remarkable Polymarket Funding Boost? According to a report from Business Insider, Polymarket is currently conducting a new funding round that has propelled its valuation to an incredible level. A term sheet from at least one investor has reportedly valued the company at a staggering $10 billion. This figure underscores immense confidence in Polymarket’s model and future potential. This triple valuation is not just a number; it reflects the growing mainstream acceptance and understanding of prediction markets. Investors are clearly seeing the long-term value in a platform that allows users to bet on real-world events, from political outcomes to crypto prices, providing unique insights and entertainment. Polymarket’s Strategic Expansion: Why the U.S. Market Matters The timing of this significant Polymarket funding effort is no coincidence. It arrives amid considerable anticipation surrounding the company’s planned expansion into the lucrative U.S. market. For a long time, regulatory complexities have posed challenges for prediction markets operating within the United States. However, Polymarket has strategically navigated these waters. The company’s acquisition of QCX in early September was a pivotal move. This acquisition effectively enabled Polymarket to operate legally within the United States, opening up a vast new user base and potential for growth. The U.S. market represents a critical frontier for any global tech company, and Polymarket’s entry is a game-changer. The implications of this expansion are far-reaching: Increased User Base: Tapping into the U.S. market means access to millions of potential new users interested in forecasting. Enhanced Regulatory Clarity: Operating legally within the U.S. provides a more stable and predictable environment for the platform. Broader Market Influence: A strong U.S. presence solidifies Polymarket’s position as a dominant player in the global prediction market space. Unpacking Prediction Markets: A Glimpse into the Future of Forecasting For those new to the concept, prediction markets are platforms where users can wager on the outcomes of future events. Unlike traditional betting, they are often seen as tools for aggregating information and providing real-time probabilities based on collective wisdom. Users buy and sell shares in the outcome of an event, with prices reflecting the market’s perceived likelihood. Polymarket, in particular, leverages blockchain technology to create transparent, censorship-resistant, and efficient markets. This innovative approach has attracted a dedicated user base and, crucially, significant investor interest, leading to this impressive Polymarket funding round. These markets can often provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polling or expert opinions, especially for niche events. The Road Ahead: Opportunities and Challenges After This Polymarket Funding With this substantial capital injection from the latest Polymarket funding round, the company is poised for accelerated growth and innovation. The opportunities are vast, including: Product Development: Expect new features, improved user experience, and potentially more diverse market offerings. User Acquisition: Aggressive marketing and outreach campaigns are likely to attract even more participants globally. Technological Advancement: Further investment in blockchain infrastructure and scalability will enhance platform performance. However, challenges remain. The regulatory landscape for prediction markets, especially those involving cryptocurrencies, is constantly evolving. Polymarket will need to continuously adapt and ensure compliance across various jurisdictions. Competition from other decentralized and centralized platforms also means constant innovation is key to maintaining its leading position. In conclusion, the news of Polymarket’s tripled valuation and significant Polymarket funding marks a pivotal moment for the prediction market industry. Its strategic expansion into the U.S. market, fueled by this new capital, positions Polymarket as a formidable force in the future of forecasting. As the platform grows, it will be exciting to watch how it shapes public discourse and provides unique insights into the probabilities of tomorrow’s events.

This is on the back of days of consolidating around $2.8. Although price action in the past 24 hours has seen XRP trading back above $3, it is yet to confirm a close to solidify the zone. Against this backdrop, technical analysis of the XRP 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows a critical level that could determine whether XRP finally breaks free into price discovery. Resistance Keeping XRP From Price Discovery Although the XRP price is currently inching slowly upwards, technical analysis shows it is yet to break above a technical resistance keeping it from price recovery. According to a technical analysis of the XRP 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart that was posted on the social media platform X by CoinsKid, XRP’s movement in August was capped by a resistance line at $3.3774. This resistance is represented with the white trendline in the price chart below. Related Reading: XRP Price Confirms Descending Trendline Breakout, Here Are The Targets The importance of this line goes beyond short-term price action. As it stands, this resistance barrier has effectively become the gatekeeper between XRP’s current price action and the possibility of a major breakout for price discovery into new all-time highs. According to the analyst, clearing this line would mark the point at which XRP could enter price discovery, a stage where there are no previous highs to serve as reference points. Until that happens, XRP is expected to continue oscillating within its established range, with $2.7346 acting as the lower white support line on the chart. Possible Shakeout Before The Break Although XRP has managed to hold above notable price points around $2.8 during its most recent corrections, there’s always the possibility of a strong downside move. CoinsKid also noted that a final shakeout could take place before any bullish breakout occurs. Related Reading: Is The US Planning To Use XRP To Clear Trillion-Dollar Debt? New Developments Shock Community This shakeout could see the sellers gain temporary momentum and cause the XRP price to break below $2.8 and crash to lower price levels. In this case, the analyst pointed to the orange support trendline at $2.3375 as a possible level that XRP might retest in such a shakeout. CoinsKid linked this possibility to September, earning the reputation of being rektember during bull cycles. However, this September might be different, considering the current dynamics of the crypto market. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.06, up by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The analyst noted that XRP’s macro structure will be bullish as long as it holds above the green line at $1.9061. This long-term support has so far underpinned the rally that began in late June. XRP is already up by about 10% from its September open, but it could possibly perform better in the later part of the month. The probability of a Fed rate cut in September is now above 97%, and this could play into a bullish run for XRP and many other large market-cap cryptocurrencies.

However, analysts warn that this rotation may be reaching a temporary cooling point, even as the broader crypto market cap pushes above $4 trillion. Ethereum Leads, Altcoins Challenge Bitcoin’s Grip Market technician Daan Crypto Trades said on X that an alt season is in progress , defining it by a sustained period where alternative cryptocurrencies outpace BTC. “If we define it by alts outperforming BTC over a period of 3+ months? Then yes,” the analyst stated. According to him, 78% of the top 50 altcoins have exceeded Bitcoin’s returns across the last three months. This shift is primarily driven by Ethereum, whose nearly 100% climb in that time has stood out while BTC largely traded sideways. The total crypto market valuation has reflected this strength, climbing back to $4.1 trillion as of September 12, with altcoin valuations near their 2021 highs at $1.7 trillion. However, Daan noted that this run has so far been concentrated in major, large-cap assets and has not yet spread broadly to mid and small-cap tokens, a dynamic that differs from previous cycle manias. Still, he believes that if the rally is sustained long enough, it will trickle to the smaller assets but not to the level seen previously in 2017 and 2021. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading at just under $115,000, after the latest U.S. CPI data gave it a leg up . However, the more dramatic moves came from assets like Avalanche (AVAX), which jumped almost 17% in a week, and Solana (SOL), which advanced 8% while drawing attention to its growing network liquidity. Outlook Hinges on Fed Policy and Market Momentum Even though optimism is running high, some analysts have cautioned that the next major moves depend on macroeconomic factors. For that reason, traders are watching the U.S. Federal Reserve’s September 17 rate decision, with easing inflation raising expectations for possible cuts. A dovish pivot could extend risk-taking into altcoins, while a hawkish tone might stall the rally. Still, market sentiment remains split. Daan Crypto Trades noted the altcoin market cap is “knocking on the door of the 2021 all-time high” and suggested a breakout could attract new participants. Another analyst, Miles Deutscher, also highlighted that TOTAL3, the altcoin index excluding BTC and ETH, is “on the verge of a major weekly breakout.” Still, their counterpart Axel Adler Jr. warned that thin liquidity could leave prices vulnerable to abrupt corrections even with a steady upward drift. For now, Ethereum’s strength and the rotation into high-cap altcoins point to a maturing cycle, where selective plays matter more than blind bets. As Daan put it, “Picking the outperformers will still matter. Not every sector and every coin will go up.” Whether this trend spills over into mid- and small-cap tokens will likely determine how far the alt season can run.

In a widely shared post, BarriC forecast that XRP will first surge to the $10–$20 range, climb to $100, and ultimately advance toward an eye-popping $1,000. While such projections are ambitious, they highlight growing confidence in XRP’s fundamentals and the evolving market environment that supports them. Current Market Landscape As of report time, XRP trades slightly above the $3.00 mark, far from the lofty milestones BarriC envisions. Market data show steady price consolidation after a period of strong gains earlier in the year. Supporters believe this stability could set the stage for longer-term appreciation, though reaching triple- or quadruple-digit prices would require extraordinary catalysts. $XRP to $10-$20 is just the beginning #XRP to $100 is the next step $XRP to $1,000 is where it’s heading — BarriC (@B_arri_C) September 12, 2025 Drivers Behind the Bullish Thesis Institutional Integration: Ripple continues to strengthen ties with global financial institutions. High-profile collaborations with major European banks underscore XRP’s potential as a bridge asset for cross-border settlements, expanding real-world use cases that could bolster demand. Product Expansion and Stablecoin Launch: Ripple’s December 2024 rollout of the RLUSD stablecoin has added a critical liquidity channel. Analysts note that RLUSD adoption across Ripple’s payment network may boost XRP utility, creating conditions that could sustain higher valuations over time. Regulatory Clarity : Perhaps most significant is the definitive resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Both parties have withdrawn their appeals, officially closing the case . With the litigation fully concluded, XRP now enjoys the regulatory certainty that investors and institutions have long sought, removing a major overhang on market sentiment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Path to $1,000: What It Would Take Moving from $10 to $100 and ultimately to $1,000 would require more than market enthusiasm. Analysts emphasize the necessity of persistent global XRP adoption for transactions and liquidity provision, widespread infrastructure linking traditional and digital currencies, and a conducive macroeconomic environment. Ongoing integration of Ripple’s technology across major banking networks and steady growth in tokenized payments would be essential. Such a transformation would likely unfold over several years. Risks and Market Realities Despite Ripple’s legal clarity, challenges remain. Global monetary policy shifts, potential competition from other blockchain solutions, and general crypto-market volatility could still affect XRP’s trajectory. Price movements will continue to depend on broader investor sentiment and the pace of institutional adoption. Outlook BarriC’s bold prediction—that XRP will first reach $10, then $100, and eventually $1,000 —underscores the confidence some market participants place in Ripple’s long-term vision. With the SEC case now settled and institutional interest growing, the fundamentals are stronger than ever. Whether those ambitious price levels become reality will depend on continued technological progress, global financial integration, and market demand in the years ahead.

Not long ago, things looked rough. The foundation’s founder got dragged into insider trading rumors, ADA tanked to a 5-month low, and Cardano price prediction pointed even lower. It felt like everyone was ready to give up on ADA . At that time, ADA was hit with heavy whale sell pressure, with about 150M tokens dumped in just a week. Now, things are turning as the derivatives market data points to rising interest in Cardano. Big wallets, the whales themselves, are starting to stack again and extending their buying streak. Large Cardano Whales Keep Accumulating Santiment data shows Cardano whales holding over 10M ADA are still stacking. Their bags climbed to 18.79B tokens, up from 18.63B last week, about 1% more. That consistent accumulation shows confidence from big players who seem content to wait for a recovery. Source: Santiment Open interest is heating up too, going toward the all-time high of 1.87B. CoinGlass data has it at 1.83B now, up from 1.65B just a week ago. That surge lines up with ADA’s recent show of strength, plus more than 16 whale moves over $1M each in the past month. All signs point to large holders doubling down instead of backing off. Cardano Price Prediction: Falling Wedge Breakout, Solana-Style Breakout Source: ADAUSD / TradingView ADA price is breaking out of a clean falling wedge, which is a bullish reversal setup. The price has already touched above the downtrend line, but it’s sitting a bit under the $1 zone marked in blue, which is the primary resistance to clear. If buyers can hold above the wedge, momentum could carry ADA toward that $1.05–$1.15. On the other hand, if the whales can’t sustain it, the price might retest the wedge’s upper boundary or even dip back to supports around 0.76 and 0.68 before another attempt. The RSI sitting mid-range and MACD still neutral means the breakout hasn’t gained full strength yet, but the structure favors upside as long as the wedge breakout holds. Best Wallet (BEST): The Utility Token Turning Presale Hype Into Next Gen Real Adoption Cardano’s setup shows how fast sentiment can flip in crypto. A project can be down bad one month and stacking bullish catalysts the next. That shift usually comes when the product, team, and community deliver instead of just hyping. That’s why eyes are now turning toward Best Wallet . It’s not just another presale token; it’s already closing in on $16M raised and backing it up with a working product. Unlike the clunky wallets left over from 2021, Best Wallet’s built-in DEX, crypto debit card, and early access to ICOs give it real-world utility right out the gate. The BEST token also packs utility: reduced fees, premium perks, and a crazy 84 % staking reward live right now. With the app already live on both Google Play and the App Store, adoption is way ahead of most presale projects. Analysts are even calling it a legit 100x candidate once it hits the open market. You can jump in directly through the app—pay with card or swap ETH/USDT—making it one of the simplest onramps to a presale with this much upside.

Figure streamlines HELOC origination, closing loans in as little as five days using automated, blockchain-based processes. The company earns revenue from loan origination, servicing, tokenization, and its Figure Exchange, which enables digital asset trading and collateralized lending. It also recently introduced a stablecoin called YLDS, though its size is dwarfed by players like Tether and USDC. The company is growing revenue at a >20% y/y clip and estimates its market opportunity at $180 billion. It is already profitable on a GAAP and adjusted EBITDA basis. For years, blockchain enthusiasts have been advocating for the far-reaching potential of blockchain technology. But what has gotten the sharpest gains and the most attention in the public markets has been the more speculative side of crypto trading. Figure Technology's ( FIGR ) IPO may represent a step down a different path. The company deploys blockchain technology to originate and service loans at a lower cost, most typically home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). The stock has shot up ~40% from its IPO price of $25, giving the company a market cap of about ~$7 billion. I'm initiating Figure Technology at a buy rating. In my view, this is an excellent way for investors to gain exposure to a fantastic blockchain company deploying smart contracts, and one that is already profitable. Fast, lower-cost HELOCs and a digital asset trading marketplace Let's first get a solid grounding on what exactly Figure Technology does and how it earns revenue. The company was founded in 2018 by Mike Cagney, who previously served as the co-founder and CEO of SoFi ( SOFI ), which was originally known for student loans. From its outset, Figure Technology's core principle was that the decentralized nature of the blockchain and smart contracts could help loan originators issue collateralized loans at a fraction of the cost. Figure HELOC process (Figure IPO prospectus) The chart above, taken from the company's finalized IPO prospectus, showcases the process of a potential borrower applying for a loan through the Figure platform. The company touts its ability to close loans in as quickly as five days (and a median of 10 days across the platform), versus an average of 42 days based on analog processes. The company is able to speed up these transactions by replacing human underwriting with automatic processes for valuing collateral (the borrowers' homes) and their incomes, as well as replacing the typical title verification process (which comes with third-party fees of its own) with digital lien matching instead. Importantly, the majority of loans issued through the Figure platform are done through partners, which are financial firms ranging from banks, credit unions, and other private lenders. The company then earns fee-based revenue from these partners upon loan origination and for the right to use the Figure platform to service and manage these loans. More recently, in August 2024, Figure also launched a product called the Figure Exchange. The Figure Exchange is a typical decentralized token trading platform (such as the more popular ones hosted by Coinbase ( COIN ) and Robinhood ( HOOD )), but with an important additional twist: digital assets traded on the platform can also be utilized as collateral for loans. The company describes this marketplace as a ""many-to-many"" marketplace in which lenders have pro rata exposure to all borrowers and uses a Dutch auction method to determine the market-clearing interest rate for particular contracts. Figure loan marketplace mechanics (Figure IPO prospectus) Meanwhile, Figure's smart contract technology automates securing collateral (which are digital assets held in Figure Exchange) and interest payments. The core synergy here is that Figure Exchange's typical borrowers are loan originators and loan buyers who hold tokenized HELOCs (including those originated on the Figure platform), who then wish to borrow against these assets in a low-cost and frictionless manner. Figure also sponsors a stablecoin, YLDS, which trades on Figure Exchange. YLDS pays a set interest rate of SOFR - 50 bps, backed by cash and cash equivalents, which the company likens to a money market fund. All in all, Figure carves its revenue and market opportunities into three addressable markets: Origination and distribution of loans: $80 billion revenue opportunity, representing a 4% take rate of a $2 trillion annualized market for consumer loans (inclusive of HELOCs, but extending as well to auto loans, mortgage refinancings, credit cards, and personal loans). The 4% take rate represents Figure's targeted pricing today, consisting of technology usage fees, origination fees, servicing rights, and gains on sale of loans that it holds for investment. Tokenization and trading: $80 billion revenue opportunity, representing a 0.5% take rate on $16 trillion of tokenized assets. It's important to note that tokenized assets represent real-world assets (such as a HELOC) that are digitized for ease of transfer and use as collateral. Stablecoins (YLDS): $25 billion revenue opportunity, representing a 0.5% take rate on a $5 trillion stablecoin market by 2030. Taken together, Figure addresses a long-term market opportunity of ~$185 billion in revenue. Financial overview Let's now dig into how Figure is progressing against the largesse of its estimated target market. Figure financials (Figure IPO prospectus) The chart above showcases Figure's financials through June 2025. In the first half of FY25, the company hit $190.6 million in revenue (approaching a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate, which is still less than 0.5% of its estimated market opportunity), growing at a 22% y/y pace. We note one quirk in Figure's financials: as a blockchain company that also doubles as a loan servicing company, Figure also capitalizes its servicing rights as an asset (major mortgage originators and servicing companies, such as Rocket Companies ( RKT ), refer to this as ""Mortgage Servicing Rights"" or MSRs, and are valued according to a discounted cash flow analysis of future servicing fee streams). As such, gains on servicing assets are a very choppy component of its revenue, which is down 90% y/y in the first half of FY25. To me, however, the more telling indicators of Figure's growth are the ~3.5x y/y growth in ecosystem and technology fees, which reflects Figure's growing monetization after the launch of Figure Exchange. Also, we note Figure's interest income of $32.6 million grew 65% y/y, reflecting the recent launch of YLDS. Also important to note is that Figure is already profitable, despite its rapid growth and relatively young status as a company. In the most recent (June) quarter, Figure generated $30.0 million of GAAP net income, doubling y/y, and $52.9 million of adjusted EBITDA, up 111% y/y. Figure adjusted EBITDA (Figure IPO prospectus) Figure generates a very high adjusted EBITDA margin of 47.2%. We note here, however, that we do expect Figure's margins and profitability to be jumpy as it includes valuation changes in its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), as does its revenue. The notes to Figure's financial statements confirm that this valuation is done based on a discounted cash flow analysis done by a third-party independent valuation firm on a quarterly basis. Figure significant accounting policies (Figure IPO prospectus - notes to the financial statements) Changes in estimates ranging from early loan prepayment rates, default rates, and discount rates/interest rates are all inputs that can swing this valuation (and thus, Figure's adjusted EBITDA). Valuation and key takeaways As shown in the offering statement below, there are 208.5 million shares of Figure outstanding after the IPO. Note that the Class A shares offered in the IPO only have one vote per share, whereas the ~38 million Class B shares controlled by insiders have supervoting 10:1 rights, which is standard in technology IPOs. Figure capitalization (Figure IPO prospectus) At current share prices near $35, Figure trades at a market cap of $7.30 billion. Netting off the $545.4 million of expected IPO proceeds plus $865.0 million of cash, restricted cash, digital assets, and loans held for sale against $452.1 million of debt on Figure's latest balance sheet gives us an enterprise value of $6.34 billion. We acknowledge that valuing an early-stage company in the absence of an outlook is quite challenging. Over the trailing twelve months, Figure has generated $375.5 million in revenue. If we assume a 22% y/y growth pace on that revenue stream (in line with the company's growth in the first half of FY25), revenue for the 12-month period ending in June 2026 would be $458.1 million. If we apply a 41.5% adjusted EBITDA margin on that revenue profile (flat to H1'25 actual margins), adjusted EBITDA would be $190.1 million. This positions Figure's valuation multiples at: 13.8x EV/FTM revenue 33.4x EV/FTM adjusted EBITDA We note that a ~30x adjusted EBITDA multiple is actually quite reasonable for a company with 40%+ margins that is currently growing revenue at 20%+ and more than doubling adjusted EBITDA on a y/y basis; though we do note, as previously cautioned, that servicing asset valuation changes could make Figure's adjusted EBITDA margins very choppy. Risks and key takeaways Of course, there are a number of risks surrounding Figure, and the core risks at the top of my mind are: Complex business and valuation. Figure has multiple revenue streams (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), and its profitability hinges on valuation estimates for its mortgage servicing rights, which could cause very lumpy metrics. Huge competition for stablecoins. YLDS is a relative bit player in the hugely growing stablecoin arena, with a market cap (at the time of writing) of only ~$20 million. The top stablecoins are USDT ($170 billion) and USDC ($72 billion), dwarfing YLDS. Credit risks and credit quality. Figure holds some loans on its balance sheet, though it does aim to securitize and sell these assets at a gain. If the company's underwriting turns out to be poor, however, it presents not only risk to Figure's own balance sheet but could damage inflow and demand for new partners to originate via the Figure platform. That being said, I view Figure as a very attractive early-stage investment opportunity, given the company's assessed ~$180 billion market opportunity and the promising benefits of using blockchain smart contracts to dramatically lower the cost of consumer loans. I also like the fact that the company, despite its early stage, has multiple revenue streams that contribute to positive GAAP and adjusted EBITDA profits. This is an early-stage IPO I am comfortable betting on for the long haul.",FIGR,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-12 18:14:45

However, the reality is that its potential for explosive, life-changing gains is limited by its large market cap. That’s why smart investors are now diversifying, adding a new project to their portfolios that they believe is a top altcoin for 2025: Ruvi AI (RUVI). This move is gaining momentum, particularly as institutional backing begins to flow into the project, signaling massive growth potential. This isn’t just speculation; the market is validating Ruvi AI’s potential with overwhelming force. The project’s presale is surging, rapidly closing in on the $3.6 million fundraising mark. A powerful global community of over 3,500 investors has already purchased more than 265 million tokens . This level of demand, driven by genuine utility and significant institutional interest, is a clear indicator that Ruvi AI is set for a breakout year. The Smart Money Play: From Saturated to High-Growth The logic behind this portfolio diversification is simple. While Ripple could provide steady growth, it is unlikely to generate the 100x returns that create millionaires. For that, investors need to target high-potential projects at an early stage. Ruvi AI fits this profile perfectly. It operates in the explosive AI sector and is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor entry point. The recent influx of institutional backing further confirms that “smart money” sees Ruvi AI as a project with the fundamentals for a massive rally. This potential is built on a foundation of trust and security. Ruvi AI has successfully completed a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a reputable third-party security firm, assuring investors of the platform’s integrity. This crucial validation, combined with a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , has established Ruvi AI as a legitimate, high-growth project attracting serious capital. A Super App Fueling Unprecedented Growth The engine driving this forecast is Ruvi AI’s revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is designed to empower content creators in the booming $104 billion creator economy . By offering a powerful suite of AI-driven tools that solve real-world problems, Ruvi AI is creating a foundation for mass adoption and sustained demand for its token. Key features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Last Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at the highly attractive price of $0.020 . However, with demand reaching a fever pitch, this window of opportunity is closing fast. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain before the next leg up. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s path to becoming a top altcoin for 2025 is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, setting the stage for rapid price discovery. For investors looking to maximize returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. The Strategic Choice for 2025 While Ripple remains a solid asset, smart investors understand the need for high-growth opportunities. With its powerful utility, institutional backing, and explosive presale, Ruvi AI is emerging as the top choice for those looking to secure life-changing returns in the coming year.

With filings for XRP Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) already on the table, one crypto analyst stresses that approval is inevitable. Once that milestone is reached, it could trigger a major break in the XRP price, paving the way for a long-anticipated bull rally. ETF Approval To Mark Turning Point For XRP According to crypto market expert Mason Versluis, the long-awaited approval of Spot ETFs tied to XRP is no longer a question of if, but when. Versluis emphasized in a video on X social media that the filing processes are already in motion, and approval appears undeniable regardless of whether it happens in 2025, 2026, or even 2027. He argued that the green light given to Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs in 2024 sets a clear precedent for the launch of an XRP ETF . Notably, the broader crypto market has already witnessed transformative changes with the arrival of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year, which opened the doors for institutional capital inflow and heightened mainstream recognition. Even lesser-known assets like Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) have spot ETF applications in the pipeline. For XRP, Versluis forecasts that approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would boost liquidity and legitimacy and spark a potential price rally as institutional demand increases. A key element highlighted in the analyst’s video report is the transparency that spot ETFs introduce. Versluis explained that, unlike futures products, ETFs require issuers to hold the underlying asset directly, meaning their wallet addresses will be visible on-chain. He highlights that this opens a new dimension of market analysis where investors can monitor institutional activity in real time, tracking when large entities buy or sell XRP. Most importantly, the ripple effect of an ETF approval is expected to extend beyond price speculation. Versluis noted that institutional involvement could introduce bullish and bearish pressure , foster greater market maturity, and carry risks such as heightened volatility and manipulation . Analyst Says XRP Bull Rally Has Resumed The technical picture for the XRP price has also taken a bullish turn. Crypto analyst CW declared on X that XRP has broken out of its previous consolidation phase , where price action was stuck in a narrow convergence. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To FOMO In, Wait For This To Happen First According to him, this breakout signals that XRP’s bull rally has officially resumed, with traders forming a new trend pattern pointing toward renewed momentum. Based on this bullish setup, CW’s chart suggests that XRP could soon see an explosive surge above $4.4, marking a new all-time high . At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.06, representing an almost 9% increase in the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency’s recovery from its previous downturn has also propelled it back into the world’s top 100 assets by market capitalization, securing the 98th spot with a valuation exceeding $182 billion.",XRP|bitcoin ETFs|Coinmarketcap|CW|Ethereum ETFs|HBAR|Hedera Hashgraph|Mason Versluis|ripple|Securities and Exchange Commission|US SEC|XRP ETF|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|HBAR,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 19:00:11

His analysis focuses on a powerful technical pattern now pointing toward an ambitious upside target of $8.00 , with the current XRP price at $3.03. Chart Figures and Breakout Pattern The chart Steph shared, drawn from TradingView’s Bybit XRP/USDT pair, captures a clear symmetrical triangle formation. Over the past year, XRP has climbed from below $1.00 to consolidate between roughly $2.50 and $3.50. The triangle’s breakout now projects a decisive continuation, with visible resistance levels plotted around $4.50, $6.00, and an upper objective near $8.00. Starting from a confirmed price of $3.03, these targets imply substantial upside: a 48% increase to reach $4.50, a 98% gain to hit $6.00, and a 164% rise to touch $8.00 mark. Each level aligns directly with the figures on Steph’s chart, underscoring the technical precision behind his projection. #XRP will create many new millionaires in the next few weeks! pic.twitter.com/YHXgEpLnHT — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 12, 2025 Momentum Drivers Market behavior has strengthened the bullish case. Exchange data show XRP holding firmly above the key $3.00 level, with rising volume confirming renewed interest. Traders tracking the pattern point to sustained buying pressure and a steadily increasing order book, conditions that often precede the kind of sustained move Steph envisions. Maintaining support above $3.00 is now critical . If buyers defend this zone, the breakout structure remains intact, leaving room for a sequential climb through $4.50 and $6.00 before testing the $8.00 threshold. Investor Outlook Steph Is Crypto’s call hinges on this visible chart setup, and for investors already holding XRP, the potential is clear. A move from $3.03 to $8.00 would more than double capital and could indeed create new millionaires among those with significant early positions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risk management through position sizing, staged profit-taking, and protective stops remains essential even in the face of such compelling technical signals. Bottom Line The case Steph presents is grounded in data, not hype. His shared chart shows a textbook breakout with precise upside levels: $4.50, $6.00, and $8.00. With XRP trading at $3.03, these targets represent exceptional percentage gains that, if achieved, could dramatically increase the wealth of committed holders. While markets can be unpredictable, the breakout pattern now in play supports Steph’s prediction that XRP could indeed “create many new millionaires in the next few weeks,” provided momentum continues and traders approach the opportunity with disciplined strategies.

The wealthy Chinese are now finding their way back to rival wealth hubs like Hong Kong and Japan. The inflow of Chinese wealthy families started after 2019, when a wave of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong led to a clampdown by Beijing and the introduction of a national security law the next year. The political stability, a favorable family-office regime, independent courts, and Mandarin fluency made Singapore a natural draw for China’s super-rich. However, in the wake of a $2.3 billion money-laundering scandal in 2023 dubbed the “Fujian case”, Singapore’s regulators and banks began an aggressive clean-up. They tightened the rules and re-screened wealthy clients. According to Ryan Lin, a director at Bayfront Law in Singapore, “ When the Fujian news broke, a lot of these wealthy Chinese left. So literally, almost all … they go to Hong Kong, the Middle East, Japan.” That departure has accelerated since then. Applications from mainland clients slashed 50% Ryan Lin, who evaluates and handles applications from rich Chinese people who want to set up family offices or live in Singapore, is getting 50% fewer applications from mainland clients now than in 2022. More push is from the new rules and compliance checks that are going into effect. Applicants for permanent residence and family offices must undergo extensive background checks. This includes disclosures about their family and dependents, as well as requirements they see as invasive. Carman Chan, founder of Click Ventures, a single-family office, similarly said that many of her family office peers who set up businesses in Singapore are relocating back to Hong Kong. Chan said that some KYC certifications took more than a year, which made some investors move their businesses to other places. In Dubai’s International Financial Centre, it takes about two to six months. According to the consulting firm Acclime, getting a residency or work visa for family office professionals in Hong Kong is usually easier than in Singapore. Henley & Partners, a company that helps rich people get residence in Singapore through investments, says that in 2025, Singapore will see a sharp drop in the number of affluent people moving there. They estimate only 1,600 millionaires will move there, which is less than half of the 3,500 that were expected to go there in 2024. Crypto companies leave Singapore due to the MAS The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) pushes to make sure everyone follows the rules. This has become effective mainly for crypto, which has made people even less interested. This year, Singapore made it a rule that platforms that sell cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or tokenized equities to customers outside of the city-state must be licensed. The central bank of Singapore said that approvals would be rare and that compliance costs would be high. For example, there is a minimum capital requirement of SG$250,000 and strong controls against money laundering, technical risk, and illicit behavior. Crypto firms offering services to customers within Singapore are already regulated under existing laws. So for this year, those who are in the crypto space particularly, they have all gone because of this particular legislation by the MAS It’s already very hard to apply for a license in Singapore, and then you come out with another legislation targeting even services to people outside Singapore. So all of them left. Ryan Lin. Banks and other financial institutions did a lot of “clean-ups,” like redoing know-your-customer (KYC) checks, re-screening family office applications, and in some cases even deleting accounts. That put a lot of rich Chinese clients in limbo, unable to get to their accounts or register new ones. Also, Iris Xu, the founder of Jenga, a corporate services firm that works with rich mainland Chinese people in Singapore, says that the aftermath of Singapore’s money-laundering scandal and high-profile crypto failures like Three Arrows Capital and FTX led to a strong push for compliance in 2024.

Gemini Success On Nasdaq Debut Based in New York, Gemini priced its IPO late Thursday above the anticipated range of $24 to $26, reflecting strong investor interest. This valuation positioned the company at approximately $3.3 billion before trading commenced.

According to its registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company reported a net loss of $159 million in 2024 and a loss of $283 million in the first half of this year. The Winklevoss brothers, who are recognized as early Bitcoin investors and the first Bitcoin billionaires, have consistently advocated for Bitcoin as a superior store of value compared to gold. In a recent interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, they expressed their belief that the price of the market’s leading cryptocurrency could reach $1 million within the next decade, saying it could easily increase tenfold from its current price. GEMI Stock Peaks At $40 The Winklevoss twins’ exchange debut on the Nasdaq follows those of Circle (CRCL), the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin by trading volume (USDC), and Bullish (BLSH), the Peter Thiel–backed exchange, which were among the first crypto firms to go public this year.

This isn’t just a number; it’s a signal that often sparks curiosity and speculation across the digital asset landscape. Understanding what this significant minting event entails is crucial for anyone keen on the crypto market’s pulse. What is USDC Stablecoin and Why Does Minting Matter? Before diving into the implications of 250 million USDC stablecoin being minted, let’s clarify what USDC is. USDC, or USD Coin, is a prominent stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This means that for every USDC in circulation, there is supposed to be one US dollar, or a dollar-equivalent asset, held in reserve. Here’s why USDC stablecoin plays a vital role: Stability: It offers a stable alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies, making it ideal for trading, lending, and payments. Liquidity: As a widely accepted stablecoin, it facilitates easy movement of funds within the crypto ecosystem. Transparency: Its reserves are regularly audited, aiming to provide confidence in its peg. The act of ‘minting’ refers to the creation of new USDC tokens. This process typically occurs when there’s an increased demand for the stablecoin, often from institutional investors or large traders looking to move funds into or within the crypto market. Unpacking the 250 Million USDC Stablecoin Mint: Immediate Implications The recent minting of 250 million USDC stablecoin by the USDC Treasury is a substantial transaction. Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker, brought this to light, indicating a significant injection of new stablecoin supply into the market. But what does this immediately suggest? Increased Demand: A large minting event usually signals robust demand for USDC. This demand can stem from various sources, including investors preparing to buy other cryptocurrencies, or institutions looking for a stable on-ramp into the digital asset space. Market Liquidity Boost: More USDC stablecoin in circulation can translate to enhanced liquidity across exchanges. This makes it easier for traders to execute large orders without significant price slippage. Potential for Crypto Purchases: Historically, large stablecoin mints have often preceded periods of increased buying activity for Bitcoin and other altcoins. While not a direct causation, it’s a trend many market watchers observe closely. It is important to remember that minting doesn’t automatically mean immediate buying pressure. However, it does equip market participants with the capital to act when opportunities arise. The Broader Impact of USDC Stablecoin on the Crypto Ecosystem Beyond the immediate effects, such a large mint of USDC stablecoin has broader implications for the entire crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins, including USDC, serve as critical bridges between traditional finance and the decentralized world. Consider these wider impacts: Institutional Interest: Large mints can sometimes be linked to institutional players entering or expanding their positions in the crypto market. These entities often prefer stablecoins for their stability and ease of compliance. DeFi Growth: USDC is a cornerstone of many Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. An increase in its supply can support growth in lending, borrowing, and other DeFi activities by providing more collateral and liquidity. Regulatory Scrutiny: As stablecoins grow in prominence, so does regulatory attention. Events like large mints highlight their systemic importance, potentially influencing future regulatory frameworks. The continuous growth of USDC stablecoin underscores its pivotal role in the ongoing maturation and mainstream adoption of digital assets. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for USDC Stablecoin? The minting of 250 million USDC stablecoin is a snapshot of current market dynamics. Looking ahead, the trajectory of USDC, and stablecoins in general, will continue to be shaped by several factors. The demand for a reliable, dollar-pegged digital asset remains strong, especially as the crypto market evolves. Market participants should keep an eye on: Reserve Transparency: Continued rigorous audits and clear reporting of USDC reserves are essential for maintaining user trust and regulatory compliance. Technological Advancements: Innovations in blockchain technology and cross-chain compatibility will further enhance USDC’s utility and reach. Global Adoption: As more businesses and individuals worldwide embrace digital payments, the role of USDC stablecoin as a global medium of exchange could expand significantly. Ultimately, the minting of 250 million USDC stablecoin is a testament to the ongoing expansion and increasing sophistication of the digital economy. It highlights the constant flow of capital and the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. This event, while specific, reflects a larger trend of stablecoins becoming indispensable tools for liquidity, stability, and growth within the crypto market. It serves as a reminder that even seemingly routine actions like minting can carry significant weight and provide valuable insights into the broader financial ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, it means new USD Coin tokens are created and added to the circulating supply. This typically occurs in response to increased demand for the USDC stablecoin, often when individuals or institutions deposit US dollars with Circle (the issuer) to receive an equivalent amount of USDC. Who minted the 250 million USDC stablecoin? The 250 million USDC stablecoin was minted at the USDC Treasury, which is managed by Circle, the primary issuer of USD Coin. This action was reported by Whale Alert, a blockchain transaction tracking service. How does USDC minting affect the crypto market? USDC minting generally indicates increased liquidity and demand within the crypto market. It can signal that investors are bringing more capital into the crypto ecosystem, potentially preparing to purchase other cryptocurrencies, thus influencing market prices and trading volumes. Is a large USDC minting event a bullish or bearish signal? A large USDC stablecoin minting event is often interpreted as a bullish signal for the broader crypto market. It suggests that significant capital is entering the space, which could lead to increased buying pressure for Bitcoin and altcoins. However, it is not a guarantee and should be considered alongside other market indicators. Where can I track USDC stablecoin minting events? You can track USDC stablecoin minting events and other large cryptocurrency transactions through blockchain analytics platforms like Whale Alert, Etherscan, or other reputable crypto data providers that monitor stablecoin movements.

That’s exactly what’s unfolding as World Liberty Financial (WLFI) reels from wallet freezes and Chainlink (LINK) partners with UBS in Hong Kong, while the Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) presale hits its icy finale with the most electrifying deal yet. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is now in Stage 40—the “Frozen Finale.” With a 400% bonus using code FINAL400, every purchase multiplies fivefold. That means more tokens, more upside, and a chance to catch a projected 8,233% ROI if analysts’ $0.1 prediction comes true. And here’s the kicker—CEX Coinstore has already confirmed APC’s listing on its X account, alongside PancakeSwap, right after the presale ends. That makes this one of the top crypto coins to buy for 2025 before it officially enters the open market. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC): Presale Finale with 400% Bonus and 8233% ROI What happens when myth collides with money? Arctic Pablo’s story isn’t just about an explorer on a snowmobile gliding across icy terrains—it’s about uncovering $APC coins that shimmer with wealth and community power. Investors now get to step inside that legend as the presale reaches its frozen climax. The Finale Stage 40 has unlocked the boldest offer yet: a 400% bonus on all purchases with code FINAL400. This means an investor dropping $2,500 at today’s presale price of $0.0012 secures 2,083,333 APC tokens. Multiply that by the 5x bonus, and it becomes 10,416,666 tokens. At the confirmed listing price of $0.008, that investment rockets to $83,333—a 3,233% ROI. Should analysts’ moon target of $0.1 play out, that same $2,500 explodes into over $1,041,666. Numbers like these explain why whales are rushing in before this best meme coin presale shuts. And this isn’t just numbers on paper. APC has raised over $4 million, burning unsold tokens weekly to keep supply tight. Add to that a deflationary model, 66% APY staking, referral bonuses, and community competitions—it’s a whole ecosystem designed to grow while rewarding early believers. With just three days left, the presale isn’t a quiet trickle—it’s a stampede. Tokenomics caps the total supply at 221.2 billion APC, and after Stage 40, unsold tokens vanish in permanent burns. This final stretch feels less like an opportunity and more like the last boarding call on a jet destined for the moon. But there’s more. Arctic Pablo Coin will not only debut on DEX (PancakeSwap) but also on CEX Coinstore, confirmed in Coinstore’s official X post. This dual listing ensures deep liquidity and visibility, a perfect storm for price momentum the moment trading begins. Among the top crypto coins to buy for 2025 , this presale isn’t just another option—it’s the headline act. Chainlink (LINK): Expanding Power with UBS and U.S. Data Feeds While meme coin presales make headlines, blue-chip infrastructure projects like Chainlink are laying down serious building blocks. LINK’s partnerships are breaking new ground—UBS and DigiFT launched a pilot in Hong Kong to tokenize funds with Chainlink’s oracles at the center. At the same time, Chainlink secured a role in bringing U.S. Department of Commerce macroeconomic data on-chain, including GDP and CPI. This expands Chainlink’s reach into prediction markets, DAOs, and DeFi projects needing real-time, verified government data. Add to that the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which has processed over $2.2 billion across 50+ chains, and Chainlink is proving it’s more infrastructure than speculation. With LINK trading near $24.45 and a circulating market cap of around $16.5 billion, it remains a cornerstone for investors hunting for reliability in top crypto coins to buy for 2025. World Liberty Financial (WLFI): Frozen Wallets, Buyback Burns, and Price Pressure WLFI’s story is more chaotic. In recent days, Justin Sun claimed his WLFI tokens were frozen without explanation, while reports suggest 272 wallets have been blacklisted. The official stance? Security reasons, like compromised wallets. But the lack of transparency has raised questions about decentralization and control. Despite the drama, the community voted overwhelmingly for a buyback-and-burn program using protocol-owned liquidity fees. That’s a deflationary step meant to stabilize value. Currently, WLFI trades around $0.20 with a market cap of roughly $5.4 billion and daily volumes near $480 million. The coin’s highs of $0.46 and recent lows around $0.18 show how volatile WLFI can be. With uncertainty around governance, WLFI is both a high-risk and high-watch asset in today’s lineup of top crypto coins to buy for 2025. Final Call: Why Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Finale Rules the Conversation Tick—tock—the last three days of Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale are running out, and with them goes the FINAL400 400% bonus. Based on research, market momentum, and confirmed listings on Coinstore and PancakeSwap, APC offers an unmatched setup. Chainlink is building critical infrastructure with real-world partnerships, and WLFI’s buyback plan might steady investor nerves—but only APC is handing investors 5x tokens today with projections soaring past 8,233% ROI. For those deciding on the top crypto coins to buy for 2025 , Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale finale is more than an investment—it’s an adventure. The question isn’t whether this opportunity is big enough. The real question is: will you grab it before it freezes over? Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now. FINAL400 is live, but not for long.

51616897,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=204106,1757704510,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/51616897.jpeg,Google AI Under Fire: Publishers Accuse Tech Giant of Content Theft,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-ai-content-theft/,"BitcoinWorld Google AI Under Fire: Publishers Accuse Tech Giant of Content Theft The digital landscape is currently witnessing an escalating conflict, particularly for those deeply entrenched in the world of digital publishing and content creation. At the heart of this dispute is Google, the undisputed titan of search, now facing severe accusations from major publishers regarding its AI practices. Neil Vogel, the CEO of People, Inc. (formerly Dotdash Meredith), a powerhouse behind over 40 renowned brands like People, Food & Wine, and Better Homes & Gardens, has publicly branded Google as a ‘bad actor.’ His charge? That Google is effectively ‘stealing’ publisher content to fuel its burgeoning AI products, creating a seismic shift in how content creators view the tech giant. The Alarming Accusation Against Google AI Neil Vogel’s bold statements, made at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, have sent ripples through the media industry. He contends that Google is not operating on a level playing field. The core of his argument revolves around Google’s unified crawling mechanism. According to Vogel, Google employs a single bot to crawl websites, serving a dual purpose: indexing content for its traditional search engine (which still directs some traffic to publishers) and simultaneously harvesting data to train its advanced AI features. This dual functionality, Vogel argues, is a profound ethical and economic dilemma for publishers. “Google has one crawler, which means they use the same crawler for their search, where they still send us traffic, as they do for their AI products, where they steal our content,” Vogel articulated. This isn’t merely a complaint; it’s an indictment of a practice that publishers fear could undermine their very existence in the long run. The implication is clear: while Google Search historically served as a vital artery for website traffic, its AI ambitions are now perceived as parasitic, extracting value without equitable compensation or clear consent. The Shrinking Lifeline: Traffic Drop and Publisher Predicaments Vogel’s concerns are rooted in tangible data. He revealed that just three years ago, Google Search accounted for a staggering 65% of People Inc.’s traffic. Today, that figure has plummeted to the “high 20s.” In a more startling revelation to AdExchanger, Vogel even stated that at one point, Google’s traffic represented as much as 90% of their open web traffic. While People Inc. has managed to adapt, growing its audience and revenue despite this significant drop, the principle remains a contentious point. “I’m not complaining. We’ve grown our audience. We’ve grown our revenue,” Vogel clarified, emphasizing that his issue isn’t with his company’s performance. “We’re doing great. What is not right about this is: you cannot take our content to compete with us.” This statement encapsulates the core of the publisher’s grievance: the perceived unfair competition where their own creations are used by a tech behemoth to build products that may eventually bypass or even replace them, without appropriate remuneration. The Battle for Leverage: Blocking AI Crawlers In response to this evolving threat, publishers are seeking new forms of leverage in the AI era. Vogel believes that strategically blocking AI crawlers – automated programs designed to scan websites for AI training – is a necessary step. This tactic aims to force AI developers into negotiating content deals, ensuring fair compensation for the intellectual property they utilize. People, Inc. has already taken proactive measures, leveraging web infrastructure company Cloudflare’s latest solution to identify and block AI crawlers that are not part of a paid agreement. This strategy has already yielded results, prompting several “large LLM providers” to approach the publisher with potential content deals. While no agreements have been finalized, Vogel confirmed that his company is “much further along” in negotiations since implementing the crawler-blocking solution. This demonstrates a potential pathway for publishers to reclaim agency over their valuable content. Here’s a look at how publishers are navigating this new terrain: Identification: Using tools like Cloudflare’s solutions to distinguish between legitimate search engine crawlers and AI training bots. Blocking: Implementing technical blocks (e.g., via robots.txt or Cloudflare’s rules) for AI crawlers that haven’t secured a licensing agreement. Negotiation: Engaging with AI companies that approach them for content licenses, aiming for equitable content deals . Advocacy: Publicly calling out practices deemed unfair and advocating for industry-wide standards for AI content usage. The Google Exception: A Critical Obstacle for Publisher Content Despite the success in negotiating with other LLM providers, Google presents a unique and formidable challenge. Vogel highlighted the critical issue: Google’s crawler cannot be blocked without simultaneously preventing the publisher’s websites from being indexed in Google Search. This would effectively cut off the remaining “20%-ish” of traffic that Google still delivers, a lifeline many publishers cannot afford to sever. “They know this, and they’re not splitting their crawler. So they are an intentional bad actor here,” Vogel asserted, emphasizing the deliberate nature of Google’s approach. This lack of a separate crawler for AI purposes puts Google in a position of immense power, leaving publishers with little recourse but to allow their content to be scraped for AI training if they wish to maintain their search visibility. Industry Voices: A Chorus of Concern Vogel’s sentiments are echoed by other prominent figures in the media industry. Janice Min, editor-in-chief and CEO at Ankler Media, agreed with the assessment, labeling big tech companies like Google and Meta as longtime “content kleptomaniacs.” Her company, too, has opted to block AI crawlers, expressing skepticism about the benefits of partnering with any AI company at this juncture. Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare (whose company provides the AI-blocking solution), offered a nuanced perspective during the same panel. While acknowledging the current challenges, Prince expressed optimism that the behavior of AI companies would eventually change, possibly driven by new regulations. He also questioned the efficacy of relying solely on existing legal frameworks, such as copyright law, which were developed in a pre-AI era. “I think that it’s a fool’s errand to go down that path, because, in copyright law, typically, the more derivative something is, the more it’s protected under fair use…What these AI companies are doing is they’re actually creating derivatives,” Prince explained. He cited Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement with book publishers as an example of companies aiming to preserve positive copyright rulings, rather than definitively losing on fair use arguments. This suggests that the legal landscape around AI and copyright is still nascent and complex, with outcomes that may not always favor content creators in the way they expect. The Future of Digital Publishing : Will Google Pay for Content? Prince didn’t shy away from broader critiques, famously proclaiming that “everything that’s wrong with the world today is, at some level, Google’s fault.” He argued that Google had inadvertently trained publishers to prioritize traffic metrics over original content creation, leading to phenomena like BuzzFeed’s clickbait strategies. However, he also acknowledged Google’s current competitive pressures. Despite his criticisms, Prince offered a hopeful prediction: “Internally, they’re having massive fights about what they do, and my prediction is that, by this time next year, Google will be paying content creators for crawling their content and taking it and putting it in AI models.” This forecast, if it materializes, would represent a monumental shift in the relationship between tech giants and content producers, potentially ushering in a new era of compensation for publisher content in the AI age. Conclusion: Navigating the AI Frontier The accusations leveled against Google by prominent figures in digital publishing highlight a critical inflection point for the internet’s content ecosystem. As Google AI and other large language models become increasingly sophisticated, the debate over fair use, content ownership, and compensation intensifies. Publishers, while adapting to changing traffic patterns and developing new revenue streams, are drawing a line in the sand regarding the uncompensated use of their intellectual property for AI training. The strategy of blocking AI crawlers is emerging as a powerful tool to force negotiations and secure much-needed content deals . While the path forward is complex, involving legal ambiguities and the immense power of tech giants, the growing collective voice of publishers, coupled with innovative technical solutions, suggests that the future relationship between AI and content creators will likely be one built on clearer agreements and, hopefully, equitable compensation.

Liquidations near $115K fueled sharp upward momentum, clearing resistance and boosting short-term bullish outlook. Short-term holders realize losses, but institutional demand suggests the broader trend remains strongly bullish. Bitcoin Tests $114K Level Again Bitcoin has recovered in the past week or so after reaching a low near $107,000 earlier this month. That zone marked the end of its measured move, and the price has since pushed back above $114,000, trading close to $115,000. Analyst Rekt Capital said , “Bitcoin is now in contention for a reclaim of the $114k (black) level back into support. Weekly Close above $114k would trigger bullish bias and resynchronisation with the $114k–$120k Range.” The $114,000 level has acted as resistance in recent weeks. Holding above it on the weekly close would open the way toward the $114,000–$120,000 range. Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin “needs to stay above ~$114k as it heads into the new Weekly Close” and should build a cluster around this level, similar to early August. Trader Ted pointed to $117,200 as the next resistance and wrote , “$117,200 is the next important level for Bitcoin and it also has a CME gap. If BTC fully reclaims this level, the doors towards the new ATH will open.” If the move fails, Bitcoin could revisit recent monthly lows. Liquidations Drive Short-Term Spike Glassnode data shows that a wave of short liquidations near $115,000 pushed the latest surge. The liquidations were triggered across exchanges between 9–10 p.m. UTC and matched signals from its Hyperliquid heatmap.

The network difficulty, which measures the computational complexity required for miners to discover new blocks on the blockchain, is on track to reach a record peak of 136.04T Market analysts now suggest that Bitcoin is positioned to overcome its 3-week-long resistance level at $117K. Record Bitcoin Hash Rate and Fed Rate Cut Could Trigger $117K Breakout An increasing hash rate shows increased computational resources being allocated to Bitcoin mining.

Source: CoinWarz With the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated rate decision scheduled for September 17 and risk-on markets anticipating a 25-basis-point reduction, investor sentiment on a Bitcoin $117k breakout now leans optimistic. This perspective aligns with miner reserves climbing to a 50-day peak of 1.808 million BTC on September 9, according to CryptoQuant data , suggesting miners are maintaining their holdings rather than liquidating. Similarly, crypto analyst Avocado Onchain identifies a fundamental shift in mining behavior and Bitcoin network resilience. Examining the Miners’ Position Index (MPI), spikes have historically emerged under two conditions, which are pre-halving periods when miners tactically reduce holdings, and late bull market phases when they sell aggressively into fresh retail capital. Source: CryptoQuant The present cycle shows a contrasting pattern, although some pre-halving distribution is obvious, as the intense late-cycle liquidations remain notably absent. This shows that ETF inflows and Bitcoin’s adoption as a strategic treasury asset by major economies may be reshaping mining strategies. They seem to be transitioning from short-term liquidation toward long-term accumulation. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs Ignite with a $553M daily inflow, pushing a four-day streak to $1.7B.

Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bulls Challenge $117k Resistance Wall Bitcoin analysts have identified $117,200 as the key resistance level for the price to overcome, which corresponds with a CME gap. Should BTC decisively reclaim this threshold, pathways toward new all-time highs above $124k would emerge. In the event of rejection, BTC could retreat to monthly lows with liquidity concentrations around the $108K-$112K range. The FOMC meeting approaches next week, with a 25-basis-point rate cut anticipated. Market direction will hinge on Powell’s commentary and the Fed’s perspective on inflation and employment metrics. If Powell emphasizes inflation concerns, BTC might decline to test the $112k liquidity zone. Liquidity Zone.

Pepe Dollar, a new crypto token presale on Ethereum’s Layer-2, has quickly gained momentum with strong early fundraising. Stage 2 has already secured $2 million, placing it firmly on multiple crypto presale lists. With a presale price far below its launch value, PEPD offers one of the clearest entry advantages among token presales. For XRP investors, it has become more than just a meme coin: analysts now call it one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. PepeDollar meme economy and presale crypto tokens Pepe Dollar ($PEPD) is setting up for a faster trajectory than many other presale crypto projects. Built on Ethereum, it aims to create an entire meme-powered economy supported by payments, staking, and token minting. This broader framework distinguishes it from meme tokens that rely solely on hype. The presale crypto tokens are currently priced at $0.006495 in Stage 2, compared to the launch price of $0.03695. This creates a built-in 6× margin for early buyers, offering one of the strongest advantages among top crypto presales. The scale of this gap is notable, even compared to projects like Brett, which did not offer such favorable entry multipliers. By combining cultural momentum with infrastructure-driven tools, Pepe Dollar has secured its place on the crypto presale list. For many, it represents a new crypto token presale that merges humor with real financial design, making it one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. Ripple explores DeFi expansion for long-term growth Ripple (XRP) is trading around $2.80 today after recent volatility. Bulls faced challenges as liquidity was absorbed and a key support zone was tested. Despite these hurdles, developers remain optimistic about Ripple’s future. Flare Networks co-founder Hugo Philion has introduced plans for FAssets and Firelight, two tools aimed at expanding DeFi capabilities for XRP. These upgrades could transform XRP into a yield-bearing, composable asset, pushing it further into top crypto projects beyond payments. If successful, Ripple could evolve from a transactional coin into a productive asset within decentralized finance. This vision underscores why XRP remains a key player even as some investors diversify into presale coins like Pepe Dollar. XRP investors rotate into Pepe Dollar presale The decision of XRP investors to move into Pepe Dollar highlights how token presales are becoming central to diversification strategies. While XRP continues to play a strong role in blockchain payments, PEPD offers the advantage of early entry with high fundraising momentum. With $2 million raised in Stage 2, Pepe Dollar is already proving itself as one of the top presale crypto projects of 2025. Its roadmap of payments, staking, and token minting has captured interest from whales and retail buyers alike. This migration reflects a broader trend of investors balancing established projects like Ripple with new crypto presales that offer faster traction. Among these, Pepe Dollar has consistently been called the best crypto presale to buy right now. Crypto market outlook The contrast between Ripple’s steady DeFi-focused growth and Pepe Dollar’s rapid presale success highlights the dual paths investors are taking in 2025. XRP provides long-term security, while PEPD delivers near-term momentum through token presales. Among crypto coins on presale, Pepe Dollar has established itself with whale support, a capped supply, and Ethereum Layer-2 integration. Its presence on several crypto presale lists reinforces its status as one of the top presale crypto projects this year. For investors scanning cryptocurrency presales, PEPD demonstrates how humor, community, and financial design can merge. This explains why Pepe Dollar is now viewed as the best crypto presale to buy right now.

The data center hardware manufacturer delivers HGX B300 systems and GB300 NVL72 racks. The SMCI stock is currently up 3.52% for the 24 hours and 49.3% YTD. It is trading at an average price of $45.31, with a day range of $44.84 – $47.00. The San Jose-based firm confirmed that it is delivering the HGX B300 systems and GB300 NVL72 racks worldwide. The systems can handle large-scale AI training, real-time reasoning, and advanced inference applications. Super Micro’s onsite deployment expertise enables turnkey solutions The data center hardware manufacturer said the systems have been integrated turnkey, meaning hardware and infrastructure software, including Nvidia AI Enterprise, Nvidia Blueprints, and Nvidia NIM, have been integrated. The company noted that the system’s plug-and-play nature allows customers to deploy immediately, reducing integration delays. SUPER MICRO $SMCI has started global volume shipments of NVIDIA $NVDA Blackwell Ultra systems, including HGX B300 and GB300 NVL72 racks. These pre-validated solutions offer up to 7.5× Hopper performance, 50% more HBM3e memory, and 1.1 exaFLOPS FP4 compute, with liquid cooling… pic.twitter.com/1GxeZlAdQQ — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) September 11, 2025 Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro Computers, acknowledged the company’s experience in deploying, adding that the data center customers face several challenges. He highlighted some of the challenges, including complex network topology and cabling, power availability, and temperature management. He confirmed that the company’s expertise in on-site deployment and building block solutions has enabled it to build turnkey products. Liang revealed that the Blackwell Ultra systems can reach up to 7.5 times compared to Nvidia’s previous generation chips. The system architecture allows for reduced power and cooling usage and cuts floor space requirements. According to the firm, operating costs may fall by up to 20% compared to the previous systems. The firm confirmed that it has also increased its stock-keeping units (SKUs) by more than ten based on Blackwell technology. Super Micro is just recovering from last month’s sharp fall in stock after posting weaker-than-expected quarterly results. The firm reported net sales of approximately $5.6 billion, representing 54% growth compared to last year. CEO Liang highlighted that the direct cooling technology may increase the firm’s revenue in the upcoming quarters, projecting $23.5 to $25 billion and $40 billion in the fiscal year 2026. The Wall Street investors await to see whether the firm can sustain the demand for AI infrastructure and how it will affect the stock’s performance. SMCI stock maintains strong performance, buoyed by Nvidia’s partnership The Super Micro stock experienced a sharp fall just two weeks ago when Cryptopolitan reported that the AI server maker had revealed weaknesses in internal controls. The annual SEC filing showed that the company acknowledged its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective due to material deficiencies, which raised concerns over the reliability and timeliness of disclosures. The news sparked a stock sell-off, which risked losing more than $1 billion in market value. The firm currently has a market cap of $27.03 billion with an average trading volume of $32.32 million. The stock has, however, maintained a strong performance this year, with a YTD of 49.3%, which has buoyed the partnership with Nvidia. According to a CNBC interview , JPMorgan increased its forecast to $39 billion in revenue for the company in fiscal year 2026, which means a 65% increase year over year. JPMorgan cited the support of Nvidia’s improved supply chain and higher average selling price as reasons. Nvidia has recorded strong performance this year, with a YTD of 32.31%. It is currently trading at $177.65. The stock price increased by 0.24% over the last 24 hours, with a day range of $176.45 – $178.60. Its average trading volume is $176.39 m, and its market cap is $4.32 trillion.

Despite the lack of clear direction, institutional appetite for ETH continues to grow, underscoring confidence in its long-term value. One of the most notable dynamics shaping Ethereum’s outlook is the shrinking supply on exchanges, as more coins move into cold storage and long-term holdings. This trend signals reduced sell pressure and reinforces the narrative of accumulation beneath the surface. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds 4% Above STH Cost Basis As Mature Bull Cycle Demands Discounts Fresh data from Arkham adds weight to this view. According to their latest report, three newly identified whale wallets collectively purchased over $200 million worth of ETH yesterday. Such large-scale inflows highlight that major investors remain active even in choppy conditions, positioning themselves ahead of what many see as the next decisive move for the market. While short-term traders grapple with swings, the underlying flows point to a growing disconnect between surface volatility and deeper structural demand. Institutions and whales continue to treat Ethereum as a core asset, betting that its utility and adoption will outlast momentary market uncertainty. As consolidation plays out, these strategic buys could prove pivotal in shaping Ethereum’s next breakout. Ethereum Accumulation Signals Institutional Strength Ethereum continues to attract significant institutional attention, even as short-term price action reflects broader market uncertainty. According to Arkham, three newly created whale addresses collectively purchased $205.48 million worth of ETH from FalconX, a move that underscores the growing role of large players in shaping Ethereum’s trajectory. Such substantial acquisitions highlight that institutional money is steadily flowing into ETH, viewing it as a core asset in the evolving digital economy. Recent price action, marked by volatility and sideways consolidation, is less about Ethereum’s fundamentals and more about the uncertainty clouding the macroeconomic environment. While traders focus on the noise of short-term swings, whales and institutions are making long-term bets on adoption and shrinking supply. Exchange balances for ETH continue to trend downward, reinforcing the idea that large investors are moving assets into cold storage with little intent to sell in the near future. Looking ahead, the market’s attention turns to next week’s US Federal Reserve meeting, where a widely expected rate cut could act as a major catalyst for risk assets. Analysts believe the decision will mark the beginning of a new phase for the market, potentially unlocking further liquidity inflows. If confirmed, Ethereum’s combination of strong fundamentals and accelerating institutional accumulation could set the stage for a renewed leg higher, solidifying its leadership in the altcoin sector.

Ethereum is trading at $4,515, marking a strong rebound and continuation of its broader bullish structure. The weekly chart highlights how ETH surged from lows near $1,600 earlier this year to test the $4,800 level, underscoring the intensity of the rally. This move also shows Ethereum outperforming most altcoins as institutional demand and shrinking exchange supply continue to support momentum. The 50-week SMA at $2,935 and the 100-week SMA at $2,876 are both turning upward, while the 200-week SMA at $2,444 remains a strong long-term support base. With price comfortably above all major moving averages, Ethereum is technically positioned in a solid uptrend. The breakout from the $3,200 resistance zone in July paved the way for the sharp leg higher, confirming strong accumulation beneath.

On the downside, immediate support lies around $4,300, with deeper backing near $3,800 if volatility picks up.

The funds were stored in an unhosted wallet allegedly controlled by Abedini or his company, SDRA. Abedini’s firm supplied navigation systems used in IRGC drones and missiles, including one used in a fatal 2024 attack. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil forfeiture action to recover $584,741 in USDT allegedly controlled by Mohammad Abedini, an Iranian national charged with supporting Iran’s drone operations. The action was announced in a press release published by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts. DOJ Files Forfeiture of USDT The seized funds were held in an unhosted cryptocurrency wallet believed to be associated with Abedini or his company, San’at Danesh Rahpooyan Aflak Co. (SDRA), which manufactures navigation systems used in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ drone and missile programs. Abedini was indicted in December 2024 for providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged a dozen people for their role in a $263 million crypto crime scheme. #DOJ #CryptoCrime https://t.co/5yBzBytkgy — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 16, 2025 According to court filings, his company sold the Sepehr Navigation System to the IRGC Aerospace Force. U.S. prosecutors allege that between 2021 and 2022, nearly all of SDRA’s sales of the system were to the IRGC. Authorities linked the system to a drone recovered from a January 2024 attack in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members and injured more than 40. The drone was identified as an Iranian Shahed UAV, and investigators allege that it used navigation technology developed by SDRA. “U.S. law authorizes the forfeiture of assets used to support or fund acts of terrorism against the United States or its citizens,” the DOJ stated. Italian authorities detained Abedini in December 2024, but he was later released. He is currently believed to be in Iran. International Enforcement in the Crypto Sector The case is being handled by prosecutors from the District of Massachusetts and the National Security Division. The forfeiture complaint and criminal charges are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Investigators are now placing increased focus on tracing funds linked to dual-use technologies in defense applications, especially when tied to actors under U.S. sanctions. Enforcement agencies have also pushed for closer coordination with international counterparts to monitor digital asset transfers involving sensitive exports. U.S. prosecutors have stated they will continue pursuing forfeiture and criminal actions where digital assets are linked to security threats, even when suspects are beyond physical reach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How do U.S. prosecutors trace stablecoin transactions from unhosted wallets? Although unhosted wallets lack a central intermediary, blockchain analysis firms and forensic tools allow investigators to link wallets to known actors or flagged transactions, particularly when exchanges are involved at entry or exit points. Could digital asset seizures be used to deter overseas suppliers of military technology? Yes. Freezing or seizing funds related to defense-linked exports can limit financial operations and serve as a method of pressure, especially in the absence of extradition.

The forecast comes after Moscow took a series of steps in the past months to organize and regulate this segment of its digital economy, still strictly reserved for institutions and rich Russians. Regulation opens door for institutional players Russia has been gradually warming towards crypto since last year, with laws and rules recognizing certain activities related to digital assets. The adoption of basic regulation in 2024, when the Russian government legalized cryptocurrency mining, opened up new horizons for the industry, the daily Izvestia noted in an article. Then, this past spring, the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) permitted investments in crypto derivatives based on the value of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Financial institutions and large production holdings started entering the market after regulators tightened control, the owner and CEO of GIS Mining, Vasily Girya, told the Russian newspaper. This creates a significant incentive for the development of innovations in the Russian digital economy, he elaborated, speaking at the Capital Markets forum. The markets for fiat and cryptocurrency instruments will continue their integration, the entrepreneur noted, reminding that qualified investors have gained access to crypto-based investment products. Girya’s company is a significant hardware operator in Russia’s growing crypto mining sector, alongside leaders like BitRiver and Intelion. According to GIS Mining’s estimates, the size of the Russian crypto market, including mined cryptocurrency, employed computing power, mutual funds , digital financial assets (DFAs), and perpetual DFAs , may exceed 2 trillion rubles in 2026 (nearly $24 billion). Vasily Girya further commented: “The growth of interest among large banks and investment companies continues to gain momentum. If we have a moderately positive scenario for the industry’s development, the price of Bitcoin may reach $130,000 – $135,000 by the end of 2025.” Role of crypto grows for Russia amid global instability Russian authorities, which used to be quite hostile regarding crypto, have been changing their attitude lately, largely as a result of crippling Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, which severely limited Russia’s access to traditional financial channels. The recently proposed special “experimental legal regime” gives Russian companies the option to use cryptocurrencies in cross-border payments and allows “ highly qualified ” investors to buy and sell coins and put money into crypto derivatives. Girya pointed out that in the context of geopolitical instability, cryptocurrency is becoming an important hedging tool and serves as a gateway to international financial markets and settlements. The Bank of Russia is now discussing with the government ways to expand the use of crypto assets by introducing a similar regime for digital innovations in the financial market. And the Ministry of Finance recently suggested widening investor access to crypto products. Russia’s monetary authority is also drafting separate rules for financial institutions that want to invest in crypto directly, taking into account specific risks. Vasily Girya believes the new regulations for large participants will help balance the market’s development. The founder of GIS Mining also highlighted that Russian citizens are “actively mastering new technologies, including blockchain,” while Russian companies are developing solutions that will make the country’s economy more competitive.

Meanwhile, Tokyo-listed gaming company Gumi approved a strategic $17 million XRP acquisition, planning to purchase 6 million tokens through February 2026. Technical analysis reveals XRP testing key resistance at $3.00 after breaking from long-term descending wedge patterns, with multiple projections targeting $3.30-$3.70 range. Historic ETF Approval Signals Regulatory Acceptance The REX-Osprey Spot XRP ETF cleared the SEC’s review process, becoming the first regulated fund offering direct XRP exposure to U.S. investors.

The ETF structure eliminates custody concerns while meeting regulatory compliance requirements that previously prevented institutional adoption. Franklin Templeton’s competing XRP ETF application faces an extended review until November 14 . The SEC postponed its original September 15 deadline, requesting additional time to evaluate the proposal. Multiple other ETF applications remain under review, including proposals from BlackRock and Fidelity. The industry anticipates additional decisions before the end of the year. Gumi’s board approved a strategic 2.5 billion yen ($17 million) XRP purchase, targeting 6 million tokens through phased acquisition between September 2025 and February 2026.

Immediate challenges involve achieving decisive breaks above $3.05-$3.10 resistance with sufficient volume validation. Success triggers momentum-based buying toward projected $3.30-$3.60 targets, while failure could retest $2.70-$2.80 support zones. The institutional adoption catalysts provide fundamental support for bullish scenarios, though timing and magnitude may require measured expectations rather than explosive short-term moves. Gradual advancement through resistance levels appears more probable than violent upside acceleration. Is Maxi Doge the Next 1000x Gym-Bro Meme Everyone’s Trading? While XRP targets new highs through institutional adoption, this muscular meme coin is flexing strong presale performance, especially with DOGE ETF on the way. Smart traders know that finding the right meme coin early can lead to massive gains during bull seasons. Maxi Doge is getting attention because it combines gym culture with max leverage trading themes. The project has raised over $2 million in presale with competitive 157% staking rewards. The presale started at $0.00025 per token with plans for Uniswap listing after completion. Early buyers can earn passive income while waiting for exchange debuts. Knowing this might be a very rare opportunity, as the best meme coins get adopted fast once the crypto community discovers them. Maxi Doge targets major exchange listings with derivatives trading up to 1000x leverage. This means you should buy soon if you want presale pricing.

His post highlights a long-term resistance level and a tightening price pattern that many traders interpret as a classic sign of an impending breakout. XRP Nears Key Resistance As of report time, XRP trades around $3.04, reflecting a steady recovery from mid-year lows. This price action puts the token within striking distance of a historically significant resistance band. Galaxy’s chart draws a green horizontal line around the $3.30 to $3.65 range , marking the level XRP must break to confirm strong upward momentum. A sustained move above this area would represent a decisive shift from consolidation to a fresh bullish trend. $XRP This is how a bullish chart looks like. Green line is what we want to break to see some strong momentum. Just a matter of time. pic.twitter.com/Fu5XJDy6nC — Galaxy (@galaxyBTC) September 12, 2025 The Critical Green Line The green line in Galaxy’s chart is not merely symbolic. It represents a price zone where sellers have historically overwhelmed buyers, halting previous rallies. A weekly close above $3.30–$3.65 with heavy volume indicates potential re-entry by institutions and major traders. Until confirmed, traders ought to expect price swings, possible false breakouts, and lower support retests. Technical Setup and Bullish Formation Galaxy points to a flag-like pattern—a period of price compression following a strong advance. This is a textbook continuation setup. Independent technical analyses echo this view, citing supporting indicators such as moving-average crossovers and higher-timeframe consolidation. Together, these factors increase the probability of an upside resolution, provided the breakout is validated with significant volume and market breadth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Upside Targets If XRP closes a weekly candle above the green resistance with strong volume, chart-based projections suggest initial targets in the low-$4 range. More aggressive measured-move calculations, factoring in the depth of the flag formation, point to mid-single-digit prices over the medium term. However, if bulls fail to sustain the breakout, XRP could remain range-bound, with pullbacks toward established supports below $3 . Broader Market Context The wider crypto market and macroeconomic environment will heavily influence XRP’s next move. Liquidity trends, institutional flows, and global risk sentiment can either amplify or mute any technical breakout. Traders should monitor these macro signals and price action to gauge the strength and longevity of any rally. Key Takeaway for Holders Galaxy’s chart provides a directional guide, not a certainty. The technical outlook appears bullish , but realization hinges on market engagement and confirmation of a breakout. For those holding XRP long-term, patience is key: a confirmed weekly close above the green line might unlock a strong upward trajectory. Until then, disciplined risk management remains the smartest strategy. Galaxy’s analysis offers a clear message—the setup is bullish, and the market is approaching a defining threshold. Whether XRP transforms this structure into a lasting uptrend now depends on traders’ ability to push through and hold above that decisive green line.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent held a two-hour meeting with Rieder in New York yesterday, according to an official familiar with the matter. The meeting focused on monetary policy, the Fed's institutional structure, and regulatory policies. Bessent has reportedly met with four of the 11 candidates publicly mentioned so far, and the process is ongoing. It's also being reported that one or two more names may be added to the list. Rieder heads BlackRock's fixed-income securities division. He joined the firm in 2009 and previously spent nearly 20 years at Lehman Brothers. BlackRock declined to comment. Related News: Billionaire Bitcoin Bulls Winklevoss Twins Reveal 10-Year Price Forecast for Bitcoin Treasury Secretary Bessent is reportedly impressed by Rieder's long career in markets, his experience managing large groups, and his deep understanding of the micro and macroeconomic factors. It was noted that Rieder would be able to take office with a calm approach and extensive knowledge of non-bank financial institutions. President Donald Trump, however, is known to have nicknamed Powell “Too Late,” believing he was too slow to act on economic data. Trump is reportedly considering Christopher Waller, Kevin Warsh, and Kevin Hassett as leading candidates for the Fed Chair position. Bessent is expected to meet with all candidates on Trump's behalf and present a shortlist of three to four names to the President in the fall. Bitcoin should be included in portfolios alongside gold, but allocations depend on each investor's risk profile, Rick Rieder, BlackRock's Director of Global Fixed Income Investments, said on CNBC on Tuesday. *This is not investment advice.

Despite the excitement surrounding potential exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that could invest in the altcoin if approved, The Motley Fool has cautioned that the current market correction may persist longer than many anticipate. Warns Of Prolonged Downtrend In a recent analysis, the firm attributed some of XRP’s lackluster performance to a general malaise in the cryptocurrency market, where traders are waiting for Bitcoin (BTC), the market’s leading cryptocurrency, to lead a new price rally. However, two critical factors suggest that XRP may face a more prolonged downtrend than previously expected. The anticipated launch of new spot crypto ETFs has been a focal point of discussion since the beginning of the year. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) On The Brink Of A Major Supply Crisis: What It Means For Investors Several asset managers have submitted applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create spot XRP ETFs, with Bloomberg estimating a 95% approval chance and online prediction markets estimating 94%. While approval seems likely, the real question revolves around the demand for these ETFs. XRP, currently the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency, undoubtedly has some level of institutional interest, yet the actual inflows tell a different story. Data indicates that only $1.25 billion flowed into XRP from institutional investors during the first eight months of 2025. JPMorgan Chase has projected that the upcoming ETFs could attract between $4 billion and $8 billion into XRP. However, the firm asserts that even the lower end of this estimate might not significantly influence XRP’s price action over the long-term, given its current market capitalization of $180 billion. Recovery For XRP May Not Occur Until 2026 While there is considerable optimism among analysts regarding XRP’s future, with some price predictions suggesting it could reach new record prices of up to $4, $5, or even $10, the firms noted that these projections do not account for the risks of short-term price declines. According to crypto betting platform, Polymarket, there is a 32% chance of XRP dropping to $2.50 this year, a 30% chance it could fall to $2.40, and a 27% chance of plummeting to $2. Related Reading: BNB Price Surges to Fresh ATH – Can Bulls Push Toward $1K? These statistics indicate that XRP could continue to drift lower over the next few months before any meaningful recovery takes place, potentially not occurring until 2026. Ultimately, The Motley Fool analysis suggests that any upward movement for XRP is likely to depend on Bitcoin’s performance. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim its previous peak by the end of the year, it will be challenging for XRP to initiate its own rally. As of this writing, the XRP price has recovered the $3.0675 mark, representing a 1.5% surge within the last 24 hours. This pales in comparison to Ethereum’s (ETH) 5% gains within the same time frame.

Such large-scale withdrawals are typically interpreted as signs of long-term holding intentions, since smart money often moves altcoins off exchanges for self-custody or strategic allocation. According to data from Lookonchain , the four newly created wallets withdrew a combined 78,229 ETH from Kraken in just 10 hours, though there are no links to known whales or institutions.

Ethereum Price Prediction: Is This Early Positioning For the Next Bull Run? Looking at the 4-hour chart, this whale accumulation also came hours before the breakout from a descending channel that had held Ethereum in consolidation for the past three weeks. A support trendline stretching back to early August has proven the launchpad for Ethereum’s next upward move. ETH / USD 1-day chart, descending channel breakout. Source: TradingView. Momentum signals, however, urge caution. The RSI has pushed into overbought territory near 70, often a marker of local tops as buyers exhaust short-term momentum. That said, the MACD line continues to hold a strong lead over the signal line, suggesting that the broader uptrend retains strength despite signs of a potential histogram peak. With this move, Ethereum has broken key resistance that capped upside since the start of September at $4.500, a level analysts argue is the gateway for a 10% rally toward $5,000. $4,500 is the key resistance for Ethereum $ETH . Break it, and $5,000 is next! pic.twitter.com/oPtyL72Rop — Ali (@ali_charts) September 11, 2025 If this level holds as support and $5,000 is realised, ETH enters uncharted territory with no historical resistance, opening the door to price discovery. A stronger rally, underpinned by up to 75 bps in U.S. rate cuts before year-end, could extend the Ethereum price toward $7,000 —a 55% gain from current levels.

Yet seasoned investors are beginning to look beyond meme-fueled assets and toward PayFi tokens that combine utility with growth potential. One XRP rival, Remittix (RTX) , priced at just $0.108, is a ‘screaming buy now’ with a $250,000 giveaway, a wallet beta launch set for September 15, and a 15 % USDT referral reward program, momentum behind Remittix is heating up at a pace that suggests far stronger returns than Dogecoin’s speculative climb. Dogecoin Price Faces Investor Scepticism The Dogecoin price is currently hovering around $0.25, trading within a range that has persisted for months. Optimism remains strong among its community, especially with ongoing ETF chatter and occasional celebrity mentions. While it remains a symbol of early crypto enthusiasm, the Dogecoin narrative today relies almost entirely on sentiment-driven spikes rather than adoption. This creates limited upside when compared to tokens driving real-world use cases. Remittix Emerges As A Better Growth Story Remittix , often compared to XRP in its payment-first model, is now being tipped as a stronger bet than the Dogecoin price trajectory. Unlike Dogecoin, Remittix has carved out a role in PayFi by enabling direct crypto to bank transfers across more than 30 countries. It has already confirmed two centralized exchange listings, with BitMart secured after raising $20 million and LBANK confirmed after surpassing $22 million. A third exchange listing is currently being prepared. Momentum continues to build as Remittix has sold over 658 million tokens at $0.108 each, raising more than $25.2 million. These achievements reflect growing confidence from both retail buyers and larger holders who see parallels to XRP’s early days. Added to this is the 15 % referral program that pays rewards in USDT every 24 hours, which is accelerating adoption at the grassroots level. Investors are paying attention because it is: Solving A Real World $19 Trillion Payments Problem Built For Adoption, Not Speculation Global Payout Rails Already Integrated And Expanding Deflationary Tokenomics Designed For Long-Term Growth Audited By CertiK Built With Trust And Transparency Why Remittix Could Outperform Dogecoin While the Dogecoin price might attract retail buyers hoping for another viral breakout, Remittix is steadily building the kind of payment system that appeals to both institutions and global users. For investors evaluating long-term upside, the comparison is becoming clear. Dogecoin’s $1 dream rests on speculative hope, whereas Remittix is showing the mechanics that could realistically power a 10x or even higher move as PayFi demand accelerates. With XRP once trading at $0.03 before its parabolic run, many are now eyeing Remittix’s $0.108 price point as a similar early-stage opportunity.

The recall dealt another blow to the Chinese EV market as a leading brand had to recall one of its most popular models due to concerns over safety risk. The issue involves a flaw in the sensor wiring harness. The affected cars, which include some of those produced between August 20 last year and April 27 this year, may display a steering fault warning indicator light before experiencing a steering failure. Xpeng has committed to replacing the faulty parts free of charge for owners. Xpeng has recalled its flagship model The Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng Inc. had to issue a recall of 47,490 units of its P7+ sedan, affecting at least 70% of its customers who bought the model. The recall is due to a steering fault that poses safety risks, according to a statement from China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) that was released Friday. The P7+ sedan was launched late last year and quickly became one of Xpeng’s most popular models, selling 67,000 units. China’s price competition Earlier this year, regulators moved to rein in the industry’s price war , which has been raging for several years as automakers compete for market share in the world’s largest EV market. Even established players like BYD and Tesla, as well as newer companies like Nio and Xpeng, have had to cut prices to attract buyers. While these discounts have boosted sales, they have also squeezed profit margins. In response, automakers have been pressuring their suppliers to lower costs. Industry analysts and regulators have warned that these conditions could affect the standards of materials and components used in production. Xpeng’s incident may lead to increased global scrutiny on China’s auto exports and domestic regulators pushing for stronger safety standards. China’s booming EV market provides buyers with lower prices and rapid technological innovation, but the sustainability of those advantages may depend on how well automakers can balance affordability with durability and safety.

AI agents are no longer just a concept, but rather a common feature being leveraged for a variety of crypto-focused use cases. AI agents also differ from traditional rule-based bots . Rather than following simple prompts, agents are able to continuously learn from market movements, sentiment and liquidity conditions to execute trades with greater precision. This is why AI agents are being leveraged more often in the crypto sphere . David Sneider, CEO and co-founder of Lit Protocol, told Cryptonews that any strategy a person or organization executes manually in DeFi today can be automated through AI agents. Sneider added that beyond saving time, these models provide entirely new access. “One person can craft a strategy, while others simply enroll to benefit, removing the barrier of technical sophistication that previously limited who could participate in advanced crypto strategies,” he said. AI Agents for Trading and Yield Optimization To put this in perspective, Sneider explained how retail investors use AI agents through Lit Protocol and Vincent, an automation platform layer on Lit that powers a wide variety of crypto trading agents. “Within autonomous crypto agents, we see two broad categories: ‘user-configured’ agents and ‘set-and-forget’ agents,” Sneider mentioned. According to Sneider, user-configured agents allow crypto investors to have direct strategy input. A leading example of this is Lit’s “Agent Hustle,” where users interact through a chat interface and provide prompts like the one below: “Execute a mixed trading strategy: allocate 80% to conservative blue-chip and stablecoin yield positions, 10% to aggressive perp trading with dynamic leverage and a max 2% drawdown per trade, and 10% to trending meme tokens using sentiment and social signals. Rebalance automatically, manage risk tightly, and maximize overall portfolio performance.” “The agent drafts, refines with user feedback, and then executes the strategy,” Sneider said. Users can also leverage set-and-forget agents to run established strategies that are optimized over time. Sneider pointed out examples of these being deployed through Vincent: Perpetual futures hedging : Monitoring exposures and rebalancing leverage automatically. Yield optimization : Shifting stablecoins between lending markets and vaults to secure the best rates. Trader Agents : Executing momentum, mean reversion, options spreads, or cross-chain arbitrage strategies under a defined mandate. Vincent Yield = yield automation built on Lit. Deposit once → Lit secures the agent → Morpho powers lending → Vincent automates. Result: yield you don’t have to babysit. Max yield, without micromanagement. — Lit Protocol (@LitProtocol) September 10, 2025 AI Agents for Token Discovery AI agents are also helping crypto users with token discovery. Jake Gallen, CEO at agenthustle.ai (Hustle), told Cryptonews that the platform helps users discover tokens intelligently and trade autonomously. “Hustle’s Memory, Toolbox, and Conditional trading engine are the three pillars that separate this agent from competition, making him one of the most unique products on the market,” Gallen said. “We combine these apps, leverage it with the Emblem Vault multichain wallet, and allow the Agent to interact with any blockchain.” Gallen pointed out that Hustle’s primary use cases include token discovery and automated trading. “Within a single prompt, Hustle can find a token based on the context a user presents, then buy these assets, and set up an advanced entry and exit order. From start to finish, this can be accomplished in 30 seconds,” Gallen commented. Hustle also helps with users seeking pocket analysis. “Users can combine Hustle’s memory and toolbox to utilize just his alpha aggregation, news reporting, and contextual outputs. They do not trade and use him simply as a pocket analyst,” Gallen said. AI Agents Within Crypto Exchanges While AI agents can help crypto investors trade intelligently, popular U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase has also started to explore these models. Dan Kim, head of strategy at Coinbase Developer Platform, told Cryptonews that Coinbase is currently focused on building infrastructure to allow AI agents to operate safely and autonomously. “This includes giving agents wallets, the ability to transact on-chain, and tools to charge or pay for services programmatically,” Kim said. He added that the infrastructure behind these models, like x402 and AgentKit , allows AI agents to interact with DeFi, pay for services, and perform economic activities safely across Coinbase. “This is essentially preparing the groundwork for future AI-native payments,” Kim noted. AI Agents Can Make Mistakes Although the potential behind AI agents and crypto use cases is huge, these models are far from perfect. While AI agents can ensure efficiency, accessibility, and risk discipline, Sneider explained, there are downfalls to consider: Data fragility: This is where poor inputs or unreliable oracles can cascade into bad trades. Overfitting : Agents trained on narrow historical data underperform in black swan events. Execution errors : We’ve seen cases where AI models hallucinate or misinterpret instructions. For instance, Sentient recently shared an example of an AI agent getting “stuck” in a transaction loop, firing the same order over and over. Without circuit breakers, this kind of loop can spiral quickly. Latency: Agents that depend on off-chain inference sometimes miss optimal execution windows. EXPOSING MASSIVE VULNERABILITIES IN AI AGENTS: MILLIONS($) AT RISK Case in point: elizaOS (just one example of the broader problem in agentic frameworks) The Sentient research team and Princeton University researchers recently illustrated crucial gaps in the security of the… pic.twitter.com/mnAU0cUQNd — Sentient (@SentientAGI) March 24, 2025 Gallen added that the most common mistake AI agents make when it comes to trading is purchasing “fake tokens.” “When a token is pumping, there are multiple copycat tokens that pop up. Even more so, these copycat tokens are artificially inflated to appear as the organic runner. AI can be tricked to buy these because they consider the on-chain volume as real,” Gallen explained. Although there are multiple safety mechanisms set in place, as well as checks and balances, Gallen noted that these occurrences happen every so often . Additionally, Gallen mentioned that API and tooling inconsistencies can be challenging. “This can happen when someone uses one API for conditional trading to execute trades, while using another API to source real-time data. One API can consider Market Cap and FDV as the same thing, while the other provider is much more meticulous in their classifications. This can cause AI to close trades early or result in another variety of outputs that can cause these models to fail at what they were intended to accomplish.” AI Agents Won’t Replace Human Traders Yet Although the potential behind AI crypto trading agents is massive, these models are not yet ready to replace humans entirely. According to Sneider, the beginning of “agentic finance” is just now taking place . However, he said that today’s early products show both promise and pitfalls. “AI can act as a co-pilot, but it must operate inside secure rails,” he said. As such, Sneider believes that AI agents won’t replace human traders, but rather they’ll extend them. “They’ll automate execution across both DeFi and TradFi, but always anchored in user-defined authority,” Sneider said.

In a filing , Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell alleged that sports event contracts, which Kalshi introduced in January 2025, violate the state's sports wagering laws, which require operators to be licensed. Campbell is asking for a court to block Kalshi from offering sports prediction markets in the state without a license, as well as monetary and other relief. Prediction markets have grown in popularity over the past few years, with crypto-focused companies like Polymarket and firms like Kalshi seeing immense interest over questions such as who would win the last presidential election. While the Massachusetts filing notes that Kalshi does offer these different categories of prediction markets, its lone charge is focused on its sports-related bets. The filing said Kalshi's prediction markets, which are structured as binary options, operate the same way licensed sports wagering operators' products do, comparing it to FanDuel as an example. ""Kalshi is in the business of accepting wagers, defined as 'a sum of money or thing of value risked on an uncertain occurrence' on amateur and professional sporting events in the form of selling sporting event contracts,"" the filing said, adding, ""Kalshi’s sporting event contracts constitute sports wagering as defined by [Massachusetts General Law Chapter 23, section three] and applicable regulations."" A portion of the lawsuit points to actions the Attorney General's office alleges are designed to hook possible bettors. ""Kalshi’s platform employs behavioral design mechanisms drawn from gambling psychology, including features that encourage impulsive engagement, exploit award anticipation, and diminish users’ perception of financial risk,"" the filing said. It pointed to Kalshi's website design, including presenting possible payouts in ""bright green font, a color that signals safety and correctness,"" while odds were presented in black font. ""This interface design subtly encourages high-risk transactions by emphasizing reward while obscuring risk."" Campbell said ""if Klashi wants to be in teh sports gaming business in Massachusetts, they must obtain a license"" in a statement. ""Sports wagering comes with significant risk of addiction and financial loss and must be strictly regulated to mitigate public health consequences."" In a statement, a Kalshi spokesperson said, ""Kalshi offers its users a fair, transparent, federally-regulated, and nationwide marketplace. Rather than engage in dialogue with Kalshi as many other states have done, Massachusetts is trying to block Kalshi’s innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas. Prediction markets are a critical innovation of the 21st century, and all Americans should be able to access them. We are proud to be the company that has pioneered this technology and stand ready to defend it once again in a court of law.""",Policy|Kalshi|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MINING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-12 20:54:32

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7668 Market cap $811.39M Trading volume (24-hour) $63.72M Circulating supply 1.058B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.7924 24-hour low $0.7442 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.05% 50-day SMA $0.7935 14-Day RSI 49.48 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.6861 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: The XTZ daily chart signals a breakout, targeting $0.82 next. A MACD crossover and strong volume confirm bullish bias. The $0.75 support level is key to sustaining momentum. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart The Tezos daily structure as of September 12 has turned bullish after breaking above the mid-Bollinger Band. Price is pushing toward the upper band at $0.8127, making that the immediate resistance. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD has flipped into positive territory, confirming a fresh bullish crossover, while RSI has moved to a neutral 52 level, leaving room for further upside before overbought conditions. Volume has expanded sharply to 6.29M, validating the breakout strength. If momentum sustains, $0.82–$0.85 comes into focus, while failure to defend $0.74 risks sliding back toward $0.70. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Tezos surged toward $0.80 before mild profit-taking kicked in, leading to a consolidation range. The Alligator indicator remains in a bullish spread, with the green line near $0.76 providing immediate support. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView OBV shows strong buyer commitment during the run-up, though flattening momentum now reflects cooling demand. If buyers defend the $0.75–$0.76 area, continuation toward $0.80 remains likely. However, losing $0.75 opens the door for a retest of $0.74–$0.73. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7410 BUY SMA 5 $0.7473 BUY SMA 10 $0.7490 BUY SMA 21 $0.7641 BUY SMA 50 $0.7935 SELL SMA 100 $0.7017 BUY SMA 200 $0.6861 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7265 BUY EMA 5 $0.7365 BUY EMA 10 $0.7598 BUY EMA 21 $0.7852 SELL EMA 50 $0.7748 SELL EMA 100 $0.7382 BUY EMA 200 $0.7445 BUY What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos is gearing up for a potential push into the $0.82–$0.85 zone if the breakout holds, but losing $0.75 support would weaken momentum and delay further upside. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286.

According to Whale Alert, a staggering 987,667 SOL tokens, valued at approximately $237 million, were moved from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet. This substantial transaction immediately sparked discussions and speculation across the digital asset landscape. Understanding the implications of such large movements is crucial for anyone following the crypto market. What Does This Massive SOL Transfer Mean for Solana? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, especially involving an institutional platform like Coinbase and an undisclosed destination, it often signals a significant shift in ownership or strategy. Such a substantial SOL transfer can be interpreted in several ways: Strategic Reallocation: The institutional holder might be moving assets for better security, diversification, or to prepare for over-the-counter (OTC) sales. Custody Change: It could indicate a change in the custodian service used by a large entity or high-net-worth individual. Market Signal: While not always a direct indicator, large transfers can sometimes precede significant market movements, either buying or selling pressure. The sheer volume of the SOL transfer makes it a notable event, as nearly a million Solana tokens represent a considerable portion of the circulating supply. This activity is closely monitored by analysts for its potential ripple effects. Unpacking the Details: Coinbase Institutional and the Unknown Wallet The source of the funds, Coinbase Institutional, adds a layer of intrigue. Coinbase Institutional is a platform designed for large financial institutions and corporations, offering advanced trading and custody solutions. This suggests the original holder was a sophisticated entity with significant capital, likely managing a substantial portfolio. The destination, an “unknown wallet,” is typical for blockchain transactions where the identity of the wallet owner is not publicly disclosed. While this maintains privacy, it also fuels speculation about the intent behind the SOL transfer . Was it a private individual, another institution, or perhaps an exchange preparing for a listing or delisting? The lack of immediate transparency often leads to heightened market curiosity. Understanding these details helps us appreciate the potential impact of such a large-scale SOL transfer on the broader Solana ecosystem and its participants. Why Do These Solana Whale Movements Matter to You? Whale movements, like this recent SOL transfer , are closely watched by market analysts and investors for several reasons: Price Impact: Large sales or purchases by whales can significantly influence the price of an asset, especially in markets with lower liquidity. Their actions can create either upward or downward pressure. Market Sentiment: The actions of major holders can reflect broader sentiment. A move to an unknown wallet could be seen as a preparation for selling, potentially signaling bearish sentiment, or simply a shift in secure storage, indicating long-term holding. Security Concerns: While unlikely with an institutional transfer, large movements always prompt questions about the security of the funds and the integrity of the blockchain network. However, Solana’s robust security protocols are designed to handle such large transactions safely. This particular SOL transfer highlights the ongoing activity within the Solana network and the dynamic nature of institutional participation in crypto. What Should Investors Watch For After This Crucial SOL Transfer? For investors and enthusiasts tracking Solana, monitoring the aftermath of this substantial SOL transfer is key. Here are some actionable insights: Price Action: Observe Solana’s price movements in the coming days and weeks. Does it experience unusual volatility or a sustained trend following the transfer? Further Transfers: Keep an eye on the destination wallet for any subsequent movements. If the tokens are sent to an exchange, it might indicate an intent to sell. Conversely, if they remain dormant, it suggests long-term holding. News and Announcements: Stay informed about any official statements from Coinbase or major Solana ecosystem participants, although direct comments on specific whale movements are rare. On-Chain Analytics: Tools that track whale activity can provide more granular insights into the flow of funds and potential accumulation or distribution patterns following this SOL transfer . Such events underscore the importance of staying vigilant and informed in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Understanding the nuances of these large transactions can provide valuable context for your investment strategy. In conclusion, the recent SOL transfer of nearly one million tokens from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet represents a significant event in the Solana ecosystem. While the exact intentions behind this $237 million movement remain shrouded in mystery, it serves as a powerful reminder of the substantial capital flowing through the digital asset markets. Keeping an eye on these whale activities is essential for understanding potential market shifts and making informed decisions. The crypto world is constantly evolving, and staying abreast of major transactions like this can offer unique insights into market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was the recent significant SOL transfer? A staggering 987,667 SOL tokens, valued at approximately $237 million, were recently transferred from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet, as reported by Whale Alert. This large-scale SOL transfer has drawn considerable attention. Q2: What does “Coinbase Institutional” imply in this transaction? Coinbase Institutional is a platform tailored for large financial institutions and corporations. Its involvement suggests that the original holder of the SOL tokens was a sophisticated entity with significant capital and likely a well-defined investment strategy. Q3: Why are large SOL transfers, often called “whale movements,” important? Whale movements are important because they can signal strategic shifts by major holders, potentially influencing market sentiment and even the price of an asset due to the sheer volume of tokens involved. This specific SOL transfer is a prime example of such a movement. Q4: Does this SOL transfer guarantee a price change for Solana? No, a single SOL transfer does not guarantee a price change. While large movements can influence market sentiment and potentially precede price volatility, many factors affect cryptocurrency prices. It’s an indicator to watch, not a definitive predictor. Q5: How can I track future movements from this unknown wallet? You can track future movements from the unknown wallet using blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics tools. By inputting the wallet address, you can monitor any subsequent transfers, which might reveal more about the holder’s intentions. Did you find this analysis insightful?

Avalanche (AVAX) was one such project, but its initial momentum pales in comparison to what analysts are seeing now. A new AI project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is being hailed as the next 100x opportunity after its Phase 2 presale sold out in record time, demonstrating a level of demand that has surpassed even the early days of Avalanche. This bold claim is being backed by hard numbers and explosive market enthusiasm. The Ruvi AI presale is surging toward the $3.6 million fundraising mark, with a rapidly growing global community of over 3,500 investors having already snapped up more than 265 million tokens . This incredible velocity, fueled by real utility in the AI sector, is a powerful indicator that Ruvi AI is on the fast track to a monumental breakout. A New Benchmark for Demand The comparison to Avalanche isn’t about replacing it; it’s about recognizing a familiar pattern of explosive growth, but on an accelerated timeline. While Avalanche took time to build its following, Ruvi AI’s presale has caught fire, with Phase 2 selling out almost instantaneously. This suggests a level of investor conviction and market readiness that is rarely seen. For those seeking the next 100x gem, this accelerated demand means the window of opportunity for a ground-floor entry is closing much faster than anticipated. This immense potential is built on a foundation of trust and security. Ruvi AI has successfully completed a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a reputable third-party security firm, assuring investors of the platform’s integrity. This crucial validation, combined with a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , has established Ruvi AI as a legitimate, high-growth project attracting serious capital. The Super App Fueling the 100x Forecast The engine driving this forecast is Ruvi AI’s revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is designed to empower content creators in the booming $104 billion creator economy . By offering a powerful suite of AI-driven tools that solve real-world problems, Ruvi AI is creating a foundation for mass adoption and sustained, long-term demand for its token. Key features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Urgent Warning: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at the highly attractive price of $0.020 . However, with the demand explosion following the end of Phase 2, this opportunity is disappearing at an incredible speed. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure their position before the inevitable surge. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s path to becoming a 100x gem is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery. For investors seeking to maximize their returns, the project’s VIP program and early bonuses offer a clear path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens).

The names that are picking up speed include industry giants and some emerging players that have the potential to change the crypto scene completely. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano continue to anchor portfolios, while emerging opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the attention of forward-thinking investors seeking to harness the potential for outsized gains. Bitcoin: The Bedrock of Digital Assets Bitcoin remains the main store of value in the crypto world. Its limited supply, institutional adoption, and increasing awareness for it as a “digital gold” make it a cornerstone for everyone looking to build a portfolio that will stand the test of time. As the supply pressure intensifies with every halving, it sets the stage for a bullish outlook in the long run. Ethereum: Building Decentralized Applications Ethereum has become the main platform for decentralized finance(DeFi), non-fungible tokens(NFTs) and smart contracts. With its continuous upgrades, including the scaling enhancements and reduction in transaction fees, it is solidifying its role as the infrastructure layer for blockchain innovation. Many experts think that Ethereum will continue to be the center of the next wave of Web3 growth. Cardano – A Scientific Approach to Blockchain Cardano has the distinction of being peer-reviewed and developed through a process of rigorous research and development. It has a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications, token launches, and cross-chain functionality. Its attention to scalability and sustainability makes it a project with a strong potential to grow over the next decade. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Shining Star With Explosive Potential One project that is gaining a lot of attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With projections of returns up to 50x , its presale has been a massive success, selling out rounds in rapid succession as early investors scramble to get allocations. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE captivating is not merely speculation but its vision of building real-world utility and rewarding community-driven growth. Many are drawing parallels between the momentum behind it and the early days of world-class tokens, implying that early movers could potentially reap life-changing returns. Tron – Creating a Decentralized Internet Tron has established itself as one of the most active networks for decentralized applications and content sharing. With no transaction fees, fast processing times, and an enormous user base worldwide, it is a viable candidate to stay relevant for the long-term, particularly in areas where blockchain access must be cost-effective and scalable. Conclusion As the crypto industry continues to mature, investors are moving towards projects with solid foundations and long-term growth potential. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano are the tried-and-true pillars of the blockchain world, while Tron provides real-world applications in decentralized content and payments. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is creating tremendous hype around its explosive growth predictions and has established itself as one of the most promising altcoins for the coming years.

Related Reading: Institutional Adoption Rises: 21X Brings Chainlink Into Europe’s Tokenized Securities Market At a spot price of $113,595, that haul equals about $7.35 billion. Reports have disclosed that these investors — wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC — have pushed their monthly net accumulation to 93,000 BTC. Sharks Expand Their Holdings Those mid-sized holders a.k.a. “sharks” now control about 3.65 million BTC. That is roughly 18% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, which is about 19.91 million coins. The shift is striking because it removes a meaningful chunk of coins from the pool of easily traded supply. Less available BTC can change how quickly prices move when demand rises. #Bitcoin entities holding 100–1k #BTC (“sharks”) have sharply ramped up accumulation. Over the past 7 days, their holdings grew by ~65k $BTC. The pace of accumulation has grown as well, with a 30D net increase of 93k $BTC. This group now holds a record 3.65M $BTC. pic.twitter.com/MRcIPcTB1T — glassnode (@glassnode) September 11, 2025 What This Means For Supply And Demand While these sharks are not the same as the very large institutional whales, their moves still affect market balance. Buying at this scale reduces liquid supply and can push prices up if fresh buying keeps coming. Some market participants see the pattern as a sign of growing confidence among this class of investors. At the same time, it can raise short-term volatility: when a concentrated group holds more coins, their future decisions to sell or hold will matter. Market Moves And Recent Price Action Bitcoin’s run this year has been strong. Based on market tracker numbers, BTC has climbed about 100% over the past year, is up 23% year-to-date, and has gained over 40% over the past six months. Price action has not been smooth, though. The market fell to about $107,000 on September first, then recovered to a little over $116,000 earlier today. At the time of writing, BTC was inching near $114,000. Forecasts And Investor Expectations Public forecasts have been bold. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has suggested Bitcoin could top $150,000 by Christmas. Tom Lee of Fundstrat has forecast $200,000 by the same date. Related Reading: ETF Dreams For Dogecoin: Serious Possibility Or Just Hype? Risks And What To Watch For This aggressive accumulation comes with caveats. Markets can reverse quickly. Large inflows into or out of ETFs, miner sell pressure, or a shift in macro conditions could halt the rally. Also, heavy concentration in certain wallet groups can amplify moves if those groups change course. Investors should watch wallet flows, trading volumes, and major announcements that might tilt sentiment. In short, the recent buying by mid-sized holders is a clear, measurable trend. It tightens the pool of coins available to trade and has coincided with strong price gains this year.

Originally expected to hit the trading floor this Thursday, the REX-Osprey DOGE ETF ($DOJE) has been postponed to next week , according to Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas . Update Part 3: Another delay. Launching next week. Mid week. Prob Thur. https://t.co/Lzk2pCVo0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 11, 2025 Dogecoin ($DOGE) is gaining momentum ahead of the ETF listing, rising nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, with trading volume surging 23% to $4 billion . Over the past week, $DOGE has climbed 20.2% , signaling it may be playing catch-up with newer entrants in the meme coin space. The launch of an ETF could be a game-changer. It would allow both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through a fully regulated product – potentially triggering a fresh wave of demand across the entire meme coin sector in the near term. Dogecoin Price Prediction: $DOGE Gears Up for 200% Breakout as ETF Mania Builds The upcoming ETF launch may be the final boarding call before $DOGE takes off . The daily chart shows five green sessions out of the last six , with Dogecoin already testing key resistance at $0.26 . Price action reveals a clear pattern of accumulation , with $DOGE trading tightly between the 200-day EMA and this resistance zone. Whales appear to be loading up , positioning ahead of what could be a major breakout – fueled largely by ETF anticipation. A clean move above $0.26 would confirm a bullish Dogecoin price prediction , with the next upside targets at $0.45 , then $0.80 if momentum continues to build. And as Wall Street increasingly embraces crypto , capital is rapidly rotating into high-upside opportunities . That’s why many investors are now eyeing top presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – a meme coin with early-stage momentum and the kind of upside potential that could deliver 10x to 100x gains before the cycle peaks. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Rockets Past $2M – Degens Already Loading Bags Maxi Doge ($MAXI) With Bitcoin and major altcoins hitting new highs, early-stage meme coins are back in focus – and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is grabbing attention fast. This token isn’t here to play safe. It’s built for raw, unfiltered upside – think 1000x energy, no brakes, and full degen momentum. The mascot? A Shiba Inu on overdrive – caffeinated, laser-focused, and ready to claw its way to the top with diamond hands and zero hesitation. Here’s what makes $MAXI stand out. Up to 25% of presale funds are deployed through the Maxi Fund – capital used to buy and hold high-potential tokens during this cycle. Those who stake $MAXI during presale can also earn up to 155% APY , rewarding early holders for locking in now.

However, a recent court setback for the White House has raised the prospect that some of the money may have to be paid back. Treasury Department figures show the U.S. collected $30 billion in tariff revenue in August, bringing the year-to-date total to $165 billion. By contrast, August 2024 yielded $7 billion, with $70 billion gathered over the same period a year earlier. That puts the increase in tariff receipts this year at $95 billion. The gains could be temporary, however, if courts ultimately rule the approach unlawful and order refunds. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court found that Trump lacked authority to use the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to impose the duties at issue. The administration is appealing, sending the dispute to the Supreme Court. “We would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the treasury,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” In a court filing, Bessent said between $750 billion and $1 trillion in tariffs could be collected by June 2026, which is when the Supreme Court is expected to issue its ruling. The justices agreed to fast-track the case, with arguments set for November. Court loss may not end tariffs completely Even if the court sides against the administration, the tariffs might not vanish, according to Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. He wrote that the White House has other legal routes it could use to re-establish duties. Whether previously collected tariff revenue would have to be paid back remains unresolved. “Regardless of how the highest U.S. court rules, expect most of the current tariffs to remain in place,” Buchbinder wrote. Not every tariff is at stake in the case. At issue are the “reciprocal tariffs” on a range of partners and the fentanyl-related duties on Canada, China, and Mexico. Sector-specific tariffs on items such as foreign cars, steel, and copper are outside the lawsuit because they rest on a different legal basis and remain in force. The economic backdrop has grown more complicated. U.S. consumer prices rose in August by the most in seven months, driven by housing and food, Labor Department data showed Thursday. At the same time, a surge in first-time applications for jobless benefits last week left the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates next Wednesday. Together, firmer inflation and a softer job market have revived stagflation worries and complicate the Fed’s choices after Wednesday’s meeting. Trump has also said recently that the U.S would be “completely destroyed” without tariff money , as reported by Cryptopolitan. Tariffs and travel drive up prices Part of the price pressure reflects companies passing along higher costs tied to Trump’s broad tariffs, alongside a rebound in demand for travel. Visitor numbers to the United States slumped in the spring and early summer amid boycotts and the administration’s immigration crackdown before turning higher. The Consumer Price Index increased 0.4% in August after a 0.2% rise in July, the largest monthly gain since January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Housing costs rose 0.4%. Food prices went up 0.5%, with supermarket prices up 0.6%. Fruits and vegetables saw the biggest rise at 1.6%. Tomato prices jumped 4.5%, the highest since January 2020. Beef rose 2.7% in the month and stood 13.9% higher than a year earlier. Coffee was up 3.6% for the month and 20.9% from a year earlier. Tariffs likely contributed to some of these increases, while past droughts that reduced the national cattle herd probably helped push beef higher. Get seen where it counts.

Trump made the comments during a Fox News interview after being confronted by protesters at a Washington, D.C. restaurant earlier this week. “Protesters get paid for their profession from Soros and other people,” Trump said. “And we’re going to look into Soros, because I think it’s a RICO case against him and other people. Because this is more than like protests. This is real agitation.” The remarks were made during Trump’s sit-down with Fox, according to the full segment broadcast Wednesday. The RICO Act (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) is usually aimed at dismantling organized criminal networks. Trump didn’t clarify which Soros relative might be involved or name any organizations under suspicion. But this isn’t the first time Trump has called for an investigation. In previous speeches, he’s attacked Soros and “his wonderful Radical Left son,” without specifying which son. George’s son Alex Soros currently chairs the board of Open Society Foundations, one of the world’s biggest philanthropic groups tied to liberal causes. The renewed interest in launching a federal investigation follows the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a close Trump ally. Trump links political funding to financial chaos, points to Soros bets Soros has long been linked to massive financial movements. He profited from one of the biggest currency trades in history. Leading up to Black Wednesday in September 1992, Soros’s fund had sold short over $10 billion in British pounds, believing the UK’s entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was flawed. The British government refused to raise interest rates or float the currency. The pound collapsed. The UK was forced to withdraw. Soros’s profit: over $1 billion. The UK Treasury lost £3.4 billion. Soros was believed to have traded billions of Finnish markkas in 1996, expecting the currency to drop. Finnish authorities said they saw no evidence of any conspiracy. In 1997, during the Asian financial crisis, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused Soros of deliberately punishing ASEAN countries for accepting Myanmar. Mahathir referenced Soros’s Jewish background during the accusations, calling him “a Jew who triggered the currency plunge.” In 2006, Mahathir changed course after meeting Soros and accepted that he had not been responsible. Soros later wrote in his book The Crisis of Global Capitalism that his fund had shorted the Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit in early 1997, with contracts ranging from six months to a year. He said they later bought those currencies to lock in gains, but moved too early, fearing Malaysia would impose capital controls, which eventually happened. Soros also tried shorting the Hong Kong dollar during that time using similar strategies. But China backed the peg, and Hong Kong’s currency stayed stable. Soros’s fund lost most of the money bet against the HKD. French court found Soros guilty of insider trading after 14-year case In 1988, Soros was contacted by Georges Pébereau, a French financier who tried to organize a takeover of Société Générale and other companies under France’s privatization program. Soros didn’t join the group but bought shares in Société Générale, Suez, Paribas, and Compagnie Générale d’Électricité. French regulators launched an investigation in 1989, but found no evidence of insider trading. The case was reopened years later. On June 14, 2006, the French Supreme Court ruled Soros guilty and fined him €940,000. Soros denied any wrongdoing, claiming the information he had was public and that he had already planned to buy the shares before learning of the takeover. He appealed the conviction to the European Court of Human Rights in 2006, arguing the 14-year delay violated his right to a fair trial under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4–3 decision, saying Soros should’ve known the risks of trading with non-public information about a takeover.

The new funding round is projected to significantly boost its valuation and potentially triple the $1 billion valuation it achieved in an earlier funding round that closed just this summer. Polymarket soars in valuation amid expansion in the US According to Business Insider, which cited two sources familiar with the issue, investor interest in the platform has surged amid indications that one investor is offering a term sheet valuing the platform at as much as $10 billion. This comes on the back of news that the platform is close to entering the US market. One of the sources revealed that the valuation is, however, still in flux. The platform’s spokesperson did not comment on the matter. The news comes as Polymarket’s chief executive officer, Shayne Coplan, earlier this month made a major announcement on the X platform that regulators had given it “the green light to go live in the USA” in a major development that would open it to an immense new user base. The company has been making several strategic moves in that regard. Last month, Donald Trump Jr. joined its advisory board, and 1789 Capital, the company where he is a partner, made a strategic investment in the company. At that time, Trump Jr. said in a statement that: “Polymarket is the largest prediction market in the world, and the US needs access to this important platform.” Partnership with Chainlink gels with the US expansion initiative Polymarket was founded in 2020 by Shayne Coplan. It allows users to bet on the outcomes of real-world events utilizing cryptocurrency. It gained attention last year during the US presidential election when its markets managed to correctly predict a victory for President Trump, a forecast that ran counter to many traditional polls. Outside politics, the platform’s markets cover a wide range of topics, from sports outcomes to pop culture events, such as the potential engagement of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift. Despite its global popularity, the platform has been barred from operating in the US until now. Polymarket’s previous financing round was led by Peter Thiel’s Founder’s Fund, which valued the platform at $1 billion and brought its total funding to $255 million, according to Pitchbook data. Meanwhile, Polymarket is gearing for a major move, partnering with Chainlink signals a push for trust and accuracy as their US strategy heats up, according to Alva on the X platform. As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier, Polymarket and Chainlink have announced an integration standard into Polymarket’s resolution process. The report further explains that this partnership will focus on enhancing the accuracy and speed of asset pricing resolutions.
