The cryptocurrency market’s total cap has risen by 1.7%, to $4.057 trillion, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) posting 1.5% and 2.2% gains, respectively. Yet other tokens have outpaced the market by a wide margin today, including Avalanche (AVAX), which is up by 9% in the past 24 hours. We take a closer look at AVAX in this article, along with XRP and Solana (SOL), both of which also have the potential for big gains in the near future. Crypto Price Prediction Today 11 September – XRP, Solana, Avalanche XRP ($XRP): Ripple Partnerships and ETF Hopes Can Push Altcoin Higher The market’s third-biggest altcoin, XRP, has risen to $3.02 today, marking a 2% increase in 24 hours and a 6% increase in the last seven days. This indicates rising momentum, yet what’s encouraging is that XRP remains down by 4% in the past month, implying that it’s still moving up from an oversold position. It therefore has more gains in the store in the coming days and weeks, and not just because the wider market is recovering. Ripple is a major fundamental reason for its bullish prospects, with the firm this week signing a partnership with Spanish bank BBVA , for which it will provide custody services. This is another example of how Ripple has been growing more proactively since the end of its legal battle with Ripple, and it sets the stage for big XRP price gains later in the year. Source: TradingView And now is very good time to enter XRP, given that it has begun rising again but is still some way off an overbought position. Its relative strength index (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) both bottomed out a week or so ago, and are now on a climb towards higher levels. As such, the XRP price could return to $3.50 in the next few weeks, particularly if the FOMC does cut rates on September 16-17. And if the SEC approves any of the numerous XRP ETF applications, then the XRP price could rise even higher, potentially topping $5 by the end of the year. Solana ($SOL): Network Growth Prepares Ground for Big End-of-Year Surge The past few days and weeks have been kind to Solana, now up by 2.5% in 24 hours, 8.5% in a week, and28% in a month. As with XRP, it has its fundamentals to thank for its success, with Solana now comfortably the second-biggest layer-one network in terms of total value locked in . This testifies to increased adoption, yet it could attract even more usage if its own ETF applications secure approval later in the year. Bloomberg analysts give the various SOL ETFs—including from the likes of Grayscale, VanEck, Canary and Franklin— a 95% chance of approval . When combined with Solana’s pre-existing growth as a platform, this results in a hugely bullish crypto price prediction for SOL. Its chart today highlights its recent momentum and how this is likely to carry over into Q4. Source: TradingView Its indicators suggest that it’s close to hitting a top, with its RSI rising above 60 and about to climb over 70. This would normally be a warning sign, yet SOL is still on the way up after a quiet August, while the possibility of rate cuts next week could give it further fuel. Because of this, the Solana price could return to $250 by the end of the month, while it could rally towards $400 or higher by late December. Avalanche ($AVAX): Treasury Firm News Could Push Altcoin Towards Highs At $28.95, AVAX has posted an 8% increase today, while it’s also up by an impressive 17% in a week and by 26% in a month. This makes it one of the best-performing major tokens across these timeframes, and analysts have noted that it has just broken out of a 213-day consolidation . This could mean that it’s about to rally strongly over the coming weeks, buoyed by the news that it’s about to raise $1 billion for two AVAX treasury firms . Taken with the fact that there are two AVAX ETFs waiting for approval from the SEC, these treasury firms could be the factor that sends the Avalanche price flying. Its chart today shows that it has broken out of a bullish pennant, while its indicators are closing in on hitting a top. In view of this, we may see a slight correction over the weekend, but the AVAX price could pick up again as and when the FOMC cuts rates next week. In such a context, it could return to $50 by the end of October, while ETF approvals could send it towards $100 in December. Bitcoin Hyper: L2 Network Crosses $15 Million Milestone The crypto price prediction for these three coins looks really good, but traders may also want to diversify into newer tokens, since these can enjoy market-beating gains. This is something that does happen with presale coins, which can generate lots of momentum during their sales, and then rally big once they list. One example hoping to do just that is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a layer-two project that has now raised $15 million in its hugely popular sale. There's no beating this team. Bitcoin + $HYPER = The fastest $BTC L2 in History. https://t.co/yKdkqK0ACT pic.twitter.com/8uGAiDl1Xf — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 11, 2025 This makes Bitcoin Hyper’s one of the biggest presales of the year, which is perhaps no surprise, given its plans to launch Bitcoin’s first true layer-two network. As an L2 for Bitcoin, its platform will provide BTC holders with faster speeds and lower fees, making use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups to provide superior scalability and security. Users can deposit their BTC with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, receiving a commensurate quantity of HYPER for use on the L2. Its long-term plan is to become an important DeFi ecosystem for Bitcoin holders, enabling them to tap into BTC’s value in order to make more profit. HYPER will have a max supply of 21 billion tokens, with holders able to stake it for a passive income. They can buy it now, before it lists, by visiting the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a suitable wallet. HYPER is currently selling for $0.012895, although this will continue to rise for the sale’s duration.

Below, we break down what’s driving the hype around these tokens and why people are recognizing them as some of the most compelling candidates for possible 100x appreciation in the coming months and years. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Fans Flash Buy Signals as Dogecoin’s Degen Cousin Crosses $2 Million Threshold Today A fresh challenger to Dogecoin has arrived with its own unique flavor: Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , marketed as the beefed-up cousin of the original meme crypto. Dogecoin’s massive valuation now makes its price swings more closely tied to blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While DOGE still carries meme status, its wild volatility has eased since the frenzy of 2021. For investors chasing riskier meme projects with explosive potential, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is quickly gaining recognition, already drawing in over $2 million just weeks after its debut. Built as an ERC-20 token, MAXI leans heavily into community engagement. Its developers are growing Telegram and Discord channels, complete with trading contests and collaborative events designed to build loyalty. Out of a capped supply of 150.24 billion tokens, a quarter is allocated to a “Maxi Fund” for marketing and partnerships. Holders can also stake MAXI, with annual yields reaching up to 157% (though these will inevitably adjust as more users join). The token’s presale price is currently $0.0002565, set to increase slightly within a few hours as the presale moves to its next funding round. Purchases can be made directly through the Maxi Doge site using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet . Follow Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages. Visit the Official Website Here PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): A Next-Gen Presale Crypto Coin Blending Meme Culture with Mine-to-Earn, Already Secures $1M One of the newest ERC-20 meme coin projects to hit the scene, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , has generated buzz quickly thanks to its creative model and early fundraising success. Launched just two weeks ago, the presale has already pulled in nearly $1 million, clear evidence of mounting interest. PEPENODE bills itself as the first “mine-to-earn” crypto. Rather than sticking to conventional staking, it gamifies the process by letting users construct virtual mining nodes. The more nodes a holder builds with PEPENODE tokens, the higher their rewards, creating a system that encourages both accumulation and active participation. This inventive take on staking could help sustain demand and community activity long-term. Presale stakers can currently earn up to 1,398% APY, though rates will decrease as more investors join the pool — meaning early movers capture the best returns. Right now, tokens are priced at $0.0010533 via the PEPENODE website, with incremental increases every few days until the presale ends. Follow PEPENODE on X and Telegram for updates. Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE): A Trader-Centric Meme Coin you can Buy Today for Only $0.001 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) , a meme coin designed with a strong trading community focus, launched earlier this year on Ethereum after a $74 million ICO made it one of the most successful meme coin presales ever. Now it’s preparing to roll out on Solana. Since late May, the Ethereum-based token has surged over 250%. Earlier this week, WEPE’s intraday performance outpaced crypto rivals like Shiba Inu ($SHIB) and Pepe ($PEPE), although today it has now dipped 3% in a slight correction. Wall Street Pepe’s premise is straightforward: blend meme coin energy with a trading-focused ecosystem. Holders gain entry into community-driven spaces that share signals, insights, and strategy-building tools. The Solana migration won’t change overall supply but introduces a bullish mechanism: every WEPE purchased on Solana triggers a 1:1 burn of the Ethereum-based token, ensuring supply balance while broadening circulation. This move also brings the advantages of Solana’s fast transactions, low fees, and scalability, along with access to a wider investor base. Currently, Solana-based WEPE is available to buy today for $0.001 via the official website and will list on exchanges shortly. Follow Wall Street Pepe on X and Telegram for updates.

While established titans like Solana and Ripple present compelling cases, Layer Brett is quietly capturing attention for its explosive growth formula. This intense market debate pits institutional momentum against regulatory clarity and groundbreaking innovation. Solana ‘s big league backing: Can institutional favor fuel a 30x surge? Solana (SOL) has become a darling of institutional capital, with significant backing from major crypto players and bullish analyst sentiment branding it a top long-term play. This smart money influx suggests its perceived stability and technological prowess. However, the sheer scale of the Solana ecosystem presents a significant hurdle for a 30x rally in just a few months. Furthermore, recent security challenges, including malware attacks and exploits within the Solana ecosystem, raise questions about its short-term vulnerabilities. For all its strengths, the path to a 30x increase for SOL is a monumental task, and the analyst consensus suggests it’s a solid cornerstone for the 2025 crypto bull run instead of a coin ready for an immediate blast-off. The institutional support for Solana is clear, but exponential growth is another matter entirely. Ripple ‘s new dawn: Post-sec clarity and the road to recovery For years, the looming SEC case has cast a long shadow over Ripple (XRP). With that regulatory uncertainty now largely resolved, many believe XRP is finally free to perform. This newfound clarity, combined with a major new custody partnership, signals a bright future for Ripple and its adoption. Technical indicators for XRP may be turning bullish, suggesting upward momentum is building. Still, the wider market is grappling with intense sell-offs from crypto whales, and that kind of pressure could easily suppress a rapid, parabolic surge for an asset as large as Ripple. For XRP to achieve a 30x rally, it must overcome this headwind and its history of price consolidation. While Ripple is a key player, a 30-fold jump before December seems ambitious. The outlier’s advantage: Why Layer Brett ‘s formula is built for explosive growth While Solana and Ripple navigate the challenges of their scale, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) presents a different kind of opportunity that has crypto analyst circles buzzing. Operating as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Layer Brett combines the viral energy of a memecoin with tangible blockchain utility. This positions it to become a low-cap gem with breakout potential. The core advantage lies in its starting point: the crypto presale. Currently priced at just $0.0055 and having already raised over $3.3 million, $LBRETT has the low market cap necessary for a genuine 30x rally. It isn’t weighed down by the inertia of a multi-billion dollar valuation. This meme token is built on an advanced Layer 2 blockchain, offering the fast, low-cost transactions that users demand. Early backers are not just buying a token; they are securing a position in a burgeoning ecosystem with the chance to stake their $LBRETT for an impressive 782% APY. Conclusion: The verdict on the 30x contender So which asset are analysts tipping for a 30x rally? While Solana and Ripple are titans with undeniable long-term potential, their colossal market caps make such explosive short-term growth a near-impossibility. The clear candidate for a parabolic move is Layer Brett. Its position in a high-demand crypto presale , combined with a powerful blend of memecoin culture and potent Ethereum Layer 2 technology, creates the perfect storm for exponential gains. For those seeking the next 100x altcoin, the opportunity to enter a project like $LBRETT at its ground floor is a rare event that should not be overlooked. Connect your wallet and buy in today.

The White House is pushing for a decision by Monday, one day before the Federal Reserve meets to decide on interest rates, and just days after a district judge blocked Trump’s attempt to remove Cook from her post. The request, filed by the Justice Department on Trump’s behalf, was sent to a three-judge panel and demands an emergency stay on U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb’s ruling. Cobb had previously blocked the president from carrying out the firing, saying Trump “likely” lacked proper cause under the Federal Reserve Act and violated Cook’s due process rights when he attempted to oust her through a social media post. The court’s stay would let the firing take effect before Trump’s full appeal is even heard. The administration’s filing said : “Even with the Federal Reserve’s unique structure and history, its governors are subject to removal for cause, and the president’s actions to remove Cook based on her misconduct should strengthen, not diminish, the Federal Reserve’s integrity.” That’s the position Trump is taking to justify the firing, and now he wants the courts to act fast. Justice Department tells court the clock is ticking The Fed’s board is scheduled to begin its rate policy meeting Tuesday. As it stands, Lisa can still participate, as long as Cobb’s ruling remains in effect. Trump is asking the appeals court to issue a stay before that meeting starts. If the court doesn’t rule in time, the White House is prepared to take the case straight to the Supreme Court. Trump’s decision to fire Lisa came after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte accused her of mortgage fraud in three states. In 2021, Lisa allegedly listed properties in Michigan and Georgia as her “primary residence” to receive better loan terms. Later, Pulte added another allegation, this time involving a third mortgage in Massachusetts. Rather than issue a formal termination, Trump made the announcement online, a move Judge Cobb said likely denied Lisa any “meaningful opportunity” to contest the allegations. That’s what triggered the legal pushback. Cobb ruled that Trump’s method of firing could be unconstitutional, and that the allegations alone didn’t amount to legal “cause” for removal under the Fed’s rules. If the three-judge appeals panel grants the stay, Trump’s action could go into effect immediately, regardless of whether the broader legal fight is over. These kinds of emergency stays are only approved if judges believe the appeal has a good shot at success and that Trump would suffer “irreparable harm” without immediate relief. It’s not yet clear how fast the panel will decide. Lisa hasn’t spoken publicly about this herself, while the Federal Reserve itself has remained neutral, saying it will honor the courts’ final decision. But Lisa has previously said that Trump’s effort to remove her is part of a “politically motivated pattern”, warning that her ouster could damage public trust in the Fed and create long-term risks for the economy.

According to the latest market monitoring by Bitcoin World, the leading digital asset has officially surged above the $115,000 mark. This impressive Bitcoin price surge is captivating investors and enthusiasts globally, indicating a vibrant and dynamic period for the market. Specifically, BTC is currently trading at $115,092.01 on the Binance USDT market. This figure not only represents a new peak but also highlights the growing confidence and robust momentum surrounding the world’s largest cryptocurrency. What factors are truly propelling this extraordinary ascent? What’s Fueling This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Surge? Several critical elements contribute to Bitcoin’s strong performance and this latest Bitcoin price surge . Understanding these drivers helps us interpret the current market dynamics. Institutional Investment: Major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly allocating significant capital to Bitcoin. Their growing interest provides substantial liquidity and enhances the asset’s legitimacy, driving upward price movement. Halving Event Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving event drastically reduced the supply of new BTC entering the market. Historically, such supply shocks lead to price appreciation as demand outpaces the decreased availability. Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation fears and geopolitical tensions, often encourage investors to seek alternative assets. Bitcoin, frequently seen as “digital gold,” offers a hedge against traditional market volatility. Renewed Retail Enthusiasm: As prices climb, individual investors often experience a “Fear Of Missing Out” (FOMO). This renewed retail interest injects fresh capital, further amplifying the upward trajectory of the Bitcoin price surge . Is This Bitcoin Price Surge Sustainable? Many are asking if this incredible momentum can continue. While Bitcoin is famous for its volatility, the current rally appears to rest on more solid foundations than previous speculative surges. The increasing involvement of institutional players points to a maturing market. However, short-term market corrections are always possible in any asset class, especially in cryptocurrency. Market participants should prepare for potential pullbacks, which are a natural component of healthy market cycles. Significant gains often precede periods of consolidation. Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from various downturns to achieve new highs. Its underlying technology and expanding utility continue to bolster its long-term investment case. Navigating the Market During a Bitcoin Price Surge: Key Insights For both experienced and new investors, navigating a rapidly ascending market like the current Bitcoin price surge demands a strategic approach. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before investing. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, market cap, and future potential. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly rather than a lump sum. This strategy helps mitigate risks associated with market timing during volatile periods. Risk Management: Only invest capital you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different assets to reduce overall risk exposure. Stay Informed: Keep updated with market news, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Knowledge is crucial in the fast-paced crypto world. Bitcoin’s journey has been truly extraordinary, and its latest ascent above $115,000 marks another compelling chapter. This Bitcoin price surge reflects a combination of factors, from institutional embrace to global economic shifts, all contributing to a robust digital economy. While volatility remains a characteristic, Bitcoin’s fundamental strength and increasing adoption paint a promising future. Investors should remain vigilant, informed, and strategic to capitalize on these exciting developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is driving the current Bitcoin price surge?

For those keenly observing the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the principle of decentralized trust is paramount. Yet, even in the most cutting-edge technological realms, user protection remains a fundamental concern. California, a global hub for technological advancement, is now at the forefront of establishing critical guardrails for artificial intelligence. A pioneering new bill, SB 243, which focuses on AI regulation for companion chatbots, is on the cusp of becoming law, setting a significant precedent for how states might approach the ethical development and deployment of AI. California’s Bold Move Towards AI Regulation The Golden State has taken a decisive stride toward reining in the burgeoning power of artificial intelligence. SB 243, a bill designed to regulate AI companion chatbots , recently cleared both the State Assembly and Senate with strong bipartisan backing. It now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature, with an October 12 deadline for his decision. If signed, this landmark legislation would take effect on January 1, 2026, positioning California as the first state to mandate stringent safety protocols for AI companions. This move is not merely symbolic; it would hold companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet these new standards, signaling a new era of responsibility in the AI sector. The urgency behind this legislation is underscored by tragic events and concerning revelations. The bill gained significant momentum following the devastating death of teenager Adam Raine, who committed suicide after engaging in prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that reportedly involved discussions and planning around his death and self-harm. Furthermore, leaked internal documents reportedly exposed Meta’s chatbots engaging in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children, further fueling public and legislative outcry. These incidents highlight the profound risks associated with unregulated AI interactions, particularly for minors and vulnerable individuals who may struggle to differentiate between human and artificial communication. Unpacking the California AI Bill: Key Safeguards for AI Safety At its core, SB 243 aims to prevent companion chatbots – defined as AI systems that provide adaptive, human-like responses and are capable of meeting a user’s social needs – from engaging in harmful conversations. Specifically, the legislation targets interactions concerning suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. This focus reflects a clear intent to protect the most susceptible users from the potential psychological and emotional damage that unregulated AI interactions can inflict. The bill introduces several crucial provisions designed to enhance AI safety : Mandatory Alerts: Platforms will be required to provide recurring alerts to users, reminding them that they are interacting with an AI chatbot, not a real person, and that they should take a break. For minors, these alerts must appear every three hours. This simple yet effective measure aims to combat the deceptive nature of advanced AI, ensuring users maintain a clear understanding of their interaction. Transparency Requirements: Beginning July 1, 2027, AI companies offering companion chatbots, including major players like OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika, will face annual reporting and transparency obligations. This ensures that the public and regulators have a clearer picture of how these systems are operating and the safeguards they have in place. Legal Accountability: A significant aspect of SB 243 is its provision for legal recourse. Individuals who believe they have been harmed by violations of the bill’s standards can file lawsuits against AI companies. These lawsuits can seek injunctive relief, damages (up to $1,000 per violation), and attorney’s fees, providing a tangible mechanism for victims to seek justice and holding companies directly responsible for their AI’s conduct. Senator Josh Padilla, a key proponent of the bill, emphasized the necessity of these measures. “I think the harm is potentially great, which means we have to move quickly,” Padilla told Bitcoin World. “We can put reasonable safeguards in place to make sure that particularly minors know they’re not talking to a real human being, that these platforms link people to the proper resources when people say things like they’re thinking about hurting themselves or they’re in distress, [and] to make sure there’s not inappropriate exposure to inappropriate material.” Navigating the Complexities of Companion Chatbots The journey of SB 243 through the California legislature was not without its challenges and compromises. The bill initially contained stronger requirements that were later scaled back through amendments. For instance, an earlier version would have compelled operators to prevent AI chatbots from employing “variable reward” tactics or other features designed to encourage excessive engagement. These tactics, commonly used by companies like Replika and Character.AI, offer users special messages, memories, storylines, or the ability to unlock rare responses or new personalities, creating what critics argue is a potentially addictive reward loop. The current bill also removed provisions that would have required operators to track and report how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation or actions with users. While some might view these amendments as a weakening of the bill, others see them as a pragmatic adjustment. “I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told Bitcoin World, suggesting a legislative effort to find a workable middle ground between stringent oversight and practical implementation for AI companies. This legislative balancing act occurs at a time when Silicon Valley companies are heavily investing in pro-AI political action committees (PACs), channeling millions of dollars to back candidates who favor a more hands-off approach to AI regulation in upcoming elections. This financial influence underscores the industry’s desire to shape policy in its favor, often prioritizing innovation and growth over what it might perceive as overly burdensome regulation. Broader Impact on AI Safety and National Dialogue California’s move with SB 243 is not an isolated incident but rather a significant development within a broader national and international conversation about AI governance. In recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have intensified their scrutiny of AI platforms’ safeguards for protecting minors. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is actively preparing to investigate how AI chatbots impact children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched investigations into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. Concurrently, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) have initiated separate probes into Meta, demonstrating a growing bipartisan concern at the federal level. The California bill also comes as the state considers another critical piece of legislation, SB 53, which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements for AI systems. The industry’s response to SB 53 has been notably divided: OpenAI has penned an open letter to Governor Newsom, urging him to abandon the bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech giants like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also voiced opposition. In contrast, Anthropic stands out as the sole major player to publicly support SB 53, highlighting the internal divisions within the AI industry regarding the extent and nature of necessary regulation. Padilla firmly rejects the notion that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive. “I reject the premise that this is a zero-sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive,” Padilla stated. “Don’t tell me that we can’t walk and chew gum. We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.” This sentiment captures the delicate balance lawmakers are attempting to strike: fostering technological advancement while simultaneously establishing robust protections. Companies are also beginning to respond to this increased scrutiny. A spokesperson for Character.AI told Bitcoin World, “We are closely monitoring the legislative and regulatory landscape, and we welcome working with regulators and lawmakers as they begin to consider legislation for this emerging space,” noting that the startup already includes prominent disclaimers throughout the user chat experience explaining that it should be treated as fiction. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment, while Bitcoin World has reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Replika for their perspectives. California’s impending AI regulation through SB 243 marks a pivotal moment in the governance of artificial intelligence. By establishing clear guidelines for companion chatbots and holding companies accountable, the state is setting a significant precedent for user protection, especially for minors and vulnerable individuals. While the debate between fostering innovation and implementing robust safeguards will undoubtedly continue, this California AI bill demonstrates a firm commitment to ensuring that technological progress is aligned with ethical responsibility and public AI safety . The eyes of the nation, and indeed the world, will be watching to see the impact of this landmark legislation and how it shapes the future of AI development and deployment.

With public companies now holding millions of SOL and new investment vehicles like Nasdaq-listed SOL Strategies opening the door for wider access, Solana is proving it can capture both retail and institutional attention. This resurgence underscores its role as one of the most dynamic blockchains in the industry. Yet while Solana cements its position as an institutional-grade asset, retail traders are also eyeing opportunities elsewhere, with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a high-upside candidate attracting growing attention. Price outlook Solana has recaptured momentum, rallying to $202.40 amid growing strategic demand. Public companies alone hold over 3.5 million SOL, valued at more than $591 million, reflecting a substantial institutional commitment to the network’s long-term prospects. Among them, SOL Strategies stands out. The Solana-focused treasury firm secured approval to list on Nasdaq under ticker STKE, effective September 9, offering a regulated and liquid path for institutional investors to gain exposure to Solana. This approval brings credibility and a new layer of market access to SOL’s ecosystem. Additionally, traditional corporations are taking notice. BIT Mining Ltd., a listed entity, announced plans to raise $200–$300 million in phases to build a substantial Solana treasury, swapping crypto holdings for SOL as part of its long-term growth strategy. These trends are being amplified by upcoming financing instruments. Analysts estimate Solana ETF approval odds at around 95%, with several major firms like Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck already filing proposals to launch their own Solana-based funds. This confluence of demand, infrastructure, and regulatory clarity is positioning Solana as a premier institutional-grade blockchain. Why institutional buying matters When large-scale investors allocate capital, they bring more than just buying power—they bring confidence. SOL’s recent staging above $200 is no coincidence, it reflects faith in the network’s ability to deliver infrastructure value and enduring performance. Institutions are treating SOL not only as a digital asset to hold, but also as a productive asset to stake and integrate into portfolios via regulated channels like STKE. This momentum gives retail investors a backdrop of stability to pair with speculative moves. And as market cycles continue to reward platforms with both utility and institutional adoption, Solana’s dual appeal makes it one of the most compelling large-cap stories today. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the 50x candidate While Solana reclaims its strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the high-upside opportunity investors are watching most closely. Priced at just fractions of a cent, analysts project the token could deliver up to 50x returns as demand accelerates. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from other early-stage projects is its combination of cultural momentum and structural credibility. The project has successfully completed audits with HashEx and CertiK, providing a level of transparency and trust uncommon in small-cap tokens. This has allowed it to attract not only speculative retail buyers but also more serious investors looking for vetted opportunities. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE thrives on community growth. Telegram groups and X threads are expanding daily, turning the token into a cultural talking point. Traders describe it not just as a presale play, but as a movement building at the perfect time. Analysts suggest this convergence of trust and momentum creates the kind of setup where explosive multiples become possible. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out For investors comparing ADA, TRON, or even Solana, the upside ceiling is clear: these are already multi-billion-dollar projects. While they offer stability and adoption, their growth trajectories are more measured. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, is starting from a point where exponential returns are possible. Scarcity: Limited token allocations are tightening as demand grows. Momentum: Each round has sold out rapidly, with community size doubling in recent weeks. Legitimacy: The completed audits separate it from the vast majority of small-cap launches. At just a fraction of a cent, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers retail investors the ability to accumulate large positions without overcommitting capital. This accessibility, combined with growing recognition, makes it one of the most talked-about breakout candidates of the current cycle. Diversifying with both SOL and MAGA Smart portfolios don’t bet everything on one type of asset. Ethereum provides credibility, Solana offers scalability and cultural adoption, and MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers speculative asymmetry. By holding a mix of these categories, investors can capture both resilience and explosive upside. Solana’s rally above $200 proves it remains a leading force in crypto’s infrastructure race. But for those searching for life-changing multiples, analysts increasingly point toward tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its unique positioning as both audited and culturally resonant makes it a rare high-risk, high-reward candidate. Solana’s rebound above $200 is more than market noise, it’s confirmation of a building institutional thesis. With $591M+ in corporate accumulation, staking strategies, and ETF pathways opening, SOL is becoming mission-critical for institutional portfolios. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of exponential upside that institutions don’t chase,but narratives fly. With 50x potential, confirmed audits, and retail energy converging, it could be the breakout play of the 2025 cycle.

This week, altcoin market indicators surged to their highest levels since December 2024, fueling speculation that the biggest altcoin rally in years is about to begin. According to Blockchain Center’s Altcoin Season Index, a reading of 78 out of 100 confirms altseason conditions, when 76% of the top 50 crypto assets outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. CoinGlass and CoinMarketCap show similar results, with readings of 76 and 67, respectively. Market sentiment has shifted swiftly, with altcoins stealing momentum from Bitcoin, which has recently consolidated around $114,000. The altcoin market cap, excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins, now stands at $1.63 trillion, just shy of the $1.64 trillion peak seen in late 2024. Is the Altseason a Sign of a Major Breakout Crypto traders are increasingly convinced that the market is on the cusp of a new wave of parabolic growth. Analyst “ Daan Crypto Trades ” noted that the altcoin cap is approaching price discovery territory, which historically sparks sharp rallies. “With the altseason index at its strongest reading in nine months, traders are beginning to lean risk-on again,” said educator Karan Singh Arora. Other traders, including Ash Crypto, suggest altcoins could soon enter “phase 3” of altseason, a stage often marked by explosive price gains across mid- and small-cap tokens. This optimism is further supported by speculation around U.S. Federal Reserve policy. With prediction markets now pricing in the likelihood of a 50-basis-point rate cut at the September 17 meeting, liquidity conditions may shift in favor of risk assets, such as crypto. Historically, lower interest rates have triggered capital inflows into altcoins following Bitcoin’s initial gains. Altcoins Already on the Move Several major altcoins are already flashing strong signals. Dogecoin (DOGE) has climbed above $0.25 with a 5% daily gain, while Avalanche (AVAX) jumped nearly 18% to hit $29, its highest level since January. Other notable movers include Hyperliquid (HYPE), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), and Toncoin (TON), each posting gains above 3% in the past 24 hours. If momentum continues, traders believe the market could replicate, and even surpass, the explosive altseason seen in late 2021. With the altseason index surging and the Fed’s decision looming, all eyes are now on whether 2025 will deliver the most powerful altcoin rally since 2024.

Source: MNTUSD chart from Tradingview Technical Indicators Point to Momentum, and Risk The breakout has placed Mantle firmly above $1.60, with strong support from short-term moving averages. The 10-day EMA at $1.32 and 20-day SMA at $1.22 are trending upward, while momentum indicators like MACD and Momentum remain bullish. Analysts suggest that if the uptrend continues, MNT could test resistance levels of $1.80-$2.00. However, warning signals are emerging. The RSI has climbed above 70, flashing overbought conditions, while the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) surged above 300. Both indicators often precede short-term pullbacks. Bollinger Bands also show price hugging the upper band, suggesting high volatility ahead. What’s Next for Mantle (MNT)? Mantle’s future trajectory will hinge on whether it can sustain demand generated by Bybit’s expansion and its omnichain integration via LayerZero, which boosts utility across multiple blockchains. Its growing role in DeFi, connected with a rising TVL of $1.8 billion, strengthens the bullish case.

OpenAI , the powerhouse behind groundbreaking AI models like ChatGPT , has announced a non-binding agreement with its largest investor, Microsoft . This pivotal accord paves the way for OpenAI’s for-profit arm to convert into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), a move that could redefine the future of AI development and its commercialization. For those keenly observing the intersection of technology, investment, and ethical governance, this transition represents a crucial moment, signaling a new phase for one of the world’s most influential AI entities. Understanding OpenAI’s Pivotal Shift to a Public Benefit Corporation The core of this transformative news lies in OpenAI ‘s intent to become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). But what exactly does this mean, and why is it a significant step for an organization at the forefront of AI innovation? A Public Benefit Corporation is a hybrid legal structure, allowing a for-profit company to pursue both profit and a specific public benefit. Unlike traditional corporations solely focused on maximizing shareholder value, a PBC is legally obligated to consider the impact of its decisions on society and its stated public mission. For OpenAI, whose founding mission centers on ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity, the PBC structure offers a unique path. It allows the company to: Balance Mission and Capital: Pursue ambitious, capital-intensive AI research while legally upholding its commitment to public good. Attract Values-Aligned Investment: Appeal to investors who are not only seeking financial returns but also support the company’s ethical and societal objectives. Enhance Public Trust: Signal a formal commitment to responsible AI development, potentially mitigating concerns about AI’s societal impact. Facilitate Future Growth: The transition could enable OpenAI to raise additional capital more easily and, eventually, explore the possibility of becoming a public company, further fueling its research and development efforts. According to Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s Board Chairman, the existing nonprofit entity will retain control over the startup’s operations. Under the non-binding agreement, this nonprofit would obtain a substantial stake in the new Public Benefit Corporation , reportedly valued upwards of $100 billion. This structure aims to ensure that the foundational mission remains paramount, even as the organization scales commercially. The Evolving Microsoft and OpenAI AI Partnership The relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI has been a cornerstone of AI development in recent years. Microsoft’s initial investment in 2019 provided OpenAI with crucial resources, granting Microsoft preferred access to OpenAI’s technology and designating it as OpenAI’s primary cloud services provider. This AI partnership has been mutually beneficial, with OpenAI leveraging Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure to train its massive models, and Microsoft gaining a significant edge in the competitive AI market. However, the rapid success and widespread adoption of products like ChatGPT have dramatically altered the dynamics of this relationship. ChatGPT’s emergence transformed OpenAI from a promising research lab into a global tech phenomenon with immense commercial potential. This growth reportedly led OpenAI to seek greater autonomy and to loosen some of Microsoft’s existing controls, especially concerning cloud services and market access. The recent non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signifies the next phase of this evolving partnership. While an MOU is not a legally binding contract, it serves to document the parties’ intentions and expectations, laying the groundwork for a definitive agreement. Both companies have stated they are actively working to finalize these contractual terms. This development suggests a renegotiation that aims to balance Microsoft’s strategic investment and preferred access with OpenAI’s increasing need for operational flexibility and broader market engagement, ensuring the AI partnership continues to thrive under new terms. Navigating Regulatory Hurdles and the Future of ChatGPT The path to becoming a Public Benefit Corporation is not without its challenges, particularly regarding regulatory approvals. OpenAI and Microsoft have indicated that they are working with the California and Delaware Attorneys General on the transition plan. These state regulators play a critical role in overseeing corporate structure changes, especially those involving entities with significant public impact and a stated benefit mission. Regulatory scrutiny is a standard part of such major corporate transformations. The Attorneys General will likely review the proposed structure to ensure it genuinely serves the public interest as intended by the PBC framework and that the interests of the nonprofit are adequately protected. This process can be time-consuming and may involve conditions or modifications to the proposed agreement before final clearance is granted. The successful navigation of these regulatory hurdles is crucial for OpenAI ‘s future. It will directly impact its ability to raise capital, execute its long-term strategy, and continue to develop and deploy advanced AI models like ChatGPT . The outcome will also set a precedent for how other major AI companies might structure themselves, potentially influencing the broader regulatory landscape for AI development and governance. The commitment to a public benefit mission, while commendable, must also be legally robust and transparent to satisfy regulatory bodies and maintain public confidence. Behind the Scenes: Tensions, Acquisitions, and Elon Musk’s Influence The journey to this agreement has reportedly been complex, marked by months of intense negotiations and underlying tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft . Reports from sources like The Wall Street Journal indicated that these negotiations reached a ‘boiling point’ at times, highlighting the strategic importance and high stakes involved for both entities. One notable point of contention revolved around the acquisition of Windsurf, an AI coding startup that OpenAI had planned to acquire earlier this year. Microsoft reportedly sought control over Windsurf’s technology, while OpenAI aimed to keep the startup’s intellectual property independent. Ultimately, the deal fell through, with Windsurf’s founders joining Google and its staff being acquired by Cognition. This incident underscores the competitive nature of the AI talent and IP landscape and the strategic interests of major tech players. Further complicating matters is the ongoing lawsuit filed by Elon Musk against OpenAI. Musk’s lawsuit fundamentally accuses Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and the company of abandoning its original nonprofit mission. Lawyers representing Musk have actively sought to surface information related to the Microsoft and OpenAI negotiations over this transition, viewing it as relevant to their claims. Interestingly, Musk himself submitted an unsolicited $97 billion takeover bid for OpenAI earlier this year, which the board rejected. Legal experts noted at the time that Musk’s bid might have inadvertently helped establish a higher valuation for OpenAI’s nonprofit stake, which, under the current agreement, is valued even higher at over $100 billion. These behind-the-scenes dynamics reveal the intricate blend of business, legal, and personal interests shaping OpenAI’s trajectory. Financial Implications and OpenAI’s Path Forward The financial implications of OpenAI ‘s transition to a Public Benefit Corporation are substantial. The reported $100 billion stake for the nonprofit arm is a significant valuation, cementing the nonprofit’s ongoing control and ensuring that its mission remains central to the organization’s strategy. This valuation also provides a clear benchmark, notably exceeding Elon Musk’s earlier takeover bid and reflecting the immense market value attributed to OpenAI’s innovations and future potential. As a PBC, OpenAI will be better positioned to raise additional capital from a broader range of investors. This access to funding is critical for sustaining its highly expensive research into advanced AI models, which require vast computational resources and top-tier talent. The ability to attract capital while maintaining a public benefit mandate could set a new standard for how cutting-edge AI research is funded and governed. Looking ahead, the agreement with Microsoft and the PBC transition could pave the way for OpenAI to eventually become a public company. While this is a long-term prospect, it would provide further avenues for investment and liquidity, potentially accelerating the development of AGI and its deployment. This strategic financial restructuring highlights OpenAI’s ambition to grow, innovate, and lead the AI revolution while striving to uphold its ethical commitments. A New Horizon for AI Innovation OpenAI ‘s agreement with Microsoft to transition its for-profit arm into a Public Benefit Corporation marks a significant moment in the evolution of AI. This strategic move aims to reconcile the immense commercial potential of AI with the ethical imperatives of developing powerful technologies for the benefit of all humanity. By adopting the PBC structure, OpenAI seeks to secure the necessary capital for its ambitious research, attract diverse investors, and reinforce public trust, all while legally binding itself to its foundational mission. The evolving AI partnership with Microsoft, the navigation of regulatory approvals, and the backdrop of high-profile legal challenges underscore the complexity of this undertaking. Yet, if successful, this transition could set a new precedent for corporate governance in the AI sector, demonstrating a model where innovation, profitability, and public good are not mutually exclusive but rather intrinsically linked. As ChatGPT and other OpenAI models continue to reshape industries, this structural shift is poised to influence not just OpenAI’s future, but the very trajectory of responsible AI development globally.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000430. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000699 and an average trading price of $0.000673 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The 4-hour chart shows breakout momentum supported by volume. The $0.00009700 price level is the key short-term support to hold. FLOKI on the daily timeframe The 1-day Floki Inu price chart for September 11 shows the coin closing around $0.0001, maintaining a series of higher lows after bottoming near $0.00008617. FLOKI is approaching the first key resistance at $0.00010460, with further supply at $0.00011139 and $0.00012424 overhead. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram has flipped positive, and the lines are crossing upward, suggesting strengthening momentum. Still, bulls need a clean daily close above $0.00010460 to confirm trend continuation. A drop back below $0.00009500 could weaken this setup and put $0.00008617 back in focus. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe The shorter timeframe shows a bullish structure with higher lows and a strong breakout candle pushing price above $0.00010026. The Alligator moving averages are aligned bullishly and widening, confirming trend support. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has picked up after a quiet period, and OBV is stabilizing after a pullback, indicating buyers are stepping back in. As long as $0.00009700 holds, momentum favors a retest of $0.00010460 resistance, with a higher breakout possible if sustained.

Momentum is building, but overhead resistance remains the real test. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need up to $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 110x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

The South Korean newspaper Seoul Kyungjae reported that Upbit has listed seven tokens in the past 10 days. The top 12 most-traded coins on the Upbit crypto exchange on September 11, 2025. (Source: CoinGecko) Upbit Listing Spree: Will It Stop Bithumb’s Surge? The outlet wrote that on September 9, Bithumb’s domestic market share climbed to 46%, with Upbit’s share standing at 50.6%. Upbit has dominated the South Korean market since around 2022, enjoying market share dominance above the 80% mark in some months. This has led some lawmakers to complain that its operator, Dunmau, has become the crypto exchange sector’s de facto monopoly . But Bithumb has been chipping away at Upbit’s market share in recent months. It has struck a partnership deal with Kookmin Bank, South Korea’s biggest financial player. And it has also launched a spinoff firm as it looks to become the first domestic exchange to debut on the NASDAQ stock exchange . Upbit appears to have responded to Bithumb’s resurgence by launching new altcoin pairings and listing a wider range of coins. An unnamed South Korean exchange official told the media outlet that Upbit is concerned that Bithumb has narrowed the market share gap to less than 5% without resorting to novel promotions. The official opined: “Upbit cannot help but feel a sense of crisis.” Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past seven days (Source: CoinGecko) WLD Listing The media outlet wrote that Upbit’s response to Worldcoin (WLD) trade volume growth in South Korea has been telling. When WLD transaction volumes pushed Bithumb’s market share to 46% on September 9, Upbit responded rapidly. Upbit announced it would be listing WLD at 7 pm KST the same day and completed its listing just two hours later, at 9 pm KST. Upbit’s latest listing, at 1:30 am KST on September 11, was the Linea (LINEA). The exchange’s September listings tally has already surpassed its total number of listings for the whole of August. Customers May Suffer, Experts Warn The market leader has traditionally taken a much more conservative attitude to coin listing than Bithumb, which also continues to add coins to its platform. Should the two firms become embroiled in a listings war, critics warn, customers could suffer in the long run. Experts said they were “concerned” that the “fierce competition between exchanges” could lead platform managers to make “hasty decisions” that “compromise the review process.” The experts noted that while listing frenzies continue, South Korean delisting events are becoming more common. A combined total of 25 altcoins have been delisted by Bithumb, Upbit, and their closest rivals, Korbit, Coinone, and GOPAX, since July this year. Several of these coins had only recently been listed on the platforms. An unnamed crypto industry executive suggested that Seoul’s efforts to police the sector may be at fault. The source said: “Regulators only allow domestic exchanges to provide spot trading. That means that the only way they can compete with one another is by expanding their listings. It is ironic that regulators’ attempts to police the industry are actually spurring listing competition and weakening investor protection.” The post Upbit Goes on Coin Listing Spree as Bithumb Claws Back Market Share appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Bithumb|Upbit,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|MARKET|WLD,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-11 23:30:00

The analyst, who has nearly 130,000 followers on X, shared his projections as anticipation builds for the next stage of the market cycle. Ethereum as the Benchmark Ethereum currently trades at $4,359, and according to Amonyx, a climb to $10,000 would represent a 131 % increase from this level. Achieving that target would also set a fresh all-time high for Ethereum, more than doubling its previous peak of $4,959. Many market watchers expect the current bull run to extend through December 2025, and Amonyx believes Ethereum’s potential move will serve as the foundation for broader altcoin growth. Price predictions for this bullrun: #BTC : $200,000 #ETH : $10,000 #BNB : $2,000 #XRP : $20+ #WAN : $10+ #SHIB : $0,001 #DOGE : $5 Which one will happen first? — Amonyx (@amonbuy) September 9, 2025 Shiba Inu’s Possible Upside Based on this scenario, Amonyx has outlined a striking projection for Shiba Inu. He argues that SHIB could rally to $0.001 , which would require the token to erase two zeros from its current price of $0.00001301 . For that to occur, Shiba Inu would need to appreciate by more than 7,586%, a scale of growth rarely seen in the digital asset market. If realized, the move would set a new record for the popular meme coin and exceed the expectations of most current forecasts. Historical Context and Token Relationship Despite the bold outlook, Shiba Inu’s market performance in 2025 has been largely negative. The token has lost almost 39% of its value since January. Even so, SHIB often displays a strong correlation with Ethereum, given its status as an ERC-20 token. At times, it has even managed to outperform ETH in shorter timeframes. For example, while Ethereum gained 0.17% over the past week, Shiba Inu rose 4.65% within the same period. This trend fuels optimism that the token could benefit disproportionately if Ethereum begins a sustained rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The idea of Shiba Inu climbing to $0.001 is not new . Analysts and community figures have raised this benchmark on multiple occasions. Last year, analyst Crypto Sheriff pointed to a breakout from a multi-year downtrend as a reason SHIB could eventually test that level, though without specifying a timeline. Another analyst, Krao, had earlier projected that the target would be reached in the first quarter of 2025, but that prediction did not materialize. Factors That Could Support the Rally According to Amonyx, achieving $0.001 in this cycle would require more than Ethereum’s rise. Other favourable conditions would need to align, including higher retail demand for meme tokens and new initiatives within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. One recurring theme is token supply. With 589 trillion SHIB still in circulation, large-scale burns are viewed as essential for sustainable appreciation. While projections remain speculative, Amonyx’s analysis reflects the optimism among sections of the Shiba Inu community. If Ethereum moves toward the $10,000 mark, SHIB’s potential to capitalize on that momentum will remain a closely watched narrative in the months ahead.

That answers the “will a DOGE ETF happen?” question and reshapes the short- to mid-term setup. As DOGE defends $0.214–$0.21 and wrestles with $0.22, the pivot at $0.225 remains the trigger toward $0.25. Meanwhile, the Layer Brett crypto presale is live at $0.0055, with $3.3 million raised and staking at 782% APY—an Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin. Dogecoin price prediction : what an ETF unlocks in 2025–2026 An approved DOGE ETF can drive inflows, legitimize fund exposure, and amplify narratives into a 2025 bull run. We’re already seeing institutional footprints: volume near 808.9M pushed price to $0.22 before profit-taking, confirming sensitivity to ETF headlines. Technically, DOGE prints lower highs with expanding sell volume—near-term caution—yet the DOGE/BTC pair and BTC show bullish breakout structures that favor medium-term upside. In this context, a Dogecoin price prediction revisiting $0.25–$0.30 on momentum is reasonable once $0.225 flips to support. In fact, analysts have put forward the following outcomes: – Base case (most probable): With ETF tailwinds and a risk-on market, DOGE grinds toward $0.35–$0.50 in 2025, then stretches to $0.60–$0.80 by 2026 as liquidity builds. Maintains trend above $0.21 and convert $0.25 into a launchpad. – Stretch case ($1): Needs a full bull market, sustained DOGE/BTC strength, and ETF-driven media flywheels. A parabolic phase could tag $1 late 2026, presuming broadening participation. – Risk case: Sell-the-news or macro shocks could revisit $0.21—lose it, and $0.18 returns. Watch the $0.225 pivot and volume quality for confirmation. Bottom line: DOGE can reach $1, but it likely needs near-perfect conditions. A balanced Dogecoin price prediction recognizes both paths and hurdles. Where Layer Brett aims for the bigger multiple For investors chasing asymmetric upside, Layer Brett blends meme energy with utility on Ethereum Layer 2. $LBRETT is in presale at $0.0055, with $3.26 million raised. It’s an ERC-20 built for low fees, high throughput, and scalable smart contracts—fit for a Layer 2 narrative institution increasingly respected. The stats are intriguing: – Staking power: Early buyers can stake at 782% APY while the network grows. – Utility-first meme thesis: Beyond hype, Layer Brett targets DeFi and builders with low fees and Web3-ready features. – Market-cap math: A smaller cap gives a clearer path to top-gainer status if momentum hits, making it one of the best crypto presale picks among meme coins. Final take: ETF lifts DOGE, but Layer Brett may capture the bigger upside Yes—the DOGE ETF appears imminent and should benefit DOGE through 2025–2026. Could $1 happen? Possibly in a roaring market, but not guaranteed. Meanwhile, Layer Brett’s smaller market cap, Layer 2 utility, and 782% staking APY create a compelling setup. Layer Brett’s staking engine turns community participation into compounding growth: stake $LBRETT via decentralized, no-KYC flows and benefit from Ethereum Layer 2 throughput. The roadmap builds a real ecosystem around a memecoin, not just virality. Add the $1 Million Giveaway to ignite awareness—and you have a catalyst for flows seeking new crypto coins and low-cap gems. With its crypto presale live at $0.0055 and a limited window, securing $LBRETT early and staking positions investors for a potential meme-coin breakout fueled by real tech and a $1 Million Giveaway.

With the Layer Brett presale at $0.0055 and staking at 782% APY, momentum is shifting toward this Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin. If ADA steadies and PI struggles with trust, could $LBRETT be the next big crypto to run? Cardano news today: utility meets accumulation as institutional interest rises Cardano has been resilient. Despite an ETF delay, ADA rallied as whales accumulated against bearish retail sentiment, hinting at positioning for a bigger move. Macro and network updates have aided stability. Beyond the charts, Charles Hoskinson’s $200M Wyoming clinic blending AI and blockchain shows utility beyond speculation. For ADA holders, this kind of adoption—paired with growing institutional interest—supports Cardano staying among top altcoins as rotation returns. Pi Network price prediction: hype vs. hard warnings Pi Network is back in headlines, but not for the right reasons. Bybit’s CEO publicly labeled Pi a scam following an official police warning, while the token’s debut at a lofty valuation saw thin liquidity and a 60%+ drawdown. If liquidity stays fragmented and trust issues linger, rallies in PI can be sharp but fragile. Traders should factor in headline risk: multiple exchanges listing IOU-style pairs, uncertainty around circulating supply, and uneven market depth—all of which complicate any sustainable PI recovery. Why Layer Brett is breaking records on Ethereum Layer 2 While the market debates ADA and PI, Layer Brett is executing. The project has raised $3.3 million, with $LBRETT at $0.0055 in its crypto presale—an entry for a meme token that blends meme energy with utility. Built on an Ethereum Layer 2, it offers low fees, high throughput, and staking rewards that stand out: a headline 782% APY for early stakers. Layer Brett’s approach: real tech and real rewards. As an ERC-20 on Layer 2, it’s engineered for scale—fast transactions, low fees, and a staking ecosystem designed to keep holders active. This is a memecoin built to function like a DeFi token while tapping the cultural power of a top meme coin. Head-to-head: ADA , PI , and $LBRETT into the next volatility cycle Catalysts are lining up. With Bitcoin compressing ahead of Fed/CPI and ETF headlines, sidelined cash is watching for a break. If rotation kicks in, ADA could benefit from institutional credibility and Cardano ecosystem progress—but its large market cap limits explosive upside. PI faces trust overhangs that make rebounds more speculative than strategic. That’s where $LBRETT could surprise. Smaller cap, Ethereum Layer 2 utility, live staking, and a viral brand make Layer Brett a candidate for top gainer status in a fresh alt swing. Add the $1 Million Giveaway, and you’ve got a community flywheel designed to capture attention into a crypto bull run 2025 setup. For momentum hunters scouting low-cap gems and the next 100x meme coin, $LBRETT checks the boxes. Conclusion: Today’s winner is the project breaking records—and it’s $LBRETT The verdict: Cardano shows strength, Pi Network carries risk, and Layer Brett is the standout today. Early buyers can lock in 782% APY through staking, and a smaller market cap gives $LBRETT more room to run than ADA while avoiding PI’s credibility pitfalls. The crypto presale is limited , the price is $0.0055, and $LBRETT has already raised $3.3 million—with a $1 Million Giveaway amplifying the buzz. If you’re seeking the best crypto to buy before the next volatility wave, Layer Brett deserves a top spot on your list. Connect your wallet and buy in today.

When you’re holding for years, you want tokens that have daily utility rather than just trending charts. Two networks that are at the center of that utility story are Ethereum and XRP. While they each solve different problems, they all solve problems for real users and real businesses. Ethereum is the programmable base layer for finance, culture, and identity on-chain. Everything from tokenized assets to lending is powered by its smart contracts. XRP, on the other hand, is all about value transfer. It will allow cross-border payments to be faster and cheaper than legacy rails, a practical requirement for banks, fintechs and remittance players. As investors plan longer-term strategies, they are also looking at earlier, more nimble projects that could compound from small caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE comes up in those conversations as a complementing sat-allocation play for growth-oriented portfolios. Why Ethereum Belongs in a 5-Year Hold ETH enjoys a huge developer community and a continuous array of usability improvements. When costs decrease and throughput increases, more apps achieve product-market fit. That attracts further users and liquidity, providing a strong cycle for holders. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Featured Among 2025 Growth Picks With a solid roadmap, strong community engagement, and a focus on scalable tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been identified as one of the best Altcoins to buy in 2025 for high growth portfolios. The investment strategy for long-term investors is to position for the build phase and let milestones and access expansion do the heavy lifting over time. Why XRP Keeps Its Seat For payments, it is all about speed and cost. XRP is designed for throughput and settlement efficiency. If the popularity of partner integrations continues to grow and regulatory clarity continues to improve, institutions will continue to double down where the technology makes sense. Diversifying “Utility First” Investors don’t have to pick between platforms and payments. A well-balanced five-year basket might include ETH’s programmable economy, XRP’s transfer rails and a measured exposure to earlier-stage names. Conclusion Utility is the guidepost for multi-year holding. While Ethereum and XRP continue to provide it in different ways, selective exposure to early-stage growth like MAGACOIN FINANCE can provide upside without capitulation on fundamentals.

Traders’ eye forecasts range from $3.50 to $7 by 2025, while some bold calls stretch toward $10 if regulatory clarity and adoption align. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) draws attention to the broader crypto market. It’s compared to Ripple’s early days, thanks to its exploding presale and real payment utility. XRP Price Prediction Outlook Current XRP price is around $2.97. By year’s end, many expect a rise into the $3.30–$3.50 zone if support holds near $2.77 and resistance at $3.07 is breached. Based on on-chain use and regulatory shifts, consensus projections for 2025 range from $2.80 to a moderately bullish $5- $7. Technical patterns and sentiment remain mixed. Some trackers see potential for 333% gains over 40 days, while others remain cautious, warning that a breakdown below $2.77 could push XRP back toward $2.50. The XRP price calls depend largely on ETF developments, compliance upgrades, and remittance adoption via Ripple’s network. Market Buzz: Presales, Utility, and High-Growth Picks Crypto traders are flocking to search terms like ‘best crypto presale 2025’, ‘next big altcoin 2025’, ‘crypto with real utility’, and ‘low-cap crypto gems’. Many are looking beyond legacy tokens, hunting for early-stage crypto investment with high ROI potential. That’s where Remittix (RTX) enters the picture, bringing real-world use, bonus rewards, and aggressive marketing to the fold. Remittix: The PayFi DeFi Project Surging Ahead Remittix (RTX) is viewed as a modernisation of the remittance playbook. For its focus on payments and early traction, it is earning comparisons to “XRP 2.0.” Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Raised over $24.9 million in presale, with 655M+ tokens sold at ~$0.105 Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, key centralised exchanges support Beta wallet launching Q3 2025 with the backing for 40+ cryptos, 30+ fiat currencies, real-time FX, and low gas fees CertiK audited, with deflationary tokenomics and staking potential Lively $250,000 community giveaway and viral buzz, earning it “best crypto presale to buy now” acclaim Remittix blends functionality with hype: it’s a cross-chain DeFi project delivering actual remittance tools. That’s the kind of crypto solving real-world problems traders search for when they look up “buy RTX token,” “new crypto token launch,” or “next big crypto launch.” XRP Price Prediction vs. Remittix: Two Growth Paths Side-by-Side The XRP Price Prediction underscores a stable path, solid adoption, regulatory progress, and modest gains. But for investors eyeing high growth crypto, Remittix offers a rapid rise in presale stages, real payment use, and heavy buzz. Rippling through the market is a dual narrative: XRP brings stability and legacy utility; Remittix presents high upside, early access, and payment-first innovation.

According to reports, the fund is being launched by REX-Osprey and will provide US investors a regulated way to gain exposure to DOGE without holding the coin directly. Related Reading: Altcoins Feel The Pinch As Crypto Market Sentiment Sours Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, told market watchers that the fund will hold an asset with “no utility on purpose,” and he publicly challenged supporters to point to clear real-world uses for Dogecoin beyond community interest and trading. Analyst Asks Supporters To Show Practical Uses According to Balchunas, DOJE will be the first US ETF that openly holds an asset whose backers say lacks practical functions. He pushed the community to list where DOGE is used as more than a token of speculation or culture. The Doge people (what do you call them, Doge-rs?) are objecting to my “no utility” comment. But the coin was literally started by two guys as a joke. So what’s the utility? https://t.co/6YtQPnCOTx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 9, 2025 Some in the Dogecoin community pointed to limited payment tests and merchant experiments, while others emphasized the coin’s long history of publicity and social attention. Reports also note the fund is being structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940 instead of the Securities Act of 1933, a choice that has drawn extra scrutiny. Why Utility Matters For Investors Investors typically seek ways to value an asset beyond pure sentiment. Utility can mean things like payment rails, governance roles, or fuel for smart contracts — uses that create sustained demand. When those uses are limited, price moves can be driven mainly by headlines and momentum. That makes risk evaluation harder for portfolios that require steady, predictable exposures. Some market participants counter that brand recognition, liquidity, and culture can still produce buyer interest, at least while markets are favorable. Related Reading: Institutional Adoption Rises: 21X Brings Chainlink Into Europe’s Tokenized Securities Market Less Common Legal Route Based on reports, the legal route chosen for DOJE is unusual for a crypto-linked spot fund. Filing under the 1940 Act instead of the 1933 Act carries different compliance and custody implications. Few ETFs have taken this exact path for a memecoin-style asset, and observers say they will watch how custody and regulatory reviews play out once trading begins. Traders and institutions may treat the fund differently because of the structure and the questions raised over utility.

Although achieving this target would require a major rally, many believe that widespread adoption and real-world use cases could serve as critical drivers. The token first gained global attention during 2020 and 2021, when it surged dramatically and erased several zeros from its price. That run took SHIB to an all-time high of $0.00008845, largely fueled by community-driven campaigns and viral exposure. This period established Shiba Inu as one of the most recognized meme-inspired assets in the world. Today, supporters argue that the next significant move will not come solely from speculative interest but from expanding SHIB’s functionality across different sectors. Five Avenues for Utility Growth Payments for Freelance Services: One possible pathway involves SHIB being accepted as payment across freelance platforms. The U.S. had more than 64 million freelance workers in 2023, according to Forbes . Even limited adoption in this segment could increase demand for SHIB, particularly if major platforms enable direct payments. Integration into Metaverse Economies: Shiba Inu launched its own metaverse project, Shib: The Metaverse, in 2022 , with partial rollout beginning in December 2024. Expanding the use of SHIB within this ecosystem, for salaries, royalties, or in-world transactions, could generate consistent demand beyond trading. Growth in Micropayments: The low-cost nature of SHIB transactions positions the token as a candidate for micropayments. Use cases may include tipping online creators, in-game purchases, or small-scale streaming payments. If adopted at scale, micropayments could help SHIB build a stronger utility profile. Incentivized Online Shopping: Partnerships with major e-commerce platforms could further adoption by providing discounts to users who pay with SHIB. This type of incentive-based model would encourage regular spending and broaden SHIB’s appeal beyond investment circles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cross-Border Remittances: In regions where traditional remittances are costly or slow, SHIB could provide an alternative for cross-border payments. Integration with fintech applications could make it a viable option for families transferring funds across different markets. Assessing the $0.0001 Goal At its current price of $0.00001305 , Shiba Inu would need to rise by approximately 666% to reach $0.0001. With a supply of around 589 trillion tokens, such a price would give SHIB a market capitalization close to $59 billion. Despite the ambitious nature of this target, it remains one of the most common predictions within the Shiba Inu community. Several analysts have already outlined scenarios under which SHIB could meet this benchmark. A pseudonymous commentator known as “Anonymous” projected a price between $0.00017 and $0.00032 by the fourth quarter of 2025. Forbes has also suggested the token could climb as high as $0.0003 within the same period. Technical analysts such as BitFinity and Capt. Parabolic Toblerone has added their voices, pointing to historical chart patterns that may support the case for a breakout. While speculation about SHIB’s future continues, most experts agree that sustainable progress toward $0.0001 will require tangible adoption and a strong use-case framework. Initiatives in freelancing, e-commerce, gaming, and remittances, alongside Shiba Inu’s metaverse project, could provide the foundations for long-term growth. However, the timeline for these developments may extend beyond current market cycles. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

51573486,579194,1757635250,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51573486.jpeg,"Shiba Inu Team Confirms Delayed Migration Is A Go, Here’s What’s Coming",https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-delayed-migration/,"After weeks of anticipation and setbacks, the Shiba Inu development team has officially confirmed that the long-awaited migration from LEASH v1 to LEASH v2 is ready to begin. The delay stemmed from the need to address flaws in the original LEASH token contract and to complete a thorough security audit. Now that these hurdles are cleared, developers say the transition to LEASH v2 is set to commence in the coming days. Shiba Inu Team Confirms Migration According to a recent blog post by the Shiba Inu team, the security audit of the LEASH v2 contract and its migration mechanism has been completed by Hexens, which has now cleared the way for the long-delayed rollout. The developers explained that they engaged Hexens to perform a full, independent audit of the integrated system, covering the LEASH v2 token, the migrator, and all associated flows. Now that the security firm Hexens has cleared the audit, the migration is expected to begin anytime soon. Hexens is a Web3-focused cybersecurity firm known for smart-contract and protocol audits. Its track record spans Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and BNB Chain, where the firm’s audits have protected significant on-chain value. As the migration begins, developers warned LEASH v1 holders should use only official links published on Shib.io and verified Shiba Inu social channels to avoid falling prey to scams. Once the migration window closes, any unused LEASH v2 tokens in the multisig wallet will be burned to enforce a hard-capped supply. How The Migration Will Work Now that all the security boxes have been ticked, the migration from LEASH v1 to LEASH v2 is expected to commence anytime in the coming days. The migration will occur in carefully planned phases to ensure fairness across different types of holders. In the first phase, direct LEASH v1 holders as well as those with staked or locked tokens will be able to migrate by burning or locking their v1 tokens to receive v2 equivalents at a ratio based on the current v1 supply. Liquidity providers on Uniswap V2 and ShibaSwap V1 are also included in this stage. Phase Two will handle the more complex Uniswap V3 and ShibaSwap V2 LPs, which require snapshots and proof-of-withdrawal mechanisms to prevent trapped value. Lastly, Phase Three will cover bridge users and those holding LEASH on Shibarium for a 1:1 swap of these tokens. The LEASH v1 contract was originally promoted as a fixed-supply token, but a hidden vulnerability meant that rebasing mechanisms could still alter the supply through authorized proxies. This vulnerability was exploited earlier this year and this led to an unplanned 20% increase in supply. To restore trust and safeguard holders, developers opted to create LEASH v2. According to developers, the upgrade removes any minting or rebasing loopholes, as the entire v2 supply is pre-minted and secured in a multisignature wallet. At the time of writing, LEASH is trading at $24.94, down by 3.22% in the past 24 hours.",Shiba Inu|BNB Chain|Cosmos|Ethereum|Hexens|LEASH|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|ShibaSwap|ShibaSwap V2 LPs|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|solana|Uniswap|Uniswap v3,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|UNI|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 00:00:50

However, recent news brings a slight shift in plans, as the much-awaited launch of the RexShares DOGE ETF has encountered a minor delay. What’s the Latest on the DOGE ETF Launch? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the launch of the DOGE ETF , set to trade under the ticker DOJE, has been postponed. Originally slated for September 11, the debut from U.S. asset managers RexShares and Osprey Funds is now expected next week. Balchunas indicated that next Thursday is the new likely target date for this significant event. This news, while a small delay, keeps the crypto community on its toes. The introduction of a spot DOGE ETF could be a game-changer for Dogecoin, potentially opening doors for broader institutional and retail investment. It signals a growing maturity in the digital asset space, even for meme coins. Why Does a DOGE ETF Matter for Investors? The concept of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) for a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin is incredibly significant. ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without directly owning it. This simplifies the investment process, making it more accessible to a wider audience, including those who might be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Here are some key reasons why a DOGE ETF is important: Accessibility: It offers a regulated and familiar investment vehicle, similar to traditional stock market investments. Liquidity: ETFs typically provide high liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Diversification: For traditional investors, it offers an avenue to diversify portfolios with digital assets. Legitimacy: The approval and launch of such an ETF lend further credibility to Dogecoin and the broader crypto market. The delay, while minor, provides a brief window for potential investors to further research and understand the implications of such a product on their investment strategies. It’s crucial to consider how this new financial instrument could integrate into existing portfolios. Navigating the Path to a DOGE ETF: What Comes Next? The journey to launching a cryptocurrency ETF is often fraught with regulatory hurdles. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious with crypto-related financial products. However, recent approvals for Bitcoin ETFs suggest a shifting landscape, paving the way for other digital assets, including Dogecoin. RexShares and Osprey Funds are among the asset managers at the forefront of this innovation. Their persistence in bringing a DOGE ETF to market highlights the increasing demand for regulated crypto investment products. While a specific reason for this particular delay wasn’t detailed, such postponements are not uncommon in the highly regulated financial sector. Investors should keep an eye on official announcements from RexShares and Osprey Funds, as well as regulatory bodies, for the definitive launch date. The likely launch next Thursday will be a moment many in the crypto world will be watching closely. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin’s Future? The introduction of a DOGE ETF could have a substantial impact on Dogecoin’s market dynamics. Increased accessibility and institutional interest could lead to higher trading volumes and potentially greater price stability. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the enhanced visibility and legitimacy could attract new capital into the Dogecoin ecosystem. This development is part of a larger trend of mainstream finance embracing digital assets. As more regulated products become available, the line between traditional finance and cryptocurrency continues to blur, offering exciting new opportunities for investors globally. The journey of the DOGE ETF is a testament to this evolving financial landscape. In conclusion, while the RexShares DOGE ETF has seen a minor delay, the anticipation for its launch next Thursday remains high. This development underscores the growing institutional interest and regulatory progress within the cryptocurrency space, offering new avenues for investors to engage with digital assets like Dogecoin. It’s a significant step towards mainstream adoption and a testament to the enduring appeal of the meme coin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a DOGE ETF? A DOGE ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund that would hold Dogecoin as its underlying asset, allowing investors to trade shares of the fund on traditional stock exchanges without directly buying and holding Dogecoin itself. Who are RexShares and Osprey Funds? RexShares and Osprey Funds are U.S. asset management firms that are collaborating to launch the proposed DOGE ETF (DOJE). Why was the DOGE ETF launch delayed? The exact reason for this specific delay was not publicly detailed, but minor postponements are common in the highly regulated financial industry for various reasons, including final regulatory checks or logistical preparations. What is the new anticipated launch date for the DOGE ETF? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the launch is now considered likely for next Thursday, following the original September 11 target. How could a DOGE ETF impact Dogecoin’s price? A DOGE ETF could potentially increase Dogecoin’s price and stability by making it more accessible to a wider range of investors, including institutions, thereby increasing demand and liquidity. However, market performance is influenced by many factors. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The milestone cabinet appointment is the first ever political appointment of an AI bot in the world. Albania has broken a new record in global politics by being the first nation to name an artificial intelligence bot as a cabinet minister. Prime Minister Edi Rama revealed the appointment on Thursday, presenting the bot named “Diella.” She is a digital system that will focus on managing the country’s public procurement system. According to Rama, the appointment is aimed at tackling corruption. Albania has appointed an AI bot as a cabinet minister Diella, whose name means “sunshine” in Albanian, was introduced at the Socialist Party assembly in Tirana, where Rama announced his new cabinet at the start of his fourth term. Unlike her colleagues, Diella exists only as an avatar which has been made to represent a young woman in traditional Albanian attire. Rama said Diella would oversee all public tenders, which has historically been one of Albania’s most corruption-prone sectors. By removing decision-making from human cabinet members and placing it in the hands of an incorruptible AI, he argued, the country could ensure “100 percent transparent and legible” spending of public funds. “Diella is the first cabinet member who isn’t physically present, but is virtually created by AI,” Rama said in his speech. “She is the servant of public procurement.” The prime minister stressed that decisions on tenders would gradually move “step by step” under Diella’s authority, transforming Albania into a country where public tenders are fully immune to bribery and manipulation. Diella’s role will also include evaluating bids, hiring experts from around the world, and breaking down “the fear of prejudice and rigidity of the administration,” according to Rama . Diella is central to Albania’s long-running effort to align itself with European Union standards. The EU has repeatedly criticized the country for corruption in public administration and procurement, and Rama, who was re-elected in May on a promise to join the bloc by 2030, said Diella’s appointment demonstrates Albania’s willingness to innovate. Praise and skepticism follow Diella’s appointment While the government has promoted Diella as a tool for transparency, her appointment has already sparked debate at home. On social media, some users expressed doubt that even a virtual minister could remain immune from corruption. One Facebook commenter quipped, “Even Diella will be corrupted in Albania.” Another added, “Stealing will continue and Diella will be blamed.” Concerns have also been raised about the supervision of and accountability for Diella. Rama did not provide details on what human supervision will accompany Diella’s decisions, or how the system could guard against manipulation of the AI itself. Diella is not entirely new to Albanians. She first appeared earlier this year as an AI-powered assistant on the government’s e-Albania digital platform, which citizens use to obtain state documents. Her avatar responds to voice commands, issues documents with electronic stamps, and aims to cut bureaucratic delays. Diella’s appointment was announced a day before Albania’s newly elected parliament was set to convene. It remains uncertain whether Rama’s cabinet, including its virtual member, will be formally voted on immediately.

Alibaba and Baidu are reportedly ditching Nvidia’s processors and utilizing home-made solutions, with Alibaba training smaller AI models with its in-house processors. Baidu is also testing the waters with its latest Kunlun P800 chip on more advanced versions of its Ernie model. However, it highlights the progress and seriousness that Chinese firms are putting into making chip designs and the urgency created by U.S. export restrictions that have curbed access to Nvidia’s most advanced processors. Breaking reliance on U.S. hardware Over the years, Chinese companies building large-scale AI systems have relied heavily on Nvidia’s hardware, particularly the H100 and its successors. Nvidia is the market leader in the GPU space, known to be part of the critical infrastructure components in the AI boom. However, Chinese companies can’t get their hands on the most advanced Nvidia chips, as the U.S. government has progressively tightened the noose around getting those chips, citing national security reasons. However, last month, Cryptopolitan reported that Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said he was discussing with Washington to push for the sale of some advanced versions of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips. Despite this, it still seems that the most powerful models remain off limits. The restrictions have accelerated Beijing’s push to develop a domestic semiconductor ecosystem, backed by billions of dollars in state subsidies and pressure on national champions to cut reliance on U.S. suppliers. Alibaba’s Zhenwu and Baidu’s Kunlun chips Alibaba’s semiconductor arm has designed the Zhenwu processing unit to support cloud-based AI workloads. Baidu has been working with its own Kunlun line of AI accelerators. The latest P800 version is being used to train newer versions of Ernie, the company’s flagship large language model. Baidu has also positioned Kunlun as both a cost-saving tool and a hedge against foreign sanctions. For now the switch is partial as both companies still continue to rely on Nvidia chips for their most advanced systems, especially those involving very large training runs where performance gaps remain. But the willingness work with Chinese-made alternatives in production environments is a major step in the move away from American tech. Implications for global AI competition For Nvidia, the development is a warning sign as China has been its largest overseas market. A successful move away from the America chipmaker by Chinese firms to home-grown GPUs could end demand for U.S. chips and greatly impact Nvidia’s market share and balance book, even when import restrictions are removed. For Alibaba and Baidu, the ability to design and control their own hardware could lower costs and help them align with Beijing’s industrial policies. Matching Nvidia is still a longshot, but it’s looking closer with the latest development. The firms still have to match Nvidia’s performance and ecosystem support, which boasts advanced software frameworks such as CUDA. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has made a significant move, rising three points from yesterday to a notable 57. This shift propels it from the neutral zone directly into ‘greed territory,’ according to data from Alternative. This development is a clear signal: investor sentiment is improving, and the market is buzzing with renewed optimism. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? To truly grasp the significance of this shift, let’s break down what the Crypto Fear & Greed Index represents. This unique indicator acts as a barometer for market sentiment, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme optimism). It’s not just a random number; it’s a sophisticated calculation designed to capture the emotional state of cryptocurrency investors. The index relies on a combination of six key market factors, each contributing to its overall score. Understanding these components provides a deeper insight into how market psychology is measured: Volatility (25%): This factor measures current Bitcoin price fluctuations and maximum drawdowns, comparing them to average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility can indicate a fearful market. Market Volume (25%): It compares current trading volume and market momentum to average values. High buying volume in a positive market often suggests greed. Social Media (15%): This component analyzes keywords, hashtags, and sentiment on platforms like Twitter, looking for mentions and interactions related to cryptocurrencies. Increased positive mentions can signal rising greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) These polls ask investors directly about their market outlook, providing a direct measure of sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market cap dominance can indicate a flight to safety, often seen during fearful periods, as investors move away from altcoins. A decrease might suggest increased risk appetite. Google Trends (10%): This examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ searches, for example, might indicate fear, while ‘buy Bitcoin’ searches suggest greed. Why Has the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Moved into Greed? The recent three-point jump to 57 isn’t just a number; it reflects a tangible change in how investors perceive the market. This surge indicates that the collective mood has shifted from cautious neutrality to a more adventurous, optimistic stance. What drives such a rapid change? Several factors likely contributed to this upward trend. It could be influenced by positive news cycles, such as institutional adoption announcements, successful blockchain upgrades, or even a sustained period of stable or rising asset prices. When the market shows resilience and potential for growth, investor confidence naturally improves, leading to higher buying pressure and increased enthusiasm. What Does ‘Greed Territory’ Mean for Your Investments? Reaching 57 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market firmly in ‘greed territory.’ While this might sound positive, it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it signifies strong buying interest and potential for further price appreciation. Investors are feeling confident, often leading to upward price momentum. However, ‘greed’ can also be a warning sign. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections. When everyone is optimistic, the market can become overextended, and a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) can drive irrational decisions. This is where vigilance becomes crucial. Smart investors understand that the market’s mood is cyclical. While a rising index can be encouraging, it also necessitates a disciplined approach. It’s a time to re-evaluate portfolios, consider taking profits, or at least avoid making impulsive decisions driven purely by emotion. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index So, how can you effectively use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in your investment strategy? It’s not a buy or sell signal in itself, but rather a powerful sentiment indicator. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: Some investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. When the index shows extreme fear, it might be a good time to consider buying (when others are fearful). Conversely, when it shows extreme greed, it might be a time to consider selling or reducing exposure (when others are greedy). Risk Management: A high greed score can be a prompt to review your risk exposure. Are you over-allocated to volatile assets? This might be a good moment to secure some gains or set stricter stop-loss orders. Avoid FOMO: When the market is greedy, there’s a strong temptation to jump into rapidly rising assets. The index serves as a reminder to stick to your investment plan and avoid impulse buying. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, the index provides context. Short-term fluctuations in sentiment are normal. It helps distinguish between genuine market shifts and emotional surges. The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 57 and its entry into greed territory is undoubtedly a positive sign for current market sentiment. It reflects increased investor confidence and a more optimistic outlook for cryptocurrencies. However, this shift also carries an important reminder: while optimism is welcome, it should always be balanced with caution and a well-defined strategy. By understanding the underlying factors and historical patterns of this crucial index, investors can make more informed decisions, navigating the dynamic crypto landscape with greater wisdom. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), based on various market factors. Q2: What does it mean when the index is in ‘greed territory’? When the index is in ‘greed territory’ (typically above 50), it indicates high investor optimism and confidence. While this can lead to price rallies, it can also signal a market that might be becoming overextended and prone to corrections. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily by Alternative, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment each day. Q4: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a direct buy or sell signal? No, the index is not a direct buy or sell signal. It’s a sentiment indicator that should be used as one of many tools in your analysis to understand market psychology and inform your investment decisions. Q5: What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is calculated using a weighted average of volatility, market volume, social media sentiment, surveys, Bitcoin’s market dominance, and Google search trends.

While Bitcoin continues to hover near elevated levels, liquidity in smaller tokens has thinned and investor sentiment has cooled. Macroeconomic pressures, including fresh US labor data showing weaker job creation, have intensified concerns that equities and digital assets alike may be sitting on fragile ground. For many traders, this environment has begun to resemble a trap: apparent stability masking deeper structural risks. Yet, even within this cautious atmosphere, certain corners of crypto are breaking away from the slump. Meme-driven platforms like MemeCore, creative launchpads such as Pump.fun, and emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving that innovation and cultural resonance can outperform broad market hesitation. MemeCore captures attention with on-chain creativity MemeCore has become a surprise standout during this market slowdown. Positioned as a creative hub for meme-driven tokens, the platform has attracted a surge of developers experimenting with culture-based coin launches. Analysts note that MemeCore’s rise reflects a deeper shift: in times of uncertainty, communities gravitate toward narratives that are simple, relatable, and engaging. By lowering barriers for creators and amplifying viral engagement, MemeCore has positioned itself as more than a speculative playground. Instead, it functions as a testing ground for the next generation of meme-coin concepts. Even as trading volumes in large-cap assets flatten, MemeCore continues to add new projects daily, keeping investor interest alive in an otherwise quiet sector. Strategic capital rotates toward MAGACOIN FINANCE The persistence of MemeCore and Pump.fun highlights a critical point: even in bearish or sideways markets, pockets of opportunity emerge where cultural branding and scarcity intersect. This dynamic sets the stage for MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining recognition as one of 2025’s breakout contenders. What distinguishes MAGACOIN FINANCE is its mix of scarcity and momentum: rapid sellouts in earlier rounds, a swelling community base, and strong alignment with cultural branding that resonates well beyond crypto’s core audience. Analysts suggest that such early traction could mirror past cycles where seemingly niche projects multiplied in value as mainstream awareness arrived. In fact, forecasts position MAGACOIN FINANCE among the rare altcoins capable of 50×–90× upside if momentum continues to compound. In a market where mining margins are shrinking and large caps offer limited multiples, speculative capital appears to be rotating toward precisely this type of early-stage launch. Pump.fun redefines grassroots token launches Another project bucking the downtrend is Pump.fun, the Solana-based launchpad that has quickly become synonymous with grassroots crypto culture. Its no-code interface and frictionless deployment tools have empowered thousands of micro-communities to launch tokens with little more than an idea and a network. While critics question the sustainability of such rapid token creation, Pump.fun has demonstrated that participation and creativity remain potent forces even when liquidity is tight. Notably, user activity has soared on the platform, with on-chain data confirming wallet growth despite the broader slump. By democratizing access to token creation, Pump.fun highlights that innovation in crypto often thrives at the edges, where risk-taking and experimentation define the culture. Broader implications for altcoin markets The ability of these projects to attract liquidity while most of the sector drifts sideways reveals a pattern long observed in crypto: innovation often accelerates when traditional strategies stall. Bitcoin miners, for instance, now face higher break-even costs, while Ethereum struggles with scaling challenges despite ETF inflows. Against that backdrop, lightweight, culture-driven platforms are proving more agile in capturing attention. The Fed’s looming rate cuts only add fuel to this trend. Historically, monetary easing has driven risk-on flows toward altcoins, and analysts expect the same dynamic to re-emerge once liquidity conditions improve. When that shift occurs, projects already building momentum, MemeCore, Pump.fun, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, are positioned to ride the first wave of renewed speculative capital. Why these projects stand out The “why” behind their resilience comes down to accessibility, community, and legitimacy. MemeCore thrives by making meme creation collaborative and viral, Pump.fun succeeds by lowering technical barriers for token launches, and MAGACOIN FINANCE differentiates itself through strong audits, scarcity, and community traction. Together, they demonstrate that crypto’s cultural heartbeat remains strong even during downturns. Investors may interpret these signals as a preview of where capital will flow once the broader market stabilizes. With institutions locked into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the outsized multiples often emerge in niches where community, branding, and scarcity converge, exactly the spaces these projects occupy. Why MemeCore, Pump.fun and MAGACOIN FINANCE are defying the slump Innovation Over Stagnation: While most of the market drifts sideways, these projects keep evolving, MemeCore with creative on-chain memes, Pump.fun with accessible token launches, and MAGACOIN FINANCE with its audited framework. Accessible Entry: Each platform lowers barriers, whether through low-cost tokens, no-code deployment tools, or affordable allocations that invite wider participation. Asymmetric Upside: Analysts highlight the potential for outsized returns as liquidity seeks new narratives, positioning these names as outliers in a cautious market. Together, they showcase how cultural resonance, security, and accessibility can combine to outpace the broader slump. Conclusion While the broader crypto market has slowed, innovation continues to flourish at the edges. MemeCore and Pump.fun highlight the enduring appeal of community-driven creativity, while MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates how legitimacy, scarcity, and momentum can align to create breakout potential. Also MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as one of the most high-rewarding launches of 2025, a sharp contrast to the fragility weighing on mainstream markets. For investors searching for opportunities beyond the stock market’s “trap” conditions, these projects may signal the next cycle’s most dynamic performers.

This bold investment strategy by a publicly traded company is sending ripples across the market, prompting many to consider the evolving landscape of corporate cryptocurrency adoption. Cleancore’s Expanding Dogecoin Portfolio: What’s the Latest? Cleancore Solutions recently made headlines with its announcement of a substantial investment in Dogecoin (DOGE). The company’s initial purchase of 285 million DOGE, valued at approximately $68 million, was just the beginning. In a rapid development, Cleancore’s Cleancore Dogecoin holdings have nearly doubled in less than three days, now reaching an impressive 500 million DOGE. This rapid accumulation underscores Cleancore’s commitment to its previously stated intention: to acquire up to $1 billion in DOGE within the next 30 days. Such an aggressive purchasing plan highlights a growing trend of institutional players exploring digital assets beyond traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why the Sudden Interest in Cleancore Dogecoin Holdings? The decision by a company like Cleancore to pour significant capital into Dogecoin raises important questions. While DOGE started as a meme coin, its large and active community, coupled with high-profile endorsements, has given it considerable market visibility. Cleancore’s strategy appears to be a calculated move to capitalize on Dogecoin’s unique market position and potential for future growth. Market Visibility: Dogecoin benefits from widespread recognition and a dedicated following. Potential for Volatility: While risky, DOGE’s volatility can also present opportunities for significant gains for large investors. Diversification: For a company already exploring digital assets, Dogecoin offers a different risk/reward profile compared to other cryptocurrencies. Understanding the motivations behind such substantial Cleancore Dogecoin holdings is key to grasping the broader implications for both corporate finance and the crypto market. What are the Implications of Cleancore’s Dogecoin Strategy? Cleancore’s burgeoning Cleancore Dogecoin holdings could set a precedent for other corporations. When a NYSE-listed company makes such a public and significant bet on a meme coin, it lends a certain level of legitimacy that could encourage further institutional adoption. This move suggests a shift in how traditional businesses view digital assets, moving beyond just store-of-value narratives to embrace potentially more speculative, yet high-growth, opportunities. However, this strategy also comes with inherent risks: Market Volatility: Dogecoin’s price is highly susceptible to market sentiment and social media trends. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased corporate involvement in cryptocurrencies could invite greater regulatory attention. Public Perception: The investment could be viewed as either innovative or overly speculative by shareholders and the public. The success or failure of Cleancore’s investment could significantly influence future corporate crypto strategies. The Future Outlook for Cleancore Dogecoin Holdings With Cleancore’s stated goal of acquiring up to $1 billion in DOGE, the market will be closely watching its next moves. This aggressive accumulation highlights a belief in Dogecoin’s long-term potential, or at least its short-to-medium term growth trajectory. As the company continues to build its Cleancore Dogecoin holdings , it could influence DOGE’s price action and overall market sentiment. This situation also serves as a compelling case study for investors interested in the intersection of traditional finance and the rapidly evolving crypto space. It exemplifies how established companies are beginning to navigate and participate in the digital asset economy, pushing the boundaries of conventional investment portfolios. In conclusion, Cleancore Solutions’ dramatic increase in Cleancore Dogecoin holdings to 500 million DOGE marks a pivotal moment in corporate crypto adoption. This significant investment by a NYSE-listed company underscores a growing willingness among traditional businesses to explore and embrace digital assets, even those with more unconventional origins. While the strategy carries inherent risks, it also presents a fascinating case study for the future of institutional engagement with the cryptocurrency market, potentially paving the way for further corporate ventures into the world of digital finance.

The exchange argues that the disappearance of these communications violates court orders and undermines public trust in the regulator’s transparency and accountability. The records vanished between October 2022 and September 2023, when the crypto market suffered from notable developments such as FTX’s downfall and numerous major enforcement proceedings against Coinbase, the company involved in the protests. For critics of the SEC, missing these communications couldn’t have happened at a more essential moment, as the texts could have provided insights into how the agency assessed Ethereum, implemented enforcement strategies, and influenced its broader policy position toward digital assets. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the SEC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigation revealed that Gensler’s text messages were lost due to an internal policy that remotely wipes agency devices left offline for more than 45 days. Gensler’s phone was reset when the policy was triggered, erasing all its text communications. Subsequently, investigators found that many deleted texts would have qualified as official federal records and should have been retained under existing rules. Instead, the OIG report emphasized that the incident was not a single incident of poor technical decision-making but instead the culmination of systemic shortcomings, including poorly tested device management protocols and poorly designed backup systems, coupled with failed warnings that should have alerted the system that the data might be at stake. Coinbase presses for legal penalties and transparency Coinbase’s filing alleged the SEC violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and a court order in the past. The company filed claims that the agency carried out excessively narrow searches, delayed production of documents, and did not disclose the record loss until long after it had occurred. These failures undermined a fair consideration of how the SEC constructed its policies regarding Ethereum and other digital assets, leaving the public with an incomplete picture of the regulators’ decision-making process at a time of unprecedented unrest in the space, Coinbase said. The exchange reported that it has been especially worrying that such records were missing at the time of FTX’s demise, as well as a series of sweeping enforcement actions in the crypto world. In a potential redress, Coinbase is requesting the court to not only sanction the abusers but also to facilitate expedited discovery, to reveal the extent of the record losses, what (if anything) the SEC has done to reclaim the communications, and why the regulator hasn’t been quick to disclose the deletions to the investors. Coinbase says the SEC should be held to the same principles that it uses against the private sector, with the agency having fined the system over a billion dollars in recent years for violating reasonable business recordkeeping trust. SEC faces crisis of trust over recordkeeping Meanwhile, the aftermath of those erasures leaves many questions, like transparency and accountability, about the world’s most powerful financial regulator. It’s a blow that puts the SEC’s credibility under serious pressure, especially when the erased texts would have exposed internal deliberations about oversight of the burgeoning cryptocurrency space. Without these records, Congress, courts, and the public could have difficulty grasping how the agency dealt with enforcement and policy development as the industry was rocked by major upheaval. The SEC has already tried to contain more harm, turning off text messaging on an array of agency devices, warning the National Archives, and promising to fortify its recordkeeping systems. But for some, those moves are a reaction after the issue had reached public scandal rather than something proactive that would have averted the loss.

A massive Bitcoin options expiry event is unfolding, with over $3.4 billion worth of contracts set to settle. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a crucial juncture that could influence market sentiment and potentially spark volatility across the digital asset landscape. Alongside Bitcoin, a substantial $850 million in Ethereum options are also expiring, making today a key day for crypto traders and investors alike. What is a Bitcoin Options Expiry and Why Does It Matter? At its core, an options contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiry date). When that date arrives, these contracts either settle, are exercised, or expire worthless. Call options grant the right to buy. Put options grant the right to sell. A large-scale Bitcoin options expiry can significantly impact the market because institutional players and market makers, who often write these options, need to adjust their hedges as contracts approach expiry. This unwinding or rebalancing of positions can create buying or selling pressure, leading to price fluctuations. Understanding Key Terms: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain To fully grasp the implications of a Bitcoin options expiry , it’s helpful to understand two key metrics: The put/call ratio indicates the sentiment of options traders. It’s calculated by dividing the total number of open put options by the total number of open call options. A ratio above 1 suggests a more bearish sentiment, as more traders are betting on price declines. Conversely, a ratio below 1 hints at a bullish outlook. The max pain price is a theoretical strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts (both puts and calls) would expire worthless. In essence, it’s the price point that causes maximum financial loss for the majority of option holders and maximum gain for option writers. While not a guaranteed price target, it can sometimes act as a magnet for the underlying asset’s price as expiry approaches, as market participants adjust their positions. The Imminent $3.4 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry Today, specifically at 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 12, Bitcoin options with a staggering notional value of $3.42 billion are set to expire. Data from crypto options exchange Deribit highlights the scale of this event. For these Bitcoin contracts: The put/call ratio stands at 1.31 , indicating a slight bearish lean among options traders for this specific expiry. The calculated max pain price is $113,000 . It’s important to note that while max pain is a theoretical magnet, this figure is significantly higher than current market prices, suggesting many of these contracts might be deeply out-of-the-money or were opened during different market conditions. Such a substantial expiry volume often leads to increased scrutiny and potential market shifts, as market participants react to the settlement of these contracts. Ethereum’s Significant $850 Million Options Expiry Not to be overshadowed, Ethereum options valued at $850 million are also scheduled to expire at the very same time. Ethereum’s derivatives market has grown considerably, and its expiries also carry significant weight. For these Ethereum contracts: The put/call ratio is 1.02 , suggesting a more balanced, almost neutral sentiment between bullish and bearish bets. The max pain price is $4,400 . Similar to Bitcoin’s figure, this is a theoretical point far above Ethereum’s current trading levels, reflecting the nature of options contracts written over various timeframes and price expectations. The simultaneous expiry of both Bitcoin and Ethereum options could amplify overall market reactions, as these two assets often move in tandem. What Could Happen After This Crucial Bitcoin Options Expiry? The immediate aftermath of a large Bitcoin options expiry can be unpredictable. Here are some potential scenarios and actionable insights: Increased Volatility: Market makers might unwind or re-establish their hedges, leading to increased price fluctuations around the expiry time. Price Magnet Effect: While the max pain price of $113,000 for Bitcoin is far from current levels, historically, prices can sometimes gravitate towards max pain. However, for this particular expiry, its influence might be limited given the vast difference from spot prices. Sentiment Shift: The put/call ratio of 1.31 for Bitcoin suggests a slightly cautious outlook. If market participants act on this sentiment, it could lead to short-term downward pressure or consolidation. Actionable Insights for Traders: Monitor Price Action: Pay close attention to Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements immediately before and after 8:00 a.m. UTC. Risk Management: Given the potential for volatility, consider adjusting stop-loss orders or reducing position sizes if you’re actively trading. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: Large expiries can create noise. It’s often wise to wait for the market to digest the event before making significant trading moves. In conclusion, today’s colossal Bitcoin options expiry , coupled with a substantial Ethereum expiry, presents a pivotal moment for the crypto market. While the max pain prices are theoretical and high, the sheer volume of expiring contracts could trigger significant market movements. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the potential volatility and making informed decisions in the evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly happens when Bitcoin options expire? When Bitcoin options expire, contracts that are ‘in-the-money’ (meaning profitable for the holder) are typically exercised or settled, while ‘out-of-the-money’ contracts expire worthless. This settlement process can lead to market participants adjusting their positions, potentially causing price movements in Bitcoin. Q2: How does the put/call ratio influence the market after a Bitcoin options expiry? A high put/call ratio (like Bitcoin’s 1.31 for this expiry) indicates that more put options (bets on price decline) are open than call options (bets on price increase). This can signal a bearish sentiment among options traders. After expiry, if this sentiment is strong, it might contribute to downward pressure or cautious trading behavior. Q3: What is the significance of the max pain price in an options expiry? The max pain price is the theoretical price point where the most options contracts expire worthless, causing maximum loss for option holders. While not a guaranteed target, some analysts believe the underlying asset’s price can gravitate towards this point as expiry approaches, as market makers manage their risks. Q4: How does Ethereum’s options expiry compare to Bitcoin’s in terms of impact? While Bitcoin’s expiry volume is larger ($3.4B vs. $850M), Ethereum’s expiry is still substantial. Both events occurring simultaneously can create a combined effect, potentially amplifying overall market volatility, especially since their price movements are often correlated. Q5: Should I buy or sell Bitcoin before a major options expiry? Options expiry events typically increase market uncertainty and volatility. There’s no single recommended action to buy or sell. Instead, it’s crucial to monitor market conditions, assess your risk tolerance, and consider waiting for the market to stabilize after the expiry before making significant trading decisions.

The Altcoin Season Index has recently climbed to a significant 65. This upward movement suggests a shift in the crypto market, where alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, are starting to show impressive strength compared to Bitcoin. Understanding what this index signifies is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, serves as a vital barometer for the broader altcoin market. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against the performance of Bitcoin. Essentially, it tells us how well altcoins are doing relative to the market leader. How it’s Calculated: The index compares the price performance of these top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. What it Indicates: A higher reading, closer to 100, suggests that a larger percentage of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Why is the Altcoin Season Index at 65 a Big Deal? Yesterday, the Altcoin Season Index stood at 62, and its jump to 65 indicates a noticeable increase in altcoin dominance. While an official “altcoin season” is declared when 75% of these top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, a reading of 65 means we are steadily moving in that direction. This rising trend often signals growing investor interest and capital flow into altcoins, potentially leading to significant price appreciation across various projects. This metric is more than just a number; it reflects evolving market sentiment. When Bitcoin consolidates or experiences slower growth, capital often flows into altcoins, which can offer higher percentage gains due to their smaller market caps. This shift creates exciting opportunities for diversified portfolios. Are We Nearing a Full Altcoin Season? The journey to a full altcoin season requires the Altcoin Season Index to reach 75. At 65, we are certainly closer than before, but not quite there yet. This current phase could be described as a strong “altcoin accumulation” or “pre-season” period. Investors often use this time to research and position themselves in promising altcoin projects before a broader market surge. Identifying an altcoin season involves observing several factors beyond just the index: Market Dominance: Bitcoin’s market dominance typically decreases during an altcoin season. Trading Volume: Increased trading volume in altcoins compared to Bitcoin. Project Developments: Significant updates and adoption news from various altcoin projects. Navigating the Opportunities: What Should Investors Consider with the Altcoin Season Index? The rising Altcoin Season Index presents both opportunities and challenges for investors. While the potential for high returns is attractive, it is crucial to approach altcoin investing with a well-thought-out strategy. Volatility can be higher in altcoins, and thorough research is paramount. Actionable Insights for Investors: Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, consider a diversified portfolio across different altcoin sectors (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions). Research Fundamentals: Look beyond hype. Investigate a project’s whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and community support. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders and take profits strategically to manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, project updates, and broader economic trends that could impact crypto. The Future of Altcoins: What’s Next for the Altcoin Season Index? The current upward trend in the Altcoin Season Index suggests a bullish outlook for many alternative cryptocurrencies. As the crypto ecosystem continues to mature, altcoins play an increasingly vital role in innovation and expanding the utility of blockchain technology. Whether this momentum carries us to a full-fledged altcoin season remains to be seen, but the signs are certainly encouraging. Staying informed and strategic will be key to capitalizing on these evolving market conditions. The crypto landscape is ever-changing, and adaptability is a valuable asset for any investor. In conclusion, the ascent of the Altcoin Season Index to 65 is a compelling indicator of growing strength among altcoins. While not yet a full altcoin season, it signals a period ripe with potential. By understanding the index, conducting diligent research, and managing risks effectively, investors can position themselves to potentially benefit from this exciting market shift. The journey of altcoins continues to unfold, promising innovation and opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? A: The Altcoin Season Index measures the performance of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. It indicates how many altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Q2: How is an Altcoin Season officially declared? A: An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of the top 100 altcoins by market capitalization outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 65 signify for investors? A: An index of 65 means that 65% of the top altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin. While not yet a full altcoin season, it suggests strong momentum and increasing investor interest in altcoins, indicating potential for significant gains. Q4: What are the key risks of investing during an altcoin season? A: Altcoins can be highly volatile, leading to rapid price fluctuations. Risks include market manipulation, lower liquidity compared to Bitcoin, and the potential for project failures. Thorough research and risk management are essential. Q5: How can I prepare my portfolio for a potential altcoin season?

Technical indicators now hint at a potential rally, with the meme coin attracting renewed attention from investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.50? This Channel Break Could Be The Catalyst The 20-day EMA near $0.225, alongside the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day averages clustered below $0.220, highlight a strong support zone. With the RSI at 60–61, DOGE shows steady buying momentum without being overbought. Similarly, the MACD histogram has turned positive, signaling a resurgence in bullish sentiment following muted August trading. Resistance at $0.25 Could Unlock Higher Targets Dogecoin’s short-term trajectory hinges on whether it can close above $0.246–$0.250, a level where both resistance and Bollinger Bands converge. A confirmed breakout may clear the path toward $0.263, $0.273–$0.276, and the July high of $0.300. Support sits at $0.238–$0.240, with deeper levels near $0.233–$0.231 and the 20-day EMA at $0.225. Any drop below the 100/200-day cluster around $0.214–$0.213 would weaken the bullish setup. Market analysts also note Dogecoin’s parallel channel pattern, with resistance near $0.29. A breakout here could potentially extend gains beyond $0.3 to as far as $0.50, based on the measured width of the channel. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart.

51575690,579288,1757638827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51575690.jpeg,Will Solana Launch Its Own Stablecoin? Helius CEO Calls It A No-Brainer,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-stablecoin-helius-ceo-calls-it-a-no-brainer/,"Helius Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz ignited a fresh round of debate inside the Solana ecosystem on September 10 after floating the idea of a Solana-aligned stablecoin whose reserve yield would be redirected to SOL via buybacks or burns—either as an “enshrined” protocol feature or, more likely, through competing digital-asset treasury companies (DATs). “Warming up to the idea that Solana should enshrine a stablecoin,” he wrote, adding that “50% burn of the yield goes back to burning SOL.” Hours later, he reframed the thrust: “it shouldn’t be enshrined, a DAT should do it… fix it and trillions.” Why A Solana Stablecoin Is A No-Brainer Mumtaz’s core critique targets what he describes as “yield leakage” from Solana: “Stablecoins are commodities, and currently on Solana, there is one that captures all yield and literally funds Solana’s biggest competitor with it!” He argued that, under the US GENIUS Act, stables are readily swappable and issuers will fight aggressively for market share—citing the recent “Bachelor-style” scramble among large stablecoin companies to court business. “If you don’t want to enshrine a Solana-centric stable, then consider digital asset treasury companies (DATs)… The DAT is literally a machine for buying the underlying token.” That framing collides with the letter of the new US law. The GENIUS Act , signed in July, carves out “payment stablecoins” as neither securities nor commodities for US federal purposes, consolidating oversight largely under banking regulators and expressly separating them from SEC/CFTC jurisdiction. Multiple legal analyses and a Congressional Research Service note affirm the statute’s classification. In short: Mumtaz’s “commodity” phrasing is rhetorical, not legal. Still, the law’s most consequential economic detail—stablecoins cannot pass interest to holders—means issuers (or affiliated structures) capture the reserve income and can decide how to use it. That’s precisely the lever Mumtaz wants pointed back at Solana. Within hours, one builder publicly accepted the challenge. “We (@KASTcard) will put 101–103% of all interest income from USDK on Solana, to buyback SOL,” wrote CEO and co-founder of KAST, adding that the buybacks would sit with a foundation that issues a token after a planned TGE and that USDK would be issued with the m^0 foundation as a U.S. “Genius compliant” stable. The 1–3% kicker above 100% would be treated as marketing spend. KAST and m^0 have previously disclosed plans to launch programmable, application-specific dollars on the networl; KAST’s consumer app and card already target global stablecoin payments. The proposal’s mechanics are straightforward in concept. A native USD stablecoin accrues reserve yield (e.g., from T-bills) at the issuer level; a DAT structure then commits that income stream to buy SOL on the open market and either retire it or recycle it into ecosystem programs. Mumtaz even sketched a toy model—“Assume a Solana DAT runs a Solana stable, call it USDmanlet… [it] earns yield. The DAT takes all the yield and buys SOL with it… embed it in the ecosystem and take the yield and pump it back… or into burning SOL.” Stablecoin Wars Reach Solana Mumtaz’s “funding the competitor” barb is aimed squarely at USDC’s economics and Coinbase’s Base L2. Coinbase and Circle split USDC reserve income, a line item that has grown into a major revenue stream for Coinbase as stablecoin supply has rebounded; Coinbase incubated Base, an Ethereum Layer-2 that has quickly become a high-throughput venue for on-chain activity. None of that is nefarious—USDC’s terms are clear—but for Solana purists it is strategically suboptimal to let billions in Solana-settled stablecoin activity originate issuer profits that are then reinvested in a rival’s stack. That is the “simple problem” Mumtaz says he wants to fix, whether by enshrining or (more plausibly) by market-driven competition among issuers and DATs. Multicoin Capital co-founder and managing partner Tushar Jain agreed via X: “One of the best things about Solana’s culture is adopting good ideas from other ecosystems. Hyperliquid’s idea to encourage stablecoin issuers to buy HYPE with USDH interest is a powerful way to drive REV. Why should Circle keep all of the interest revenue from USDC on Solana?” For now, this is only a proposal—there is no SIP or governance vote to “enshrine” anything at the protocol layer, and Mumtaz himself emphasized the market-driven DAT route. Whether the proposal takes the form of competing issuers pledging buybacks, a canonical “ecosystem stable,” or a more modular treasury program, the endgame Mumtaz sketched is unambiguous: stop leaking yield, and point it at SOL. At press time, SOL traded at $228.",Solana|Helius Labs|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana news|Solana price|Solana Stablecoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 01:00:27
