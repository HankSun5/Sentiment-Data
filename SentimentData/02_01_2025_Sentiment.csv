The analyst further revealed what needs to happen for the foremost meme coin to reach this price target. How Dogecoin Price Could Rally To $1.2 In an X post, Master Kenobi explained how the Dogecoin price could rally to $1.2. He stated that if DOGE manages to break past its all-time high (ATH) of $0.74 by the end of January, it could potentially test the $1.2 area. The analyst noted that such a rally could make Dogecoin’s market capitalization align with that of XRP. Master Kenobi added that any rally beyond $1.2 would be a bonus, although not impossible. He also raised the possibility of Dogecoin rising to $3.4 if the top meme coin reaches the orange trendline, which he highlighted on his accompanying chart by the end of January. However, Master Kenobi remarked that he doesn’t believe that the foremost meme coin can reach this target at this stage of the bull market. He added that it could happen maybe later this year but not now. Regarding the current Dogecoin price action, the crypto analyst stated that DOGE seems to have found its consolidation zone in a position of balance. He observed that in the past, pauses between episodes of DOGE’s sharp growth were characterized by periods of correction followed by horizontal consolidation. In the recent context, Master Kenobi noted that after two weeks of correction, Dogecoin appears to have reached a stabilization level from which it could initiate its next move. The crypto analyst added that history shows that such stagnation periods before a new impulse typically last, on average, for a few weeks. Master Kenobi mentioned that external events beyond the crypto market could play a significant role, providing the narrative and motivation necessary for the next move. DOGE Is In The Markup Phase Crypto analyst Trader provided insights into what stage of the bull run the Dogecoin price is currently in. In an X post , he stated that DOGE is in the markup phase of the Wyckoff market cycle. Currently, the analyst revealed that DOGE has completed the first wave of the Markup phase. He added that price appreciation could intensify towards the end of this phase, resulting in a “Blow-Off Top.” This chart pattern is characterized by a rapid, steep price increase. Meanwhile, based on a recent CoinGape market analysis, the Dogecoin price could indeed reach new highs this month.

After slogging through what everyone called the “fintech winter,” things are finally heating up. Crypto payments are stepping out of their niche, and the second Trump administration is promising looser rules . Fintech stocks are clawing their way back, and interest rate cuts are making money flow again. Startups that had been riding high after the pandemic got a reality check when the funding dried up. Layoffs hit hard. Product launches slowed down. Valuations that once seemed untouchable suddenly looked bloated. But now, the market’s waking up. Stablecoins, cross-border payments, and public listings are back in the spotlight, and everyone wants a piece of the action. Crypto payments are going big About a month after President Donald Trump won the US election, Bitcoin broke $108,000 for the first time in history. This guy is all-in on crypto. He’s even launched his own project, World Liberty Financial. It’s the kind of environment the crypto community has been dreaming about for years. Stripe wasted no time. The company dropped $1.1 billion to grab Bridge, a startup that issues stablecoins. Stripe’s CEO, Patrick Collison, made it clear this is about global payments. Stablecoins are the future for cross-border transfers, especially since banks are now a joke. PayPal is on it too. Its stablecoin, PYUSD, is already being used on Xoom, its money transfer service. That’s a big deal for anyone sending money internationally. Then there’s YellowCard, a startup built for exactly this kind of moment. They traded over $3 billion in crypto last year and are working to make expensive wire transfers a thing of the past. Not everyone’s on board though. Airwallex, another big name in global payments, says the rules are still too unclear. Co-founder Jack Zhang admitted stablecoins could shake up payroll and cross-border business payments, but he’s holding back until there’s more clarity. For now. Trump’s shakeup of fintech regulations Let’s rewind to 2024. Synapse Financial, a banking-as-a-service company, went belly up. Thousands of customers were left hanging, unable to access their funds. Regulators pounced. The FDIC and CFPB went after fintech startups and the banks that partner with them. Some said it was necessary. Others argued it was a mess. The CFPB didn’t stop there. It started poking around digital wallets and buy-now-pay-later companies like PayPal, Affirm, and Klarna. FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg and CFPB Director Rohit Chopra became public enemies in fintech. Critics accused them of killing innovation with their “regulation by enforcement” approach. Trump’s team has other plans. Reports say he wants to shrink—or maybe even kill—the CFPB. Elon Musk, now leading the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), went full throttle on X, tweeting, “Delete CFPB.” President Trump is backing this and has the power to fire Chopra. This could be a turning point. Fintech companies have been cautious, and scared of sudden rule changes. Amias Gerety, a partner at QED Investors, said Trump’s administration will change the tone. “Startups will start experimenting more. They won’t have to second-guess every move,” he explained.

As explained by Shehan Chandrasekera, Head of Tax Strategy at CoinTracker, the relief mitigates complications stemming from the implementation of Section 6045 custodial broker regulations, which take effect on January 1, 2025. IRS Crypto Relief These regulations require centralized finance (CeFi) brokers to report cryptocurrency transactions and apply specific accounting methods for asset sales, as per Chandrasekera’s tweet . If holders do not choose a preferred accounting method – such as Highest In, First Out (HIFO) or Specific Identification (Spec ID) – brokers will default to First In, First Out (FIFO). This default method can increase tax liabilities, particularly in a bullish market, by prioritizing the sale of the earliest purchased assets, which often have the lowest cost basis. The problem was further escalated by the fact that, as of January 1, 2025, most CeFi brokers were not ready to support Spec ID accounting. Recognizing this challenge, the IRS issued Notice 2025-7 which aimed to provide temporary relief for cryptocurrency sales conducted on CeFi exchanges between January 1 and December 31, 2025. The relief allows taxpayers to bypass the default FIFO method by using their own records or crypto tax software to specify which assets are being sold, offering greater flexibility during this transitional period. No Immediate Action Required Chandrasekera clarified that this relief is automatic and requires no immediate action from taxpayers. However, starting January 1, 2026, CeFi users must select an accounting method with their brokers to avoid defaulting to FIFO. By this time, most brokers are expected to support a variety of accounting options, streamlining tax compliance. Meanwhile, taxpayers are also urged to maintain detailed records or use reputable crypto tax software to ensure accurate reporting and alignment with their chosen accounting methods. Failure to do so could result in default FIFO sales, which may not be ideal for many investors. Chandrasekera urged users to plan ahead and verify that their broker’s accounting methods match their tax software to prevent discrepancies. The latest development comes days after the IRS introduced a broker reporting rule under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, controversially expanding broker definitions to include decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This rule requires platforms to report transactions despite their decentralized nature. The rushed implementation faced immediate legal challenges led by A16z Crypto, DeFi Education Fund, and others, who argue the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act and oversteps Treasury’s authority.

38400595,https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-2025-predictions-for-solana,1735767000,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Lightspeed’s 5 predictions for Solana in 2025,https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-2025-predictions-for-solana,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . I’m putting my crystal ball abilities to the test this year. As we turn the page on 2024, here are five Solana predictions for 2025: 1. Elon Musk’s X will debut a native Solana token It’s time. When Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, crypto fans speculated that the dogecoin-loving billionaire would integrate crypto into the social media platform. Those predictions have so far been quashed by Musk , but with the incoming Trump administration expected to loosen US crypto regulations and bring crypto-friendly voices to the table, I think an X token is finally on the way. “Crypto Twitter” is still a vibrant community, so there would be demand for such a token, and Musk’s other companies are known to hold crypto on their balance sheets. X Premium users could pay for their subscriptions using the X token, which Musk could cheaply on- and off-ramp with help from his stablecoin buddies over at Bridge. Solana has the high throughput and low transaction fees to make this all feasible. To sweeten the deal, Solana Blinks could make ecommerce happen natively on X without users leaving the app — a feature from which TikTok recently found success . If X wants to be an everything app, why wouldn’t that moniker extend to currency too? 2. Solana’s stablecoin market cap will quadruple Solana’s onchain volume and demand woke up in a major way in 2024, but stablecoins stayed sleepy. The blockchain currently houses roughly $5 billion in stables, which ranks it fifth among blockchains behind Ethereum, Tron, BSC, and Arbitrum, according to DeFiLlama. This is partly because Solana transactions often don’t require stablecoin pairs for actions like memecoin trading, but stables can play an important role in other use cases like DePIN or payments. With startups like Perena and Lulo focused on growing the Solana stablecoin pie and issuers like PayPal and Sky launching on the chain, Solana could be primed for major growth in 2024. I think Solana’s stablecoin market cap will cross $20 billion by the end of the year, which equates to a 4x increase from its current levels. That would still leave Solana far behind Ethereum, which holds some $110 billion in stablecoins at the moment. 3. Solana ETFs will be approved but will underperform ETH Ok, time for some cold water: I’m not bullish on solana ETFs. I think solana funds are likely to be approved this year as a Paul Atkins-led SEC takes a less stringent stance on defining cryptoassets as securities, but I don’t think SOL ETFs are likely to find all that much demand. Crypto ETFs’ raison d’etre is giving investors regulated access to crypto within things like brokerage accounts. With bitcoin, this makes sense. Its “digital gold” narrative is sticky, it is by far the largest crypto, and curious boomers could be interested in allocating 1% of their portfolios to see where things go. Ether ETFs have done okay partly due to the novelty of the products, but it’s been a little harder to sell investors on them. Solana is more degen and less boomer than either BTC or ETH. A lot of SOL buyers seem to be more likely to onboard via Phantom or Coinbase than with their retirement accounts. By the time SOL ETFs get approved, BTC/ETH combo, Litecoin, HBAR, and possibly XRP will all also have ETFs, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart said . Look, all I’m saying is there’s a reason BlackRock and Fidelity are yet to file for SOL ETFs. ETH ETFs have seen $35 billion in inflows in their first five months of trading. I expect SOL ETFs will have fewer inflows over their first five months. 4. Pump.fun won’t collect the most fees among memecoin platforms One of the most interesting stories to watch in Solanaland this year has been the unprecedented rise of memecoin launchpad pump.fun. Since launching in early 2024, pump has already crossed $330 million in revenue. Multiple times, purportedly-better versions of pump.fun have come out, but no one has been able to snatch the crown in the memecoin sector. But all good things must end, and I think pump.fun will be passed by another app this year. Speculative platforms tend to have a short shelf life in crypto — just ask the investors who valued OpenSea at $13.3 billion in 2022. I think memecoins will continue to be a very large contributor to Solana’s onchain volumes this year, but I don’t think the majority of that volume will play out on pump.fun. If I had to guess, I’d say the heir apparent will be something AI-related. 5. Solana will not experience a major outage Solana has experienced a number of outages in its four-year lifetime. This might be naive of me, but I don’t think it will add another outage to that ledger in 2025. This is a bold take because Firedancer, a fully unique Solana client, is set to take its training wheels off and greatly increase Solana’s throughput this year. This will create a lot of unseen potential risk vectors that could bring the chain down. But Solana’s frequency of outages has fallen over the past two years, presumably as the network’s developers learned from previous mistakes. The Solana Labs spin-off Anza recently created an invalidator team meant to stress test the network. Plus, Jump’s Firedancer client took years to build, and the rollout has taken place over multiple phases. What’s another outage-less 12 months?

This makes it even harder for residents to engage in crypto trading. These measures, which took effect on December 31, 2024, target cross-border crypto activities. Despite the crackdown, China still holds billions in Bitcoin (BTC), sparking questions about its real crypto strategy. China’s New Regulations for a Tighter Grip on Crypto The fresh regulations require banks to scrutinize crypto traders’ identities, track their funds’ sources, and monitor trading patterns. Liu Zhengyao, a lawyer from ZhiHeng law firm, noted that these regulations create a stronger legal framework. This framework targets crypto traders who try to bypass China’s strict rules. It aims to crack down on illegal cross-border crypto activities. In practice, converting China’s currency, the yuan, into crypto and using it to buy foreign currencies could now be flagged as cross-border activity. This makes it increasingly difficult to engage in crypto trading without falling foul of the authorities. China’s Paradox: Tight Regulations and a Massive Bitcoin Stash While China has imposed strict measures to restrict crypto trading, it holds a massive 194,000 Bitcoin worth around $18 billion. According to the Bitcoin Treasuries tracker from Bitbo, these holdings come from asset seizures linked to illegal activities. The fact that China holds such a large amount of Bitcoin raises eyebrows, considering its tough stance on digital assets. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao speculated during the Bitcoin MENA event that China could eventually pivot toward a Bitcoin reserve strategy. While this is unlikely in the immediate future, it is an intriguing paradox. China is cracking down on crypto while stockpiling one of the world’s most valuable digital assets. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum: A Strong Context for China’s Crypto Stash Currently, Bitcoin is priced at $92,983.54, continuing its bullish trend in a bearish market. This surge in Bitcoin’s value is no small factor considering China’s vast holdings. If the country shifted toward using Bitcoin in its financial strategy, it would gain a massive asset. This asset would be worth tens of billions of dollars. This paradox highlights a deeper tension in China’s crypto policy. On one hand, the government aims to protect its financial system from the risks of uncontrolled crypto trading. On the other hand, it’s quietly positioning itself as a major player in the Bitcoin market by accumulating significant holdings.

The liquidity for this initiative will come from 16,310,285,772.6 FLOKI tokens held in the community buyback wallet. A portion of these tokens will fund the ETP, while the remainder will be permanently burned, reducing the overall token supply. Floki DAO’s Liquidity Allocation for ETP Creation The Floki ETP offers a regulated investment vehicle designed to attract institutional and retail investors looking for cryptocurrency exposure through secure and familiar platforms. By mirroring the functionality of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , the ETP allows investors to hold FLOKI without direct asset ownership. This launch aligns Floki with Dogecoin, the only other memecoin to achieve this milestone. Launching a regulated investment product for a memecoin presents notable challenges, including regulatory scrutiny, liquidity concerns, and the volatility commonly associated with meme-based cryptocurrencies. However, Floki has partnered with a leading asset manager and an ETP issuer to navigate these hurdles. A core advisor at Floki emphasized the relevance of this launch, stating that it represents an important step toward memecoin legitimacy in traditional finance. Floki DAO’s Regulatory Milestones and Future Growth As Floki prepares to launch its ETP, it has also gained recognition in regulatory discussions. On November 21, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) acknowledged Floki as a utility token during the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting. This milestone placed Floki alongside major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Avalanche in shaping the regulatory framework for digital assets. Floki’s NFT-based metaverse game , Valhalla, set to launch in early 2025, played a crucial role in gaining this recognition.

Metaplanet has a reputation as Japan’s version of MicroStrategy. And Gerovich didn’t frame this as a “maybe” scenario. He was certain. “The Bitcoin community helped elect Trump,” he said . “Now, he’s expected to deliver. If America adopts Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the rest of the world won’t just watch. They’ll act.” Gerovich’s company switched its entire strategy in 2024 to focus on Bitcoin accumulation. “For us, April was when it clicked. All we care about now is stacking more Bitcoin for our shareholders,” he said. If 2024 was the year the world started taking Bitcoin seriously, 2025 will be the year it becomes a global reserve asset. Trump could set off a global Bitcoin race “Japan looks to the U.S. like a big brother,” Gerovich said. “If Trump moves forward, Japan and other Asian nations will copy the playbook. That’s how this works.” “For third-world countries, Bitcoin could stabilize their economies,” he said. “We’re about to see the full force of game theory in action.” In simple terms, if one country starts using Bitcoin to strengthen its reserves, others will feel pressure to do the same—or risk being left behind. Governments in the Middle East are already acting, though quietly. Gerovich shared insights from a recent Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi. “We spoke to officials from the region, and they’re buying Bitcoin under the radar. They just haven’t announced it yet,” he said. “After Trump declares a Bitcoin reserve, countries will come out and say, ‘Guess what? We’ve got Bitcoin too.’” Why governments might (and might not) jump on Bitcoin The idea of using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve isn’t as crazy as it sounded a few years ago. Countries like El Salvador and Bhutan have already done it. El Salvador holds around 6,000 BTC, worth over $567 million. Bhutan’s stash is even bigger—almost 12,000 BTC, valued at more than $1.1 billion. Both countries see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a kind of “digital gold” for their reserves. The U.S., under Trump’s leadership, could take this idea to another level. Reports suggest a plan to buy 200,000 BTC annually for five years, totaling one million BTC. But this isn’t without risks. Bitcoin’s volatility is legendary. Prices can swing wildly in hours, let alone months. That makes it a risky asset for national reserves. Plus, regulations are still uncertain. Governments would need rock-solid systems to manage their holdings and avoid the kind of hacks that have plagued crypto exchanges. Then there’s the problem of utility. Critics argue Bitcoin doesn’t have the same practical value as traditional reserves like gold or oil. You can’t use Bitcoin to fuel an economy in the middle of a crisis. And let’s not forget market manipulation. These governments could potentially destabilize markets, putting the entire industry at risk. Still, the potential upsides are hard to ignore.

He claimed that his forward guidance for the coin has not changed in the last three years when Bitcoin price traded at just $20,000. This latest forecast is one of the boldest for the coin looking ahead into 2025. Factors to Drive the Price Growth – Halving and Pump PlanB highlighted two of his previous X posts where he made some predictions about the future outlook of Bitcoin. One of these posts dates back to October 2022 while he shared the other last year. In the earlier post, the analyst noted that his forward guidance for the next three years for Bitcoin takes account of the 2024 halving event. He noted that the halving can significantly boost the price of BTC. PlanB is convinced that most of the Stock-2-Flow (S2F) model impact will play out this year. Utlimately, this validates the S2F target of approximately $500,000 projected for this year. Before Q4, 2024 came to an end, Bitcoin price hit $100,000 and rallied as high as $108,000 , setting it as an All-Time High (ATH). The coin has pared off its gains thus far. At the moment, the coin is currently trading at $94,591.42 amid a 1.16% surge in the past 24 hours. Per his latest forecast, PlanB struck the $100,000 level from his list. Besides the average target of $500,000, he said the coin could trade in the high range of $250,000 to $1 million. My forward guidance for 2025 has not changed since 2022 (when bitcoin was 20k, see below): rise into April 2024 halving halving around S2F value pump after halving 100k in 2024 2025: hit S2F target ~500k average (range 250k-1m) https://t.co/Neet5BQ90W pic.twitter.com/osA3vXAW9D — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) January 1, 2025 The New 2025 Bitcoin Price Range Target The PlanB price target for Bitcoin may seem insurmountable to a few market observers but it is worth noting that it aligns with predictions from other experts. The general 2025 BTC price predictions noted that the coin’s valuation may fall within the range of $150,000 to $300,000. Several experts believe the potential establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve will be a key event that could help propel the coin to new highs in 2025. Institutional investors’ adoption is another factor that could serve as a lever for the price of the coin. Business intelligence and software firm MicroStrategy is one of the institutions leading this movement. Recently, MicroStrategy bought 2,138 BTC for $209 million to take its total count to 446,400 BTC. Other firms like Riot Platforms and Semler Scientific are also joining the trend.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-01 21:50:38

Let’s dive into the milestones, trends, and predictions shaping the next era of crypto. This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol , our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. 1. A Look Back: Top Crypto Tech Milestones of 2024 Ethereum’s Duncun Upgrade: 2024 marked Ethereum’s most significant network upgrade yet. Ethereum activated the Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) upgrade, a landmark improvement designed to enhance scalability and reduce data fees, marking a pivotal step in the network's evolution. Duncun introduced proto-danksharding , a mechanism aimed at lowering costs for Layer-2 rollups by simplifying data availability and improving transaction throughput. The changes, though immensely debated , aimed to benefit developers and pave the way for further innovations in Ethereum’s roadmap, reinforcing its position as the leading smart contract platform. Solana Locks in Value: Solana's DeFi TVL hit $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) for the first time in three years, with its DeFi ecosystem experiencing even more growth. This achievement reflects increased user engagement and the expansion of decentralized applications on the platform. This growth was significantly helped by institutional adoption and major integrations. Financial giants like Franklin Templeton and Société Générale leveraged Solana for tokenized asset projects. Solana also expanded its reach with Robinhood adding SOL to its trading platform and Cboe Global Markets filing for Solana-linked ETFs , signaling increased confidence in its infrastructure. Quantum Computing’s Warning Bell: Google’s advancements in quantum computing, particularly with its revolutionary quantum chip, raised alarms within the crypto community about the potential threats to blockchain security. The chip’s ability to solve problems far beyond the reach of classical computers reignited debates around Bitcoin’s reliance on traditional encryption methods and the broader implications for the crypto ecosystem. Experts emphasized the urgency of transitioning to quantum-resistant encryption to safeguard cryptocurrencies against future vulnerabilities. While current quantum computers are not yet capable of compromising blockchain networks, Google’s progress underscored the need for proactive measures to ensure the long-term security and resilience of digital assets. Layer-2 Adoption Soars: Layer-2 adoption surged as projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base played pivotal roles in addressing Ethereum’s scalability challenges. Arbitrum continued to dominate the Layer-2 ecosystem, crossing 1 billion in transactions , driven by its strong developer support and DeFi integrations. Optimism continued to expand its influence with its OP Stack technology , which enable modular Layer-2 solutions and foster ecosystem-wide collaboration through its integration into Optimism’s Superchain. Base, a Layer-2 incubated by Coinbase, gained significant traction as it leveraged Coinbase's extensive user base and on-ramps, with Franklin Templeton becoming the first asset manager to launch a tokenized treasury fund on the network. DeFi Leaders Innovate: Aave became the focus of a new fund launched by Grayscale Investments in October, providing institutional and accredited investors with exposure to its governance token (AAVE) through a traditional investment vehicle; Uniswap Labs announced Unichain , a decentralized Layer-2 blockchain built with Optimism's OP Stack, designed to enhance transaction speed, reduce costs, and improve cross-chain interoperability, with plans for a 2025 mainnet launch; and MakerDAO rebranded to Sky as part of its Endgame Plan, introducing new governance (SKY) and stablecoins (USDS), autonomous ""Sky Stars,"" deflationary tokenomics, and a roadmap for transitioning fully from MKR to SKY tokens. 2. Emerging Trends for 2025 AI x Blockchain: The integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain is set to revolutionize identity verification, predictive analytics, and smart contract automation — and, hopefully, curtail negative side effects of AI . Regulated Crypto Hubs: Jurisdictions like Hong Kong, Dubai, and Singapore are positioning themselves as crypto-friendly innovation centers , attracting startups and institutional investors alike. Interoperability Takes Center Stage: Cross-chain protocols will dominate development , enabling seamless asset transfers and collaboration between blockchain ecosystems. 3. Developer Spotlight: 2024 in Numbers The Electric Capital Developer Report : The report highlighted sustained growth in blockchain development with a 35% increase in active developers. Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, Base, and Polygon led the pack, showcasing their strong developer communities. Solana was the biggest draw for new developers, bringing in 7,625 new developers in 2024, surpassing Ethereum. Solana's appeal, driven by its low fees, fast transactions and many memecoins , positions it as a formidable competitor in the smart contract arena. 4. What to Watch in 2025 Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade: Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade has been split into two phases, Prague and Electra, to ensure a smoother rollout of key improvements to the consensus and execution layers. The Electra phase will enhance validator efficiency, bolster network security, and introduce improved mechanisms for managing validator exits. Scaling Solutions: ZK-rollups and modular blockchains will drive the next wave of scalability , ensuring smoother user experiences. Zero-knowledge proofs are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling enhanced privacy and efficiency while paving the way for a future where blockchain networks can scale seamlessly without compromising decentralization. Decentralized Identity: The rise of decentralized identity solutions could redefine how users interact with Web3 platforms, emphasizing privacy and ownership.These systems leverage blockchain technology to give users control over their personal data, allowing them to verify their identities without relying on centralized authorities. 5. Final Thought 2024 set the stage for crypto's next chapter, with breakthroughs in scalability, DeFi, and security shaping a transformative year ahead.",Tech|Milestones|The Protocol|Newsletters|Crypto 2024|Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SOL|TECHNOLOGY|ARB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-01 22:01:12

The reform comes when Syria has been struggling with decades of conflict and economic mismanagement that have left its infrastructure in ruins and its currency devalued. Integrating Blockchain into Syria’s Economy At the heart of the plan is the digitization of the Syrian pound through blockchain. The digital currency is to be backed with reserves of Bitcoin, gold, and U.S. dollars in order to gain confidence and stability. Besides that, the government wants to legalize the mining and trading of Bitcoin within a strict regulatory framework. The initiative hopes to spur a new mining industry-which the country would be well-placed for, given abundant energy resources-while addressing concerns about monopolization and environmental impact. Supporting Businesses and Remittances The plan seeks the incorporation of Bitcoin into financial services, startups, and currency exchanges to spur economic recovery. It focuses on streamlining remittances-a major source of income for many Syrian families-and opening up opportunities to businesses that have been crippled by many years of conflict. Key in this is privacy and security: residents must be afforded the right to self-custody their digital assets free of exploitation. Challenges Overcome But the plan comes with many obstacles. The country is under strict international sanctions, still lacks modern technological infrastructure, and runs huge debts from the previous regime. And while Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means that it can avoid traditional banking restrictions, implementing such a system will require significant technological investment and international cooperation. Legal and Ethical Considerations The reform proposition is toward a transparent and legitimate financial system, not one embracing the illicit use of virtual currencies by outfits such as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham. This jihadist group, formerly part of al-Qa’idah, has used digital currencies to finance activities, as various reports claimed, hence raising ethical and legal considerations. In contrast, this plan by the Syrian Center for Economic Research will seek to benefit all citizens through legitimate channels overseen by the transitional government. Global precedents, the way forward for Syria: This has been tried with partial success by countries such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic. There was some higher tourism inflow in El Salvador and partial foreign direct investment inflow, though much criticism about economic risk. The geopolitics around Syria is particularly complicated, but if pulled off, this could be a unique leading position in cryptocurrency adoption for Syria within the Middle East.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|REGULATION|BTG,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-01 22:06:41

In 2024, a year that defied expectations, the market added over $10 trillion in value. Think about it: that’s more than the combined GDP of many major economies. Over the past four and a half years, the market’s capitalization has doubled . Meanwhile, the entire stock markets of China, Hong Kong, and Europe combined trail behind by 50%. And let’s not even get started on the fact that the “Magnificent Seven” tech companies alone have a market cap larger than Europe’s entire stock market. This level of dominance is historic. The S&P 500 is expected to close out 2024 with a 24.3% increase, mirroring last year’s 24.2% rise. Back-to-back years of 20%+ growth? That hasn’t happened since the late 90s. It’s a monster bull run for the history books. Tech giants push the market to new heights The “Magnificent Seven” deserve their spotlight. Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta didn’t just lead the charge , they bulldozed the competition. Nvidia, riding the hype of AI advancements, became a Wall Street darling. Its stock price soared to $134.37 by year’s end, with a 30% year-over-year revenue increase. Tesla was another headline grabber. With a stock price of $404.57, the company shattered records by delivering 500,000 vehicles in Q3 alone. That’s a 20% revenue jump in a single year. Add in its groundbreaking battery tech, and you’ve got investors throwing cash at it like it’s going out of style. Microsoft? Oh, it had a year. Azure cloud revenue shot through the roof, driving a 25% annual revenue boost. Its stock closed the year at $421.18, making it one of the most reliable players in the tech industry. Apple didn’t lag behind either. With its iPhones flying off shelves, particularly in emerging markets, its stock closed at $250.21. Alphabet and Amazon rounded out the pack with strong performances in cloud computing, advertising revenue, and e-commerce. The numbers speak for themselves. Amazon hit $219.27 per share, boosted by a surge in Prime memberships and a 30% growth in AWS revenue. Alphabet? A steady $190.22, thanks to recovering ad spending and a strong Q3. Indices break records as the economy rebounds The S&P 500 hit 57 new all-time highs in 2024 alone. By December 31, analysts were already projecting another 10% increase for 2025. But it was the Nasdaq Composite that outshone everything, boasting a 30% annual gain. Smaller indices though were completely left in the dust. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average, often considered the more traditional face of the market, held its ground. But the year was also about the U.S. economy showing off its resilience. Businesses adapted to higher interest rates. Consumers kept spending. Inflation is still volatile, but not enough to scare off investors. The Federal Reserve was part of the party too. Their announcement of just two planned interest rate cuts for 2025 was met with strong, if a bit mixed, reactions. Some investors wanted more aggressive action, but the market kept pushing upward. Corporate profits surged, and companies adapted faster than anyone expected. Bitcoin and stocks crashed though. Crypto’s champion MicroStrategy And then there’s MicroStrategy. While most investors stuck to traditional equities, this company doubled down on crypto. By the end of 2024, it had over 444,000 Bitcoins. Its stock (MSTR) surged after President Trump won the election, which made it a standout in a year dominated by tech giants. In fact, it is currently one of the most-watched stocks this year. Analysts have big hopes for the company. Though after Bitcoin’s price correction, MSTR also tumbled. Its closing price was $289.62. The stock reached its all-time high of $543 on November 20. MicroStrategy has received a consensus rating categorized as a “buy” from analysts, with a median price target of $1,403.22, a high estimate of $2,890.00, and a low estimate of $400.00.

The recently New York-approved Ripple RLUSD stablecoin, which uses modest quantities of XRP for transactions, is directly related to XRP’s value, driving market demand. The listing of RLUSD on Uphold, MoonPay, and Bitso has increased investor interest, with XRP holding firm support above $2.22. Analysts expect the XRP price to rise to the $5 level soon, especially if Ripple gets U.S. ETF certification. These changes make XRP one of the most exciting cryptocurrencies to monitor, offering early investors significant growth potential.

Table of Contents XRP’s path to $5: An uphill battle Lightchain AI: A force in blockchain innovation Lightchain AI to achieve a 20x rally Ripple (XRP) has long been a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, celebrated for its ability to revolutionize cross-border payments. However, as XRP faces challenges in scaling to new price levels, emerging projects like Lightchain AI are proving to be compelling alternatives. Priced at $0.004 in its presale, Lightchain AI has gained significant traction, raising over $7 million and positioning itself as a high-growth contender with the potential to outpace XRP’s performance. XRP’s path to $5: An uphill battle Ripple’s XRP coin plays a key role in world payments, facilitating quick, cheap trade among money groups. Even with its known use, XRP’s rise to $5 depends on getting past a few obstacles, like stronger competition from other blockchains. Although Ripple has key wins in its court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the top rules still stay h͏ard. Moreover, XRP’s need for big firms using it makes it less appealing to small buyers who mainly look for opportunities that give both use and fast growth. Lightchain AI: A force in blockchain innovation Lightchain AI has quickly gained recognition as a platform designed to integrate AI systems into decentralized environments. Unlike traditional blockchain networks, Lightchain AI focuses on creating practical solutions for advanced computation and data management. Its unique approach has resonated with investors, leading to a highly successful presale that highlights confidence in its long-term viability. The project’s ability to attract both developers and enterprises demonstrates its potential to address real-world challenges. With its emphasis on fostering collaboration and creating decentralized applications that utilize intelligent systems, Lightchain AI provides a competitive edge that traditional financial-oriented blockchains may lack. Lightchain AI to achieve a 20x rally At its presale price of $0.004, Lightchain AI presents a unique opportunity for early investors to capitalize on its rapid growth potential. Achieving a 20x rally would bring its token price to $0.08, a realistic milestone given its current market interest and growing adoption. The platform’s technical strengths and ability to provide tailored solutions for decentralized environments contribute to the likelihood of outperforming older blockchain networks. While XRP has established its dominance in specific niches, Lightchain AI’s broader appeal and transformative framework make it a versatile player in the evolving blockchain landscape. This versatility could attract a wide array of users, driving demand for its token and accelerating its market performance.

Could this be the moment investors have been waiting for? And more importantly, will altcoins join the rally? Bitcoin Indicators Show Signs of Bottoming Out On both the daily and weekly charts, key technical indicators for Bitcoin suggest that a reversal may be imminent. The Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch), which measures momentum, has hit oversold levels, indicating that sellers might be exhausted. Similarly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular tool to assess whether an asset is overbought or oversold, is hovering near its bottom range. Historically, such levels have often preceded significant price recoveries. This convergence of oversold conditions on multiple timeframes paints a promising picture for Bitcoin. If history repeats itself, a breakout could be on the horizon, possibly pushing Bitcoin to reclaim key resistance levels and set the stage for a new bullish trend. Q1: A Key Period for Ethereum’s Growth While Bitcoin’s potential reversal is exciting, Q1 has historically been a period of growth for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ethereum’s price often follows Bitcoin during market recoveries, but it has its own catalysts that drive unique growth. Ethereum’s network upgrades, growing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), and the increasing popularity of layer-2 scaling solutions frequently gain momentum in the first quarter of the year. Investors and developers alike tend to double down on Ethereum’s potential during this period, leading to significant price increases. If Bitcoin’s reversal triggers a broader market rally, Ethereum could lead the charge among altcoins. Altura ($ALU): One of the Most Bullish Projects Ahead Amid the broader market anticipation, Altura ($ALU) stands out as one of the most bullish projects for the coming months. Altura is revolutionizing the gaming and NFT industry by providing smart NFT solutions that enable developers to integrate dynamic NFTs into their games. This innovation allows in-game assets to evolve and adapt based on gameplay, creating a more immersive and engaging experience for players. What makes Altura particularly promising is its strong community support and growing list of partnerships with game developers. As blockchain-based gaming gains traction, Altura’s native token, $ALU, could see exponential growth. If Bitcoin and Ethereum rally as expected, Altura is well-positioned to ride the wave and deliver impressive returns for investors. Conclusion Bitcoin’s potential reversal is sparking excitement across the crypto market. With key indicators like Stoch and RSI signaling a bottom, the stage is set for a rebound. Ethereum, as always, is likely to shine in Q1, fueled by its strong ecosystem and historical trends. Meanwhile, Altura ($ALU) emerges as a standout altcoin, poised to capitalize on the growing blockchain gaming market. As the market gears up for what could be a pivotal period, investors are keeping a close eye on these trends. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newcomer, now might be the time to position yourself for the opportunities ahead. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Remember 1973, when the global economy took a nosedive? Smart investors “bought the dips” and reaped the rewards. Today, meme coins offer a similar opportunity amidst the chaos, with projects like BTFD Coin (BTFD), Fartcoin (FRTC), and Simon’s Cat (CAT) leading the pack. Among these, BTFD Coin has captured the spotlight, smashing presale records by raising over $4.8 million. As analysts predict major gains for early adopters, these meme coins are more than just internet laughs; they’re becoming serious investment contenders. Meme coins have come a long way since the early Dogecoin days. Communities have grown stronger, projects have evolved, and real-world use cases like Play2Earn (P2E) games, staking rewards, and referral programs now drive their value. BTFD Coin is taking this momentum to new heights, combining community power with innovative features to dominate the meme coin scene. Let’s dive into how these coins stack up. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Meme Coin Revolution They say timing is everything, and BTFD Coin’s presale has perfect timing. It’s all about buying the dips, and $BTFD embraces this mantra. This meme coin’s presale started at just $0.000004 per coin and has climbed to $0.0000142 in Stage 13, with a total of 16 stages before its planned listing price of $0.0006. BTFD Coin’s P2E game, in its entirety, is live, enabling players to experience the game and receive rewards. In just a few weeks, over 60 billion $BTFD tokens have been sold to more than 7,300 holders, raising a jaw-dropping $4.8 million. The secret? A strong mix of features that blend fun with serious earning potential: Play2Earn Game : The buzz around BTFD’s upcoming P2E platform is hard to ignore. Gamers will earn $BTFD tokens while immersing themselves in addictive gameplay. Referral Program : Get rewarded for spreading the word. Community building has never been this profitable. Staking Rewards : Holders can stake $BTFD for juicy returns, adding another layer to its utility. Drawing inspiration from the 1973 crash, where icons like Warren Buffett excelled, $BTFD presents a compelling investment opportunity. At a low price of $0.000142 in Stage 13, it’s an affordable entry point for potential substantial returns. The exclusive BIG50 bonus provides you with a 50% bonus on your purchase (e.g., buy 100, receive 150) with code BIG50. Now’s the time to acquire $BTFD and prepare for potential market growth. Fartcoin (FRTC): The Comedic Underdog with a Loyal Fanbase If you thought the crypto market couldn’t get more creative, say hello to Fartcoin (FRTC). What started as a joke among developers is now turning heads. FRTC is banking on its comedic branding and grassroots approach to stand out in a saturated market. What makes FRTC unique is its refusal to take itself too seriously while delivering solid tokenomics. With a deflationary supply and a loyal, meme-loving fanbase, FRTC has gained traction on social platforms. It’s not just about laughs, though. The team is working on utility features, including NFT integrations and community-driven governance. However, its biggest hurdle remains scalability. FRTC’s roadmap is ambitious, but the question is whether it can deliver in a space where memes come and go faster than your favourite TikTok trend. While the coin has potential, its price movements are more volatile, making it riskier for long-term investors. Still, if you’ve got a sense of humour and a love for crypto, FRTC might be worth a punt. Simon’s Cat (CAT): The Whiskered Wonder of Meme Coins There’s a good reason Simon’s Cat (CAT) has gained traction among Gen Z and Millennials. Inspired by the beloved animated series, CAT merges meme coin culture with nostalgia, making it a hit among internet-savvy investors. Launched on the Binance Smart Chain, CAT surged 69% last week following anticipation of an airdrop. Its team has nailed marketing, with token burns, exchange listings, and a strong social media presence driving its meteoric rise. But here’s the catch: CAT lacks a defined utility, and 30% of its supply is reserved for presale investors, leading to potential volatility. Still, CAT’s community is its strength. Fans of Simon’s Cat are fiercely loyal, and this meme coin could gain serious traction if it taps into broader adoption strategies. Think of exclusive NFTs or partnerships with gaming platforms. For now, CAT remains a speculative play, but one with a fun twist. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale: A Quick Guide Getting in on the BTFD Coin presale is easy as pie.

38405286,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323995,1735771480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38405286.jpeg,Bitcoin DeFi Trends Predicated to Soar in 2025,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-defi-trends-predicated-to-soar-in-2025/,"The year 2024 was monumental for Bitcoin (BTC). For the first time ever, Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 per coin . This all-time high sparked renewed interest in crypto from both regulators and investors alike, prompting fresh conversations around Bitcoin DeFi. As Bitcoin continued to gain traction, industry experts believed that decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases specific to BTC would escalate in the coming year. Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder and CEO of Build on Bitcoin (BOB), told Cryptonews that the first wave of Bitcoin DeFi took place in 2024 . “Teams started building products last year consisting of emerging layer-2 (L2) scaling networks and DeFi protocols for Bitcoin,” Zamyatin said. “But this was just the beginning, as all of these products are finally going live in 2025.” Bitcoin Liquid Staking and Liquidity Options Zamyatin explained that the Bitcoin L2 Babylon will launch this year , creating safe and simple channels for users to participate in Bitcoin staking. He noted that Bitcoin Secured Networks (BSN) will connect to the BOB L2 network, boosting the growth of Bitcoin liquid staking . According to Zamyatin, the more BTC liquid staking tokens (LSTs) are used on chains like BOB, the more fees are generated on those chains, which then share a portion back with BTC stakers. This cycle potentially draws more BTC into staking. $3.5bn BTC staked so far Let that sink in. And we’re only just getting started. Still 700+ blocks to go. Cap-3 is still open. For those who have already staked directly through the Babylon protocol, you can now head over to our discord, verify your BTC address and secure… pic.twitter.com/p6ZIr7NByi — Babylon (@babylonlabs_io) December 12, 2024 LSTs representing claims on staked BTC already reached $5.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) by January 1, 2025, according to stakingrewards.com . Enabling Liquidity Without Selling BTC Granite is another Bitcoin DeFi project launching in 2025. Granite is an autonomous liquidity protocol built on the Stacks Bitcoin L2 blockchain . The protocol allows borrowers to take stablecoin loans using Bitcoin as collateral, without exposure to counterparty or rehypothecation risk. Rena Shah, COO of Trust Machines – a community of dedicated Bitcoin builders – told Cryptonews , that Granite enables Bitcoin holders to get liquidity without selling their Bitcoin. The end of 2024 is approaching, but there is still time to sign up for the @GraniteBTC waitlist. 2025, Bitcoin DeFi is coming. — Rena Shah (@renapshah) December 31, 2024 “DeFi hasn’t touched Bitcoin meaningfully, but with the increased price volatility, more people are looking for options to leverage their Bitcoin without selling it,” Shah said. “Granite finally allows Bitcoin users to unlock their assets through a DeFi protocol.” Given the maturing Bitcoin DeFi sector, Shah added that Bitcoin can potentially play the most important role in mainstream DeFi adoption in 2025. “With over a trillion dollars in BTC held across different wallets, the potential of Bitcoin staking services will be one of the most sought after spaces of Bitcoin for new and expanding companies looking to provide access to Bitcoin DeFi,” she remarked. Bitcoin Adoption in Institutional Lending Protocols While loans and staking are important for retail investors, institutional DeFi lending platforms will incorporate Bitcoin derivatives as collateral this year. Sidney Powell, CEO and Co-Founder of Maple Finance, told Cryptonews that Maple Finance is incorporating Lightning Bitcoin (LBTC) as collateral. Maple Institutional Wrapped: High Yield Secured Lending In 2024, our High Yield pool delivered 16.5% net APY to lenders, always overcollateralized. High Yield is positioned for an even stronger Q1 – deposit today to continue outperforming DeFi competitors. pic.twitter.com/MLzMGkgEu8 — Maple (@maplefinance) December 30, 2024 “This reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s high liquidity and low counterparty risk,” Powell said. “These advancements highlight Bitcoin’s evolving role as a cornerstone asset in decentralized lending, derivatives, and automated market maker (AMM) ecosystems.” Powell further believes that adoption of Bitcoin in institutional lending protocols will continue to expand, with Bitcoin serving as collateral in decentralized undercollateralized loans. “This trend reflects the broader integration of crypto into traditional finance, as institutions increasingly value blockchain’s transparency and efficiency ,” he commented. “Additionally, new use cases like Bitcoin Ordinals are opening up innovative opportunities for asset tokenization and creative finance solutions linked to Bitcoin.” Powell mentioned that use cases such as these further reflect how Bitcoin is being used beyond traditional narratives of store-of-value and payments. “With Bitcoin increasingly incorporated into institutional DeFi lending markets, it is poised to establish itself as a premier collateral asset within decentralized financial ecosystems,” he said. Improved UX Designs For Bitcoin DeFi Protocols Beyond L2 solutions, projects are refining user experiences (UX) to make Bitcoin DeFi more accessible. Matt Luongo, CEO of crypto venture production studio Thesis, revealed that Mezo – an economic layer for Bitcoin – prepared a UX upgrade focusing on a concept called “Cathedral and Bazaar.” BitcoinFi will dominate 2025 — Mezo (@MezoNetwork) December 31, 2024 According to Luongo, the core focus of Mezo’s offering will be an intuitive process for Bitcoin borrowing. This will allow users to collateralize their BTC and access a line of credit via mUSD, Mezo’s native stablecoin. This feature is currently live on the Mezo testnet. “Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions like Mezo will improve scalability and unlock smart contract capabilities for Bitcoin-based DeFi applications,” Luongo added. “I expect many of the highly anticipated projects to be live on the market in 2025, giving a full end-to-end Bitcoin DeFi experience.” Challenges for Bitcoin DeFi While 2025 offers promise, potential hurdles may slow adoption. Powell explained that new tax regulations in the United States will likely influence Bitcoin DeFi this year , particularly for institutional participants. “Stricter reporting requirements for crypto transactions could introduce added complexity for institutions leveraging Bitcoin in DeFi activities, such as using it as collateral in lending protocols or yield-generating strategies,” he remarked. As a result, these changes may require more detailed transaction tracking and could trigger taxable events at multiple stages. On the other hand, Powell believes that clearer tax policies could promote institutional adoption by alleviating regulatory uncertainty, which has long been a hurdle for large-scale market players. “Greater transparency and compliance may encourage institutions to engage more confidently with Bitcoin DeFi platforms,” he said. Retail investors may also be hesitant when it comes to earning yield on Bitcoin. Deven Soni, CEO of Matador Network, told Cryptonews that “the biggest knock on Bitcoin yield historically has been the centralization risk of platforms like Celsius and FTX.” However, Soni remarked that the rise of decentralized platforms that allow users to access DeFi/yield while holding custody of their crypto is something to look forward to this year.

See How It Compares to Struggling Altcoins!,https://thecoinrise.com/can-web3bay-be-the-ebay-killer-see-how-it-compares-to-struggling-altcoins/,"The digital economy is on the brink of significant change, with e-commerce and cryptocurrencies charting divergent paths. Web3Bay is at the forefront, harnessing blockchain’s power to enhance trust and user autonomy in online shopping. Conversely, well-known altcoins such as Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano are navigating through rough waters. Web3Bay ’s decentralized platform, fueled by the 3BAY token, seamlessly integrates traditional and crypto payments, offering a streamlined shopping experience. Meanwhile, these altcoins are contending with declining prices, driven by changing market sentiments and a drop in trading activity. Web3Bay: A Glimpse into the Future of E-Commerce Imagine a vibrant marketplace, not confined by physical space but sprawling across the blockchain, where trust is inherent in every transaction, and your personal data is entirely your own. This is the scenario Web3Bay is crafting. It aims to revolutionize online shopping by eliminating central oversight, thus returning power to the consumers. Operating on a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay melds security, transparency, and efficiency to rival industry giants like eBay. At the core of this transformation is the 3BAY token, the lifeblood of the ecosystem. This token isn’t just a currency; it’s a tool for empowerment. Token holders can steer the platform’s governance to reflect the community’s will, enjoying perks like a 5% discount on marketplace purchases. With a presale designed to incentivize early adopters, the 3BAY token offers potential returns up to 6430%, representing a compelling investment opportunity. The marketplace itself marries traditional and modern, accepting crypto payments alongside standard options like PayPal. This dual approach connects the old and new worlds of commerce, making Web3Bay inviting for both crypto veterans and newcomers alike. Additional features like IPFS storage for secure data handling and robust blockchain infrastructure ensure transactions are smooth, even during peak demand. With 580 million crypto users worldwide and growing confidence in blockchain finance, Web3Bay is set to revolutionize online shopping. As more consumers demand control, privacy, and security, Web3Bay’s vision for a decentralized e-commerce future is becoming increasingly compelling. Altcoins Under Pressure: Stellar, Dogecoin, & Cardano Experience Downturns In recent market shifts, several leading altcoins have faced significant downward trends. Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano have each encountered headwinds, reflecting broader market sentiments and distinct investor behaviors. Stellar , dedicated to streamlining cross-border payments, has seen its value dip due to market dynamics and investor outlook. Although the platform is advancing its technology and partnerships, the prevailing market slump has taken a toll on its valuation. Dogecoin , which began as a satirical crypto token, has undergone substantial price swings. Despite earlier boosts from community support and celebrity endorsements, DOGE’s price has recently fallen. This decline is partly due to a decrease in trading volume and open interest, suggesting a cooling of trader interest. Notably, DOGE’s trading volume plummeted by approximately $14.84 billion to a 40-day low of $5.29 billion, and open interest fell by nearly $1.4 billion, indicating a downturn in short-term trading activity. Cardano , celebrated for its rigorous, research-based approach and a focus on security, has also seen its price drop. Despite ongoing development and a robust community support, ADA’s market performance is swayed by overall market trends and investor sentiment. Analysts suggest, however, that Cardano’s price could ascend by 30% of the crypto market rallies, hinting at a potential rebound. These instances highlight the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility, where prices can swiftly shift due to various factors including market mood, technological advancements, and global economic conditions. Investors are thus encouraged to conduct thorough research and weigh the risks associated with digital assets. Summing Up As e-commerce entities like Web3Bay push forward with decentralization, the struggles of altcoins underscore the inherent unpredictability within blockchain ventures. Web3Bay sets itself apart with a blend of security, transparency, and efficiency, offering a unique decentralized shopping experience. Meanwhile, the tribulations of Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano remind us that crypto valuations are heavily swayed by market sentiment, technological evolution, and investor behavior. While Web3Bay advances its pioneering future, the volatile nature of altcoin prices reflects the broader uncertainties of the crypto landscape.

According to Etherscan data reported by crypto reporter Colin Wu, Buterin donated a total of 100 ETH to Pertsev on two occasions, helping him pay legal fees. “[Vitalik] donated 50 ETH, worth about $170,000, to Juicebox: Support Alexey Pertsev today Currently, Juicebox: Support Alexey Pertsev has raised more than 184 ETH. Alexey Pertsev is a Tornado Cash developer and is seeking more funds to pay for ongoing legal fees. [Vitalik] donated another 50 ETH to Juicebox: Support Alexey Pertsev today, totaling 100 ETH, worth about $340,000.” An X page dedicated to helping the Tornado Cash developers publicly thanked Buterin for the donation. In May of 2024, Pertsev was sentenced to five years and four months in prison by a Dutch court for allegedly laundering billions of dollars. The US banned the use of Tornado Cash in 2022, citing national safety concerns. However, a US appeals court sided with Tornado Cash in November of last year, effectively overturning its ban by saying the Treasury Department’s actions against it were unlawful. The judge in the case ruled that smart contracts do not technically qualify as “property” and thus the ban under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act – which allows the President to “block any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest” – was an overreach of power.

That’s why when it comes to managing digital assets, having the best crypto wallet can make all the difference. Whether someone’s a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just starting their journey, choosing a reliable wallet is key to keeping funds secure and accessible. With options like PlusWallet, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and Exodus Wallet gaining popularity, it’s essential to explore what sets these wallets apart. This article will dive into four of the top crypto wallets and highlight their strengths. 1. PlusWallet: Security, Flexibility & Rewards—All in One! When it comes to choosing the best crypto wallet, PlusWallet delivers a powerful combination of advanced tools, unmatched security, and income-generating opportunities. Designed for today’s crypto enthusiasts, PlusWallet stands out with its multi-chain compatibility, allowing users to manage assets across numerous blockchains seamlessly. This wallet ensures maximum flexibility while maintaining top-tier protection for digital holdings. PlusWallet’s innovative rewards mechanism truly sets it apart. With the Swap to Earn feature, users can earn USDT rewards on every transaction—there are no caps, no gimmicks, just real earnings. PlusWallet transforms every trade into an opportunity to grow assets, making it a favorite among active traders. Unlike traditional wallets, which offer limited or no passive income options, PlusWallet rewards its users consistently, providing both ease and profitability. On average, users can start claiming rewards after accumulating just 5 USDT, which are processed within 24 to 48 hours—fast, reliable, and hassle-free. Additionally, PlusWallet’s referral program takes earning potential to the next level. Every time someone’s referred friends make a swap, they earn a percentage of the commission in USDT too! 2. Trust Wallet: A Top Pick For Crypto Travelers Trust Wallet is designed specifically for Android and iOS devices and ensures smooth operations for users who prefer a mobile experience. With support for multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin, Trust Wallet provides a seamless way to manage diverse digital assets in one place. Travelers can also showcase or collect digital art with ease, thanks to the wallet’s integrated NFT management features. Trust Wallet goes the extra mile with its built-in crypto exchange, allowing users to swap assets quickly without leaving the app—a lifesaver for last-minute transactions. Although it lacks a native desktop app, its mobile-first approach ensures convenience for those constantly on the go. 3. MetaMask: The Go-to Wallet for Web3 Enthusiasts For users looking to explore the decentralized web, MetaMask has earned its place as a top choice in the crypto wallet space. Available as both a mobile app and a browser extension, MetaMask offers the flexibility to manage assets on the go or from a laptop. It supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible networks, making it a versatile tool for managing crypto portfolios. Users can use MetaMask to access decentralized finance platforms, connect with exchanges like Uniswap, or interact with NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea. However, its primary focus on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks may not suit those managing assets across multiple chains. 4. Exodus Wallet: A Blend of Style & Functionality When it comes to combining sleek design with practical features, Exodus Wallet stands out as a top choice. This wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Solana, meme coins, and stablecoins, making it versatile for various needs. With its built-in exchange, users can perform quick swaps between cryptocurrencies without ever leaving the app. Exodus also caters to security-conscious users by integrating with Trezor hardware wallets, ensuring extra protection for digital assets. Its cross-device synchronization allows it to seamlessly manage portfolios across desktop and mobile apps. While Exodus excels in design and user experience, it doesn’t offer extensive dApp support or advanced staking options compared to other wallets. Conclusion: The Best Crypto Wallets for Every Need Selecting the best crypto wallet hinges on specific requirements such as security, flexibility, and earning potential. Trust Wallet stands out for its mobile-friendly design and offering features like NFT integration. For those engaging with the decentralized web, MetaMask provides extensive support for Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks. For users who prioritize aesthetics and functionality, Exodus Wallet delivers a sleek interface alongside support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. But for traders seeking the best wallet with advanced features and earning opportunities without compromising on security, PlusWallet is the ideal go-to option. This wallet offers multi-chain compatibility, the Swap to Earn feature, and a transparent referral program. While each wallet—Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Exodus Wallet, and PlusWallet—brings unique advantages to the table, users can evaluate these options to identify the wallet that best aligns with their crypto management needs and goals.

Many believe it has the potential to grow by 2025. With early bets being placed, some wonder if DTX could outperform the more established players. Why is this platform getting so much buzz, and what could it mean for the crypto market? Ripple's SEC Battle: What's at Stake for XRP? The long-running legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has investors on edge. As the January 15 deadline for the SEC's opening brief approaches, speculation is rampant. There's a glimmer of hope for Ripple, though. With Paul Atkins set to take over as SEC Chair in January, many in the crypto community are optimistic. Atkins is seen as more crypto-friendly than current Chair Gary Gensler, and some experts believe this change in leadership could lead to the lawsuit being dismissed. XRP's price dropped 7.27% last week and is trading at $2.09. One XRP expert, EGRAG CRYPTO, predicts XRP could rise in a possible upswing. However, others warn that Ripple’s XRP price could drop to $1 before bouncing back. With the dicey status quo of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit and the recent unstable nature of XRP’s price, Ripple investors are setting their eyes on DTX Exchange, which experts believe affords more benefits. What's Next for Chainlink's Token Following LINK Whale Activity? A Chainlink whale recently deposited 250,000 LINK tokens, valued at $5.37 million, on Binance and OKX. Between December 14 and 18, the whale withdrew 595,000 LINK tokens from Binance, worth around $17.31 million. Chainlink's LINK token has seen a big price drop, as it fell 16.91% last week. It's now trading at $20.94. The recent price drop in Chainlink's LINK token was triggered by a liquidity sweep around the $22 mark. This critical level saw a large volume of LINK sell orders, and it caused a short-term price drop from around $26 to below $22. This activity could lead to future volatility as Chainlink traders target these liquidity-rich zones. This volatility is causing LINK investors to consider DTX Exchange as it promises maximal profits for investors. New Crypto Player Enters the Scene: DTX Exchange As 2024 comes to a close, a surprise contender is emerging in crypto. DTX Exchange is bringing together a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, ETFs, stocks, and bonds, all under one platform for a pleasant trading experience. This platform aims to make life easier for traders by offering an impressive 12,000 tradable assets. No more switching between different platforms! DTX Exchange's layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX, is the key to making this happen. It connects traditional assets with modern ones, creating a seamless experience. VulcanX has already launched its testnet, and the results are promising. It's expected to deliver an impressive 100,000 transactions per second, putting it ahead of the competition. This makes DTX Exchange an exciting player in the crypto space, and some experts think it could be one of the best cryptos to buy in the coming year. DTX Exchange Takes the Lead: Is it the Best Crypto to Buy? DTX Exchange is making waves in the crypto world, leaving XRP and Chainlink behind. It's become a go-to platform for accessing major ETF assets. The platform's native token, DTX, is currently in presale, and has already raised over $11 million in funding. Investors are taking notice, and the numbers look promising. Each DTX token is available for just $0.14 in the current stage, with predictions of an 80% return on investment. By the looks of it, DTX Exchange promises to be one of the best cryptos to buy in the coming year.

Trump 2025 (TRUM2025), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUM2025 is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump 2025 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump 2025 could become the next viral memecoin. Trump 2025 launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump 2025 on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump 2025 by entering its contract address – 5K2ESM1q2SjZFybttofLFpbbW8yF3isBRW3ZxDPUVfVY – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUM2025. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-01 23:17:17

With its official exchange listing just around the corner, the token has drawn significant attention. Recent market activity indicates a potential 220% surge, fueled by strategic accumulation and viral interest from XRP whales. As momentum builds, DTX is quickly emerging as one of the most talked-about tokens of 2024, with the potential to solidify its position as a breakout star heading into 2025. XRP on the Rise: RLUSD and Bullish Momentum Drive Optimism XRP has maintained its bullish momentum, trading near $2.11 and targeting critical resistance at $2.15, which could pave the way for a rally toward $2.50. On-chain activity surged in December, with transactional volume increasing by 40%, signaling heightened network utility and investor interest. Source: Tradingview The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s new stablecoin, has added another layer of optimism to XRP’s outlook. Backed 1:1 by USD reserves and cash equivalents, RLUSD was introduced on December 17 and is already making waves. Its use in cross-border transactions and integration into the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has enhanced liquidity, making XRP more attractive to institutional players. RLUSD’s transparent audits and regulatory approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) have further bolstered its credibility, positioning it as a serious competitor to stablecoin giants like USDT and USDC​ However, XRP faces near-term challenges. A recent downside triangle breakout hinted at potential retracements to key support levels between $1.75 and $1.64, where buyers may look to re-enter. Despite this, RLUSD’s growing adoption has reinvigorated XRP’s use case, potentially driving sustained price growth into 2025. DTX Token’s Viral Moment: Could It Pump 220%? While XRP garners attention for its bullish price action, DTX Token is quietly stealing the spotlight during its presale phase. Trading at just $0.14, DTX has already attracted interest from XRP whales, signaling growing confidence in the project’s potential. Whale accumulation during presales is often seen as a strong indicator of an asset’s future prospects, and DTX is no exception. DTX Token powers the DTX Exchange , a hybrid trading platform that integrates stocks, crypto, and forex markets into a seamless ecosystem. The exchange’s innovative approach has made it one of the most exciting projects in the blockchain space, offering users access to tokenized real-world assets, decentralized custody through the Phoenix Wallet, and advanced trading tools such as 1000x leverage. The presale phase has gained significant traction, as early investors recognize the token’s potential for explosive growth once it enters the broader market. With an anticipated exchange listing expected to drive demand, analysts are predicting a 220% pump or higher, as DTX transitions from its presale phase into active trading. DTX and XRP: Two Tokens to Watch in 2025 The synergy between DTX Token and XRP is creating a buzz that’s hard to ignore. While XRP’s recent activity points to strong bullish potential, DTX is emerging as a high-growth asset with the fundamentals to back its hype. XRP remains a cornerstone of blockchain-based financial solutions, leveraging its regulatory clarity and on-demand liquidity services to dominate cross-border payments. On the other hand, DTX offers a fresh perspective by integrating traditional markets with blockchain innovation, making it a unique player in the hybrid crypto category. Both tokens are poised for significant gains in early 2025. XRP’s resistance at $2.15 and potential rally toward $2.50 highlight its immediate bullish potential, while DTX’s viral moment and whale activity suggest that it could see exponential growth following its listing.

Deaton would boldly express his bullish stance on the XRP price, the pro-crypto lawyer outrightly stated that he had no idea how high the coin could soar. Deaton made a long post on X after Peter Chung, Head of Research at Presto, appeared on Squawk Box discussing crypto. John Deaton Slams Visible Boycott by Top Forecasters Chung noted his predictions about leading digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), for 2025. For BTC, the firm expects that it will hit $210,000, while SOL is forecasted to trade at $1,000. Deaton expressed his astonishment in light of these predictions, noting that XRP did not feature in the projections. He outlined the coin’s successes, including becoming the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, excluding USDT. Despite being the 3rd largest cryptocurrency by market cap (excluding Tether as a stable coin), no mention of XRP below. I’m surprised considering XRP is one of the few cryptocurrencies to finish December trading in the green. I don’t do price predictions but Barron’s recently… https://t.co/scamKncLKT — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 1, 2025 John Deaton also noted that XRP is one of the few cryptocurrencies that ended the year in the green. On this basis, he did not see the omission of XRP as fair. Though Deaton claimed that he never gave crypto predictions, he highlighted an earlier forecast by Barron. In a recent article, the American newspaper made some strong claims, including that “XRP has been one of the biggest post-election crypto winners and has quadrupled in value since Nov. 5.” Even Arthur Azizov, CEO of the crypto business B2BinPay, feels very bullish about XRP. Azizov predicted that XRP could reach a price range of $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025. To further furnish his stance, Azizov cited XRP’s strong momentum following the completion of the US elections. Additionally, he pointed to the strides made by Ripple to solidify its place as a key player in the crypto space. Where is XRP Headed? According to CoinMarketCap, the Ripple-associated coin currently has a market value of $2.31, following a 10.8% surge in the past 24 hours. While this is a significant boost, an earlier price analysis projects a $5 target for XRP this year amid growing whale embrace. Last month, top market analyst expert Ali Martinez pointed out that the coin is gearing up for a massive rally. He named the technical and historical trends around it as “one of the most promising setups” for XRP. Martinez then predicted that this setup indicates a potential rally to the $11 target on the horizon.

Web3Bay is making waves by using blockchain to bolster trust and user control in online shopping. On the flip side, popular altcoins such as Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano are hitting rough patches. Web3Bay ‘s decentralized market, driven by its 3BAY token, melds traditional and crypto payments, offering a smooth shopping journey. In contrast, these altcoins are feeling the pinch from falling prices, influenced by market sentiment and a downturn in trading activity. Web3Bay: Witness the Future of E-Commerce Unfold Imagine a bustling digital marketplace where each vendor’s stall is not on the streets but on the blockchain—a domain where every deal is built on trust and your data stays strictly yours. Web3Bay is turning this dream into reality. It’s set to overhaul online shopping by cutting out the middleman and returning power to the people. Constructed on a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay melds security, transparency, and efficiency, challenging tech behemoths like eBay. At the core of this shift, the 3BAY token acts as the backbone of the platform. This token is a Swiss Army knife for users, allowing them to shape the platform’s governance to reflect community needs and bag perks like a 5% discount on purchases. With a presale aimed at rewarding early birds, the 3BAY token dangles a carrot of potential returns up to 6430%, making it an attractive bet for investors. This marketplace seamlessly combines the old and the new, welcoming crypto payments alongside time-tested options like PayPal. This strategy builds a bridge between traditional and blockchain commerce, opening Web3Bay’s doors to everyone from blockchain buffs to newbies. Plus, features like IPFS storage for secure data management and a sturdy blockchain backbone ensure smooth sailing for transactions, even when the waters get choppy. With 580 million crypto users globally and a growing trust in blockchain finance, Web3Bay is poised to upend online shopping. As more consumers crave control, privacy, and security, Web3Bay’s blueprint for a decentralized shopping future is catching eyes as a viable alternative. Altcoins Feeling the Heat: Stellar, Dogecoin, & Cardano Face Declines In the latest market trends, several well-known altcoins have experienced notable dips. Stellar (XLM), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) are each wrestling with challenges, reflecting wider market sentiments and particular investor behaviors. Stellar , which prides itself on enabling cross-border payments, has seen its value dip amid market swings and shifts in investor mood. Despite ongoing advancements and partnerships, the current market slump has dented its valuation. Dogecoin , born as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has seen its share of ups and downs. Despite earlier rallies driven by community support and celebrity nods, DOGE’s price has taken a hit recently. This downturn is partly due to a drop in trading volume and open interest, suggesting cooling interest from traders. Notably, DOGE’s trading volume plummeted by about $14.84 billion, hitting a 40-day low of $5.29 billion, with open interest shrinking by nearly $1.4 billion, pointing to a drop-off in short-term trader activity. Cardano , celebrated for its rigorous, research-driven approach and focus on security, has also witnessed a decline in price. Despite continuous development and strong community backing, ADA’s market performance is swayed by broader market dynamics and investor sentiment. Yet, analysts remain optimistic, projecting a potential 30% rise in ADA’s price if the market conditions improve, signaling a chance for recovery. These developments underline the cryptocurrency market’s volatility, where prices are quick to react to a mix of factors, including market attitudes, tech advancements, and broad economic indicators. Thus, investors are encouraged to do their homework and weigh the risks when diving into these digital assets. Final Thoughts As platforms like Web3Bay push the envelope on decentralizing online shopping, the hurdles faced by altcoins spotlight the inherent unpredictability in blockchain ventures. Web3Bay distinguishes itself with a mix of security, transparency, and efficiency, presenting a unique opportunity for a decentralized shopping experience. Meanwhile, the trials of Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano serve as a reminder that market mood, technological strides, and investor actions can greatly sway crypto values. As Web3Bay forges ahead with its innovative vision, the fluctuating fortunes of these altcoins mirror the broader uncertainties of the crypto landscape.

The Stellar coin price has been bearish, reflecting the overall market sentiment. At the same time, Uniswap (UNI) has seen a 9% price drop, even with significant activity from large holders, leaving many wondering about the reasons behind it. BlockDAG (BDAG) , an up-and-coming layer-1 blockchain project, is stirring up excitement with a $1 million USDT New Year raffle. This raffle is not just about winning; it’s an opportunity to gain substantial rewards, including a 200% bonus on BDAG purchases. With enticing prize levels and a limited window to participate, it’s drawing the attention of crypto enthusiasts globally. Stellar’s Downtrend Continues: Can It Recover? Recently, the Stellar coin price has dropped by 10%, struggling to keep its market cap above $10 billion, now at $10.87 billion. Technical indicators like the RSI have fallen sharply, increasing the selling pressure and nearing oversold conditions. The Ichimoku Cloud analysis confirms the downtrend, showing Stellar trading below the cloud without any imminent signs of reversal. The market is closely monitoring the $0.351 support level. Should this level break, further declines in Stellar coin price are likely, though a rebound could push it towards $0.40. The RSI at 39.9 suggests a continued bearish shift, with potential for more declines unless the market finds stability. Uniswap’s 9% Drop Amidst Surging Whale Transactions Uniswap, a prominent decentralized exchange token, is showing conflicting signals. Despite a 200% boost in large holder transactions, Uniswap price has fallen 9% within just 48 hours, sparking debates over its immediate direction. The data indicates a spike in significant trades, suggesting strategic moves within the market, yet the absence of a clear direction keeps retail traders on edge. The trend of decreasing exchange inflows over the past three days suggests that holders are keeping their assets, usually a bullish indicator. However, despite the Uniswap price drop, there’s a chance for recovery if the $12 support level holds firm. If this support breaks, further declines could occur, with liquidation data revealing $818,000 at stake. Hurry, BlockDAG’s $1M USDT Raffle is Closing Soon! BlockDAG, a burgeoning blockchain platform, is ringing in the New Year with a grand giveaway, creating a thrilling opportunity for crypto enthusiasts to win big. This exciting $1 million USDT New Year raffle is calling on participants to grab BDAG coins and enter for a chance at substantial rewards. Each ticket purchase is sweetened with a 200% bonus, giving each entrant exceptional value for their involvement. This raffle is cleverly divided into three alluring prize tiers, each tailored to fit different levels of participation. The Bronze Tier allows for a $125 BDAG purchase, which includes a 200% bonus and the chance to win up to $250,000 USDT. The Silver Tier steps it up with a $250 purchase, a similar 200% bonus, and the potential to win $500,000 USDT. The premier Gold Tier, with a $500 entry, not only provides a 200% bonus but also the highest probability of snagging the coveted $1 million USDT grand prize. Winners will be declared on BlockDAG’s official Telegram, Twitter, and website channels. With the raffle concluding in just one day, excitement is mounting, attracting a large influx of participants to the presale, further boosting its triumph. Currently, the BDAG coin is listed at $0.0234 in its 26th batch, having amassed $174.5 million in the presale with over 17.6 billion BDAG coins distributed. Renowned as one of the highest ROI cryptos, early purchasers have seen a return of 2240% since its initial pricing at $0.001, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the crypto community. Wrap-Up Thoughts The crypto market is facing transformative shifts, with the Stellar coin price currently at a low of $0.33, indicating a downward trend, and Uniswap witnessing a significant price drop of 9% despite notable activity from large-scale traders. In this uncertain climate, BlockDAG’s $1 million New Year raffle emerges as a standout opportunity. Participants stand to gain from a hefty 200% bonus and vie for impressive prizes, including the $1 million USDT top award. With an impressive track record as one of the highest ROI cryptos—providing 2240% gains to its initial backers and raking in over $174.5 million in its presale—BlockDAG’s drive is unmistakable as it counts down the final day of its New Year raffle.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin.

How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field.

Memecoins have been at the centre of this frenzy, and the rise of Pepe Coin (PEPE) was a prime example. In 2023, PEPE took the crypto world by storm, turning early holders into overnight millionaires and sparking what some called a “meme coin season.” Investors watched as coins pumped and dumped in a flash, but PEPE’s deflationary charm and homage to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme ensured it wasn’t just another fleeting trend. While PEPE made history with its rapid rise and billion-dollar market cap, there’s no need to wallow if you missed that train. The next big thing is already here— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With a buzzing presale offering the lucrative BIG50 offer (50% extra BTFD Coins), a thriving community, and exciting features like staking and Play-to-Earn (P2E) games, BTFD is making a strong case for being one of the best meme coins to buy today. BTFD Coin: Bulls Are Owning the Meme Coin Moment Let’s talk about BTFD Coin, the new kid on the block that’s got everyone buzzing. Short for “Buy the Dip,” BTFD is more than just a clever name—it’s a rallying cry for those who see market dips as opportunities rather than obstacles. The presale is currently in its 13th stage, with tokens priced at $0.000142, and it’s been nothing short of explosive: $4.8 million raised so far, with milestones like hitting $1M in under 10 days— over 60 billion tokens sold, with a growing holder base of over 7,000 bulls. For example, by investing $1750 in BTFD Coin during Stage 13 at $0.000142 per coin and activating the BIG50 code, you would secure an impressive 18,086,620 coins (e.g. buy 100 and get 150 offer). As the presale progresses and the price rises to $0.0006 per coin, your investment would grow to an exciting $10,851.97, delivering a remarkable profit of $9,101.97. This illustrates the extraordinary earning potential of this presale opportunity, magnified by the BIG50 bonus advantage. But numbers aren’t the only reason BTFD is getting attention. This coin is building an ecosystem designed for engagement and growth. BTFD Coin has officially launched the full version of its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, enabling users to earn $BTFD tokens while playing. The project also features a referral program and staking rewards, establishing a comprehensive ecosystem designed for sustainable growth. The P2E game immerses users in the world of crypto bull runs, creating an interactive and fun way to participate in the project’s vision. It’s this kind of forward-thinking innovation that sets BTFD apart from typical meme coins. And let’s not forget the staking rewards. With a 90% APY, BTFD isn’t just about short-term gains—it’s about creating sustainable opportunities for investors. Imagine earning rewards just for holding onto your tokens—talk about making your money work for you. It’s no wonder analysts are predicting big things for BTFD when it lists at $0.0006, giving early adopters significant upside potential. Add in the Bulls Squad, a community of passionate holders rallying around this project, and it’s clear that BTFD isn’t just a coin—it’s a movement. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, BTFD is proving to be one of the best meme coins to buy today . Pepe Coin: The OG of Memecoin Season Pepe Coin, launched on Ethereum as a deflationary token, was created to pay homage to the beloved Pepe the Frog meme that dominated internet culture in the early 2000s. What set PEPE apart was its simplicity: no taxes, no overpromising utilities—just pure meme power. In 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap hitting an eye-popping $1.6 billion. This incredible run minted millionaires out of early holders and sparked a memecoin frenzy, with investors scrambling to find the next PEPE-like opportunity. While some coins pumped and dumped, PEPE managed to hold its own, thanks to its strong community of believers who rallied around its meme-centric ethos. However, like any whirlwind crypto success, the question remains: will PEPE and its memecoin peers rise to new highs, or was their peak the crescendo of a fleeting season? For those who missed the boat, it’s a tough pill to swallow—but the crypto market never sleeps. If PEPE was your missed chance, projects like BTFD Coin are here to ensure you don’t make the same mistake twice. Conclusion Pepe Coin showed us how quickly a meme can turn into a market sensation, creating millionaires and shaping the narrative of “meme coin season.” But the crypto space is all about what’s next, and BTFD Coin is making a strong case as the heir to the meme coin throne. With a booming presale, staking rewards that offer real value, and an engaged community driving its growth, BTFD is proving itself as one of the best meme coins to buy today. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Whether you’re here for the memes, the returns, or both, BTFD Coin is ready to take you on a wild ride. Get in on the action, join the Bulls Squad , don’t forget to claim the BIG50 bonus and stake your claim in the future of meme coins.

With his eye on the memecoin sector, the trader says many of the big memes like MOODENG , CHILLGUY , or PNUT “all either send hard” from current prices or “fall off a cliff.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 01:36:00

One of the most notable success stories is Solana’s ICO, which highlighted the potential of investing early in innovative technologies. Similarly, Qubetics is emerging as a promising project, offering a visionary approach to blockchain interoperability and scalability. This article delves into the missed opportunities of Solana’s ICO and the exciting potential of Qubetics. Qubetics: The Future of Autonomous Blockchain Ecosystems Qubetics has been established to address the growing demand for a decentralised, interoperable, and self-sufficient blockchain infrastructure. By integrating seamlessly with the Ethereum ecosystem, Qubetics sets a new standard for scalability, security, and user-centric features. This visionary project is designed to enhance the blockchain landscape by enabling interoperability across networks and fostering a truly decentralised Web3 ecosystem. The fragmented nature of the current blockchain environment limits the potential of decentralised applications and cross-chain transactions. Qubetics tackles these challenges by becoming a Web3-aggregated chain, unifying multiple networks into a cohesive framework. This approach enables seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality, unlocking the full potential of decentralised technologies for developers, enterprises, and users. Solana: A Missed Opportunity for Early Investors Solana’s ICO is a classic example of how early-stage investments in innovative projects can lead to extraordinary returns. Held in March 2020, the Solana ICO offered SOL tokens for $0.22. The project raised $25 million during this fundraising round, securing the resources to develop its high-performance blockchain platform. Fast-forward to today, Solana has established itself as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains, with a growing ecosystem of decentralised applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralised finance (DeFi) projects. At its peak, the SOL token traded at over $250, representing an astonishing ROI for early investors participating in the ICO. Solana’s success can be attributed to its unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism, which allows the blockchain to process thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. This scalability has positioned Solana as a key player in the blockchain space, driving adoption among developers and enterprises alike. It is understandable that those who missed the opportunity to invest in Solana’s ICO regret it. However, the cryptocurrency market is filled with new opportunities, and emerging projects like Qubetics present a chance to be part of the next wave of innovation. Qubetics: A Compelling Investment Opportunity Currently in Presale Phase 15, Qubetics offers an exceptional opportunity for early adopters. Each presale phase brings a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. At this stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0414, with over $8.5 million raised, 12,800+ holders, and 394 million tokens sold. The next phase is imminent, with a post-presale target price of $0.25 per token. Analysts predict that $TICS tokens could achieve $10 to $15 values following the mainnet launch. For investors entering this stage, this translates to an ROI of approximately 32,028.61% if the token reaches $10 and around 48,092.91% if it climbs to $15. Qubetics’ autonomous and decentralised infrastructure ensures self-sufficiency, positioning it as a transformative force in the blockchain. Qubetics is poised to drive innovation and adoption across the Web3 ecosystem by addressing interoperability challenges and providing scalable, secure solutions. The Synergy Between Vision and Execution Solana and Qubetics showcase the importance of visionary thinking in the blockchain industry. Solana’s success demonstrates how technological innovation and scalability can drive widespread adoption. On the other hand, Qubetics highlights the significance of addressing interoperability and creating autonomous blockchain ecosystems to unlock the full potential of decentralised technologies. Learning from Missed Opportunities The lesson for investors who missed out on Solana’s ICO is clear: identifying and investing in promising projects during their early stages can yield remarkable returns. While Solana’s ICO is a missed opportunity, projects like Qubetics provide a fresh chance to participate in the future of blockchain innovation. By addressing real-world challenges and offering compelling solutions, Qubetics is well-positioned to become a key player in the next wave of blockchain development. With its focus on interoperability, scalability, and user-centric design, Qubetics is more than just a cryptocurrency; it is a comprehensive ecosystem that bridges the gap between fragmented blockchain networks. Conclusion: Seizing the Next Big Opportunity The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, offering new opportunities for those who missed out on past successes like Solana’s ICO. Qubetics stands out as a visionary project that addresses critical issues in the blockchain space, providing a unified and autonomous ecosystem for developers and users alike. For investors seeking to capitalise on the next transformative blockchain project, Qubetics offers an unparalleled opportunity. By participating in its presale, early adopters can position themselves to benefit from the project’s growth and avoid the regret of missing out on another landmark ICO. With its innovative solutions and strong growth potential, Qubetics is poised to shape the future of blockchain technology.

As Shiba Inu (SHIB) grapples with its fluctuating value, a new contender has emerged from the shadows, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a low-cap altcoin that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and real-world assets (RWA). This intriguing shift highlights the dynamic nature of altcoin investments and highlights the potential for substantial returns in the developing decentralized markets. Shiba Inu Price Takes a Hit Amid Whale Activity and Market Selloff The Shiba Inu price has faced significant headwinds in recent days, fueled by large-scale selloffs from crypto whales and a broader market downturn. Over the last 48 hours, the Shiba Inu price posted a 3% loss, joining the ranks of other meme coins that have struggled under the weight of bearish sentiment. A major transaction, highlighted by analytics firm Lookonchain, saw a whale offloading 250 billion SHIB tokens, valued at approximately $6 million, pushing the Shiba Inu price further into the red zone. This selloff marks a pivotal moment, as the whale in question had amassed a staggering 15.28 trillion SHIB tokens in 2020 for just $3,800, raking in $109 million in profits to date. Despite these challenges, Shiba Inu enthusiasts remain hopeful. Historical patterns suggest that meme coins, including Shiba Inu, could rebound strongly during altcoin seasons or broader market rallies, with analysts predicting potential highs of $0.0000998 by 2025. However, volatility remains a critical factor as the market awaits signs of a Shiba Inu price turnaround. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The Low-Cap Altcoin With AI and RWA Integration Amidst the current bear movement of the Shiba Inu price, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is making waves in the real estate sector. PropiChain is reshaping the global real estate industry with a groundbreaking decentralized platform integrating blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the metaverse. Historically, real estate investing has been reserved for high-net-worth individuals due to steep capital requirements and geographic limitations. PropiChain dismantles these barriers by providing global access to real estate markets. One of PropiChain’s standout features is its use of NFT tokenization. PropiChain allows for swift and secure property transactions by converting physical properties into digital assets without the need for cumbersome documentation or intermediaries. This fractional ownership model also empowers investors to purchase shares of high-value properties, making real estate accessible to a broader audience while introducing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid asset class​. PropiChain’s AI capabilities redefine how investors approach the real estate market. With automated market predictions and valuation models, the platform enables users to make data-driven decisions with unparalleled accuracy. AI tools analyze historical sales data and economic indicators to provide predictive insights into market trends and price fluctuations, helping investors capitalize on opportunities while mitigating risks. For instance, PropiChain’s AI-powered virtual assistants guide users through complex processes like document preparation and legal compliance, ensuring a flawless and efficient experience. Through its metaverse integration, users can virtually explore properties, interact with 3D environments, and evaluate property features without needing physical visits. This feature bridges geographic gaps and improves the decision-making process by providing an immersive property exploration experience​. PropiChain employs blockchain’s decentralized ledger system, known as “Title Contract,” to assure the security and transparency of all transactions. This feature eliminates counterparty risks, fraudulent activities, and trust issues that plague traditional real estate systems. Additionally, smart contracts , audited by BlockAudit, automate lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals, reducing administrative burdens and ensuring timely agreement execution​. PropiChain minimizes transaction costs and accelerates the property transfer process by removing intermediaries. Why Invest in the PropiChain Altcoin Presale PropiChain’s altcoin presale is structured to reward early participants with significant returns on investment (ROI). The presale is divided into three rounds, each offering altcoins at progressively higher prices. Currently, it is in the second stage, offering altcoins at $0.011. The listing price on exchanges post-ICO is set at $0.032 per altcoin, representing a 900% increase from the current price. Early participants receive 20–25% bonus altcoins, with 50% unlocked at TGE and the rest vested over 10 weeks to guarantee long-term commitment. The PCHAIN altcoin provides flawless platform functionality, from purchasing property NFTs to accessing AI-driven insights. Early investors can participate in PropiChain’s presale, with altcoins offered at discounted rates across multiple rounds. Now listed on CoinMarketCap, participating in PropiChain’s presale allows investors to secure substantial financial gains while supporting a platform set to revolutionize real estate investment through the integration of AI and blockchain technology. While investors brace for a probable further Shiba Inu price drop, savvy investors are looking forward to PropiChain (PCHAIN) altcoin, which has a better utility value and market proposition.

Concurrently, a flurry of activity surrounds Cardano’s whales, who have snapped up 20 million ADA in anticipation of the imminent Plomin Hard Fork, a pivotal governance update poised to redefine the blockchain’s structure. Amidst this buzz, BlockDAG (BDAG) fresh Refer and Earn USDT initiative is dishing out immediate USDT cashback for both referrers and buyers, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Consequently, the network’s presale has ballooned to $174 million, with 17.6 billion coins already snapped up. Tron Crypto Price Poised for a Significant Leap The current buzz around Tron crypto price, now trading at $0.257793, points to a potential 444% rally to the $1.11 mark soon. This comes after a commendable 31.79% rise last month, even after a slight dip from its December high of $0.4407. A notable uptick in trading volume—jumping 50% to $1.19 billion—mirrors a heightened investor interest. A bullish pattern on the charts suggests Tron’s upward trajectory might continue, though support at $0.246 and resistance near $0.31 will be critical in shaping its path forward. Cardano Whales Make Big Moves Before Key Blockchain Update In a show of market confidence, Cardano whales have recently accumulated 20 million ADA. This comes just before the Plomin Hard Fork, scheduled between January 4 and 29, 2025, which introduces full on-chain governance via CIP-1694. This governance overhaul is crucial for the Cardano ecosystem, and the whales’ actions suggest they are gearing up for possible price movements, with ADA now at $0.887. Market analysts see a potential spike to $1.20 if resistance at $0.91 is breached, though a fall below $0.76 might push it down to $0.50. BlockDAG’s Refer & Earn: A Lucrative USDT Cashback Scheme BlockDAG’s referral initiative is reshaping the landscape of cryptocurrency incentives, offering immediate USDT rewards that stand out as one of the premier opportunities in the digital currency sphere. Referrers are rewarded with a solid 6% cashback in USDT for transactions made through their links. As activity heightens within a single day, the cashback percentage escalates, reaching an impressive 10% starting from the fifth transaction onwards. Additionally, buyers receive a consistent 6% cashback on each transaction, paving the way for limitless benefits for everyone involved. To participate, transactions need to exceed a $30 threshold, with rewards promptly transferred to any BEP-20-compatible wallet, ensuring swift satisfaction. This streamlined process is designed to instantly gratify both referrers and purchasers, cultivating a vibrant and active community. The surge in demand fueled by this offer has catapulted BlockDAG’s presale to over $174 million, with more than 17.6 billion coins distributed. Currently priced at $0.0234 in its 26th batch, the cryptocurrency has already yielded a staggering 2240% ROI for early investors since its inception. This time-sensitive referral scheme not only augments immediate returns but also primes participants for future growth, with projections aiming for a $1 valuation per BDAG by 2025. BlockDAG’s referral system is noted for its simplicity, scalability, and profitability, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Engaging now allows users to enhance their financial gains while securing a position in a burgeoning network poised to revolutionize the blockchain arena. Best Crypto Coins to Buy Now Tron’s growing traction and positive forecasts suggest a robust upswing, backed by solid technical and trading volume indicators. Cardano’s whale activity underscores robust market faith in its upcoming governance overhaul, potentially influencing its price in the near future. Moreover, BlockDAG’s impressive referral rewards and presale achievements establish it as one of the best crypto coins to buy right now. With a presale that has already gathered $174 million and moved over 17.6 billion coins, BlockDAG offers high ROI possibilities through its timely Refer and Earn USDT system, a chance for daily rewards not to be missed!

Ethereum’s adoption of a proof-of-stake model has drawn environmentally aware users, enhancing its function and leading to more long-term holders than Bitcoin. However, Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by removing middlemen providing user empowerment through blockchain-backed clarity and decision-making. At the same time, XRP Ledger’s increase in activity, propelled by RLUSD stablecoin use and key advancements, hints at possible price rises and greater network function. As Ethereum continues to be a major player in decentralized finance and XRP bolsters its system, Web3Bay is forging a distinct path in altering consumer shopping and financial behavior. Analysing Ethereum’s Growing HODLer Base In 2024, Ethereum saw a significant rise in long-term holders, surpassing Bitcoin in this measure. This increase largely comes from its switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus approach, which greatly cut its energy use and appealed to those conscious of the environment. Additionally, Ethereum’s vast network of decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts has increased its usefulness, attracting developers and companies. Moreover, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, primarily on Ethereum, have driven its uptake by delivering financial services such as lending and borrowing without middlemen. This has boosted confidence among investors, as seen in the growing number of HODLers. Analysts also foresee Ethereum reaching $10,000 due to technological improvements and rising interest from institutions. Furthermore, the expected launch of cryptocurrency ETFs could further enhance Ethereum’s attractiveness, cementing its status as a top player in digital finance. Web3Bay Transforms E-Commerce via Blockchain Imagine a place where online shopping is governed not by large corporations but by its own users. Web3Bay is turning this concept into reality by removing large middlemen, lowering costs, and placing control into the hands of users via blockchain technology. This system manages payments, contracts, and logistics efficiently and securely through smart contracts, enhancing transparency and efficiency. This decentralized platform not only saves money but also allows users to influence its direction. Through the 3BAY token, users do more than trade; they have a voice in its evolution. This includes governance rights that allow the community to direct the future of Web3Bay, turning it into more than just a shopping site but a user-driven ecosystem. Additionally, the crypto community is beginning to notice. With over 400 million crypto shoppers worldwide, Web3Bay is set to capture this expanding audience. For example, early backers have already seen returns as high as 4253% during the token’s presale. Even those who missed the early opportunities still have a chance to participate before the full launch. As Web3Bay prepares to take on major e-commerce platforms like eBay, it combines the convenience of online shopping with the benefits of blockchain. For crypto shoppers weary of hidden fees and data misuse, Web3Bay presents a refreshing alternative where they can shop, save, and influence a future they help shape. This unique mix could soon make Web3Bay a leading name in the e-commerce revolution . XRP Ledger Enhances Crypto Transaction Efficiency The XRP Ledger is witnessing a surge in usage that may hint at potential price increases. Recently, the creation of new accounts has reached levels not seen since 2020, indicating a growing interest in the XRP ecosystem. Daily transactions have also soared to over 1.4 million, spurred by new functionalities and increased adoption of the platform. One significant factor in this growth is Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which is fully supported by U.S. dollar deposits. RLUSD is gaining popularity on major exchanges like Uphold and Bitso, with plans for more integrations. The addition of Kenneth Montgomery, formerly of the Federal Reserve Bank, to the advisory board also enhances confidence in Ripple’s initiatives. Final Note! Ethereum, Web3Bay, and XRP each demonstrate the diverse potential of blockchain technology across finance, e-commerce, and digital ecosystems. Ethereum’s increase in long-term holders underscores its appeal as a sustainable and adaptable platform. The XRP Ledger’s rising activity, propelled by RLUSD and strategic developments, emphasizes its growing utility and potential market impact. Meanwhile, Web3Bay’s approach to e-commerce places power and control in the hands of its users, creating a marketplace that is shaped by its community.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 03:35:00

BTFD Coin Is Quickly Becoming the Meme Coin You Don’t Want to Miss,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-dogwifhats-peak-btfd-coin-is-quickly-becoming-the-meme-coin-you-dont-want-to-miss/,"The world of meme coins is fast-paced, wild, and full of opportunities—but only if you’re quick enough to grab them. Dogwifhat (WIF), a playful Solana-based memecoin featuring a Shiba Inu dog rocking a pink knitted hat, turned heads with its unique charm and loyal community. During its early days, WIF was a hidden gem, giving early investors massive returns as it surged in popularity. But here’s the thing about meme coins: timing is everything. If you didn’t snag WIF when it was trading low, you might be feeling like the moment has passed. And, let’s be honest, that FOMO is real. The good news? The crypto space is always buzzing with the next big opportunity, and BTFD Coin is stepping up as the new contender. BTFD’s booming presale offering a 50% bonus in BTFD Coins with BIG50 offer, innovative features and growing community are turning heads. If you’re hunting for the best meme coins to buy this month , BTFD Coin might just be your ticket to turning missed opportunities into major wins. BTFD Coin: Bulls Are Owning the Meme Coin Frenzy BTFD Coin is making waves as one of the most exciting new meme coins on the market. Short for “Buy the Dip,” this project is all about embracing volatility and finding value in the chaos of crypto. Currently in its 13th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.000142—a price point that’s already drawing in savvy investors. The numbers speak for themselves: Over $4.8 million raised so far, with key milestones like $2.5M reached in under 14 days. More than 61 billion tokens are sold, reflecting the growing interest in the project. A passionate community of 7,300 holders, known as the Bulls Squad, is rallying behind the coin. Consider an investment scenario, By investing $3000 in BTFD Coin during Stage 13 at the price of $0.000142 per coin and unlocking the BIG50 code for a 50% bonus, you would secure an impressive 31,690,141 coins . As the presale concludes and the price surges to $0.0006 per coin, your investment would blossom to a remarkable $19,014.08 , delivering a substantial profit of $16,014.08 . This showcases the undeniable growth potential of this opportunity, amplified by the presale bonus and the strategic use of the BIG50 code. One standout feature of BTFD is its 90% APY staking rewards. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD offers tangible incentives for holders. Staking lets you earn while holding your tokens, turning your wallet into a passive income machine. This alone makes BTFD one of the best meme coins to buy this month. BTFD Coin has officially released the full version of its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, allowing players to earn $BTFD tokens while enjoying the game. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game immerses users in a fun, and interactive experience. It’s not just about playing; it’s about being part of the bullish ethos that BTFD represents. The game keeps investors engaged and connected, adding a layer of value to the project that extends beyond the token itself. The project also includes a referral program and staking rewards, forming a dynamic ecosystem designed for sustained growth. BTFD’s secret sauce, though, is its community. The Bulls Squad isn’t just a group of holders—they’re a movement. Their enthusiasm and dedication are helping BTFD build momentum as it heads toward its projected listing price of $0.0006. If you missed out on Dogwifhat, now’s your chance to be part of a project that’s gaining steam fast. Dogwifhat: A Playful Memecoin With Serious Fans Dogwifhat (WIF) took the meme coin world by storm, blending humour, community, and creativity. Built on the Solana blockchain, WIF’s concept—a Shiba Inu dog wearing a pink knitted hat—was as quirky as it was endearing. It quickly gained traction among investors who were drawn to its lighthearted vibe and its promise of inclusivity. WIF was more than just a joke. Its community-driven nature made it a favourite among investors who valued mutual support and a shared vision. With an accessible buying process—requiring only a Solana-friendly wallet and exchange—WIF made it easy for newcomers and seasoned traders alike to join the fun. However, as with all meme coins, timing was key. Dogwifhat’s peak brought massive gains to early adopters, but for those who hesitated, the opportunity to ride its wave has come and gone. While WIF remains a beloved project, it serves as a reminder of how quickly the memecoin market moves. If you missed out on WIF’s meteoric rise, BTFD Coin is proving to be the next big chance to catch a rising star in the meme coin world. The Bottom Line Dogwifhat showed us the power of creativity and community in the crypto space. It turned a playful idea into a full-fledged movement, rewarding early adopters with impressive gains. But the market doesn’t wait, and those who missed WIF’s rise know all too well how fleeting these opportunities can be. Now, with its explosive presale, staking rewards, and vibrant community, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the best meme coins to buy this month. Don’t let another chance slip by. Join the Bulls Squad, stake your claim by utilising the BIG50 bonus code before it’s gone, and be part of the next big thing in meme coins. With BTFD, your missed moments can become your biggest wins.

The XRP price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. Ripple price with a potential surge, may reach a high of $15.65 by 2030. Ripple Lab’s native token XRP price holds its value above the $2 mark with a surge of over 250% in 2024. Moreover, with SEC chair Gary Gensler’s exit on 20th January and a potential dismissal of the appeal on the SEC vs Ripple case, this altcoin is all set to explode. On the other hand, with the launch of the “RLUSD” and the potential filing of the XRP ETF in 2025, the Ripple price could slingshot toward a new ATH. Keeping a close watch on the short-term and long-term Ripple price prediction with questions like “Will XRP reach $5 before 2025?”.

Furthermore, the most controversial Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is on the path to its closure with the resignation of Gary Gensler. This could act as a catalyst in the project to regain its dominance in the sector and achieve a new high. In such an optimistic outlook, Ripple’s XRP coin price could surpass its previous ATH and head toward an annual high of $3.99 in 2025. However, in a global crisis, the Ripple price might settle at $2.15. Considering the buying and selling pressure of the crypto market, the average price of this altcoin could settle at around the $3 mark.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE.

Following a bearish phase that saw Shiba Inu fall by more than 37% from its December highs, market analysts now believe the meme-inspired cryptocurrency may be poised for a strong recovery. Amid this consolidation phase, a whale has withdrawn $4.63 million worth of Shiba Inu from Binance, sparking speculation of a potential upward movement. SHIB Whale Activity and Resistance Levels A major transaction involving Shiba Inu has caught the attention of the crypto community. A whale, dormant for five months, withdrew 220 billion SHIB tokens worth $4.63 million from Binance. This significant move came amid Shiba Inu’s struggle to reclaim the $0.000025 price level during the holiday season. Data from IntoTheBlock indicates that Shiba Inu faces two key sell walls preventing it from reaching the $0.00003 range. The first resistance zone, between $0.000023 and $0.000024, involves 42,310 addresses holding 60.44 trillion SHIB. Source: IntotheBlock A larger sell wall lies between $0.000024 and $0.000030, where 208,010 addresses purchased 70.35 trillion SHIB. These walls have repeatedly hindered the token’s SHIB price recovery , resulting in pullbacks and sharp declines. Price Consolidation Signals Potential Breakout Shiba Inu price has recently entered a consolidation phase after a volatile period. The token is currently trading within a tight range of $0.00002100 to $0.00002300. Analysts view this consolidation as a potential setup for an upward breakout, especially due to the recent surge in SHIB burn rate and if the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery. SHIB/USD 4-hour price chart (source: TradingView) The token’s recent price action aligns with technical analysis suggesting it has found support at $0.00002. This level has been critical in preventing further declines, even as bearish trends persist. RSI and MACD indicators suggest that SHIB price may be regaining bullish momentum, with RSI currently at 56.81, leaning towards a neutral to slightly bullish outlook. Analyst Predicts 260% Shiba Inu Price Rally Crypto analyst Javon Marks has identified “textbook bull signals” in Shiba Inu’s price chart, suggesting a strong rally may follow. According to Marks, the token recently broke through a long-term resistance trendline and retested it as support during its recent pullback. This breakout behavior often signals the beginning of an upward trend. Marks predicts Shiba Inu price could rise to $0.000081 in the short term, representing a 260% gain from current levels. He also noted the presence of hidden bullish divergence, where price forms higher lows while momentum indicators form lower lows. This pattern indicates underlying strength in the asset. “Shiba Inu is holding above its breakout zone, which is a positive sign for potential growth,” Marks stated in his analysis. Shiba Inu price must overcome two major resistance levels to sustain a bullish rally. The first target is $0.00003, a zone where the token has faced significant selling pressure in previous attempts. If SHIB breaks through this barrier, analysts believe it could reach $0.000081, the next key resistance. Marks also identified a long-term SHIB price target of $0.000155, a price level that represents an unprecedented high for Shiba Inu. He believes this target could be achievable if market conditions improve and broader bullish trends return.

The second batch of aid supplies has been successfully shipped to the Bahamas, providing urgently needed sanitary products for 4,000 local women and effectively improving their quality of life. The “Menstrual Equity Project” aims to offer sustainable menstrual hygiene solutions to marginalized women and girls, aligning with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As the oldest multi-specialty medical organization promoting women’s advancement in the medical field and improving women’s health, AMWA’s mission is in perfect alignment with KuCoin’s commitment to social responsibility. With the support of the Office of the First Lady of Commonwealth of Bahamas H. E. Ann Marie Davis, this round of donated materials focuses on disposable menstrual pads. This decision reflects the local challenges of water scarcity and high washing costs, while also providing essential emergency supplies for women during natural disasters such as hurricanes and typhoons. Since KuCoin made a firm commitment to social welfare initiatives during the “KuCoin Green Future Gala” at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in 2023, the company has actively fulfilled its corporate social responsibilities. The “Menstrual Equity Project” has become a key initiative under this commitment. In March 2024, the project’s first phase was implemented, distributing 1,000 menstrual kits—each containing 10 sanitary pads and 2 menstrual cups—to Suriname, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and domestic violence shelters in New York and California. The smooth delivery of the second batch of supplies to the Bahamas will benefit 4,000 women. Jing Zhao Cesarone, President of Global CSR Foundation, commented: “KuCoin has set a remarkable example in addressing period poverty in underserved regions, demonstrating its enthusiasm and dedication to social responsibility.” Nancy Cheung, KuCoin’s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), emphasized: “As a global leader in the digital economy, KuCoin is committed to advancing the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on key areas such as climate change, health, and education, driving more philanthropic initiatives to fruition. We also plan to expand the scope of the ‘Menstrual Equity Project,’ collaborating with more international organizations to improve women’s living conditions and contribute to global sustainable development.” About KuCoin Founded in 2017, KuCoin is one of the pioneering and most globally recognized technology platforms supporting digital economies, built on a robust foundation of cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure, liquidity solutions, and an exceptional user experience.

The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUM2025. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 05:13:00

While the broader crypto space has faced some wobbles, meme coins have been riding a wave of popularity, proving they’re more than just a laugh—they’re a serious opportunity. The chatter around these coins has reached a fever pitch, with investors eyeing their next big move. Some are a throwback to crypto’s light-hearted beginnings, while others offer solid utility, showing meme coins aren’t just about memes anymore—they’re about making waves. Among these, BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands tall, basking in the meme coin frenzy while flaunting features that even seasoned investors can’t ignore. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game out now in its full version, a juicy offer that gives you 50% more coins using BIG50, and a solid presale tally of over $4.8 million amassed to this day, no one can ignore its potential. But it’s not alone. This listicle dives into the top trending meme coins to buy in January 2025, spotlighting BTFD, Bone ShibaSwap, Simon’s Cat, and COQ Inu. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin That’s All About Strategy Ah, the BTFD Coin—it’s not just another meme coin; it’s a whole vibe. BTFD stands for “Buy the Dip,” and that’s exactly what it encourages you to do, especially with its ongoing presale that’s captured everyone’s attention. But don’t let the cheeky name fool you—this coin packs a punch. Let’s start with its features. BTFD Coin has launched the full version of its P2E Game, which allows users to play and earn through it. Then there’s staking. Offering a whopping 90% APY, it gives investors another reason to stick around. Who wouldn’t want to earn passive income while being part of a meme coin revolution? Add in the referral programme, and you have a recipe for excitement. Share the word, and you’ll be rewarded for bringing others into the fold. Oh, and did we mention the Bulls Squad? It’s an exclusive community for early supporters—where like-minded investors gather to strategise and celebrate wins. What the 1973 Crash Teaches Us About Buying the Dip Back in 1973, the world was in chaos. The Bretton Woods system collapsed, OPEC tightened its grip, and oil prices skyrocketed. Inflation ran wild, and markets tanked nearly 50%. It was grim, no doubt about it. However, savvy investors like Warren Buffett saw carnage as a golden opportunity. They bought the dip, scooping up undervalued assets and reaping the rewards when the markets recovered. Sound familiar? The current crypto market might not be the 1970s, but the lesson remains. Dips are temporary, but opportunities are timeless. That’s why BTFD Coin is perfectly poised for today’s market, and it’s already giving you the chance to make smart investments by offering you its ongoing festive offer, which grants you 50% more tokens once you use the BIG50 code when buying $BTFD (you need to act fast before January 5th, though!). Why did this coin make it to this list? Simply put, BTFD Coin is smashing it. With over $4.8 million raised and 61 billion coins sold, it’s already surpassed half its presale journey, now in Stage 13 at $0.000142 per token. 2. Bone ShibaSwap: The Backbone of the Shiba Ecosystem Bone ShibaSwap isn’t your typical meme coin—it’s a utility powerhouse. As the governance token of the ShibaSwap ecosystem, Bone lets users have a say in the platform’s future, making it a favourite among decentralisation enthusiasts. If you’re already into Shiba Inu, adding Bone to your portfolio is a no-brainer. What sets Bone apart is its real-world functionality. It powers the ShibaSwap platform, a decentralised exchange (DEX) where users can trade, stake, and earn rewards. It’s like getting the keys to the Shiba kingdom, and who wouldn’t want that? Plus, the ecosystem is expanding, with the upcoming Shibarium blockchain promising to make Bone even more integral. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bone ShibaSwap is trending because it’s not just riding the meme wave—it’s steering it. With its unique governance features and ties to the ever-popular Shiba Inu ecosystem, it’s a coin that combines fun with functionality. 3. Simon’s Cat: The Quirky Newcomer with Serious Potential Who doesn’t love a good cat meme? Simon’s Cat taps into the internet’s endless fascination with felines but takes it a step further by blending nostalgia with crypto. Inspired by the wildly popular animated series, this coin is as playful as it gets—but don’t mistake its humour for a lack of substance. Simon’s Cat is focused on building a community-driven project where holders influence its direction. From NFTs to potential metaverse integrations, this coin aims to be more than just a meme. Imagine owning a piece of internet history while reaping the benefits of a blockchain-based economy. That’s the dream Simon’s Cat is selling, and it’s catching on fast. Why did this coin make it to this list? Simon’s Cat earns its spot for its unique blend of charm and potential. It’s not just a coin; it’s a movement for meme and crypto lovers alike, proving that sometimes, the underdog—or should we say undercat—steals the show. 4. COQ Inu: The Underdog with a Sassy Twist COQ Inu has one of those names that makes you do a double-take—and that’s exactly the point. This coin thrives on its irreverent humour, drawing in a crowd that loves a good laugh and a promising investment. But beneath the cheeky exterior lies a project with serious ambitions. Why did this coin make it to this list? COQ Inu is making waves because it knows how to stand out in a crowded market. By blending humour with innovation, it’s carving out a niche that’s impossible to ignore. If you’re tired of the same old meme coins, this one’s got the spark you’re looking for.

38415699,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53577,1735795831,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ethereum Price Analysis: Is ETH Ready To Challenge $3,500 and $4,000 After Recent Crash? This New Altcoin Aims For $1 In 2025",https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-price-analysis-is-eth-ready-to-challenge-3500-and-4000/,"After Ethereum’s massive correction that pulled back its price to the $3K psychological level, the top altcoin began a cooling-off period, sparking rising expectations for a potential bullish rebound. ETH’s price has consolidated above the critical $3K support level allowing bullish participants to re-enter the market. This renewed demand reflected in the uptick in funding rates, highlights growing confidence among market participants as they anticipate reversing the current trend. Alongside this mix, Lunex Network (LNEX) continues to pick up steam as more people discover its unique solution to some inherent DeFi challenges. Its innovative DeFi ideas and successful presale have drawn considerable interest from investors. With a growing user base and system designed to offer real passive income, Lunex could become a strong contender, following in the footsteps of existing giants like Ethereum. Lunex Network (LNEX): Enhances DeFi Trading With its superior interoperability allowing seamless transactions for more than 50,000 crypto assets across isolated blockchains, Lunex Network ( LNEX )has enhanced the DeFi trading experience like never before. The project has appealed to privacy-focus traders as it has eliminated tedious KYC verification requirements and third-party connectivity, thereby eliminating data breaches and barriers to entry. Moreover, the Lunex ecosystem offers advanced asset management tools, creative portfolio-maximizing capabilities, and multi-currency staking choices. This all-encompassing strategy ensures the platform not only satisfies the needs of today’s traders but also opens the door for a more linked and effective DeFi future. The buzz around Lunex is evident, attributed to its expanding community and successful presale. It has demonstrated robust investor confidence and demand, having already raised over $5.6 million after selling more than 2.3 billion tokens. Early adopters who entered at $0.0012 have already recorded an over 333% return. Investors now have a rare chance to participate in the Lunex Network presale with the LNEX token priced at just $0.0052. Can ETH Price Reclaim The $3,500 Level? Ethereum’s price action has witnessed increased volatility after it failed to breach the $4,050 resistance level. This pushed the price of Ethereum below the $3,500 threshold and ultimately found strong support at the $3,000 psychological level. This level is crucial in determining the ETH coin’s next move due to the confluence of demand. Moreover, the $3,000 level aligns with the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. Notably, the ETH price has formed a golden cross , with the 100-day MA crossing above the 200-day MA. This indicates a potential shift in market sentiment. However, the ETH token has been confined below the $3,500 resistance level. A breakout from this zone could catalyze a new upward trend and set the stage for a renewed rally. Meanwhile, ETH crypto has declined from its ascending price channel from the 4-hour time frame, which culminated in a test of the $3K zone. This region aligns with the 0.5 Fib retracement at $3,200 and 0.618 Fib retracement at $3,000 levels, indicating a robust support line. Overall, ETH price action suggests a potential buildup of buying interest, which means that Ethereum is likely to embark on a fresh bullish surge, reclaiming the $3,500 resistance level. Lunex Network Attracts Ethereum Investors Ethereum (ETH) continues to excite investors with its massive potential for a breakout and long-term recovery. However, investors seeking the next big thing in the crypto landscape are shifting their attention to Lunex Network. With an unmatched low entry price point at the presale, Lunex is expected to record a 50x rally in Q1 2025. Meanwhile, the presale tokens are selling out fast since the token supply is limited.

In a tweet, he stated, “Nothing has changed at all with my $XRP thoughts, in fact, $XRP looks amazing. We are just ranging after a 465% move upwards. The oscillators have cooled off, we are just awaiting the next leg to the upside.” $XRP . Nothing has changed at all with my $XRP thoughts, in fact $XRP looks amazing. We are just ranging after a 465% move upwards. The oscillators have cooled off, we are just awaiting the next leg to the upside. pic.twitter.com/Kjv5uq7b4Q — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) December 31, 2024 The analyst’s perspective suggests that XRP’s current consolidation phase is a normal part of the market cycle after its significant upward movement. With technical indicators stabilizing, Cryptoinsightuk believes XRP is preparing for another potential rally. Diverging Opinions on XRP’s Market Dynamics While Cryptoinsightuk remains optimistic, skepticism persists among some market participants. An X user, Arthur Klucznik, commented , “Shit is dropping like a rock. Now wait until Ripple dumps their monthly pile of shit tomorrow.” This remark references the periodic sale of XRP from Ripple’s escrow , a practice some critics argue could create downward pressure on the asset’s price. Despite such concerns, XRP supporters maintain that the broader technical and market trends favor a bullish outcome. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Indicators Signal Potential Upside Adding to Cryptoinsightuk’s analysis, analyst Egrag highlighted the significance of the Williams Alligator Indicator. This tool uses three moving averages—Jaw, Teeth, and Lips—to evaluate market trends. Egrag noted that XRP’s current alignment supports a bullish trajectory, provided the asset remains above the $2 equilibrium zone. Egrag also identified two notable “Break of Structure” (BOS) moments in XRP’s price history. The first occurred in early 2018 when XRP reached its all-time high of over $3.80. The second, in 2021, failed to break the previous record. Egrag now sees a new BOS forming as XRP maintains its position above $2, signaling a potential uptrend continuation. Historical Patterns Bolster Optimism Historical comparisons further reinforce the bullish outlook. The last time the Williams Alligator Indicator displayed a similar alignment was in late 2017, preceding XRP’s surge to its all-time high. XRP could be poised for another significant rally if the current alignment follows a similar trajectory. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $2.09, reflecting a 0.54% increase over the past 24 hours. As the market awaits the next decisive move, analysts like Cryptoinsightuk and Egrag emphasize the asset’s technical strength and potential for further gains.

Today’s XRP price surge to $2.42 comes along with a 120% surge in the daily trading volume reaching over $10 billion showing strong bullish momentum. The surge comes as the bulls defended the $2.0 support following the recent crypto market correction. Popular analysts predict a surge to $13 and beyond. Furthermore, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has hinted at working on real-world utility as we head into 2025. Where Is XRP Price Heading Next? With Ripple bulls stepping in, the XRP price daily close above $2.12 confirms that the bullish action remains intact for the Ripple cryptocurrency. Crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto has identified critical resistance levels to monitor in the coming sessions: $2.60, $2.65 and $2.75. Breaking through these thresholds could pave the way for higher price targets, potentially signaling a bullish breakout above $3. Additionally, the XRP whale activity could support the broader momentum. Source: EGRAG Crypto Moving into 2025, market analysts remain bullish on the Ripple cryptocurrency predicting double-digit price targets and new all-time highs above $10. With the expectation that the XRP lawsuit will end soon , analysts are overly bullish for the altcoin based on its technical setup. On a multi-year chart, XRP price is eyeing a breakout from the flag-and-pole pattern. Crypto analyst Tony has highlighted a potential bull flag pattern in XRP, suggesting a target of $13 if the formation holds true. While acknowledging that this level exceeds his primary targets, Tony noted that such a move, though ambitious, is not entirely impossible in a strong bullish scenario.

Garanti BBVA Kripto, a crypto custody platform operated by Garanti BBVA — Turkey’s fifth largest bank, which as of December 2023 was almost 86% owned by BBVA — will soon be providing crypto trading services to the general public. Bit2Me, a crypto exchange founded in Spain in 2014, will be used as the bank’s trading execution center. And now that the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is in full effect across the European Union, the partnership between BBVA and the crypto exchange is a strong signal of more things are brewing on the horizon, according to Abel Peña, Bit2Me’s chief sales officer. “I believe in 2025 we are going to see so many banks across Europe offering crypto spot trading to their users,” Peña told CoinDesk. “We are in very close contact with more than 50 financial institutions, with banks all across Europe and internationally, and they will start launching their services in the first quarter of 2025.” BBVA held $857 billion in assets in 2023, making it the 43rd largest bank in the world at the time, and the second biggest in Spain after Banco Santander. While Garanti BBVA Kripto has already been advertising crypto trading services on its website since January 2024, the product was only offered as a pilot and wasn’t available for the general public, according to Bit2Me. BBVA began embracing the crypto industry in Turkey because the regulatory environment allowed it to move earlier, Peña said. Since MiCA finished rolling out on Dec. 30, financial institutions such as BBVA will now be able to secure approval from domestic regulators and offer exposure to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies to their European customers. “As soon as they have the green light, they will start,” Peña said. “This is from the knowledge that many of them are already integrated with us,” he added, though he declined to disclose the names of the institutions. But why is the banking sector suddenly so enthusiastic about crypto? The regulatory certainty provided by MiCA played a part, Peña said, but U.S. President-elect Donald Trump — who became a vocal crypto supporter in the middle of his campaign, and won big in November — was also a factor. Not to mention the various ideas floating around to get the U.S. government to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The tremendous success of the U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which have raked in a record $35 billion in inflows in less than a year, certainly didn’t hurt either. “We’re talking about an asset [bitcoin] that many users and companies want to gain exposure to. This is something that banks cannot deny anymore,” Peña said. BBVA isn’t the first European bank to dip its toes into crypto. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest multinational investment bank, is building a rollup on Ethereum using ZKsync technology and has been working on crypto custody and tokenization services with Swiss start-up Taurus since 2023, among other things. French financial services company Société Générale, for its part, has its own crypto arm, called SG-FORGE, which recently announced it will deploy its own euro stablecoin to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) network.",Finance,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-02 06:00:00

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 06:02:00

By integrating its infrastructure with Crymbo’s novel unification layer for digital asset compliance, Singularity Finance makes it possible for trading counterparties to share fragmented on- and off-chain transaction data in a secure and trust-minimized way, ensuring adherence with key financial regulations like the FATF Travel Rule . Singularity Finance was created by a merger between SingularityDAO, Cogito Finance and SelfKey, and has built a Layer-2 network for tokenizing assets within the AI economy, including the graphics processing units that power large language models. SingularityDAO provides the necessary financial management expertise, while Cogito handles the actual tokenization process, and SelfKey ensures privacy, compliance and security through its decentralized identity technology. In tokenizing GPUs and other essential AI assets, such as data, Singularity Finance is making the AI economy more liquid and accessible, so that anyone can invest in it. But despite making the AI industry more accessible, compliance still causes headaches for many organizations, preventing their participation. Crymbo has created a decentralized oracle for on- and off-chain compliance data that anyone can validate in real time. It allows tokenized assets to demonstrate full compliance in an immediate, privacy-preserving way. The oracle is designed to enable the secure and seamless transfer of information. All data exchanged between users is encrypted. Only the sender and receiver have access to the data, not even Crymbo itself can view the information. The ability to streamline compliance will go a long way towards speeding up adoption of tokenized RWAs. Because they now have an easy way to prove compliance, it makes RWAs more palatable to financial institutions that must adhere to strict global regulations. Many RWAs require KYC and AML processes to support regulatory compliance, which Crymbo manages for clients while also adhering to privacy standards through its encryption feature. For instance, the FATF Travel Rule is noted as a critical compliance standard created by the Financial Action Task Force, which is a global body that establishes guidelines around anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism rules. The integration eliminates the need for numerous cumbersome processes that were previously required to validate compliance. Traditionally, enterprises would have to connect to multiple technology platforms and send and respond to regular emails in order to demonstrate that everything is above board. But with Crymbo’s oracle, users can leverage the Oracle Explorer to access transaction information, and if both parties are already connected to the oracle, the required information is exchanged automatically, eliminating manual effort and ensuring efficiency. “With Crymbo Oracle, achieving compliance becomes effortless,” a spokesman from Singularity Finance said. “Moreover, it is an upgradeable solution that’s designed to adapt seamlessly as regulations evolve, ensuring your business stays ahead of the curve.”",Information,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-02 06:04:23

Some suggested he may have intended it as a joke, while others hinted at possible hidden meanings to the change. However, Musk has yet to give a direct explanation about his profile alterations. The term ‘Kekius’ appears to have been coined from the Latin “Kek,” which connotes laughter. Moreover, ‘Kek’ is said to be an ancient Egyptian god of darkness with a frog’s head. ‘Maximus’ is related to the character played by Russell Crow in the movie Gladiator, Maximus Decimus Meridius. Musk’s X name update caused the KEKIUS token to pump Soon after Musk updated his profile name, the value of the memecoin Kekius Maximus shot up. As of Tuesday evening, the memecoin’s value had surged by more than 900%; however, at the time, it was not immediately clear if Musk’s move had caused the price rise. However, the KEKIUS whale ‘0x820168e15ec0c16cd757257399519429eb2b31cc’ began selling his assets, triggering a 60% drop in the token’s prices in just one hour.

Such a significant milestone would likely have reverberating effects throughout the market, impacting leading coins like Cardano (ADA) and new players such as Yeti Ouro (YETIO). Its unique gaming and utility-focused ecosystem provides Yeti Ouro a prime opportunity to ride the market momentum wave and garner the attention of gamers and investors alike. Yeti Ouro excited its community some more by announcing a 25% bonus on every purchase made from December 31 to January 2, furnishing investors with an ideal opportunity to get tokens at a discounted rate. Yeti Ouro : A Rising Star In The Crypto Universe If BTC price hits $500K, imagine the capital flow into the greater crypto space, which will only push Yeti Ouro up. With established investment firms branching out into projected growth prospects, Yeti Ouro’s rare identity as a gaming utility token puts it in the running for a significant amount of newfound interest. Ecosystem And Tokenomics YETIO: The backbone of the Yeti Ouro ecosystem, enabling in-game Transactions, staking mechanisms and a vibrant marketplace. Token-burning mechanisms are integrated into the gaming ecosystem to guarantee long-term value appreciation, making the game a fascinating project for both gamers and crypto investors. This time of year is even more appealing to question marks with the 25% New Year bonus. Community Engagement The community-driven roar of Yeti Ouro is palpable, seen in meme contests and referral campaigns that engender a loyal user base. With the presale already providing significant ROI to early investors, the project is set up for sustained success. Cardano Price Prediction: A Blockchain With Grand With its scientifically informed approach, Cardano still has its share of developer fans and investor followers. Focusing on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability has made the platform one of the leaders in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). 7-day ADA price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Impact of Bitcoin’s Ascent If Bitcoin climbed to $500K, adoption could come to Cardano in droves as more projects aim to build dApps that require reliable and scalable solutions. But ADA price appreciation may still struggle as competition from newer, speedier ecosystems such as Yeti Ouro’s in vision. Despite strong fundamentals, Cardano has often been criticised for the lack of development progress compared to its competitors. Such a scenario allows space for nimble, new projects like Yeti Ouro to get noticed by investors looking for faster return on investment (ROI) and new, unique opportunities. Bitcoin News: The Market King Bitcoin would reach 500K, which would be historical for the crypto market. BTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is a bellwether for the entire industry, influencing sentiment and liquidity across other coins. 7-day Bitcoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap When BTC price pumps, it’s generalised around the blue chips as more capital gets pointlessly rotated around the good, money. However, since it’s solely “store of value” and not utility-driven like tokens such as Yeti Ouro, it opens up the space for opportunity. Thus, yield-hungry investors will consider projects offering something beyond speculative price action. Why Yeti Ouro Stands Out While Bitcoin could skyrocket to $500K, Yeti Ouro stands as a one-of-a-kind investment opportunity. The combination of its unique P2E gaming model with solid tokenomics and a community-driven approach presents a strong case for growth. With the crypto market preparing for a bullish cycle, Yeti Ouro is primed to offer life-changing returns to its investment. So, in the spirit of the 25% New Year bonus, making what will surely be an attractive entry point, take a trip down with Yeti Ouro. Whether you are a gamer, an investor, or both, this project will change the game in the crypto and gaming space.

RTX, PEPE or RENDER appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Some investors are wondering if a $100 investment can turn into a shocking $100,000 in 2025. Three top crypto coins—Pepe (PEPE), Render (RENDER) and Remittix (RTX) —are grabbing the attention of investors with their special promise. These altcoins offer something remarkable, from blockchain-driven financial innovation to memecoin comebacks. Which one, though, has the bullish potential to yield massive rewards this 2025? Read on to find out why analysts are very bullish on these 3 altcoins, especially RTX. Pepe (PEPE) Displays Bullish Momentum After the Pepe coin first sank to the $0.000017 support zone, the price has seen a noteworthy 10% rise over the past week, indicating a strong comeback. After this decline, the Pepe price had a surge in bullish pressure that sent it back over the $0.000019 resistance level. The Pepe price chart shows that the meme coin has plummeted by almost 6% in the past month, even with this recent comeback. With holders excitedly expecting a possible rally to the coin’s all-time high (ATH) of $0.000028 in Q1 2025, the Pepe (PEPE) community’s general attitude is still quite hopeful, nonetheless. The Pepe coin has a bright future based on technical indicators including MACD displaying purchase signs and the Momentum Oscillator. Pepe (PEPE) is still among the top altcoins to keep an eye on, although right now the Pepe price is roughly 30% away from its ATH. Render (RENDER) Is Set for a Potential Breakout Over the past week, the Render price has dropped more than 10% , following a bearish pattern distinguished by a succession of lower highs and lows. Reflecting the general bearish momentum , the Render price chart shows that the altcoin has declined by more than 22% over the past month according to CoinMarketCap statistics. Notwithstanding these losses, some analysts see a possible comeback; one X user speculates that the Render price could rise by 100% in January . Although these forecasts are speculative, the Render price chart shows encouraging indications of a bullish reversal. Usually connected with price recovery, the yearly Render price chart shows a double bottom pattern formation. Key indicators such as the MACD and Momentum Oscillator also show buy signs, implying that Render is one of the promising altcoins to watch for a near future breakout. Remittix (RTX) Is Enhancing Financial Inclusion By bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and conventional financial institutions, Remittix is poised to transform the worldwide remittance industry. The demand for quicker, more reasonably priced solutions is at an all-time high given over $750 billion in yearly remittances and growing use of digital payment systems. Meanwhile, Remittix meets this demand by allowing users to convert over forty different cryptocurrencies to FIAT straight to any bank account anywhere in the world. Remittix provides unmatched speed, security, and simplicity by using blockchain technology and local payment networks, therefore enabling more reasonably priced cross-border transactions. Furthermore, Remittix is unique mostly in its dedication to reducing transaction expenses and streamlining the process. Remittix guarantees that the recipient gets exactly the amount transferred by flat rates and no hidden charges for foreign currency or wire transfers, so ensuring that users may send money at a fraction of the cost compared to conventional banks. Unaware that the payment started from cryptocurrency, the recipient also gets a flawless experience getting money as a standard bank transfer. Priced at only $0.0167 during its presale, the native RTX coin has attracted a lot of interest with over 56 million tokens sold in only a few days, generating almost $900,000 in revenue. RTX, PEPE, or RENDER: The Altcoin Bet for 2025? Pepe (PEPE) and Render (RENDER) exhibit interesting prospects with their optimistic patterns; nevertheless, Remittix (RTX) closes the distance between crypto and fiat like no other. Its emphasis on minimal fees, easy transactions, and financial inclusion distinguishes it from other crypto projects. RTX is positioned to turn little investments into significant returns with an attractive presale price of just $0.0167 and significant early investor interest. Moreover, the presale tokens are fast selling out as a result of huge demand for the limited supply.

Among their top picks are Solana (SOL), Lightchain AI , Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH). Each of these projects offers unique strengths, from scalability to innovation, making them stand out as potential leaders in the upcoming bull market. Solana (SOL) Scalability That Drives Adoption Solana is causing big changes in the blockchain area, and its key tool is growth. By mixing Proof of History (PoH) with Proof of Stake (͏PoS), Solana gives quick speeds, handling many deals each second with small costs. It’s no surprise that builders are rushing to create decentralized apps (dApps) and DeFi answers on the platform. With a rising system, new tools, and a love for change, Solana has put itself as a main spot for blockchain fans. But its not all easy—problems like network breaks and central worries still bring doubt. Fixing these troubles will be key to making lasting growth and trust in the group. Even with the bumps, Solana’s strong aim for growth makes it a top player in blockchain tech helping to form the future of use and new ideas Lightchain AI AI-Blockchain Fusion Attracting Whales Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to transform industries, and by combining AI with blockchain, this token is positioned to tap into two fast-growing markets. With rising demand for AI solutions, the token benefits from AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain automation. Features like AIVM and PoI create opportunities in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) and AI governance. A clear roadmap, including the mainnet launch and AI-driven dApp rollouts, highlights the project’s focus on growth. A growing community of investors is also building momentum, and as awareness of its innovation spreads, broader adoption is expected. Ripple (XRP) And Ethereum (ETH) Timeless Giants Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) are prominent cryptocurrencies, each serving distinct purposes within the blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum, introduced in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), positioning itself as a pioneer in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Conversely, Ripple, launched in 2012 by Ripple Labs, focuses on facilitating fast and cost-effective cross-border payments. It aims to revolutionize international money transfers by partnering with financial institutions. While Ethereum’s versatility has led to widespread adoption in various sectors. Ripple’s emphasis on efficient global transactions has garnered significant attention from banks and payment providers. Both cryptocurrencies have significantly influenced the digital finance landscape, each addressing unique challenges and opportunities. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-02 06:32:59

With this scalable and efficient architecture, TON is positioned as a blockchain of blockchains, capable of managing almost unlimited ultra-fast transactions. TON’s sophisticated design ensures it remains a pillar of the developing blockchain scene, even at $5.95 as of writing. TON’s multi-level capabilities could propel institutional interest in cryptocurrencies to unprecedented levels as post-XRP ETF clearance speeds forward. VeChain (VET): real-world blockchain applications VeChain Thor (VET) is a pioneering IoT and blockchain platform to address enterprise-level data problems. Due to its two-token approach, which uses VET as a store of value and VTHO for gas taxes, companies are encouraged to adopt it. VeChain’s enterprise-grade solutions in sustainability, healthcare, and logistics make blockchain a significant factor in its adoption. As of writing, its live price is $0.05. The predicted flood of institutional investor money could see VeChain’s market cap skyrocket in 2025 and utility soar. Kaspa (KAS): the future of proof-of-work Using the GHOSTDAG technique, Kaspa is a proof-of-work (PoW) Bitcoin that allows blocks generated in parallel to coexist instead of becoming orphans. Thus, Kaspa can handle near-instant confirmations and significant block rates. As of this writing, Kaspa’s blockDAG technology has significantly improved over conventional blockchains at $0.11. As the crypto ecosystem develops in 2025, it is a strong candidate for expansion since it can scale safely while preserving excellent throughput. The introduction of XRP ETFs in 2025 will likely bring about a significant transformation in the cryptocurrency market. Thanks to their creative technologies and robust business cases, tokens like Rexas Finance, Sui, Toncoin, VeChain, and Kaspa are positioned to profit from this momentum. Investors should watch these projects since their potential value could make them among the most-performing assets in the next few years.

Investors reacted to private survey data showing factory activity in China grew less than expected in December, mirroring an official figure due earlier this week. Japan ( NKY:IND ) market closed. The Japanese yen remained largely unchanged around 157 per dollar on Thursday, amid thin trading volumes as Japan observed the holiday season. China ( SHCOMP ) fell -2.48% on Thursday in post-holiday trading, with the Shanghai Composite falling 1% to around 3,320 and the Shenzhen Component shedding 1.3% to 10,280 as investors reacted to disappointing factory activity data, and the offshore yuan held steady at around 7.30 per dollar, as investors returned from New Year’s holidays. A private survey revealed slower growth in China’s manufacturing sector in December, missing expectations for faster expansion. In response, Chinese authorities announced plans to issue a record 3 trillion yuan ($411 billion) in special treasury bonds in 2025. Meanwhile, traders also took note of President Xi Jinping’s New Year’s address on Tuesday, where he projected China’s 2024 GDP to surpass 130 trillion yuan and outlined plans for more proactive growth policies in 2025. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell -2.18% to 19,695 on the first trading day in 2025 following a muted activity in the prior session amid steep losses in all sectors. India ( SENSEX ) rose +0.87% to 79,145 in early deals on Thursday, marking the second consecutive session of gains and hitting a two-week high, mainly supported by rises in the auto, tech, and financial services sectors. The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI dropped to 56.4 in December 2024, down from 56.5 in November, and revised lower from an initial estimate of 57.4. Australia ( AS51 ) rose +0.52% rose 0.52% to close at 8,201 on Thursday, kicking off the year with a modest gain as mining and energy stocks benefited from stronger commodity prices. The Australian dollar surged above $0.62 on Thursday, recovering from two-year lows. The Judo Bank Australia Manufacturing PMI fell to 47.8 in December 2024 , down from 49.4 in November, according to final data. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s Index of Commodity Prices dropped 10.7% year-on-year in December, easing slightly from a downwardly revised 10.8% decline in November. The benchmark KOSPI traded nearly flat at around 2,400 points early Thursday, as investors returned from New Year’s holidays. The South Korean won rose around 1,470 per dollar, reversing losses from the previous session but remained near 16-year lows. Investors now assessed the Bank of Korea's monetary policy outlook after Governor Rhee Chang-yong emphasized the need for flexibility and agility in a New Year’s address on Thursday, citing rising political and economic uncertainties. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended in red with the S&P 500 down 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite falling 0.1%, and the Dow shedding 30 points.

Moreover, it is also the first AI token on Solana to hit a $2 billion market cap as the AI agents narrative picks up steam moving into 2025. Reports suggest that whales have accumulated nearly $25 million of the tokens recently. Solana Meme Coin ai16z Price Rally Steals the Limelight Amid hitting fresh milestones, the ai16z price rally has extended more than 200% on the weekly chart moving all the way to $2.41. With more than 600% monthly gains, it is among the top AI-based meme coins that analysts look forward to moving into 2025. As per the Coinglass data , today’s price rally for the crypto comes with a 147% surge in open interest moving all the way to $63 million. Additionally, the daily trading volume is also up by 40% to more than $260 million. The ai16z price pump from less than $1 to $2.4 has come in less than seven amid huge whale accumulation for the Solana AI coin. Blockchain data from SOL Scan highlights strong whale activity surrounding the altcoin. Whale wallet wVbrpF…BYuA withdrew 1.86 million coins, (valued at $3.95 million) from Gate.io just four hours ago. This wallet now holds a total of 10.21 million of the crypto , amounting to $22.86 million. A new wallet, CoErvN…8DiS , was created 22 hours ago and has already withdrawn 9,317 SOL ($1.77 million). These funds were used to purchase 955,500 tokens. The surge in whale activity underscores the growing interest in the AI coin, with substantial investments signaling strong confidence in the token’s future prospects. Developers behind the project are now focused on overhauling its tokenomics and launching a dedicated Layer 1 network akin to Pump.fun. These planned changes to the tokenomics could significantly influence ai16z’s price, alongside broader impacts on related cryptocurrencies within the space. This AI coin is the first venture capital DAO driven by AI agents. Spearheaded by the AI agent @pmairca, the project harnesses artificial intelligence and collective intelligence to optimize investment decision-making AI Agents Narrative Picking Up Fast Crypto market analysts believe that moving into 2025, the AI agents narrative will dominate the market. Notably, VIRTUAL , a leading AI-related cryptocurrency, experienced a remarkable price surge in 2024, solidifying its position as one of the sector’s top performers. Similarly, ai16z , also contributed to this sector with strong gains. AI-driven infrastructure projects made significant strides as the year began. VIRTUAL reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $5.06, climbing to rank 31 by market capitalization. On the other hand, ai16z price achieved an ATH of $2.42 following a remarkable 192% price surge over the past seven days, reported Coingeckco. Solana meme coins were on a roll last year in 2024 driving a large part of the overall ecosystem activity.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 06:40:26

Speaking to CNBC, Alexander expressed confidence in Bitcoin's continued growth but warned that the high leverage in crypto trading would contribute to significant price swings. “I am more bullish than ever for 2025,” Alexander said, adding that Bitcoin could “easily reach $200,000” by the end of next year. Alexander also predicted that Bitcoin would trade around $150,000 by the summer of 2025, with a potential range of plus or minus $50,000 due to ongoing volatility. Despite his optimistic outlook, Alexander clarified that he does not own Bitcoin. Related News: CEO of Giant Cryptocurrency Company Reveals the Level He Thinks Bitcoin Price Will Hit in 2025 Alexander attributed his bullish stance to the expected regulatory clarity in the US, which he believes will provide significant support to Bitcoin. However, he warned that the absence of stricter regulation on crypto exchanges will continue to increase volatility in the market. The high leverage on crypto trading platforms in particular is expected to cause sharp price swings, with trades amplifying both upward and downward movements in Bitcoin’s value. Alexander has previously demonstrated his ability to accurately predict Bitcoin’s price movements. In 2023, he predicted that Bitcoin would reach $100,000 in 2024. While Alexander’s price targets are optimistic, he noted the ongoing volatility problem in the cryptocurrency market. “There are no signs that volatility is abating,” he said, signaling that investors should be prepared for unpredictable price swings even as Bitcoin’s value rises. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, he updated his profile name to “Kekius Maximus” and changed his avatar to an image of Pepe the Frog, a popular meme often associated with internet subcultures, dressed as a Roman soldier. This seemingly playful move triggered a dramatic surge in the value of a meme-based cryptocurrency named Kekius Maximus, with reports of its value skyrocketing by as much as 800% within 24 hours. The phenomenon is reminiscent of Musk’s previous impact on Dogecoin, where his tweets and endorsements transformed the joke cryptocurrency into a global sensation, driving its price to historic highs. Musk’s ability to amplify internet memes into financial instruments underscores the power of his social media presence but also raises serious questions about market volatility, the sustainability of such trends, and potential concerns over market manipulation. As Musk continues to blend meme culture with financial markets, his actions highlight the unpredictable intersection of social media, technology, and cryptocurrency. Elon Musk’s recent switch to a frog-themed X profile picture has reignited speculation about his influence on cryptocurrency markets, sparking meme coin surges almost instantly. Rumors abound that Musk’s “binary 0 1 code” reference to “Kekius Maximus” might indirectly point to Pepeto, the God of Frogs. As a project with a narrative and value deeply rooted in frog-themed cryptocurrency culture, Pepeto aligns perfectly with the growing interest Musk seems to spotlight. This move underscores the unparalleled power of social media to drive market trends, blending meme culture with financial speculation and fueling excitement around Pepeto’s potential.

This announcement serves Pepeto’s New Year’s gift to its devoted community. With Tier 1 exchanges already showing interest in listing Pepeto during its presale, the project’s momentum is undeniable. The message encourages the community to share and engage, ensuring the God of Frogs’ influence grows even further.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the crypto market gears up for the 2025 altcoin season, analysts are spotlighting Ripple, Hedera, and Rollblock as top contenders. Table of Contents Rollblock: Transforming the $450b gambling industry Is Ripple breaking the $5 resistance level in 2025? Hedera could become the dark horse of 2025 Is RBLK the best token for 2025? Donald Trump’s presidency ignited a surge in the crypto market, with numerous altcoins reaching new all-time highs. However, the market has since cooled off, preparing for the 2025 altcoin season. Among the many promising cryptocurrencies, analysts are highlighting Ripple, Hedera, and Rollblock as options investors should watch. Here’s why. Rollblock: Transforming the $450b gambling industry Rollblock is poised to be one of the best-performing crypto assets in 2025 due to its innovation in the GambleFi niche. The project combines the traditional iGaming approach with new blockchain technologies to disrupt the traditional casino industry. The GambleFi protocol has already proven itself as a big player in the field, with more than $1.3 million in wagers placed in December alone. A fully licensed and operational platform Rollblock is a fully licensed online gambling provider with over 7,000 casino games, including blackjack, roulette, slots, and poker. All these games are offered under a license issued by Gaming Anjouan. In addition to its license, Rollblock offers a top-notch AI-powered security system and advanced encryption technology, protecting both players and investors. RBLK: Fueling Rollblock’s ecosystem At the heart of Rollblock’s ecosystem is RBLK, the native and utility token. Currently, in its ninth presale stage, analysts forecast a potential 100x return once RBLK hits the market. Each week, up to 30% of Rollblock’s revenue is directed towards buying RBLK from the open market. From that sum, 60% of the tokens are burned to create a deficit of supply on the market. The rest is used for staking rewards. This mechanism makes RBLK deflationary, setting the project up for long-term success.

Ripple has dropped 30% from its December 3 peak of $2.90 but has had a 4% rise in the last 24 hours. The increase follows a stronger U.S. dollar. XRP’s trading volume reached $4.5 billion, highlighting significant selling pressure, with $173 million in liquidations, including $7 million in Ripple longs. The broader market downturn saw Bitcoin fall 12.6% this week to $93,700 and Ethereum drop 15.5% to $3,337. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) surged to 108.5, adding pressure on dollar-denominated assets like Ripple. Ripple is now testing key support levels at $2.0–$1.96, with resistance at $2.5. A breakout above this level could lead to a sharp rise to $4–$5. With an RSI of 57.23, the market is neutral but ripe for a short-term rebound. Analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s future. With legal issues potentially behind it and growing institutional adoption, Ripple is expected to hit $5 by late 2025, with even more upside if market sentiment improves. Hedera could become the dark horse of 2025 Currently trading at $0.2924, Hedera has surged 13% in the past 30 days, reflecting strong market interest. Analysts are predicting a target of $1.00, with a potential for $5.00 by late 2025, driven by increasing institutional support and the possibility of ETF approval. Hedera’s technical indicators show a strengthening uptrend, with a neutral RSI at 47. Analysts foresee resistance at $0.31 and $0.37, with key support at $0.27. Given the ongoing growth, successful ETF rumors and potential for further partnerships, Hedera is well-positioned for significant price appreciation. As adoption accelerates, Hedera could see a strong rally, reaching $5 by 2025 as more institutions and sectors integrate Hedera’s cutting-edge solutions. Is RBLK the best token for 2025? While cryptocurrencies like Hedera and Ripple have already delivered strong results in 2024, 2025 may belong to Rollblock. Unlike many tokens, Rollblock offers more than just capital gains, it allows investors to tap directly into the $750 billion gambling market through a staking mechanism. With RBLK tokens priced at just $0.044, now is the time to take advantage of this opportunity before prices rise in the coming weeks. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and socials.

Blue chip tokens like XRP and ADA have been predicted to give good returns. AI and meme coins will also turn bullish in 2025. The crypto market has entered 2025 with optimism, fueled by predictions of a potential bull market under President-elect Donald Trump. Known for his pro-crypto stance during campaign speeches, Trump’s administration has raised expectations of favorable regulatory changes and policies. A recent ThinkingCrypto podcast , hosted by Tony Edward, highlighted that the Federal Reserve might resume Quantitative Easing (QE) and continue cutting interest rates. These developments could boost Bitcoin (BTC), making it more appealing to investors as liquidity rises globally. Bitcoin’s Record Highs Under Pro-Crypto Policies Last year, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,000 following Trump’s election.

This release, totaling over $1 billion in value, highlights the ongoing strategy Ripple has in place to distribute XRP over time. However, this massive release was accompanied with a memo which read, “January 20th is around the corner. Donald Trump will be in the WH, and we are going to make crypto great again!” The upcoming inauguration could provide a catalyst for further price action, potentially leading to a strong rally. XRP Price Reacts: The price of XRP has already seen an 11% surge, with a positive Buy signal on the indicators, suggesting that the bullish trend will continue throughout the month. The overall market is also showing signs of recovery, adding to the optimism surrounding XRP. XRP is currently trading at $2.35 and is now aiming to hit the $2.50 mark. While December is often a time of market corrections, January and beyond look much more promising for XRP and other cryptocurrencies. The market saw rapid fluctuations, with major coins like Bitcoin and XRP experiencing sharp pumps and sudden drops, but now that we’ve entered January, the outlook is bullish. A key factor is the expected regulatory changes for crypto, with President Trump’s administration likely to introduce crypto-friendly policies. The launch of several altcoin ETFs—including for XRP—could fuel massive market growth in the coming months.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-02 07:02:24

XLM has surged 28% on the day, hitting an intraday high of $0.456 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session. Stellar spiked to over $0.60 in late November, but it still remains down 50% from its 2018 all-time high.

Bitcoin Consolidation Continues Bitcoin has made just 1.3% over the past day to top $95,000 during Thursday morning trading.

This move comes as part of its ongoing bankruptcy process, where Celsius seeks to recover significant funds while dealing with past missteps. The Claims Against FTX Celsius originally sought $2 billion, blaming FTX for making false statements that allegedly worsened its financial problems. Later, the claim was revised to $444 million, focusing on “preferential transfers” arguing that certain transactions unfairly benefited specific creditors. Celsius filed a Notice of Appeal against Judge Dorsey's ruling for FTX debtor Elected for Appeal to be heard in the District Court Facts 1) Celsius Filed a $2bn claim for disparagement before the bar date 2) Celsius filed a $444m amended claim for a preference claim after bar… pic.twitter.com/evaBzMi5Lt — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) January 1, 2025 In December, Judge John Dorsey dismissed both claims in December, saying Celsius failed to provide enough proof. He also criticized the company for improperly filing changes to its claims in July 2024 without seeking permission. The court ruled these changes were unrelated to the original claims and would disrupt FTX’s restructuring. Paying Back Creditors Despite legal challenges, Celsius has worked to repay its creditors. In August, it returned $2.53 billion to over 250,000 creditors, covering around two-thirds of the claims. In November, it announced another $127 million payout from its recovery funds. These efforts briefly boosted the value of Celsius’s native token (CEL), which surged 350% to $0.56 in September. However, the price dropped to $0.1960 . Legal Troubles for the Founder Adding to Celsius’s challenges, its founder, Alex Mashinsky, pleaded guilty last month to fraud and manipulation of the CEL token. He faces a potential 20-year prison sentence, with sentencing scheduled for April 2025. What’s Next for Celsius? Celsius’s appeal aims to overturn the court’s dismissal of its claims against FTX. While it continues to navigate bankruptcy proceedings, the case highlights the risks and complexities in the crypto industry.

Between July 25 and December 31, 2024, the company purchased 78.2 Bitcoin at an average price of $80,960 per unit, totaling $6.3 million. In order to fund this purchase, Yuxing has to sell 6.3 million USDT at an average price of $1 per unit. The USDT proceeds were directly converted into Bitcoin, which shows how confident the firm is in crypto assets. Bitcoin is slightly out of focus from its last $100K mark and currently trading around $95K, though the market is bullish that it will get an upward boost this year with industry support.

According to him it is a strategic move to bring financial stability to the country and will reduce dependency on traditional assets. Jiexhuang highlighted the importance of leveraging Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework to explore innovative financial strategies. He claimed that if major economies in the world start adding Bitcoin to their reserves, its value will stabilize, encouraging other countries to follow suit. Hence as an outcome, it will actually drop the value of traditional assets, impacting government reserves tied to those assets. Institutions are betting big on Bitcoin as it soars! Read Bitcoin price prediction to see how the bullish market could push it to new heights! Efforts to Enhance Crypto Infrastructure To stay ahead in the crypto game, The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) launched a Virtual Asset Index Series earlier this year. This index will provide a reliable price benchmark that will be set for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pricing in Asia, to address the global price fluctuations. Moreover, Hong Kong regulators are also about to finalize licensing for several crypto exchanges , including Crypto.com which shows the region’s commitment to become the fintech crypto hub in the world. Crypto is slow at the moment in Hong Kong due to regulations and licensing issues with crypto exchanges yet investors are confident that Bitcoin will give maximum returns than traditional assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Adoption Index 2024: US Ownership Hits 40%, Market Cap Soars , Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve plan has created a global impact and countries are debating whether to add Bitcoin to their mainstream financing model.

Industry leaders are hopeful that the new administration will fulfill its promises in bringing about clarity and reform to the regulations governing digital assets. It could prove to be the turning point for crypto companies in their long battle against an unfriendly regulatory environment that seems too cloudy and overregulatory. Ripple vs. SEC: A Defining Legal Battle One of the most overriding concerns is the Ripple case ongoing against the SEC. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, reiterated on Dec. 31 that tokens are not inherently securities, although they can be involved in security transactions. Ripple is appealing an August 2024 ruling that found the company liable for $125 million. The outcome could set a vital precedent for how regulators classify digital assets going forward. The Chevron Doctrine and SEC Cases Other recent significant movement included the Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling that overturned the Chevron doctrine, whereby courts would defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous laws. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said that decision may force judges to re-evaluate cases brought by the SEC, potentially leading to a more fair-minded judiciary when it came to digital asset regulations. High-Stakes Legal and Criminal Cases The year 2025 will be very eventful legally for the crypto sector. Cases against former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and recently extradited Terraform Labs’ Do Kwon will continue, while simultaneously, the shake-up in the leadership at agencies such as the SEC and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York might impact the ongoing enforcement actions. Trump’s Proposed Leadership Shake-Up He has hinted at plans for regulatory leadership shake-ups. Among them, he’s proposed swapping SEC Chair Gary Gensler for former commissioner Paul Atkins and naming Jay Clayton, Gensler’s predecessor, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. If the plans go through, this could substantially lessen the regulatory load on crypto companies and direct enforcement efforts to support business growth. Everything the crypto industry could want in 2025 depends on whether this new administration can deliver. In a year featuring changed leadership, landmark legal cases, and possibly some regulatory clarity, this could be the year that sets up the future of digital assets in the US.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-02 07:15:00

According to a December research note , BTC’s price is forecasted to exceed $150,000, while ETH could surpass $8,000. Analysts are also increasingly optimistic about a robust “altcoin season” on the horizon. The bullish predictions stem from several favorable factors, including an improved regulatory landscape, declining interest rates, and enhanced liquidity. The historically strong performance following Bitcoin’s halving and growing institutional adoption further strengthens this outlook. Inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs to Remain Strong Steno anticipates significant inflows into U.S.-based Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), estimating net inflows of $48 billion for BTC ETFs and $28.5 billion for ETH ETFs in 2025. Ethereum is expected to outpace Bitcoin’s growth, with the ETH/BTC ratio projected to reach at least 0.06, nearly doubling its current level of 0.035. This shift is likely to trigger a broader altcoin rally, reducing Bitcoin’s market dominance from 57% to approximately 45%, the report suggests. Steno attributes part of this trend to the potential impact of Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory, which is seen as more favorable for altcoins than Bitcoin. Trump’s policies are expected to encourage stronger onchain activity, benefiting platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Altcoin investors in 2025: pic.twitter.com/Te9RKnx5p7 — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 19, 2024 Additionally, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications is projected to surpass $300 billion in 2025, significantly exceeding the 2021 peak of $180 billion. Other industry leaders, including Grayscale, share similar optimism. Grayscale recently added decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, including those on Solana, to its watchlist for 2025. The firm cited a favorable U.S. policy environment and Trump’s pledge to position the U.S. as a global crypto hub as driving forces behind its positive outlook. US Crypto Owners Expect Less Regulation Cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift. Speaking at a legal conference in New York, current and former senior government lawyers indicated that while financial fraud cases will still be pursued, the Justice Department’s focus will likely move toward immigration enforcement, a key campaign promise of Trump. Scott Hartman, co-chief of the securities and commodities task force at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, revealed that fewer resources will be allocated to policing cryptocurrency crimes. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies , opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. As reported, the Republican Party is preparing to introduce a comprehensive crypto market structure bill within the first 100 days of the upcoming legislative session, according to Representative French Hill. In December, Hill emphasized the urgent need for regulatory clarity in the U.S. crypto market, calling it a “top priority” for the GOP. Hill revealed that GOP Majority Leader Steve Scalise is leading the charge on the legislation, which aims to establish clear guidelines for the digital asset industry.

Since 2018, Bappebti has overseen crypto assets. However, the transition, set to be completed by Jan. 12, 2025, is delayed due to the lack of a supporting government regulation, the Jakarta Globe reported on Thursday. OJK is expected to create a more transparent regulatory environment aligned with international standards. It plans to introduce clearer rules on trading, taxation, and crypto exchange operations, areas previously managed under Bappebti’s less detailed oversight. This shift aligns with the Financial Sector Development and Strengthening Law, aiming to streamline oversight and foster a safer, more inclusive framework for digital assets. OJK Confirms Progress on Crypto Oversight Transition, Regulation Draft Finalized OJK Chairman Mahendra Siregar reportedly confirmed that discussions and preparations for the transition are actively underway. He announced that the draft government regulation is now officially formatted. “We’ve been working closely with the Trade Ministry to ensure a seamless process. Once the regulation is issued, it will provide the legal basis for the transition,” he said. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati first introduced the plan during financial sector discussions in late 2022. The bill was to become law once both the legislative and executive branches reached an agreement on all provisions. Indonesia Crypto Market Hits $30B in 2024 Transactions By Oct. 2024, Indonesia’s crypto market reached a major milestone with over 475 trillion rupiah (around $30b) in transactions. This marks a 352% jump from the $6.5b recorded during the same period in 2023. However, it still falls short of the $54b achieved in the bullish market of 2021. At the same time, Indonesia’s crypto trader base has grown significantly, reaching 21m users. Of these, 716,000 trade through locally registered exchanges. Notably, over 60% of these investors are aged 18 to 30 , highlighting strong youth participation in the market. This growth places Indonesia among the countries with the highest number of crypto traders worldwide.

There are “textbook bull signals” on the charts, which means SHIB could reach $0.000081 in the next few months, according to an analyst. But what’s making people so hopeful? Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Enter Its Most Massive Bull Cycle? This Engineer Thinks So Whale Activity Sparks Fresh Momentum Recent whale movements are yielding very significant insights into the prospects of SHIB. One such movement involved the withdrawal of 220 billion SHIB tokens, worth $4.63 million, from Binance by a single entity. Such withdrawals have usually been linked to heightened interest among institutional or high-net-worth investors, and it bodes well for the token. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) finishing up the year holding a major breakout and coming off of textbook bull signals on lower timeframes! Holding broken out, the target at $0.000081 goes unchanged and these bull signals can be pointing to a continuation within an over 264% run to reach it! https://t.co/4L9HEciT3a pic.twitter.com/qkmLQURP5u — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 31, 2024 According to IntoTheBlock data, the large transaction and whale activity also supports this trend. As more interest is gathered, SHIB is building up the momentum needed for overcoming critical resistance levels. Breaking Resistance Levels Even though the prediction is for price growth, SHIB needs to break through a key resistance level at $0.000029. Analysts say that breaking above this level is the first thing that needs to happen for the token to reach its lofty goal of $0.000080. In the past, this resistance had stopped SHIB in its tracks, but recent good sentiment might be enough now. Meanwhile, the metrics from Coincheckup have shown an improved trading volume and market sentiment of SHIB. If this continues, the token might find the strength to overcome the current barriers it faces. The Broader Crypto Context The surge for Shiba Inu is happening in the midst of more significant changes in the cryptocurrency space. The recent stabilization of Ethereum and Bitcoin has created an opportunity for altcoins like SHIB to flourish. Furthermore, new players have entered the market as a result of memecoins’ growing appeal as speculative investments. According to other analysts, the optimism may also stem from SHIB’s long-term strategy, which centers on Shibarium, their Layer 2 blockchain. Investors find SHIB’s use case more appealing since Shibarium enables quicker transactions and cheaper costs. Related Reading: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset?

Will Warren Buffett need Bitcoin to compete in 2025?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-btc-2025/,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway did what it does best in 2024—beat the market. While the S&P 500 had a historic 24% gain, Berkshire came out on top again, sticking to its decades-old strategy of value investing. But see, Wall Street isn’t what it used to be anymore, and 2025 is set to challenge even Warren’s legendary approach. With a self-proclaimed “crypto president” in the Oval Office, Bitcoin crossing $100,000 and getting increasingly correlated to US stocks, we couldn’t help but wonder: will the Oracle of Omaha have to embrace Bitcoin to stay ahead? Berkshire Hathaway’s success isn’t luck. It’s a strategy built on consistency, cash reserves, and a refusal to chase fads. But there’s no denying that Bitcoin, once dismissed by Warren as “rat poison squared,” is now a serious player in global finance. Can Warren’s old-school methods hold up in what is widely expected to be the “Golden Age” of finance? Berkshire Hathaway’s 2024 playbook Berkshire Hathaway’s 2024 performance was a masterclass in patience. While the tech-heavy S&P 500 surged, driven by AI giants like Nvidia and Apple, Berkshire leaned into its traditional strengths. As of January 1, its Class A shares were trading at $677,200, above the $673,660 target set by analysts. Key to this success is its diversified portfolio. Apple remains its crown jewel, making up 30-40% of its equity holdings. Coca-Cola, a Warren favorite since the 1980s, still pulls its weight with a steady 3.1% dividend yield. Sure the company has underperformed the S&P 500 over five and ten years, lagging by 33% and 105%, respectively. But it’s still a bedrock investment—consistent dividends, pricing power, and a global brand that prints money. But what really sets Berkshire apart is its cash. The company’s reserves surged past $300 billion in 2024, giving Warren the kind of flexibility most investors will only ever dream about. He is a legend, with a war chest that allows him to snap up opportunities when others panic. Analysts predict this will be a major advantage in 2025, especially if tech stocks lose steam and value investing comes back into vogue. The Bitcoin question: A threat or an opportunity? For years, Warren has been the loudest critic of Bitcoin, calling it everything from “rat poison” to a “mirage.” His argument is simple: Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. But come on, it’s 2025, that view is kind of outdated now. We are in a monster bull run, and institutional investors are piling in. BlackRock’s Larry Fink now calls it “digital gold.” Nearly everyone with a position under the incoming administration is pro-crypto, even the director of NASA . That’s how serious Trump is about loving Bitcoin. At some point, it’s gonna get embarrassing for Warren that he is still holding out on Bitcoin. What more does he need? We all know that young and retail investors, the ones Berkshire needs to attract for long-term growth, are all-in on crypto. They see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and the future of finance. If Berkshire ignores this trend, it risks losing relevance with this demographic. Meanwhile, the S&P 500’s 24% gain in 2024 was driven by the so-called “Magnificent Seven,” tech giants like Nvidia and Apple. Nvidia alone jumped 171%, thanks to AI hype. But this tech-driven rally came at a cost. The S&P recorded its first four-day losing streak to end the year since 1966. It’s a reminder that what goes up, eventually comes down. Berkshire, by contrast, plays the long game. So will Warren ever adapt to Bitcoin? History says maybe. He once called tech stocks a bubble, only to invest billions in Apple. No matter which way he goes in the end, it’ll be historic to witness.",OP-ED|Apple|Berkshire Hathaway|BlackRock|BTC|Coca Cola|Nvidia,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-02 07:31:08

Trump 2025 (TRUM2025), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUM2025 is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump 2025 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump 2025 could become the next viral memecoin. Trump 2025 launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump 2025 on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump 2025 by entering its contract address – 5K2ESM1q2SjZFybttofLFpbbW8yF3isBRW3ZxDPUVfVY – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUM2025. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 07:38:59

Speaking about his decade-long journey with Cardano, Hoskinson said that they aim to ensure a smooth transition to a fully decentralized, community-driven ecosystem. Reflecting on the past decade, Hoskinson said: “I have spent ten years of my life on Cardano as of 2025. Many mistakes were made but I never crossed the line to take money from the community or deviated from the original roadmap.” With the recent launch of the Chang hard fork upgrade, ADA is now controlled by community members. Hoskinson described his latest mission as removing obstacles to this transition and ensuring that no individual or entity disrupts the process. Related News: Syrian Transitional Government Offers Extraordinary Bitcoin Proposal The Voltaire Era is the final phase on Cardano’s roadmap, focusing on full decentralization and community-driven governance. A critical step in this transition is the approval of the budget and bylaws, which Hoskinson believes are crucial to the project’s success. But there are obstacles. Insiders have raised concerns about the timeline, accusing the Cardano Foundation of delaying the approval process. Hoskinson insisted that these plans should be approved by next year: “This is my mission for the last ten years, and I will fulfill it, no matter what the personal, economic or professional consequences.” Despite the challenges, Hoskinson is optimistic about Cardano’s future and predicts 2025 will be its best year yet. *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents Pepeto leads the charge into 2025 with unmatched vision About PEPETO Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and owner of X (formerly Twitter), has once again demonstrated his extraordinary impact on cryptocurrency markets. In a recent move, he updated his profile name to “Kekius Maximus” and adopted an avatar featuring Pepe the Frog, a well-known internet meme portrayed as a Roman soldier. This seemingly lighthearted update sparked an incredible 800% increase in the value of a meme-inspired cryptocurrency named Kekius Maximus within just 24 hours. This phenomenon echoes Musk’s previous influence on Dogecoin, where his tweets and public endorsements elevated the meme-based cryptocurrency to global prominence, driving its value to unprecedented heights. Musk’s ability to turn memes into financial powerhouses highlights the vast reach of his social media presence, while also raising important questions about market stability, the sustainability of meme-driven trends, and the potential for market manipulation. His actions continue to showcase the unpredictable intersection of social media influence, emerging technologies, and the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Elon Musk’s recent frog-themed profile picture on X has ignited speculation in cryptocurrency communities, with some interpreting his “binary 0 1 code” reference to “Kekius Maximus” as a possible nod to Pepeto, the God of Frogs. Pepeto’s captivating narrative and its alignment with the surging popularity of frog-themed cryptocurrencies place it in sync with the trends Musk’s actions frequently magnify. This development underscores the powerful role of social media in influencing crypto market trends, blending the whimsical appeal of memes with significant financial intrigue, and drawing attention to Pepeto’s rising prominence and potential.

The altcoin eyes a prolonged bull market run in Q1, which could see it hit $3.

The campaign needs 100,000 signatures before it can be tabled for a referendum. The legislator has strategically pushed the Bitcoin agenda in the legislative house and on any podium with an audience. His campaign is already bearing fruit, as Swiss crypto advocates have forwarded a proposal to compel the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to hold part of its reserve in gold and Bitcoin. SNB Chairman doubts BTC’s role in national reserve amid growing crypto support Although the cryptocurrency agenda is getting loud in Switzerland, most people are feeling cold about incorporating it into their national reserve. Swiss National Bank Chairman Martin Schlegel has expressed concern for cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether, calling them niche phenomena. He believes the cash system would play an important role in the Swiss payments system. In November, at an event organized by the Aargauische Kantonalbank in Brugg, he noted that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have grown enormously in recent years. However, he observed that the currencies remain a niche phenomenon. While the chairman has never taken a position on the future of crypto, he has raised several concerns, such as its fluctuation in value, making it difficult to rely on it as a form of payment. There are also concerns about the amount of energy Bitcoin uses and illegal crypto-related activities. One online user, @PB3g3r , feels the initiative is just an educational or reelection campaign tool, as the proposal will fall. He holds that the Citizens and Cantons of Switzerland will not modify their constitution for a few more dollars, and they trust that the Swiss National Bank will act accordingly. Another online user, Till Könneker, reacted on X by saying : “ You know how Swiss democracy works. Unfortunately, people will never vote for this.” Bitcoin is going from neutral to constitutional The call to constitutionalize BTC is not new in Switzerland. Switzerland’s Canton of Bern parliament already approved a motion to relook at Bitcoin mining to use surplus energy and stabilize its electricity bill. The proposal backed by Samuel Kullmann was tabled by an expert and supported by five political parties on March 14, 2024. However, the government was against this proposal. It was passed decisively by 85 to 46 votes in the Grand Council. The cross-party initiative is compelling the government council to study how BTC mining can repurpose unused energy and create economic opportunities. The passing of this motion is driving Samuel Kullmann’s confidence that they will succeed in the referendum push and that Bitcoin will be integrated into the Swiss constitution.

Here’s What Experts Think,https://coingape.com/is-1-mln-bitcoin-price-possible-in-2025-heres-what-experts-think/,"Bitcoin price has started the year on a positive note, indicating that investors are regaining confidence in the asset. Amid this, a flurry of market experts has set different price targets for the flagship crypto, which has sparked discussions in the market. Besides, a top analyst also discussed BTC’s potential to hit $1 million in 2025 and what could trigger such a rally in the coming months. Can Bitcoin Price Hit $1 Million? Bitcoin price has gained notable traction in 2024, especially after Donald Trump’s election win in November. However, as we enter 2025, the market participants remain on edge with many exploring what lies ahead for the flagship crypto. Amid this, a top expert recently revealed if BTC could target the $1 million mark in 2025 and factors that can boost the price higher. For context, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, recently said that the crypto can likely rally to $1 million in 2025. He noted that the crypto can hit the $1 million mark only if the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve idea for the US becomes reality. However, he also said that the chance of the BTC Reserve happening in 2025 is less than 10%. Source: Jeff Park, X Meanwhile, Trump’s victory has boosted the sentiment of the market lately. Besides, his active support for BTC during his election campaign has further fueled market optimism. The Republican leader also pledged to make the US the crypto capital, which has further triggered speculations. A flurry of countries are also shifting their focus towards the digital assets space, especially Bitcoin. In addition, corporations like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy are also spending heavily on crypto, reflecting the growing market interest in crypto. Bold BTC Forecasts BTC price today was up over 2% and exchanged hands at $95,656 while its one-day trading volume fell 24% to $29.99 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $95,824 and a low of $92,788. Furthermore, CoinGlass data showed that Bitcoin Futures Open Interest also rose significantly, reflecting the strong market interest in the crypto. Meanwhile, a recent CNBC report shared several price targets for BTC by experts. For instance, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said that Bitcoin price could rally to $150K in 2025. However, he also noted that the crypto could slump to $80K as well if the bearish momentum dominates. Simultaneously, Matrixport said that the crypto is likely to hit $160K this year. On the other hand, Galaxy Digital expects BTC to rally to $185K in 2025 amid soaring crypto adoption of the institutions. The post Is $1 Mln Bitcoin Price Possible In 2025?

However, its long-term bullish trajectory remains valid. It is currently trading flat while footing a fresh increase daily. Last month’s correction slowed down buying after peaking at the $793 level. However, it managed to recover well from a low of $600. Following the recovery back into the key trading $700 range in late December, BNB’s next move has remained indecisive due to an extreme drop in volatility. Several attempts to move out of this range have proven abortive. While the crypto found it difficult to overcome $730 last week, the price remains strong weekly while the trend remains in favour of the bulls in the long term. Amid fading negative sentiments, we can anticipate a huge swing high in the coming weeks. A lower correction could trigger a leg down capable of causing serious pains in the short-term. But looking at the setups, which show signs of bullish, the price will likely explode massively anytime soon. The build-up is much more likely to go to the upside as the trend is still in favour of the bulls. For such a move, a break above the previous monthly high should set the market up for another rally. BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview BNB supports are currently held at $683 and $642. If by any chance the price plunges through these levels to $618, the next support to watch would be $600.

Court documents showed crypto lending platform has filed a notice of appeal challenging Judge John Dorsey’s ruling, which denied Celsius ‘ claims for FTX damages worth around $444 million. The trial is part of FTX’s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings which would seek to repay damages from the fallen crypto exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried. According to the appeal filed by Celsius Network’s litigation administrator, Mohsin Meghji, Celsius initially filed a claim for up to $2 billion in damages due to “unsubstantiated and disparaging statements” about the firm’ balance sheet and financial stability by FTX officers that the firm’s lawyers believe accelerated Celsius’ collapse in 2022. However, before the bar date, Celsius decreased the claim amount to around $444 million, as the crypto lending firm stated it will focus on restoring “preferential transfers” that would prioritize repayments for certain creditors. You might also like: Celsius advisors demand for $2b withdrawn before bankruptcy According to the document, FTX debtors denied Celsius’ claims because they deemed the original proof lodged by the firm were not enough to substantiate the claim. Additionally, the amendment from $2 billion to $444 million was thought to have been filed “too late and should be disallowed.” Celsius argued that the original proof should be enough to meet the minimum requirements within the Bankruptcy Code and put debtors on notice. Last December, Judge Dorsey dismissed both the amended $444 million claim and the initial $2 billion claim, stating Celsius’ original proof of claim — which only contained one sentence about investigating preference claims — was not enough to substantiate its claims for FTX damages. Moreover, the court found that Celsius’ amended proofs filed in July were not legitimate due to the revised claim not being related to the original claims. Moreover, Celsius did not seek leave to amend nor provide an explanation regarding the filing delay. In late November 2024, Celsius vowed to distribute $127 million to its credits from its litigation recovery account. Within that same month, a New York federal judge ruled against Celsius’ former CEO Alex Mashinsky’s bid to dismiss two fraud charges. Mashinsky is accused of manipulating the price of Celsius’ native token, CEL . He faces two charges of wire fraud and market manipulation following the collapse of the crypto lending firm, which could lead to a maximum sentence of 115 years behind bars.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) miner HIVE Digital Technologies has hit a major milestone, reaching 6.0 exahashes per second in operational hashrate, marking a 47% jump from 4.08 EH/s at the end of 2023. The Vancouver-headquartered firm explained in a Jan. 2 press release that the growth comes from upgrading its Bitcoin mining fleet with the latest Avalon machines from Canaan Inc. On top of the fleet upgrade, HIVE has also secured competitive energy pricing in Sweden, with electricity costs below two cents per kilowatt-hour. This helps keep their operating costs manageable and improves profitability. The firm’s hedged energy position in Sweden supports its focus on cost-effective operations. Looking ahead, HIVE has big plans. The company is still targeting 15 EH/s of global hashrate, though this time the firm is shifting its timeline for achieving this: from summer to the end of 2025. This will be supported by a 100 MW hydroelectric-powered expansion in Paraguay, which is expected to bring the company’s fleet efficiency to 17 joules per terahash.

In late 2024, HIVE considerably expanded its mining operations, purchasing 11,500 Avalon ASIC miners from Canaan Inc. and 8.6 EH/s of Bitmain’s S21+ Hydro machines. That deal was part of the firm’s plan to reach a total mining capacity of 15 EH/s, with the purchase expected to generate over $300 million in annual revenue once fully deployed.

During the last leg down that led to a broad price correction in the short term, Sol found support above a three-month trendline and recovered but unfortunately failed to resume an uptrend due to low buying commitment. Though the bulls tried to step back in action as there was not enough volume to bring them back in control. The daily supply level still appears high, and as a result, we can expect more drag-downs after distribution. If that fails to play, it will continue to trade flat until a surge occurs. Looking back from where the price started to drop in November, Sol has posted a notable loss as it fell into the $170 range, with a sharp bounce. This bounce has brought relief as it subjects to a sideways movement. Adjusting to the lower timeframe, Sol is still forming a lower low and lower high pattern on the 4-hour chart. This bearish pattern suggests that the correction phase is still active. It may create a new lower low if the support trendline breaks down. Meanwhile, a change in the bearish trend can be expected once Sol starts to make a new high. Amid the latest correction, the general market outlook is still considered bullish on a macro level. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Sol is currently in the middle of consolidation. A breakdown from the current trading level could roll the price back to $176, located under the trendline. Other support levels to consider for drops are $155 and $141. Resuming bullish, the price must climb back above the $202 and $227 resistance levels. A breakthrough $247 to the $264 resistance should fuel a huge rally to a new high. Key Resistance Levels: $202, $227, $247 Key Support Levels: $176, $155, $141 Spot Price: $190 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A CoinDesk analysis from Tuesday flagged unusually high trading volumes for XRP stemming from South Korean exchanges, which has historically acted as a harbinger for price volatility with a bias to the upside. XRP surged 11% to lead growth among majors as of Thursday, led by $1.3 billion worth of trading volumes on Korea-focused exchange UpBit. Among other majors, Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and Chainlink’s LINK added as much as 8%. Ether (ETH) and BNB Chain’s BNB rose 3%, while memecoins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) added 5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, rose 5.8% . The anticipation of a more crypto-friendly administration under incoming U.S. president Donald Trump, who has made campaign promises for crypto friendly policies and a strategic bitcoin reserve, is largely fuelling optimism for 2025. The Bitcoin halving event in 2024 historically led to a bullish trend in the following year due to the reduced supply of new tokens entering the market. The broader crypto market also tends to follow a four-year cycle influenced by the halvings — with memecoins, AI and real-world assets expected to be market leaders. Predictions aren’t limited to mere cycles, however. Firms such as Galaxy Research predict large-scale institutional, corporate, and nation-state adoption in bitcoin investments, with at least five Nasdaq-100 companies and five nation-states expected to adopt the asset. The firm targets a $185,000 level for bitcoin and $5,500 for ether (ETH) this year. Singapore-based QCP Capital mirrors that sentiment: “For 2025, while optimism surrounds crypto-friendly regulations post-Trump inauguration, we think the key catalyst may come in January as institutions readjust asset allocations.” “With BTC now broadly adopted by a broad spectrum of institutions, allocations are likely to increase, strengthening Bitcoin dominance, stabilizing spot movements, and shifting volatility dynamics closer to equities,” the firm said in a Telegram broadcast on Tuesday. “Expect stronger demand for downside puts for hedging and more covered call selling on the topside.” Some say bitcoin becoming a mainstream asset may further reduce its infamous volatility, leading to even more adoption among institutional firms. “Mainstream's effect on crypto is most evident through BTC's high correlation to the SPX, remaining the most correlated asset as we end 2024,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Another sign of BTC heading towards being a mainstream asset class is its declining realized volatility, which would eventually add more diversification benefits and alpha to the traditional 60/40 portfolio.” “Volatility should continue to decline as an asset class matures, as our long-standing view is that crypto would be no different,” Fan added.",Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-02 08:02:36

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 853,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may correct by double-digit percentage points in January based on historic precedence. “At least in the last two [post-halving years], there has been a correction in January. Now what’s interesting is this time we’ve already kind of had a correction in December, but if you look at what happened in 2021, there was a correction in January, about a 30% drop. If you look at 2017, the post-halving year in January there was also about a 30% drop.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube However, Cowen says Bitcoin’s December correction may have been caused by the anticipation of the historic January correction and therefore Bitcoin may not correct this month. “But the counterpoint, of course, is that Bitcoin was not really struggling at the end of December [in the prior two instances]. It was actually going up [in December 2016] and then you had a drop in January. Same thing again in 2021. This time has been a little bit different in that regard as it’s bled in December rather than having gone up. So obviously the optimist would say, Well, maybe it’s just front-running the correction because everyone’s talking about it happening in January; therefore, why not it happen in December? If you look at a price range here [in December 2024], it’s already dropped around 15%. A 30% drop would actually put it right around the 20-week moving average [at $77,712]. So the optimist would certainly look at that and say, Maybe it’s just front running what everyone was already knowing was happening so by the time it actually happens, Bitcoin already carried out that move.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Cowen also suggests Bitcoin may have headed lower in December based on its historical correlation with the rate for 10-year yields (US10Y). “The other way to think about it is if there’s something inhibiting Bitcoin from going higher, and again it could just simply be due to the big rise in in the yields over the last couple of weeks. We didn’t see moves exactly as strong as this in prior Decembers of halving years by the 10-year yield. If you were to overlay the 10-year yield onto this chart the 10-year yield has never really been this high at this point in in Bitcoin’s history. And so that could be the reason.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $94,584 at time of writing, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin surged more than 120% to a new six-figure all-time high in mid-December. However, analysts believe that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin, which has been consolidating for the past fortnight, in the first quarter of the new year. “ETH generally sees a good amount of action in Q1. Even during the past few years during the downtrend against BTC,” observed analyst “Daan Crypto Trades” on X on Jan. 2. ETH/BTC Ratio Needs to Improve During the previous bull market, 2020 and 2021 saw large moves for the ETH/BTC ratio, which also kick-started an altseason, he said before adding: “~0.04 remains an important level to break for ETH.” The ETH/BTC ratio, or Ethereum’s value in terms of Bitcoin, is currently 0.035, according to Tradingview. $ETH Generally sees a good amount of action in Q1.

Much of this momentum would come from Ether ETF inflows, which would hit $50 billion this year, as staked ETH products are filed for and approved, he added. He also predicted that more major TradFi companies and institutions would start to build on Ethereum, BlackRock will launch a layer-2 tokenized real-world asset platform on the blockchain, and multiple nation states will reveal that they hold ETH as a treasury asset. “Ethereum will turn 10 years old in 2025, and I’m very confident that this year will be Ethereum’s most bullish year yet!” My 2025 predictions for Ethereum: – ETH hits $15k – ETH ETF net inflows hit $50bil+ for the year – Staked ETH ETFs are filed for and approved – More major TradFi companies/institutions start to build on Ethereum – BlackRock (and partners) launch a layer 2 tokenized RWA platform… — sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) January 1, 2025 In a report released in late December, Steno Research predicted that ETH prices would reach $8,000 in 2025, with analysts “increasingly optimistic about an imminent altcoin season.” “IMO, ETH will have a face-melting rally in Q1, 2025,” said analyst Ash Crypto, who compared performance in past cycles. – ETH WAS DOWN 52% FROM ITS ATH – ETH/BTC WAS AT CYCLE LOW – EVERYONE WAS CALLING THAT ETH IS DEAD – ETH PUMPED 91% IN JANUARY AND HIT A NEW ATH – ETH IS DOWN 30% FROM ITS ATH – ETH/BTC IS ALMOST AT… pic.twitter.com/ElsocwI8S3 — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) December 31, 2024 A Great Start to 2025 On Jan. 1, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said , “Ethereum will have a great start for 2025.” He referred to the Pectra upgrade, which will enable accounts to function like smart contracts, “making smart wallets scalable and bringing better UX and safety for users.” ETH prices were currently up 2% on the day, with the asset topping $3,400 during Thursday morning trading in Asia. However, the asset has been trading sideways since its Dec. 20 slump from $4,000.

Although it has no direct connection, investors have still maintained a hype around it, which has helped the GameStop price achieve multiple milestones in the crypto market. Interestingly, the token is rising again, gaining a significant surge in the last 24 hours. GameStop Price Surged 10% With Roaring Kitty’s Tweet The crypto investor’s enthusiasm is building with the beginning of a new year. In a similar possible mindset, Roaring Kitty reappeared online, posting Rick James-themed GIF. With that, the trading activity began rising for the GME, pushing the trading volume 43% to $9.81M. This increased network activity and pushed the GameStop price by 10% within a day. It is currently trading at $0.00395 with a market capitalization of $27.19M. Another GameStop-inspired coin surged 350%. Interestingly, there is a long history between the popular finance influencer Roaring Kitty and the game retailer. Additionally, the popular Solana meme coin GameStop (GME), including today, has often taken advantage of this connection. Even, the post had no promotional stuff or anything relevant to this cryptocurrency. Still, despite that, the price began to rise, and there is a very interesting reason behind that, which goes back in time. Why Does Roaring Kitty Influence The GameStop Price? Keith Gill is a famous financial analyst and investor who goes by the name “Roaring Kitty.” He has a massive fan following because of his price analysis and market predictions. Interestingly, in January 2021, he helped the game retailer GameStop through financial trouble. He invested $53k and even promoted the business’s stock, eventually helping it through tough times. However, soon after that, he disappeared from the internet for three years before re-emerging in May 2024, and his first post pumped the GameStop stock price by 50%, whose influence was also seen on the GME crypto. Ever since then, every time Gill posted anything, people began flocking to the token in the hope of heavy profits, influencing the GME price. What’s In There For You? Despite the GameStop token’s recovery today, there is a long way to go before it reaches its prime. It was in its prime during July 2024, when it surged to $0.03201, but has lost 87% of its value ever since then. However, this is not the first time the GME price has dropped to this low. Such price drops are very common for this cryptocurrency, but it is also important to note that it has recovered after every drop as well. Interestingly, today’s 10% surge is one of those attempts at recovery. If the investor’s sentiments remained the same and Bitcoin price regained bullish momentum, the GameStop price could recover further, but careful investment strategies must be followed.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Ethereum and Dogecoin face decline, investors are rotating into a booming AI coin that has already surged 700%, signaling a shift in investors’ choice. Table of Contents Ethereum set to reach new peak Dogecoin repeats patterns, says analyst Intel Markets introduces new trends in crypto trading Why Intel Markets is the best crypto investment for 2025 Since Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are down, investors are now focusing on relatively new crypto projects like Intel Markets (INTL) . The AI Coin has proven to be a crypto gem after recording gains of over 700%. The goal of Intel Markets is to transform the crypto trading platform which is worth $36.5 billion. Given its low market cap and AI capabilities, Intel Markets could become the next best cryptocurrency to buy for up to 10x gains in 2025. Ethereum set to reach new peak A crypto expert called 5_0Trading told his followers recently Ethereum is on its way to a new high. The analyst forecasts that crossing the $3,900 level could be the key to this uptrend. Meanwhile, the Ethereum coin has been trading in a narrow range in the past few weeks. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the value of the altcoin has been consolidating between $3,309.16 and $3,512.12 in the past week. The value of the Ethereum token had plunged by 0.9% on the weekly chart. The losses have also extended to higher timeframes. The biweekly and monthly charts have price declines of 14.9% and 7.9%, respectively. Going forward, the Ethereum crypto is facing an immediate resistance at the $3,500 level. Crossing this region could kickstart a price rally at the start of the new year. Potential targets include $5k and $6k. Dogecoin repeats patterns, says analyst In a recent post on X, a top analyst called Trader Tardigrade notes the Dogecoin token could be gearing up for a massive upswing. According to him, Dogecoin usually repeats price patterns. He encouraged his followers to remain optimistic despite the price correction. Meanwhile, Tardigrade posted a chart where the Dogecoin price rallied to a peak of $9. Currently, the value of the meme coin has plunged by 23.1% on the monthly level. The price of the Dogecoin token has been consolidating between $0.3087 and $0.3375. The meme coin could surge to new levels soon as long as it remains above the $0.3 region. Losing this support could invalidate the price forecast of Tardigrade. Many crypto enthusiasts believe Elon Musk could integrate DOGE into its X platform as a payment method. Such a move could lead to a price surge. Intel Markets introduces new trends in crypto trading Intel Markets is a new generation of cryptocurrency trading platform that utilizes advanced technologies and focuses on users. It serves both retail and institutional clients with new features and advanced trading tools. A major tool on the platform is the Intelli-M trading bot. These bots can run on their own, actively make trades, and analyze various patterns in the market. In addition, the Intelli-M bot can predict future market prices to enable traders to gain a competitive edge. In addition to the Intelli-M bot, there is a multi-channel analysis tool that is equally as strong. This unique tool analyzes a vast number of data and offers traders simple and clear signals to use in trading. Another advantage of Intel Markets is its dual-chain structure. The adaptation means traders can switch directly between Ethereum and Solana easily, which will allow them to pick the platform that is most suitable for their trading requirements. The project has already reached $5.6 million in funding and looks very likely to hit the $10 million milestone in Q1 2025. The INTL token has increased by more than 700% to reach its current price of $0.073273. Why Intel Markets is the best crypto investment for 2025 While Ethereum and Dogecoin are trading in the red region, Intel Markets is proving to be the next big thing for anyone looking for the best crypto to invest in. Intel Markets’ 700% increase is only the tip of the iceberg. Given the presale success and other unique features, the value of the DeFi cryptocurrency could surge by 1,000% in Q1 2025.

Integrated as a Chrome extension, Mariner can browse spreadsheets, visit shopping platforms, and assist with online services while keeping the user in control of final decisions, such as completing purchases. Built on Google’s advanced Gemini 2.0 neural network, Mariner learns from vast datasets, including text, images, and sounds. This allows it to mimic human-like interactions with digital tools. According to Demis Hassabis, head of Google’s core AI lab, Mariner can understand when to press buttons or take actions to achieve a goal. Google CEO Sundar Pichai described the tool as a step closer to creating a “universal assistant” , reflecting its potential to become an essential part of daily digital interactions. Mariner is part of Google’s broader AI strategy, which includes tools like the Gemini chatbot and the AI Overviews feature in Google Search. These technologies are built on Gemini 2.0’s ability to detect patterns in data, generate text, and interact with services in increasingly sophisticated ways. However, the project is still in its early stages, and accuracy remains a challenge. Jaclyn Konzelmann, Google’s project manager, admitted that the system is not yet perfect and occasional mistakes are inevitable. Google’s plans face additional obstacles, particularly regulatory scrutiny. The US Justice Department’s ongoing antitrust investigation into Google Chrome could potentially impact Mariner’s development. If regulatory bodies push to separate Chrome from Google, it might limit the AI agent’s integration and future growth. Despite these challenges, Google continues to invest in next-generation AI projects. Alongside Mariner, the company is also advancing Project Astra, a digital assistant capable of responding to text, images, and voice commands. Although Astra is not yet available to the public, it represents Google’s ongoing effort to redefine human interaction with AI technologies. Competition in the AI agent space is intensifying. Tech giants and startups, including OpenAI and Anthropic, are developing similar tools designed to interact seamlessly with websites, applications, and digital platforms. Industry experts predict rapid advancements in AI agent capabilities over the next year. Observers like Cygaar suggest that current frameworks are only operating at “10-30% of their full potential” , hinting at significant improvements in the near future. Investor interest in AI agents is also growing, particularly in AI-related tokens. Prominent crypto influencers, such as Hitesh.eth, have highlighted emerging AI tokens, including ZARA, TONY, H4CK, SAM, XENO, REALIS, TRUST, ASYM, NIKITA, NOMAI, and RADIO, as potentially undervalued assets. However, caution remains essential as the market is still evolving, and risks persist. Google’s unveiling of Mariner marks a significant step in the AI agent race. With the backing of Gemini 2.0, Mariner aims to simplify digital tasks, improve efficiency, and pave the way for smarter human-machine interactions. However, regulatory challenges and technological accuracy remain hurdles that Google must overcome to ensure Mariner’s long-term success. Meanwhile, the competition among AI developers continues to accelerate, setting the stage for rapid advancements in AI agent technology.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-02 09:09:31

Numerous altcoins have produced impressive gains over the past 24 hours, with ETH surging past $3,400 and XRP gaining 12% of value. BTC Eyes $96K Following its latest all-time high of over $108,000 on December 17, BTC went into a full correction mode, dumping by $16,000 within just days by December 20. It bounced off in the next week or so and even challenged $100,000 on a few occasions, but to no avail. The subsequent rejection from the second attempt pushed it south hard to $91,300 on December 30, which became its lowest price tag in over a month. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and propelled a run toward $95,000, where they were stopped, and BTC slipped beneath $92,000. More volatility ensued at the end of the calendar year, with a surge to $96,000 and another drop to $93,000. The past 24 hours have been more positive for the largest digital asset, as it now stands close to $96,000 once again.

Bitcoin (BTC) led the way, erasing losses from the previous week by surpassing $95,000 for the first time this year. Crypto Market Soars as Bitcoin Rises Above $95,000; XRP Leads Gains Amid South Korea Trade Surge XRP has emerged as the star-performing altcoin among major tokens, up 11% as of Thursday. This rise was driven by unusually high trading volumes coming from South Korea, particularly the UpBit exchange, where $1.3 billion worth of XRP changed hands. Historically, such activity has typically preceded significant price swings with an upward trend. Other major tokens also recorded impressive gains: Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Chainlink (LINK) are up by up to 8%. Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain (BNB) rose by 3%.

On December 31, the index fell to -0.23, marking its weakest point since January 2024, according to CryptoQuant contributor Burakkesmeci. Bitcoin Retail Demand Faces Downward Pressure The premium index, which measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and global exchanges, serves as a barometer for U.S. retail investor sentiment. A positive value reflects buying momentum, while a negative reading signals increased selling. Burakkesmeci attributed the decline to thin year-end liquidity, compounded by a drop in Bitcoin’s price to $91,479—the lowest since late November. He warned that unless macroeconomic conditions shift or retail and institutional interest revives, Bitcoin’s short-term price recovery could remain elusive. Notably, the index’s last comparable low coincided with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and resurfaced briefly in October before the U.S. elections. Profit-Taking May Trigger Further Sell-Offs While short-term sentiment appears strained, long-term Bitcoin holders have emerged as significant beneficiaries of the current market dynamics. Data shows that those holding Bitcoin for over 155 days are sitting on considerable unrealized profits. According to Bitbo data , the realized price for long-term holders is $24,298, representing a staggering 290% profit margin at Bitcoin’s publication price of $94,820. This profitability could, however, spark additional sell-offs as investors lock in gains heading into 2025. In contrast, short-term holders—those who acquired Bitcoin less than 155 days ago—are dealing with a significantly higher cost basis, putting them under pressure as prices remain volatile. Trump’s Inauguration: A Turning Point? The market is also eyeing the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on January 20, a macroeconomic event that could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. While some analysts anticipate a temporary price correction of up to 30%, others believe the inauguration could catalyze renewed bullish momentum. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, predicts that Bitcoin will resume its rally after late-December’s anticipated correction . However, immediate recovery hinges on renewed confidence from both retail and institutional players.

The policy emphasizes data security, privacy, and transparency while aiming to strengthen public trust in government services. The primary goal is to integrate blockchain technology into public administration, enabling secure and efficient management of governmental processes. By leveraging blockchain’s real-time automation and verification capabilities, Jordan aims to streamline administrative tasks, minimize operational costs, and enhance service efficiency for both businesses and citizens. This initiative aligns with Jordan’s broader economic modernization plan, with hopes of boosting competitiveness across various sectors. A key focus of the policy is to develop specialized blockchain skills among the population and support local startups in the blockchain space. The government plans to create training programs and foster innovation in the sector, building a tech-savvy workforce that can contribute to the country's digital transformation. Additionally, the policy prioritizes protecting citizen data in response to growing global concerns over cybersecurity and privacy. The government believes blockchain will not only improve efficiency but also attract foreign investment. Enhanced infrastructure and a secure digital environment are expected to position Jordan as a competitive player in the global digital economy. Transparent processes and verifiable records will reduce corruption risks and increase accountability in public services. This isn’t Jordan’s first engagement with blockchain technology. In 2022, amid rising unemployment, many citizens turned to cryptocurrency trading and investment as a financial safety net. The government’s latest policy builds on that trend, offering a more structured approach to blockchain adoption at the national level. Jordan’s move reflects a growing regional trend in the Middle East towards blockchain integration. In Syria, the transitional government recently proposed legalizing Bitcoin and digitizing the Syrian pound as part of efforts to stabilize the economy and attract global investors. Similarly, Dubai has taken major steps to incorporate blockchain technology into its financial infrastructure. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) granted Ripple in-principle approval to operate within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), enabling end-to-end payment solutions across the UAE. Additionally, the TON Foundation registered with the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) to establish a legal framework for its decentralized ledger technology operations. These steps signal the Middle East's increasing reliance on blockchain for economic development and technological advancement. Jordan’s blockchain policy is expected to bring long-term benefits by improving public sector efficiency, reducing bureaucracy, and boosting economic diversification. As the global digital economy continues to grow, Jordan’s strategic focus on blockchain positions it to remain competitive and resilient in an evolving landscape. However, successful implementation will depend on overcoming challenges like building digital infrastructure, addressing regulatory concerns, and fostering collaboration between public and private sectors. The Jordanian government remains optimistic about the potential of blockchain technology to reshape governance and public administration. With a strong emphasis on transparency, data security, and economic innovation, Jordan’s blockchain policy sets a foundation for sustainable growth and technological progress.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-02 09:15:56

The 85.59% surge in open interest for SOL futures contracts suggests a rising number of traders are betting on SOL’s price movements. Open interest is often linked with strong market activity and confidence, indicating that the market expects further upside for SOL. The dominance of perpetual contracts reflects traders actively capitalizing on SOL’s price volatility through short-term strategies. This trend underscores the interplay between increased speculative activity and fundamental interest, both of which are driving SOL’s strong performance.

SOL’s transaction fees are consistently low, around $0.00025, compared to ETH’s fluctuating gas fees. ETH has a larger, well-established community and ecosystem, while SOL, though newer, is rapidly growing due to its speed and low costs, attracting developers in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. These differences influence the user experience and use cases for each blockchain. Additionally, speculation about a SOL ETF approval by Jul. 31, 2025, has been gaining traction. Platforms like Polymarket have seen rising odds for such approval, with current probabilities around 65%, up from 50% earlier this month.

The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) recently issued a notice instructing banks to track transactions involving underground banking, cross-border gambling, and illegal crypto-related activities. These rules mandate banks to monitor the identities of individuals and institutions, track the sources of funds, and observe trading frequency . The increased scrutiny is expected to make it more challenging for Chinese investors to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. All banks across China are required to comply, signaling a nationwide effort to enforce stricter financial oversight. China has maintained a strict anti-crypto stance for years, viewing digital assets as a threat to financial stability. Lawyer Liu Zhengyao from ZhiHeng law firm noted that these new measures create an additional legal foundation for penalizing cryptocurrency trading. He warned that using the yuan to buy cryptocurrencies and then exchanging them for foreign fiat currencies could now be classified as illegal cross-border financial activity, especially if transactions exceed legal limits. This crackdown reflects China’s ongoing effort to control cryptocurrency use within its borders. The government sees cryptocurrencies as tools that could potentially undermine the yuan and disrupt the country’s financial ecosystem. Despite this anti-crypto stance, China remains the second-largest government holder of Bitcoin , with over 190,000 BTC acquired through seizures tied to illegal financial operations. The nation’s restrictive crypto policies date back to 2017, when it banned financial institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. In 2021, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) officially declared all cryptocurrency trading activities illegal. Yet, loopholes and underground networks have allowed some level of trading activity to persist, prompting these latest regulations. Interestingly, despite the harsh stance, there have been recent developments suggesting some flexibility. A Chinese court recently ruled that cryptoassets possess property attributes and are protected under Chinese law, but only when viewed as commodities, not as currency or business instruments. This distinction offers limited legal protection to crypto holders while maintaining the ban on using digital assets as financial instruments. Meanwhile, Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, has advocated for a more progressive cryptocurrency policy in China. In July 2024, he suggested that China could benefit from a competitive approach to Bitcoin regulation, positioning itself strategically against the US. According to Sun, such a policy shift could positively impact the global cryptocurrency industry. Despite these perspectives, the current trend indicates further tightening of crypto regulations in China. SAFE’s directive underscores the government's commitment to eliminating any financial activities it considers risky or destabilizing. As China continues to enforce stricter controls, the global crypto community watches closely to see whether these measures will effectively reduce illegal activities or drive them further underground. For now, Chinese investors face a heavily restricted environment for cryptocurrency trading. The new regulations signal a firm stance from authorities, with financial institutions playing a crucial role in monitoring and reporting violations. While cryptoassets retain limited legal recognition in China, their use as financial tools remains firmly prohibited, and these latest rules make clear that any breaches will face serious consequences.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-02 09:22:49

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE.

The strong technical setup shows that a major blow-up in the sector is in the offing similar to the 2021 bull run. Is the Altcoin Sector Preparing for a 5x Rally? Crypto market analysts expect altcoins to kickstart a mega bull run in Q1 2025 as the technical chart setup shows a similar pattern that before the 2021 bull run. By connecting the market cap top of the previous bull runs in 2018 and 2021, the below chart shows that the next top could be around $7 trillion. Source: TradingView Throughout December 2024, the crypto market has faced major volatility along with Bitcoin price swings between $90,000 to $110,000. As per the data from CoinGeckco, the current market cap of all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin is just under $1.5 trillion. However, the current situation shows that there’s a strong bottom formation suggesting that the altcoin correction could be behind us. Additionally, the alt season index has been forming a strong base at 47 after dropping all the way from 88 last month on December 4. Moreover, with Bitcoin dominance showing signs of decline, this index is likely to recover from here on the upside. Source: Blockchain Center Crypto Market Stages Strong Recovery The crypto market movement today is showing a strong push on the upside with top altcoins contributing to the most of it. The XRP price surge of 15% is leading the show with other players like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX) gaining anywhere between 6-10%. Thus, the start of 2025 seems pretty strong driven by overall optimism. For its 2025 prediction, Steno Research forecasts that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) will exceed $150,000 and $8,000, respectively. Furthermore, analysts have expressed growing optimism about an upcoming altcoin season. This bullish forecast for Bitcoin and Ethereum comes with the expectations of a highly favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, a supportive macroeconomic backdrop with declining interest rates, and improved liquidity. Furthermore, the report notes that the year following the Bitcoin halving has always been very bullish for the crypto market. It added: “On top of this, institutional adoption is expected to reach unparalleled levels, further bolstered by significant inflows into U.S.-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” In January 2025, AI agents and tokens like ai16z are likely to increase market dominance.

In 2024, the Litecoin network processed over 92 million transactions, which represented a 38 percent growth year-over-year (YoY).

As Bitcoin (BTC) price gained around 2 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $95,323 on Thursday, January 2, during the early European session, the TOTAL3, which excludes Ethereum (ETH) and BTC, added over $13 billion to hover about $985 billion. From a technical analysis standpoint, the altcoin industry is preparing for a major uproar in the near term after closing 2024 with a bullish outlook. Moreover, the fundamental outlook for the entire cryptocurrency industry remains extremely bullish following the re-election of Donald Trump to the White House. Additionally, more institutional investors are doubling down their funds to the web3 space to benefit from the ongoing macro bull run. Midterm Targets for Cardano and Ripple’s XRP ADA Cardano network, a top-tier layer one blockchain, has significantly benefited from its constant chain upgrades and strategic partnerships.

Considering that ETH shot up 71% in just 30 days starting on November 5, there is a high chance Ethereum price will hit $5,000 in the first three months of 2025. Ethereum is up No data found for ethereum on 30 minutes ago% in the past 24 hours and will likely continue this bullish outlook. Can Ethereum Hit $5,000 in First Three Months of 2025? As mentioned above, Ethereum price can hit $5,000 in the first three months of 2025. ETH’s historical returns show that the first quarter has yielded an average return of 82.72% in the past eight years. Therefore, if history were to repeat, then 82.72% from the current price of No data found for ethereum on 30 minutes ago, Ethereum would be trading at roughly $6,276. Ethereum Quarterly Returns Let’s explore what technical analysis has to say about Ethereum price in the short term. ETH Technical Analysis From a price action perspective, Ethereum is stuck between the $3,600 and $3,000 barriers. Only a swift breakout relative to these levels will confirm the trend. To make matters worse, ETH’s value has been stuck inside a symmetrical triangle for the past two weeks. The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price has revived optimism after weeks of consolidation. Many top altcoins have bounced up double digits. As a result, investors are bullish and expect Ethereum to follow suit. ETH/USDT 12-hour chart Ethereum Price Targets Although the symmetrical triangle breakout direction is uncertain, let’s assume a bullish one, considering the recent recovery. A decisive daily candlestick close above the triangle’s upper limit forecasts a 12% move to $3,800. This target is the result of adding the symmetrical triangle’s 12% height to the breakout point of $3,445. Concluding Thoughts With a fresh start to 2025, the outlook shows promise, especially for Ethereum and altcoins. With historical returns averaging 82.72% in the first quarter of the past eight years, it is highly likely that Ethereum will unpause the consolidation and kickstart an uptrend. ETH is already up 3% on the day, and technical analysis indicate a bullish future. All of these signs suggests that Ethereum price will easily tackle the $4,000 hurdle and reach $5,000, a key psychological level, in the first three months of 2025.

Addressing the need for a legal and fair framework, Alderoty outlined six key principles that he hopes will guide regulatory clarity in the coming years. SEC Jurisdiction: The SEC's jurisdiction covers only securities transactions, not all asset sales. Asset and Security: Selling a gold bar with contractual rights attached to it in a gold mine may constitute a securities transaction, but selling the same gold bar without the post-sale rights is merely an asset sale and is outside the jurisdiction of the SEC. Post-Sale Obligations: Transactions that do not involve post-sale obligations to the buyer should not be regulated as securities. Clarifying Disclosures: The SEC cannot arbitrarily expand its reach based on subjective views about who deserves more disclosure. Tokens Are Not Securities: A token is never a security, although it may be sold as part of a securities transaction. Token Conversion is a Fallacy: The idea that a token can convert from a security to a non-security has no legal basis. Alderoty said the SEC should respect legal definitions and avoid overreach, and expressed hope that these principles would become standard practice by 2025. Related News: Surprise Stablecoin Temporarily Loses Its $1 Stablecoin Stability as a Single Whale Makes a Massive Sale Cryptocurrency attorney MetaLawMan responded to the principles set forth by Alderoty, largely agreeing with his claims but offering a brief explanation: “A token is almost never a security. In rare cases where a token confers rights to distributions, dividends, or equity-like benefits in the issuing project, it may qualify as a security.” *This is not investment advice.

Fidelity’s FETH Saw $752M in Inflows Fidelity’s FETH fund followed with $752 million in inflows. However, not all funds saw growth—Grayscale’s ETHE reported net outflows of $274 million. These inflows brought cumulative net inflows for ether ETFs to over $2.6 billion, with total net assets reaching $12.12 billion. This represents over 3% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. December’s inflow record coincided with a mid-month rally in ether prices, briefly surpassing $4,000 before retreating to around $3,500. As of writing, ether trades at $3,409, up 2.23% in the last 24 hours. In comparison, spot bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $4.5 billion in December, down from November’s record-breaking $6.4 billion. Bitcoin peaked at $108,135 on December 17, later retreating to $95,556. One of the more ridiculous charts you’ll ever see… Assets in spot gold ETFs vs bitcoin ETFs. Gold ETFs launched in 2004. Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. via @glxyresearch pic.twitter.com/eJo7Db9kb3 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 28, 2024 Notably, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded modest inflows on December 31, their last trading day of the year, following a period of significant outflows driven by a broader market downturn. 12 Bitcoin ETFs logged a net inflow of $5.32 million, ending a two-day outflow streak that saw $723 million exit the funds. Fidelity’s FBTC led with $36.81 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise’s BITB with $8.68 million and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust with $4.14 million. However, these gains were partly offset by outflows from BlackRock’s IBIT ($23.45 million), ARK 21Shares’ ARKB ($11.23 million), and Grayscale’s GBTC ($9.63 million). Six other Bitcoin ETFs reported no activity. Ethereum ETFs saw a stronger rebound, with $35.93 million in net inflows following a prior day of $55.41 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FETH accounted for most of the inflows at $31.77 million, while Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust added $9.77 million. Grayscale’s ETHE partially offset these gains with $5.61 million in outflows, while other Ether ETFs reported no activity. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Over $35B in Inflows in 2024 As reported, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States recorded a remarkable $35.66 billion in net inflows in 2024, significantly exceeding early industry projections. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) led the market with $37.31 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $11.84 billion, and ARK’s 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) with $2.49 billion. Other significant contributors included the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which reported $2.19 billion in inflows. These figures far surpassed Galaxy Digital’s initial $14 billion first-year estimate. However, Bitcoin ETFs faced a slight downturn toward the year’s end, with $1.33 billion in outflows since Dec. 19. On the Ether ETF front, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) led inflows with $3.52 billion and $1.56 billion, respectively. Grayscale’s low-fee Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) secured $608.1 million in inflows, while the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) crossed $400 million.

The delay until the start of 2026, would give time for brokers to adapt to the new regulations, which would determine the cost basis for cryptos on centralized platforms. CoinTracker Head of Tax Shehan Chandrasekera called the delay “good news for crypto holders interacting with CeFi exchanges in 2025.” Further, the temporary transition relief only applies to sales occurring inside CeFi exchanges between 1/1/25 and 12/31/25. “After 12/31/25, you must pick an accounting method for CeFi assets with the broker,” Shehan wrote on X. He also advocated to pick accounting method at CeFi exchange on 1/1/26 and matching the CeFi broker accounting method to crypto tax software tool. 4/ This temporary relief only applies to sales occurring inside CeFi exchanges between 1/1/25 and 12/31/25. After 12/31/25, you must pick an accounting method for CeFi assets with the broker. By this time, I believe many brokers will support all accounting methods. So, make… — Shehan (@TheCryptoCPA) December 31, 2024 In July 2024, the IRS finalised custodial broker (CeFi broker) regulations for determining which crypto units are sold when investors hold multiple units in centralized exchange. The mandate was initially set to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2025. Under the rule, if a taxpayer has not identified a preferred accounting method, the broker will sell assets under the First-In, First-Out (FIFO). “Now, there was a practical problem with this approach,” Shehan added . “Almost all CeFi brokers were not ready to support Spec ID as of 1/1/25.” The specific identification method (Spec ID) allows users to choose which cryptocurrency units they are disposing of. However, the problem with this approach would have left crypto investors with no option but to sell assets under FIFO. “In a bull market environment, this could have been disastrous for many taxpayers,” the tax expert added. The new crypto tax reporting delay gives a one-year grace time for brokers to develop support for other accounting methods. Meanwhile, the Blockchain Association, in collaboration with the Texas Blockchain Council, has sued IRS over its latest cryptocurrency regulations . The legal battle announced on December 28, pushed back against the IRS’ new rules mandating brokers to report crypto transactions.

Ripple’s RLUSD launch and potential SEC leadership change could significantly boost XRP’s long-term adoption. Whale activity and a strong investor community suggest growing institutional interest and optimism for XRP’s future. XRP staged a remarkable performance in 2024, with a 271% annual price surge. However, as the market cools down and XRP experiences a dip, the question arises: is now the right time to invest in XRP?

With a staggering $56.41 billion allocated to its cryptocurrency portfolio, Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, accounting for over 99% of the portfolio’s value. Dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum in BlackRock’s strategy Bitcoin leads the pack with 550,643 BTC holdings, valued at $52.78 billion at a current price of $95,855 per coin, representing a gain of $1.28 billion (+2.48%), as per data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham Intel . Ethereum follows with 1.037 million ETH worth $3.55 billion, priced at $3,425 per token, and an increase of $89.61 million (+2.59%). These two assets form the bedrock of BlackRock’s cryptocurrency approach, reflecting the company’s faith in their long-term potential. BlackRock’s crypto portfolio. Source: Arkham Intel The rest of BlackRock’s portfolio includes smaller exploratory holdings in stablecoin USDC, valued at $74.67 million, and alternative tokens such as COLLE ($303,080), SPX ($78,250), TUA ($29,100), UBXS ($24,180), and MOG ($16,490). BlackRock’s shift in stance and the success of Bitcoin ETF BlackRock’s transition from skepticism to adoption in the cryptocurrency space has been transformative. Initially hesitant, the firm launched its Bitcoin ETF after receiving SEC approval, following Grayscale’s legal battle with the SEC over a similar product. BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund became a historic success, surpassing $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) within just 11 months—a feat Bloomberg has credited with driving Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 earlier this year. The fund’s unparalleled performance has sparked speculation that its AUM could surpass gold ETFs in the coming years, signaling a seismic shift in institutional interest from traditional to digital assets. Nate Geraci, CEO of ETF Store, predicted that unless Bitcoin’s price plummets in 2025, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) could overtake SPDR Gold Shares, the world’s largest gold ETF. Limited Interest beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum Earlier this year, Robert Mitchnick of BlackRock noted that there is “very little interest” in other cryptocurrencies among their investors, indicating that the growth potential for altcoins may remain constrained. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate BlackRock’s crypto strategy, the broader market is evolving. Firms like Franklin Templeton and VanEck explore blockchain projects like Solana ( SOL ), there is optimism that altcoins could gain traction through future ETF approvals. Franklin Templeton has been vocal in its support for Solana, calling it one of the most promising blockchain projects. Meanwhile, ETF filings for XRP by WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital highlight growing institutional interest in expanding crypto offerings beyond the two heavyweights. Solana’s futures-based ETF applications and the growing interest in XRP ETFs suggest a diversification trend in the institutional landscape. Analysts like Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg believe that the approval of futures-based ETFs could pave the way for spot ETFs, providing altcoins like Solana and XRP with institutional exposure.

The market even posted a better performance compared to 2023. The NFT market survived 2024, but it did not return to previous peaks. PFP avatars remain a staple in the crypto space, but mainstream interest and active trading were replaced by niche activity. For the whole of 2024, NFT trading reached $8.83B, mostly focused on top collections and older holders. Ethereum (ETH) dominated the NFT market in 2024, since most collections were originally launched on that chain, and very few migrated. The chain is also the most active in the short term. Solana and Bitcoin followed with several active collections. Solana retains the largest number of NFT-related transactions, with over 14K buyers and sellers as of January 2. Ronin was in the fourth spot, hosting the trade for the Axie Infinity collections of playable avatars and metaverse land. Polygon followed, with traffic from older collections and games. Smaller chains have different NFT profiles, ranging between high-price, low-activity NFTs or high-traffic trades for extremely cheap items. In the short term, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Immutable posted the most active NFT traffic, as collections still see shifts in general interest. Base, the tokenless chain by Coinbase, is not included in trading statistics, as it focuses on extremely cheap NFTs owned for fun. The NFT market corresponded with crypto rallies Enthusiasm for NFTs and more active deals corresponded with the crypto bull market. For the past 12 months, NFTs had two major spikes in both volumes and price action, correlating with the March-April rally. The last three months of 2024 also boosted NFT activity. NFT trading followed the performance of the crypto market in 2024. | Source: Nonfungible Art and collectible NFTs were the most active, as they were also tied to active social media promotion. The market for gaming and metaverse NFTs, however, remained niche and kept to its baseline. The split in NFTs showed collections and avatars still commanded mindshare, while utility NFTs and use cases did not matter as much. The most appealing use cases for NFTs were the potential airdrops and preferential access. Pudgy Penguins was the leader in 2024, with its PENGU airdrop , which led the collection to a new all-time high for the floor price. Briefly, a rare Pudgy Penguin surpassed $100,000, trading above the price of Bitcoin (BTC). After the airdrop, the collection returned to its baseline price floor at around 22 ETH. Milady Maker, formerly one of the top 5 collections, slid in the charts in the new year, as it remained one of the more volatile communities. Miladies were also one of the few collections overlapping with active meme token trading. Punks held their top position, while Bored Ape holders still tried to make the best of their NFT. The collection is still supported by influencers like Machi Big Brother, who periodically launches new projects with preferential entry for Ape NFT holders. NFTs still show signs of wash trading NFT trading may still include volumes specifically created by market makers, or other forms of wash trading. The lack of mass organic demand and hype also means some chains and collections are more exposed to wash trading. On Ethereum, up to 15.48% of the daily traffic is linked to wash trading, moving NFTs between connected wallets. The market remains relatively small, with just around 117 NFT items changing hands in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin-related Ordinals have around 6.25% in daily wash trading volumes, while for other chains like Solana, wash trading remains negligible. The share of wash trading may vary depending on collections and hype. This metric may reveal the risk of buying into a collection that later turns out to be illiquid. Predictions for 2025 are conflicting, with some believing NFT can never achieve mass appeal again. However, communities and collections are trying to maintain their mindshare, especially the holders of Azuki, Pudgy Penguins, BAYC and MAYC apes. One prediction for 2025 is that AI agents may revive the NFT market. So far, agents have not built collections or hyped existing ones. NFTs also need to compete with memes, which offer a much cheaper entry point.

Here are the key takeaways: Ethereum Will Outperform Solana in 2025 Messari predicts that Ethereum (ETH) will outperform Solana (SOL) throughout 2025 due to several factors: ETF Inflows: While Ethereum ETFs are expected to attract significant institutional interest, SOL ETFs may struggle to gain similar traction. FTX Liquidation: Over 11 million SOL will be removed from FTX property in March, leading to increased selling pressure. Market Dynamics: After a tough 2024, Ethereum is likely to attract marginal buyers in 2025, while Solana faces net selling as crypto-savvy investors turn to alternative assets. According to the analytics company, the ETH/SOL ratio, which is already showing signs of a peak, is expected to continue to decline. AI Tool Frameworks to Peak in Q1 2025 Messari believes that AI vehicle frameworks will reach their speculative peak in the first quarter of 2025, but interest will wane after that. Lack of Product-Market Fit: Unlike previous blockchain innovations, AI agents lack the proven demand or a defined user base to sustain long-term speculation. Speculative Cycle: Excitement around AI agents will wane as markets realize their limited utility beyond being experimental tools. Related News: Bitcoin Price Predictions Continue to Come from Investment Companies with the New Year! Here Are the Details Pudgy Penguins to Surpass CryptoPunks Popular NFT collectible Pudgy Penguins is predicted to surpass CryptoPunks as the PFP collectible in 2025. Value Creation: Pudgy Penguins leverages airdrops (PENGU) and external protocol distributions to create direct value for its owners. Mainstream Appeal: The brand’s rapid expansion into Web3 and mainstream markets is expected to further increase its cultural relevance and market value. Abstract Chain Integration: The launch of Abstract Chain will unlock additional value streams for the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. Peaq Will Surpass All Tier 2 Solutions Peaq, a rapidly rising blockchain project, is predicted to disrupt all other Layer 2 (L2) solutions by 2025. Market Positioning: Peaq is already a top 10 L2 with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $2.1 billion. Competitive Advantage: Its unique approach to network and ecosystem development is expected to provide an advantage over traditional L2s. Virtual's FDV to Surpass TAO's FDV in Q1 2025 Messari predicts a significant shift in valuation dynamics between VIRTUAL and TAO: TAO Supply Pressure: With a daily emission of $3.3 million, the value of TAO is likely to remain stagnant until the dTAO mechanism relieves the persistent supply pressure. VIRTUAL Growth: Increasing amounts of VIRTUAL are being locked up in intermediary liquidity pools (LPs). Hyperliquid's Momentum Could Slow While Hyperliquid is expected to continue to be a dominant trend in 2025, its performance may already be priced in by Q4 2024. Valuation Metrics: Hyperliquid’s FDV is currently 1/4 that of Solana, 1/2 that of Coinbase, and equal to FTT’s peak FDV, suggesting limited room for growth without new developments. *This is not investment advice.

SHIB’s Ecosystem vs. BeerBear’s Engagement Shiba Inu’s efforts to expand its ecosystem are commendable. Shibarium promises lower gas fees and faster transactions, while token burns aim to reduce supply and increase value. However, much of SHIB’s momentum relies on speculative growth, with long-term utility still in development. BeerBear, on the other hand, focuses on fostering community engagement in real-time. Its gamified ecosystem and rewards-based loyalty programs ensure token holders are not just passive investors but active participants in its success. This hands-on approach appeals to a new generation of crypto enthusiasts seeking more than price speculation. The Verdict: 2025 and Beyond While SHIB may have the infrastructure to climb to $0.01, BeerBear’s blend of innovation and engagement gives it a unique edge in the competitive meme token landscape.

This bounce not only reaffirms the significance of this zone but also sparks fresh hopes for a potential bullish breakout. With momentum building, the bulls appear to be gearing up for a rally, aiming to push SHIB toward higher resistance levels and beyond. The market sentiment surrounding SHIB has shifted positively, with speculation on the likelihood of a breakout above its next resistance levels. Technical indicators suggest growing bullish momentum, but the road ahead is challenging. Overcoming the immediate resistance will require sustained buying pressure and robust market participation. Key Support Holds Strong: The Importance Of $0.00002045 The $0.00002045 level has emerged as a cornerstone for Shiba Inu’s price trajectory, acting as a critical support zone in the current market structure. This level has consistently demonstrated its significance, providing a base for rebounds and serving as a key psychological level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu 260% Rally: Analyst Sees Classic Bullish Patterns Emerging Support levels like $0.00002045 are more than price markers; they represent zones where buying interest is strong enough to counter selling pressure, preventing further declines. For SHIB, this level has become a battleground, where bulls step in to defend against bearish momentum. Its recent successful rebound from this support highlights its importance, instilling confidence in market participants and signaling the potential for more gains. Furthermore, the $0.00002045 support aligns with broader market trends and key technical indicators, such as oversold signals on RSI or strong trading volume, reinforcing its role as a pivotal zone. As Shiba Inu navigates its path forward, this support level will continue to be a critical marker in determining whether the bulls can maintain control or if bears will gain the upper hand. Shiba Inu’s Next Move: Will The Bulls Maintain Control? Currently, SHIB is attempting to cross above the Simple Moving Average (SMA). A decisive move above this indicator could solidify the bullish narrative. Interestingly, this could open the door for further growth and increased market confidence, sparking a move toward the $0.00002631 resistance level. Key technical indicators, such as the RSI and trading volume, suggest rising interest. However, the bulls must capitalize on this momentum to avoid a possible reversal. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Testing A Significant Support Zone – Bullish Breakout Ahead? SHIB has surged to the $0.0000224 level after witnessing a rebound. Should the bulls falter, SHIB could face renewed bearish pressure, pulling the price back toward the critical $0.00002045 support level. This level will remain a focal point as reaching it could either reinvigorate bullish sentiment or act as a trigger for a deeper correction. Ultimately, SHIB’s next move will depend on how the bulls navigate this critical phase. Will they maintain control and drive the price toward fresh highs, or will the bears regain dominance? The coming days promise to be decisive for SHIB’s short-term trajectory.

The listing has boosted market confidence in both tokens, with the Peaq token nearing its all-time high and VANA showing steady gains. These price movements reflect growing interest in the unique utilities of these tokens, as investors gear up for increased trading opportunities. PEAQ and VANA Price Surge After Listing on Bithumb South Korea’s second-largest crypto exchange, Bithumb reported on January 2 that it will list PEAQ and Vana network tokens. Both tokens will be available in the KRW pairs, enabling users to trade them directly against the Korean Won. PEAQ’s base price was set at 853 KRW, while VANA debuted at 23,730 KRW on the exchange. The listing announcement detailed that deposits for both coins would begin within three hours of the notice, and trading would commence at 4 PM KST. Bithumb noted that deposits through non-native networks would not be supported to ensure seamless processing. Additionally, Bithumb emphasized transaction restrictions to safeguard user experience during the initial trading period. The exchange restricted buying orders for the first five minutes. The platform also limited sell orders to a range of -10% to +100% of the standard price. Traders could only use automatic trading after completing the first transaction. Price Performance and Market Context PEAQ price surged by 35% to $0.715, nearing its all-time high. It recorded a 24-hour low of $0.522 and a high of $0.72. It boasts a market cap of $463 million and a trading volume of $55.56 million. The token powers core DePIN functions like governance, transaction fees, and staking. As per DigitalCoinPrice , the average PEAQ price prediction for 2025 is $1.49. While by 2030, it may reach approximately $3.67. This L1 token remains unlisted on Binance and other top exchanges. Analysts believe that future listings could trigger exponential price surges as accessibility increases. Vana Network, a Layer 1 blockchain focused on decentralized data networks, empowers data ownership and incentivizes contributions to DataDAO through governance rights and token rewards. Its price surged 10% to $17.62, with a 24-hour low of $15.41 and a high of $17.83. The network boasts a market cap of $528 million and a trading volume of $169 million. Price predictions suggest Vana Network could reach $34 by 2025 and approximately $85 by 2030. Furthermore, DeBridge (DBR) price recently hit its all-time high after a 30% jump following its listing on Bithumb. Crypto listed in KRW pairs usually witnesses a pump-and-dump. Besides, it also reflects the strong influence of the top crypto exchanges among investors. However, analysts expect the utility and growing adoption of these tokens to drive their value higher, solidifying their market positions.

Trump’s every move as he steps back into the White House, ready to disrupt, change, and possibly supercharge the economy. His presidency is already shaking the ground beneath corporate boardrooms, trading floors, and blockchain offices across America. Trump’s second term has stocks betting on massive changes in market dynamics. Meanwhile, crypto players, sidelined and battered during the Biden years, see a golden window to push crypto even more into the mainstream. Everyone’s talking, speculating, and strategizing because 2025 is widely expected to make history. Many in the crypto community are calling it the “Golden Era.” Wall Street bets on Trump-fueled growth Wall Street’s biggest players are leaning into the idea of Trump’s pro-business agenda. JPMorgan Chase predicts a resurgence of what they call “U.S. exceptionalism,” driven by Trump’s America-first policies. Tariffs directed at foreign competitors are expected to tilt the playing field in favor of U.S. companies. Banks like JPMorgan believe this could cement America’s dominance in global markets. Inflation, though they warned , remains a wildcard. Trump’s aggressive trade policies and hardline stance on immigration are seen as factors that could keep inflation above the Federal Reserve’s targets. Apollo Global Management thinks progress toward controlling inflation will “take longer than expected,” and interest rate cuts, while anticipated, might come slower than markets hope. The stock market isn’t likely to replicate last year’s 20% returns, but they’re saying AI could keep things going for quite a long time. BNY Mellon Wealth Management is also bullish on AI’s transformative potential, calling it “the technology that will outshine every innovation that came before.” AI investments are expected to drive gains, even as other sectors face slower growth. Diversification is the game plan for 2025. Not everyone’s placing their chips on stocks though. Bonds are making a quiet comeback as income-generating assets. Wall Street is looking beyond stocks, exploring hedge funds, private markets, and alternative assets like crypto to get through what promises to be a volatile year. Crypto counts on Trump for a comeback Crypto executives see Trump as their industry’s long-awaited savior . After four years of hostile regulation under Biden, these guys are betting that Trump will bring the kind of change that puts blockchain at the center of America’s financial future. His campaign promises included building a strategic Bitcoin reserve and forming a crypto advisory council, which he has actually already done. Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission was Paul Atkins, one of Bitcoin’s earliest investors. He also sits on advisory boards for crypto organizations like Securitize and The Digital Chamber. Trump’s Treasury Secretary nominee, Scott Bessent, is a proud crypto lover who famously said, “Crypto isn’t just about money. It’s about freedom.” Commerce Secretary pick Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, brings deep connections to stablecoin giant Tether. And then there’s Elon Musk, now leading a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), a nod to an industry that considers him a hero. The excitement doesn’t stop there. Trump’s administration is expected to repeal SAB 121, a controversial accounting rule that forces institutions holding digital tokens to treat them as liabilities. This rule has kept big banks and fund managers out of the crypto market. If Trump scraps it, experts believe it could open the floodgates for Wall Street’s entry into digital assets. Access to banking services is another critical issue. Under Biden, as we reported , crypto companies accused regulators of creating “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” effectively blocking them from accessing top-tier financial services. Trump’s administration has promised to reverse this. Coinbase’s legal officer, Paul Grewal, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance, “The incoming administration has the opportunity to reverse so many poor crypto policy decisions, chief among them politically motivated regulatory decisions like Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” Lobbyists paved the way for Trump’s crypto pivot The crypto industry quite literally fought for Trump’s election victory. The pro-crypto Super PAC Fairshake poured $135 million into the election cycle, securing victories for 294 pro-crypto politicians in Congress. By comparison, only 134 anti-crypto lawmakers won seats. Fairshake’s efforts were bankrolled by some of the biggest names in the industry. Coinbase, Ripple, and Andreessen Horowitz were among the top contributors. Ripple alone put $25 million into the PAC. The company also donated $5 million to Trump’s inauguration. Stuart Alderoty, general counsel at Ripple, called the election results “a decisive victory for the crypto community.” These lobbying efforts were also about building a Congress that would back crypto-friendly policies. Fairshake strategically targeted anti-crypto candidates, focusing on issues like border security to win over skeptical voters. With the 2026 midterms on the horizon, the PAC has already raised $78 million to continue its work. Last year, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs, a decision that finally brought regulated crypto investment products to the U.S. market. BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, the largest of its kind, now manages nearly $60 billion in assets. Pension funds in states like Wisconsin and Michigan have started holding Bitcoin through these funds, signaling growing institutional acceptance. Bitcoin itself has smashed through the $100,000 mark, triggering a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out). Investors who previously avoided the market are now rushing back in.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 10:05:00

Table of Contents Ripple in 2025: Could Trump’s presidency catalyze XRP higher? DTX Exchange: A new bold step in the DeFi revolution Investors could embrace DTX Exchange for a 10x return The intersection of politics and crypto often creates seismic shifts. With Trump’s return to the presidency, the XRP community is buzzing with excitement. This positive situation could bring regulatory clarity to the crypto space which Ripple Labs have been waiting for. But XRP isn’t the only token making waves. The spotlight is also on DTX Exchange, a rising star in the crypto world poised for a potential breakthrough. With whispers of a Coinbase listing on the horizon, this exchange is gaining traction and could hit $1. Let’s analyze how political shifts and strategic listings could reshape the future of XRP and DTX Exchange and why now might be the time to pay attention. Ripple in 2025: Could Trump’s presidency catalyze XRP higher? With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, speculations about the future of crypto abound, especially among those with a penchant for XRP tokens. During his first regime, this asset surged over 350%. This has spurred conversations about whether this new regime could finally take XRP to the moon. However, XRP has been down by 11% over the past 30 days due to general bearish sentiments, as it trades at $2.16 at the time of writing. Still, a silver lining exists. With Paul Atkins replacing Gary Gensler as the SEC Chair , crypto analysts are considering how this may bring better clarity into the crypto regulatory environment. Also, rumors of a potential XRP ETF could increase institutional interest in Ripple, and holders can expect to see it rise beyond its all-time high of $3.84. As XRP price steals the headlines, DTX Exchange is also doing its thing. Let’s explore the possibilities of this viral altcoin more. You might also like: DTX Exchange mirrors the 21,500% surge of Cardano during the last bull cycle DTX Exchange: A new bold step in the DeFi revolution Amid this growing political landscape, DTX Exchange managed to find a niche with its approach to DeFi. By initiating a hybrid model, DTX Exchange combines the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges into a hub that is truly accessible, fast, and innovative for the modern trader. Probably the most impressive feature of DTX Exchange is that it supports 120,000 financial instruments, from traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and forex to cryptocurrencies and tokenized ETFs. The inclusion of leverage trading (1:1,000) adds to its appeal, making DTX especially attractive to high-stakes traders looking to amplify their gains. The DTX innovation core is the VulcanX blockchain, which can process more than 100,000 transactions per second. This incredible speed surpasses even top-tier blockchains and allows traders to execute deals in real-time. But DTX is more than just a fast and feature-rich platform. Its asset tokenization feature on-chain could change how investors access previously illiquid markets. On-chain reports over 300,000 wallets holding DTX tokens, indicating a strong and active community. Equally impressive is its presale to date, which has raised over $11.2 million. Currently, at $0.14 in its seventh presale round, investors could snag a few tokens before a future price increase. As the project edges closer to a top-tier exchange listing, especially on Coinbase, experts predict DTX Exchange could reach $1, about 10x its current presale price. With its hybrid model, a wide variety of assets offered and technology, it’s well-poised to take the top slot in DeFi. Investors could embrace DTX Exchange for a 10x return As the crypto market braces for a new political shift, Ripple and DTX Exchange may offer exciting investment possibilities. The Trump administration could bring better clarity to the regulatory landscape and resolve XRP’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. This development may result in XRP’s next move being monumental. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange emerges as a game-changer in the DeFi space. Its diverse asset offerings and cutting-edge VulcanX blockchain technology have positioned it as a serious contender in the crypto world. A Coinbase listing could propel DTX to the $1 milestone, further solidifying its status as an asset to watch. For investors, these developments highlight the importance of staying informed and ready to seize the moment.
