The analyst further revealed what needs to happen for the foremost meme coin to reach this price target. How Dogecoin Price Could Rally To $1.2 In an X post, Master Kenobi explained how the Dogecoin price could rally to $1.2. He stated that if DOGE manages to break past its all-time high (ATH) of $0.74 by the end of January, it could potentially test the $1.2 area. The analyst noted that such a rally could make Dogecoin’s market capitalization align with that of XRP. Master Kenobi added that any rally beyond $1.2 would be a bonus, although not impossible. He also raised the possibility of Dogecoin rising to $3.4 if the top meme coin reaches the orange trendline, which he highlighted on his accompanying chart by the end of January. However, Master Kenobi remarked that he doesn’t believe that the foremost meme coin can reach this target at this stage of the bull market. He added that it could happen maybe later this year but not now. Regarding the current Dogecoin price action, the crypto analyst stated that DOGE seems to have found its consolidation zone in a position of balance. He observed that in the past, pauses between episodes of DOGE’s sharp growth were characterized by periods of correction followed by horizontal consolidation. In the recent context, Master Kenobi noted that after two weeks of correction, Dogecoin appears to have reached a stabilization level from which it could initiate its next move. The crypto analyst added that history shows that such stagnation periods before a new impulse typically last, on average, for a few weeks. Master Kenobi mentioned that external events beyond the crypto market could play a significant role, providing the narrative and motivation necessary for the next move. DOGE Is In The Markup Phase Crypto analyst Trader provided insights into what stage of the bull run the Dogecoin price is currently in. In an X post , he stated that DOGE is in the markup phase of the Wyckoff market cycle. Currently, the analyst revealed that DOGE has completed the first wave of the Markup phase. He added that price appreciation could intensify towards the end of this phase, resulting in a “Blow-Off Top.” This chart pattern is characterized by a rapid, steep price increase. Meanwhile, based on a recent CoinGape market analysis, the Dogecoin price could indeed reach new highs this month.

After slogging through what everyone called the “fintech winter,” things are finally heating up. Crypto payments are stepping out of their niche, and the second Trump administration is promising looser rules . Fintech stocks are clawing their way back, and interest rate cuts are making money flow again. Startups that had been riding high after the pandemic got a reality check when the funding dried up. Layoffs hit hard. Product launches slowed down. Valuations that once seemed untouchable suddenly looked bloated. But now, the market’s waking up. Stablecoins, cross-border payments, and public listings are back in the spotlight, and everyone wants a piece of the action. Crypto payments are going big About a month after President Donald Trump won the US election, Bitcoin broke $108,000 for the first time in history. This guy is all-in on crypto. He’s even launched his own project, World Liberty Financial. It’s the kind of environment the crypto community has been dreaming about for years. Stripe wasted no time. The company dropped $1.1 billion to grab Bridge, a startup that issues stablecoins. Stripe’s CEO, Patrick Collison, made it clear this is about global payments. Stablecoins are the future for cross-border transfers, especially since banks are now a joke. PayPal is on it too. Its stablecoin, PYUSD, is already being used on Xoom, its money transfer service. That’s a big deal for anyone sending money internationally. Then there’s YellowCard, a startup built for exactly this kind of moment. They traded over $3 billion in crypto last year and are working to make expensive wire transfers a thing of the past. Not everyone’s on board though. Airwallex, another big name in global payments, says the rules are still too unclear. Co-founder Jack Zhang admitted stablecoins could shake up payroll and cross-border business payments, but he’s holding back until there’s more clarity. For now. Trump’s shakeup of fintech regulations Let’s rewind to 2024. Synapse Financial, a banking-as-a-service company, went belly up. Thousands of customers were left hanging, unable to access their funds. Regulators pounced. The FDIC and CFPB went after fintech startups and the banks that partner with them. Some said it was necessary. Others argued it was a mess. The CFPB didn’t stop there. It started poking around digital wallets and buy-now-pay-later companies like PayPal, Affirm, and Klarna. FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg and CFPB Director Rohit Chopra became public enemies in fintech. Critics accused them of killing innovation with their “regulation by enforcement” approach. Trump’s team has other plans. Reports say he wants to shrink—or maybe even kill—the CFPB. Elon Musk, now leading the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), went full throttle on X, tweeting, “Delete CFPB.” President Trump is backing this and has the power to fire Chopra. This could be a turning point. Fintech companies have been cautious, and scared of sudden rule changes. Amias Gerety, a partner at QED Investors, said Trump’s administration will change the tone. “Startups will start experimenting more. They won’t have to second-guess every move,” he explained.

As explained by Shehan Chandrasekera, Head of Tax Strategy at CoinTracker, the relief mitigates complications stemming from the implementation of Section 6045 custodial broker regulations, which take effect on January 1, 2025. IRS Crypto Relief These regulations require centralized finance (CeFi) brokers to report cryptocurrency transactions and apply specific accounting methods for asset sales, as per Chandrasekera’s tweet . If holders do not choose a preferred accounting method – such as Highest In, First Out (HIFO) or Specific Identification (Spec ID) – brokers will default to First In, First Out (FIFO). This default method can increase tax liabilities, particularly in a bullish market, by prioritizing the sale of the earliest purchased assets, which often have the lowest cost basis. The problem was further escalated by the fact that, as of January 1, 2025, most CeFi brokers were not ready to support Spec ID accounting. Recognizing this challenge, the IRS issued Notice 2025-7 which aimed to provide temporary relief for cryptocurrency sales conducted on CeFi exchanges between January 1 and December 31, 2025. The relief allows taxpayers to bypass the default FIFO method by using their own records or crypto tax software to specify which assets are being sold, offering greater flexibility during this transitional period. No Immediate Action Required Chandrasekera clarified that this relief is automatic and requires no immediate action from taxpayers. However, starting January 1, 2026, CeFi users must select an accounting method with their brokers to avoid defaulting to FIFO. By this time, most brokers are expected to support a variety of accounting options, streamlining tax compliance. Meanwhile, taxpayers are also urged to maintain detailed records or use reputable crypto tax software to ensure accurate reporting and alignment with their chosen accounting methods. Failure to do so could result in default FIFO sales, which may not be ideal for many investors. Chandrasekera urged users to plan ahead and verify that their broker’s accounting methods match their tax software to prevent discrepancies. The latest development comes days after the IRS introduced a broker reporting rule under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, controversially expanding broker definitions to include decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This rule requires platforms to report transactions despite their decentralized nature. The rushed implementation faced immediate legal challenges led by A16z Crypto, DeFi Education Fund, and others, who argue the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act and oversteps Treasury’s authority.

38400595,https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-2025-predictions-for-solana,1735767000,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Lightspeed’s 5 predictions for Solana in 2025,https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-2025-predictions-for-solana,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . I’m putting my crystal ball abilities to the test this year. As we turn the page on 2024, here are five Solana predictions for 2025: 1. Elon Musk’s X will debut a native Solana token It’s time. When Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, crypto fans speculated that the dogecoin-loving billionaire would integrate crypto into the social media platform. Those predictions have so far been quashed by Musk , but with the incoming Trump administration expected to loosen US crypto regulations and bring crypto-friendly voices to the table, I think an X token is finally on the way. “Crypto Twitter” is still a vibrant community, so there would be demand for such a token, and Musk’s other companies are known to hold crypto on their balance sheets. X Premium users could pay for their subscriptions using the X token, which Musk could cheaply on- and off-ramp with help from his stablecoin buddies over at Bridge. Solana has the high throughput and low transaction fees to make this all feasible. To sweeten the deal, Solana Blinks could make ecommerce happen natively on X without users leaving the app — a feature from which TikTok recently found success . If X wants to be an everything app, why wouldn’t that moniker extend to currency too? 2. Solana’s stablecoin market cap will quadruple Solana’s onchain volume and demand woke up in a major way in 2024, but stablecoins stayed sleepy. The blockchain currently houses roughly $5 billion in stables, which ranks it fifth among blockchains behind Ethereum, Tron, BSC, and Arbitrum, according to DeFiLlama. This is partly because Solana transactions often don’t require stablecoin pairs for actions like memecoin trading, but stables can play an important role in other use cases like DePIN or payments. With startups like Perena and Lulo focused on growing the Solana stablecoin pie and issuers like PayPal and Sky launching on the chain, Solana could be primed for major growth in 2024. I think Solana’s stablecoin market cap will cross $20 billion by the end of the year, which equates to a 4x increase from its current levels. That would still leave Solana far behind Ethereum, which holds some $110 billion in stablecoins at the moment. 3. Solana ETFs will be approved but will underperform ETH Ok, time for some cold water: I’m not bullish on solana ETFs. I think solana funds are likely to be approved this year as a Paul Atkins-led SEC takes a less stringent stance on defining cryptoassets as securities, but I don’t think SOL ETFs are likely to find all that much demand. Crypto ETFs’ raison d’etre is giving investors regulated access to crypto within things like brokerage accounts. With bitcoin, this makes sense. Its “digital gold” narrative is sticky, it is by far the largest crypto, and curious boomers could be interested in allocating 1% of their portfolios to see where things go. Ether ETFs have done okay partly due to the novelty of the products, but it’s been a little harder to sell investors on them. Solana is more degen and less boomer than either BTC or ETH. A lot of SOL buyers seem to be more likely to onboard via Phantom or Coinbase than with their retirement accounts. By the time SOL ETFs get approved, BTC/ETH combo, Litecoin, HBAR, and possibly XRP will all also have ETFs, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart said . Look, all I’m saying is there’s a reason BlackRock and Fidelity are yet to file for SOL ETFs. ETH ETFs have seen $35 billion in inflows in their first five months of trading. I expect SOL ETFs will have fewer inflows over their first five months. 4. Pump.fun won’t collect the most fees among memecoin platforms One of the most interesting stories to watch in Solanaland this year has been the unprecedented rise of memecoin launchpad pump.fun. Since launching in early 2024, pump has already crossed $330 million in revenue. Multiple times, purportedly-better versions of pump.fun have come out, but no one has been able to snatch the crown in the memecoin sector. But all good things must end, and I think pump.fun will be passed by another app this year. Speculative platforms tend to have a short shelf life in crypto — just ask the investors who valued OpenSea at $13.3 billion in 2022. I think memecoins will continue to be a very large contributor to Solana’s onchain volumes this year, but I don’t think the majority of that volume will play out on pump.fun. If I had to guess, I’d say the heir apparent will be something AI-related. 5. Solana will not experience a major outage Solana has experienced a number of outages in its four-year lifetime. This might be naive of me, but I don’t think it will add another outage to that ledger in 2025. This is a bold take because Firedancer, a fully unique Solana client, is set to take its training wheels off and greatly increase Solana’s throughput this year. This will create a lot of unseen potential risk vectors that could bring the chain down. But Solana’s frequency of outages has fallen over the past two years, presumably as the network’s developers learned from previous mistakes. The Solana Labs spin-off Anza recently created an invalidator team meant to stress test the network. Plus, Jump’s Firedancer client took years to build, and the rollout has taken place over multiple phases. What’s another outage-less 12 months?

This makes it even harder for residents to engage in crypto trading. These measures, which took effect on December 31, 2024, target cross-border crypto activities. Despite the crackdown, China still holds billions in Bitcoin (BTC), sparking questions about its real crypto strategy. China’s New Regulations for a Tighter Grip on Crypto The fresh regulations require banks to scrutinize crypto traders’ identities, track their funds’ sources, and monitor trading patterns. Liu Zhengyao, a lawyer from ZhiHeng law firm, noted that these regulations create a stronger legal framework. This framework targets crypto traders who try to bypass China’s strict rules. It aims to crack down on illegal cross-border crypto activities. In practice, converting China’s currency, the yuan, into crypto and using it to buy foreign currencies could now be flagged as cross-border activity. This makes it increasingly difficult to engage in crypto trading without falling foul of the authorities. China’s Paradox: Tight Regulations and a Massive Bitcoin Stash While China has imposed strict measures to restrict crypto trading, it holds a massive 194,000 Bitcoin worth around $18 billion. According to the Bitcoin Treasuries tracker from Bitbo, these holdings come from asset seizures linked to illegal activities. The fact that China holds such a large amount of Bitcoin raises eyebrows, considering its tough stance on digital assets. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao speculated during the Bitcoin MENA event that China could eventually pivot toward a Bitcoin reserve strategy. While this is unlikely in the immediate future, it is an intriguing paradox. China is cracking down on crypto while stockpiling one of the world’s most valuable digital assets. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum: A Strong Context for China’s Crypto Stash Currently, Bitcoin is priced at $92,983.54, continuing its bullish trend in a bearish market. This surge in Bitcoin’s value is no small factor considering China’s vast holdings. If the country shifted toward using Bitcoin in its financial strategy, it would gain a massive asset. This asset would be worth tens of billions of dollars. This paradox highlights a deeper tension in China’s crypto policy. On one hand, the government aims to protect its financial system from the risks of uncontrolled crypto trading. On the other hand, it’s quietly positioning itself as a major player in the Bitcoin market by accumulating significant holdings.

The liquidity for this initiative will come from 16,310,285,772.6 FLOKI tokens held in the community buyback wallet. A portion of these tokens will fund the ETP, while the remainder will be permanently burned, reducing the overall token supply. Floki DAO’s Liquidity Allocation for ETP Creation The Floki ETP offers a regulated investment vehicle designed to attract institutional and retail investors looking for cryptocurrency exposure through secure and familiar platforms. By mirroring the functionality of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , the ETP allows investors to hold FLOKI without direct asset ownership. This launch aligns Floki with Dogecoin, the only other memecoin to achieve this milestone. Launching a regulated investment product for a memecoin presents notable challenges, including regulatory scrutiny, liquidity concerns, and the volatility commonly associated with meme-based cryptocurrencies. However, Floki has partnered with a leading asset manager and an ETP issuer to navigate these hurdles. A core advisor at Floki emphasized the relevance of this launch, stating that it represents an important step toward memecoin legitimacy in traditional finance. Floki DAO’s Regulatory Milestones and Future Growth As Floki prepares to launch its ETP, it has also gained recognition in regulatory discussions. On November 21, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) acknowledged Floki as a utility token during the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting. This milestone placed Floki alongside major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Avalanche in shaping the regulatory framework for digital assets. Floki’s NFT-based metaverse game , Valhalla, set to launch in early 2025, played a crucial role in gaining this recognition.

Metaplanet has a reputation as Japan’s version of MicroStrategy. And Gerovich didn’t frame this as a “maybe” scenario. He was certain. “The Bitcoin community helped elect Trump,” he said . “Now, he’s expected to deliver. If America adopts Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the rest of the world won’t just watch. They’ll act.” Gerovich’s company switched its entire strategy in 2024 to focus on Bitcoin accumulation. “For us, April was when it clicked. All we care about now is stacking more Bitcoin for our shareholders,” he said. If 2024 was the year the world started taking Bitcoin seriously, 2025 will be the year it becomes a global reserve asset. Trump could set off a global Bitcoin race “Japan looks to the U.S. like a big brother,” Gerovich said. “If Trump moves forward, Japan and other Asian nations will copy the playbook. That’s how this works.” “For third-world countries, Bitcoin could stabilize their economies,” he said. “We’re about to see the full force of game theory in action.” In simple terms, if one country starts using Bitcoin to strengthen its reserves, others will feel pressure to do the same—or risk being left behind. Governments in the Middle East are already acting, though quietly. Gerovich shared insights from a recent Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi. “We spoke to officials from the region, and they’re buying Bitcoin under the radar. They just haven’t announced it yet,” he said. “After Trump declares a Bitcoin reserve, countries will come out and say, ‘Guess what? We’ve got Bitcoin too.’” Why governments might (and might not) jump on Bitcoin The idea of using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve isn’t as crazy as it sounded a few years ago. Countries like El Salvador and Bhutan have already done it. El Salvador holds around 6,000 BTC, worth over $567 million. Bhutan’s stash is even bigger—almost 12,000 BTC, valued at more than $1.1 billion. Both countries see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a kind of “digital gold” for their reserves. The U.S., under Trump’s leadership, could take this idea to another level. Reports suggest a plan to buy 200,000 BTC annually for five years, totaling one million BTC. But this isn’t without risks. Bitcoin’s volatility is legendary. Prices can swing wildly in hours, let alone months. That makes it a risky asset for national reserves. Plus, regulations are still uncertain. Governments would need rock-solid systems to manage their holdings and avoid the kind of hacks that have plagued crypto exchanges. Then there’s the problem of utility. Critics argue Bitcoin doesn’t have the same practical value as traditional reserves like gold or oil. You can’t use Bitcoin to fuel an economy in the middle of a crisis. And let’s not forget market manipulation. These governments could potentially destabilize markets, putting the entire industry at risk. Still, the potential upsides are hard to ignore.

He claimed that his forward guidance for the coin has not changed in the last three years when Bitcoin price traded at just $20,000. This latest forecast is one of the boldest for the coin looking ahead into 2025. Factors to Drive the Price Growth – Halving and Pump PlanB highlighted two of his previous X posts where he made some predictions about the future outlook of Bitcoin. One of these posts dates back to October 2022 while he shared the other last year. In the earlier post, the analyst noted that his forward guidance for the next three years for Bitcoin takes account of the 2024 halving event. He noted that the halving can significantly boost the price of BTC. PlanB is convinced that most of the Stock-2-Flow (S2F) model impact will play out this year. Utlimately, this validates the S2F target of approximately $500,000 projected for this year. Before Q4, 2024 came to an end, Bitcoin price hit $100,000 and rallied as high as $108,000 , setting it as an All-Time High (ATH). The coin has pared off its gains thus far. At the moment, the coin is currently trading at $94,591.42 amid a 1.16% surge in the past 24 hours. Per his latest forecast, PlanB struck the $100,000 level from his list. Besides the average target of $500,000, he said the coin could trade in the high range of $250,000 to $1 million. My forward guidance for 2025 has not changed since 2022 (when bitcoin was 20k, see below): rise into April 2024 halving halving around S2F value pump after halving 100k in 2024 2025: hit S2F target ~500k average (range 250k-1m) https://t.co/Neet5BQ90W pic.twitter.com/osA3vXAW9D — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) January 1, 2025 The New 2025 Bitcoin Price Range Target The PlanB price target for Bitcoin may seem insurmountable to a few market observers but it is worth noting that it aligns with predictions from other experts. The general 2025 BTC price predictions noted that the coin’s valuation may fall within the range of $150,000 to $300,000. Several experts believe the potential establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve will be a key event that could help propel the coin to new highs in 2025. Institutional investors’ adoption is another factor that could serve as a lever for the price of the coin. Business intelligence and software firm MicroStrategy is one of the institutions leading this movement. Recently, MicroStrategy bought 2,138 BTC for $209 million to take its total count to 446,400 BTC. Other firms like Riot Platforms and Semler Scientific are also joining the trend.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-01 21:50:38

Let’s dive into the milestones, trends, and predictions shaping the next era of crypto. This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol , our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. 1. A Look Back: Top Crypto Tech Milestones of 2024 Ethereum’s Duncun Upgrade: 2024 marked Ethereum’s most significant network upgrade yet. Ethereum activated the Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) upgrade, a landmark improvement designed to enhance scalability and reduce data fees, marking a pivotal step in the network's evolution. Duncun introduced proto-danksharding , a mechanism aimed at lowering costs for Layer-2 rollups by simplifying data availability and improving transaction throughput. The changes, though immensely debated , aimed to benefit developers and pave the way for further innovations in Ethereum’s roadmap, reinforcing its position as the leading smart contract platform. Solana Locks in Value: Solana's DeFi TVL hit $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) for the first time in three years, with its DeFi ecosystem experiencing even more growth. This achievement reflects increased user engagement and the expansion of decentralized applications on the platform. This growth was significantly helped by institutional adoption and major integrations. Financial giants like Franklin Templeton and Société Générale leveraged Solana for tokenized asset projects. Solana also expanded its reach with Robinhood adding SOL to its trading platform and Cboe Global Markets filing for Solana-linked ETFs , signaling increased confidence in its infrastructure. Quantum Computing’s Warning Bell: Google’s advancements in quantum computing, particularly with its revolutionary quantum chip, raised alarms within the crypto community about the potential threats to blockchain security. The chip’s ability to solve problems far beyond the reach of classical computers reignited debates around Bitcoin’s reliance on traditional encryption methods and the broader implications for the crypto ecosystem. Experts emphasized the urgency of transitioning to quantum-resistant encryption to safeguard cryptocurrencies against future vulnerabilities. While current quantum computers are not yet capable of compromising blockchain networks, Google’s progress underscored the need for proactive measures to ensure the long-term security and resilience of digital assets. Layer-2 Adoption Soars: Layer-2 adoption surged as projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base played pivotal roles in addressing Ethereum’s scalability challenges. Arbitrum continued to dominate the Layer-2 ecosystem, crossing 1 billion in transactions , driven by its strong developer support and DeFi integrations. Optimism continued to expand its influence with its OP Stack technology , which enable modular Layer-2 solutions and foster ecosystem-wide collaboration through its integration into Optimism’s Superchain. Base, a Layer-2 incubated by Coinbase, gained significant traction as it leveraged Coinbase's extensive user base and on-ramps, with Franklin Templeton becoming the first asset manager to launch a tokenized treasury fund on the network. DeFi Leaders Innovate: Aave became the focus of a new fund launched by Grayscale Investments in October, providing institutional and accredited investors with exposure to its governance token (AAVE) through a traditional investment vehicle; Uniswap Labs announced Unichain , a decentralized Layer-2 blockchain built with Optimism's OP Stack, designed to enhance transaction speed, reduce costs, and improve cross-chain interoperability, with plans for a 2025 mainnet launch; and MakerDAO rebranded to Sky as part of its Endgame Plan, introducing new governance (SKY) and stablecoins (USDS), autonomous ""Sky Stars,"" deflationary tokenomics, and a roadmap for transitioning fully from MKR to SKY tokens. 2. Emerging Trends for 2025 AI x Blockchain: The integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain is set to revolutionize identity verification, predictive analytics, and smart contract automation — and, hopefully, curtail negative side effects of AI . Regulated Crypto Hubs: Jurisdictions like Hong Kong, Dubai, and Singapore are positioning themselves as crypto-friendly innovation centers , attracting startups and institutional investors alike. Interoperability Takes Center Stage: Cross-chain protocols will dominate development , enabling seamless asset transfers and collaboration between blockchain ecosystems. 3. Developer Spotlight: 2024 in Numbers The Electric Capital Developer Report : The report highlighted sustained growth in blockchain development with a 35% increase in active developers. Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, Base, and Polygon led the pack, showcasing their strong developer communities. Solana was the biggest draw for new developers, bringing in 7,625 new developers in 2024, surpassing Ethereum. Solana's appeal, driven by its low fees, fast transactions and many memecoins , positions it as a formidable competitor in the smart contract arena. 4. What to Watch in 2025 Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade: Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade has been split into two phases, Prague and Electra, to ensure a smoother rollout of key improvements to the consensus and execution layers. The Electra phase will enhance validator efficiency, bolster network security, and introduce improved mechanisms for managing validator exits. Scaling Solutions: ZK-rollups and modular blockchains will drive the next wave of scalability , ensuring smoother user experiences. Zero-knowledge proofs are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling enhanced privacy and efficiency while paving the way for a future where blockchain networks can scale seamlessly without compromising decentralization. Decentralized Identity: The rise of decentralized identity solutions could redefine how users interact with Web3 platforms, emphasizing privacy and ownership.These systems leverage blockchain technology to give users control over their personal data, allowing them to verify their identities without relying on centralized authorities. 5. Final Thought 2024 set the stage for crypto's next chapter, with breakthroughs in scalability, DeFi, and security shaping a transformative year ahead.",Tech|Milestones|The Protocol|Newsletters|Crypto 2024|Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SOL|TECHNOLOGY|ARB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-01 22:01:12

The reform comes when Syria has been struggling with decades of conflict and economic mismanagement that have left its infrastructure in ruins and its currency devalued. Integrating Blockchain into Syria’s Economy At the heart of the plan is the digitization of the Syrian pound through blockchain. The digital currency is to be backed with reserves of Bitcoin, gold, and U.S. dollars in order to gain confidence and stability. Besides that, the government wants to legalize the mining and trading of Bitcoin within a strict regulatory framework. The initiative hopes to spur a new mining industry-which the country would be well-placed for, given abundant energy resources-while addressing concerns about monopolization and environmental impact. Supporting Businesses and Remittances The plan seeks the incorporation of Bitcoin into financial services, startups, and currency exchanges to spur economic recovery. It focuses on streamlining remittances-a major source of income for many Syrian families-and opening up opportunities to businesses that have been crippled by many years of conflict. Key in this is privacy and security: residents must be afforded the right to self-custody their digital assets free of exploitation. Challenges Overcome But the plan comes with many obstacles. The country is under strict international sanctions, still lacks modern technological infrastructure, and runs huge debts from the previous regime. And while Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means that it can avoid traditional banking restrictions, implementing such a system will require significant technological investment and international cooperation. Legal and Ethical Considerations The reform proposition is toward a transparent and legitimate financial system, not one embracing the illicit use of virtual currencies by outfits such as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham. This jihadist group, formerly part of al-Qa’idah, has used digital currencies to finance activities, as various reports claimed, hence raising ethical and legal considerations. In contrast, this plan by the Syrian Center for Economic Research will seek to benefit all citizens through legitimate channels overseen by the transitional government. Global precedents, the way forward for Syria: This has been tried with partial success by countries such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic. There was some higher tourism inflow in El Salvador and partial foreign direct investment inflow, though much criticism about economic risk. The geopolitics around Syria is particularly complicated, but if pulled off, this could be a unique leading position in cryptocurrency adoption for Syria within the Middle East.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|REGULATION|BTG,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-01 22:06:41

In 2024, a year that defied expectations, the market added over $10 trillion in value. Think about it: that’s more than the combined GDP of many major economies. Over the past four and a half years, the market’s capitalization has doubled . Meanwhile, the entire stock markets of China, Hong Kong, and Europe combined trail behind by 50%. And let’s not even get started on the fact that the “Magnificent Seven” tech companies alone have a market cap larger than Europe’s entire stock market. This level of dominance is historic. The S&P 500 is expected to close out 2024 with a 24.3% increase, mirroring last year’s 24.2% rise. Back-to-back years of 20%+ growth? That hasn’t happened since the late 90s. It’s a monster bull run for the history books. Tech giants push the market to new heights The “Magnificent Seven” deserve their spotlight. Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta didn’t just lead the charge , they bulldozed the competition. Nvidia, riding the hype of AI advancements, became a Wall Street darling. Its stock price soared to $134.37 by year’s end, with a 30% year-over-year revenue increase. Tesla was another headline grabber. With a stock price of $404.57, the company shattered records by delivering 500,000 vehicles in Q3 alone. That’s a 20% revenue jump in a single year. Add in its groundbreaking battery tech, and you’ve got investors throwing cash at it like it’s going out of style. Microsoft? Oh, it had a year. Azure cloud revenue shot through the roof, driving a 25% annual revenue boost. Its stock closed the year at $421.18, making it one of the most reliable players in the tech industry. Apple didn’t lag behind either. With its iPhones flying off shelves, particularly in emerging markets, its stock closed at $250.21. Alphabet and Amazon rounded out the pack with strong performances in cloud computing, advertising revenue, and e-commerce. The numbers speak for themselves. Amazon hit $219.27 per share, boosted by a surge in Prime memberships and a 30% growth in AWS revenue. Alphabet? A steady $190.22, thanks to recovering ad spending and a strong Q3. Indices break records as the economy rebounds The S&P 500 hit 57 new all-time highs in 2024 alone. By December 31, analysts were already projecting another 10% increase for 2025. But it was the Nasdaq Composite that outshone everything, boasting a 30% annual gain. Smaller indices though were completely left in the dust. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average, often considered the more traditional face of the market, held its ground. But the year was also about the U.S. economy showing off its resilience. Businesses adapted to higher interest rates. Consumers kept spending. Inflation is still volatile, but not enough to scare off investors. The Federal Reserve was part of the party too. Their announcement of just two planned interest rate cuts for 2025 was met with strong, if a bit mixed, reactions. Some investors wanted more aggressive action, but the market kept pushing upward. Corporate profits surged, and companies adapted faster than anyone expected. Bitcoin and stocks crashed though. Crypto’s champion MicroStrategy And then there’s MicroStrategy. While most investors stuck to traditional equities, this company doubled down on crypto. By the end of 2024, it had over 444,000 Bitcoins. Its stock (MSTR) surged after President Trump won the election, which made it a standout in a year dominated by tech giants. In fact, it is currently one of the most-watched stocks this year. Analysts have big hopes for the company. Though after Bitcoin’s price correction, MSTR also tumbled. Its closing price was $289.62. The stock reached its all-time high of $543 on November 20. MicroStrategy has received a consensus rating categorized as a “buy” from analysts, with a median price target of $1,403.22, a high estimate of $2,890.00, and a low estimate of $400.00.

The recently New York-approved Ripple RLUSD stablecoin, which uses modest quantities of XRP for transactions, is directly related to XRP’s value, driving market demand. The listing of RLUSD on Uphold, MoonPay, and Bitso has increased investor interest, with XRP holding firm support above $2.22. Analysts expect the XRP price to rise to the $5 level soon, especially if Ripple gets U.S. ETF certification. These changes make XRP one of the most exciting cryptocurrencies to monitor, offering early investors significant growth potential.

Table of Contents XRP’s path to $5: An uphill battle Lightchain AI: A force in blockchain innovation Lightchain AI to achieve a 20x rally Ripple (XRP) has long been a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, celebrated for its ability to revolutionize cross-border payments. However, as XRP faces challenges in scaling to new price levels, emerging projects like Lightchain AI are proving to be compelling alternatives. Priced at $0.004 in its presale, Lightchain AI has gained significant traction, raising over $7 million and positioning itself as a high-growth contender with the potential to outpace XRP’s performance. XRP’s path to $5: An uphill battle Ripple’s XRP coin plays a key role in world payments, facilitating quick, cheap trade among money groups. Even with its known use, XRP’s rise to $5 depends on getting past a few obstacles, like stronger competition from other blockchains. Although Ripple has key wins in its court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the top rules still stay h͏ard. Moreover, XRP’s need for big firms using it makes it less appealing to small buyers who mainly look for opportunities that give both use and fast growth. Lightchain AI: A force in blockchain innovation Lightchain AI has quickly gained recognition as a platform designed to integrate AI systems into decentralized environments. Unlike traditional blockchain networks, Lightchain AI focuses on creating practical solutions for advanced computation and data management. Its unique approach has resonated with investors, leading to a highly successful presale that highlights confidence in its long-term viability. The project’s ability to attract both developers and enterprises demonstrates its potential to address real-world challenges. With its emphasis on fostering collaboration and creating decentralized applications that utilize intelligent systems, Lightchain AI provides a competitive edge that traditional financial-oriented blockchains may lack. Lightchain AI to achieve a 20x rally At its presale price of $0.004, Lightchain AI presents a unique opportunity for early investors to capitalize on its rapid growth potential. Achieving a 20x rally would bring its token price to $0.08, a realistic milestone given its current market interest and growing adoption. The platform’s technical strengths and ability to provide tailored solutions for decentralized environments contribute to the likelihood of outperforming older blockchain networks. While XRP has established its dominance in specific niches, Lightchain AI’s broader appeal and transformative framework make it a versatile player in the evolving blockchain landscape. This versatility could attract a wide array of users, driving demand for its token and accelerating its market performance.

Could this be the moment investors have been waiting for? And more importantly, will altcoins join the rally? Bitcoin Indicators Show Signs of Bottoming Out On both the daily and weekly charts, key technical indicators for Bitcoin suggest that a reversal may be imminent. The Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch), which measures momentum, has hit oversold levels, indicating that sellers might be exhausted. Similarly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular tool to assess whether an asset is overbought or oversold, is hovering near its bottom range. Historically, such levels have often preceded significant price recoveries. This convergence of oversold conditions on multiple timeframes paints a promising picture for Bitcoin. If history repeats itself, a breakout could be on the horizon, possibly pushing Bitcoin to reclaim key resistance levels and set the stage for a new bullish trend. Q1: A Key Period for Ethereum’s Growth While Bitcoin’s potential reversal is exciting, Q1 has historically been a period of growth for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ethereum’s price often follows Bitcoin during market recoveries, but it has its own catalysts that drive unique growth. Ethereum’s network upgrades, growing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), and the increasing popularity of layer-2 scaling solutions frequently gain momentum in the first quarter of the year. Investors and developers alike tend to double down on Ethereum’s potential during this period, leading to significant price increases. If Bitcoin’s reversal triggers a broader market rally, Ethereum could lead the charge among altcoins. Altura ($ALU): One of the Most Bullish Projects Ahead Amid the broader market anticipation, Altura ($ALU) stands out as one of the most bullish projects for the coming months. Altura is revolutionizing the gaming and NFT industry by providing smart NFT solutions that enable developers to integrate dynamic NFTs into their games. This innovation allows in-game assets to evolve and adapt based on gameplay, creating a more immersive and engaging experience for players. What makes Altura particularly promising is its strong community support and growing list of partnerships with game developers. As blockchain-based gaming gains traction, Altura’s native token, $ALU, could see exponential growth. If Bitcoin and Ethereum rally as expected, Altura is well-positioned to ride the wave and deliver impressive returns for investors. Conclusion Bitcoin’s potential reversal is sparking excitement across the crypto market. With key indicators like Stoch and RSI signaling a bottom, the stage is set for a rebound. Ethereum, as always, is likely to shine in Q1, fueled by its strong ecosystem and historical trends. Meanwhile, Altura ($ALU) emerges as a standout altcoin, poised to capitalize on the growing blockchain gaming market. As the market gears up for what could be a pivotal period, investors are keeping a close eye on these trends. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newcomer, now might be the time to position yourself for the opportunities ahead. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Remember 1973, when the global economy took a nosedive? Smart investors “bought the dips” and reaped the rewards. Today, meme coins offer a similar opportunity amidst the chaos, with projects like BTFD Coin (BTFD), Fartcoin (FRTC), and Simon’s Cat (CAT) leading the pack. Among these, BTFD Coin has captured the spotlight, smashing presale records by raising over $4.8 million. As analysts predict major gains for early adopters, these meme coins are more than just internet laughs; they’re becoming serious investment contenders. Meme coins have come a long way since the early Dogecoin days. Communities have grown stronger, projects have evolved, and real-world use cases like Play2Earn (P2E) games, staking rewards, and referral programs now drive their value. BTFD Coin is taking this momentum to new heights, combining community power with innovative features to dominate the meme coin scene. Let’s dive into how these coins stack up. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Meme Coin Revolution They say timing is everything, and BTFD Coin’s presale has perfect timing. It’s all about buying the dips, and $BTFD embraces this mantra. This meme coin’s presale started at just $0.000004 per coin and has climbed to $0.0000142 in Stage 13, with a total of 16 stages before its planned listing price of $0.0006. BTFD Coin’s P2E game, in its entirety, is live, enabling players to experience the game and receive rewards. In just a few weeks, over 60 billion $BTFD tokens have been sold to more than 7,300 holders, raising a jaw-dropping $4.8 million. The secret? A strong mix of features that blend fun with serious earning potential: Play2Earn Game : The buzz around BTFD’s upcoming P2E platform is hard to ignore. Gamers will earn $BTFD tokens while immersing themselves in addictive gameplay. Referral Program : Get rewarded for spreading the word. Community building has never been this profitable. Staking Rewards : Holders can stake $BTFD for juicy returns, adding another layer to its utility. Drawing inspiration from the 1973 crash, where icons like Warren Buffett excelled, $BTFD presents a compelling investment opportunity. At a low price of $0.000142 in Stage 13, it’s an affordable entry point for potential substantial returns. The exclusive BIG50 bonus provides you with a 50% bonus on your purchase (e.g., buy 100, receive 150) with code BIG50. Now’s the time to acquire $BTFD and prepare for potential market growth. Fartcoin (FRTC): The Comedic Underdog with a Loyal Fanbase If you thought the crypto market couldn’t get more creative, say hello to Fartcoin (FRTC). What started as a joke among developers is now turning heads. FRTC is banking on its comedic branding and grassroots approach to stand out in a saturated market. What makes FRTC unique is its refusal to take itself too seriously while delivering solid tokenomics. With a deflationary supply and a loyal, meme-loving fanbase, FRTC has gained traction on social platforms. It’s not just about laughs, though. The team is working on utility features, including NFT integrations and community-driven governance. However, its biggest hurdle remains scalability. FRTC’s roadmap is ambitious, but the question is whether it can deliver in a space where memes come and go faster than your favourite TikTok trend. While the coin has potential, its price movements are more volatile, making it riskier for long-term investors. Still, if you’ve got a sense of humour and a love for crypto, FRTC might be worth a punt. Simon’s Cat (CAT): The Whiskered Wonder of Meme Coins There’s a good reason Simon’s Cat (CAT) has gained traction among Gen Z and Millennials. Inspired by the beloved animated series, CAT merges meme coin culture with nostalgia, making it a hit among internet-savvy investors. Launched on the Binance Smart Chain, CAT surged 69% last week following anticipation of an airdrop. Its team has nailed marketing, with token burns, exchange listings, and a strong social media presence driving its meteoric rise. But here’s the catch: CAT lacks a defined utility, and 30% of its supply is reserved for presale investors, leading to potential volatility. Still, CAT’s community is its strength. Fans of Simon’s Cat are fiercely loyal, and this meme coin could gain serious traction if it taps into broader adoption strategies. Think of exclusive NFTs or partnerships with gaming platforms. For now, CAT remains a speculative play, but one with a fun twist. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale: A Quick Guide Getting in on the BTFD Coin presale is easy as pie.

38405286,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323995,1735771480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38405286.jpeg,Bitcoin DeFi Trends Predicated to Soar in 2025,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-defi-trends-predicated-to-soar-in-2025/,"The year 2024 was monumental for Bitcoin (BTC). For the first time ever, Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 per coin . This all-time high sparked renewed interest in crypto from both regulators and investors alike, prompting fresh conversations around Bitcoin DeFi. As Bitcoin continued to gain traction, industry experts believed that decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases specific to BTC would escalate in the coming year. Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder and CEO of Build on Bitcoin (BOB), told Cryptonews that the first wave of Bitcoin DeFi took place in 2024 . “Teams started building products last year consisting of emerging layer-2 (L2) scaling networks and DeFi protocols for Bitcoin,” Zamyatin said. “But this was just the beginning, as all of these products are finally going live in 2025.” Bitcoin Liquid Staking and Liquidity Options Zamyatin explained that the Bitcoin L2 Babylon will launch this year , creating safe and simple channels for users to participate in Bitcoin staking. He noted that Bitcoin Secured Networks (BSN) will connect to the BOB L2 network, boosting the growth of Bitcoin liquid staking . According to Zamyatin, the more BTC liquid staking tokens (LSTs) are used on chains like BOB, the more fees are generated on those chains, which then share a portion back with BTC stakers. This cycle potentially draws more BTC into staking. $3.5bn BTC staked so far Let that sink in. And we’re only just getting started. Still 700+ blocks to go. Cap-3 is still open. For those who have already staked directly through the Babylon protocol, you can now head over to our discord, verify your BTC address and secure… pic.twitter.com/p6ZIr7NByi — Babylon (@babylonlabs_io) December 12, 2024 LSTs representing claims on staked BTC already reached $5.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) by January 1, 2025, according to stakingrewards.com . Enabling Liquidity Without Selling BTC Granite is another Bitcoin DeFi project launching in 2025. Granite is an autonomous liquidity protocol built on the Stacks Bitcoin L2 blockchain . The protocol allows borrowers to take stablecoin loans using Bitcoin as collateral, without exposure to counterparty or rehypothecation risk. Rena Shah, COO of Trust Machines – a community of dedicated Bitcoin builders – told Cryptonews , that Granite enables Bitcoin holders to get liquidity without selling their Bitcoin. The end of 2024 is approaching, but there is still time to sign up for the @GraniteBTC waitlist. 2025, Bitcoin DeFi is coming. — Rena Shah (@renapshah) December 31, 2024 “DeFi hasn’t touched Bitcoin meaningfully, but with the increased price volatility, more people are looking for options to leverage their Bitcoin without selling it,” Shah said. “Granite finally allows Bitcoin users to unlock their assets through a DeFi protocol.” Given the maturing Bitcoin DeFi sector, Shah added that Bitcoin can potentially play the most important role in mainstream DeFi adoption in 2025. “With over a trillion dollars in BTC held across different wallets, the potential of Bitcoin staking services will be one of the most sought after spaces of Bitcoin for new and expanding companies looking to provide access to Bitcoin DeFi,” she remarked. Bitcoin Adoption in Institutional Lending Protocols While loans and staking are important for retail investors, institutional DeFi lending platforms will incorporate Bitcoin derivatives as collateral this year. Sidney Powell, CEO and Co-Founder of Maple Finance, told Cryptonews that Maple Finance is incorporating Lightning Bitcoin (LBTC) as collateral. Maple Institutional Wrapped: High Yield Secured Lending In 2024, our High Yield pool delivered 16.5% net APY to lenders, always overcollateralized. High Yield is positioned for an even stronger Q1 – deposit today to continue outperforming DeFi competitors. pic.twitter.com/MLzMGkgEu8 — Maple (@maplefinance) December 30, 2024 “This reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s high liquidity and low counterparty risk,” Powell said. “These advancements highlight Bitcoin’s evolving role as a cornerstone asset in decentralized lending, derivatives, and automated market maker (AMM) ecosystems.” Powell further believes that adoption of Bitcoin in institutional lending protocols will continue to expand, with Bitcoin serving as collateral in decentralized undercollateralized loans. “This trend reflects the broader integration of crypto into traditional finance, as institutions increasingly value blockchain’s transparency and efficiency ,” he commented. “Additionally, new use cases like Bitcoin Ordinals are opening up innovative opportunities for asset tokenization and creative finance solutions linked to Bitcoin.” Powell mentioned that use cases such as these further reflect how Bitcoin is being used beyond traditional narratives of store-of-value and payments. “With Bitcoin increasingly incorporated into institutional DeFi lending markets, it is poised to establish itself as a premier collateral asset within decentralized financial ecosystems,” he said. Improved UX Designs For Bitcoin DeFi Protocols Beyond L2 solutions, projects are refining user experiences (UX) to make Bitcoin DeFi more accessible. Matt Luongo, CEO of crypto venture production studio Thesis, revealed that Mezo – an economic layer for Bitcoin – prepared a UX upgrade focusing on a concept called “Cathedral and Bazaar.” BitcoinFi will dominate 2025 — Mezo (@MezoNetwork) December 31, 2024 According to Luongo, the core focus of Mezo’s offering will be an intuitive process for Bitcoin borrowing. This will allow users to collateralize their BTC and access a line of credit via mUSD, Mezo’s native stablecoin. This feature is currently live on the Mezo testnet. “Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions like Mezo will improve scalability and unlock smart contract capabilities for Bitcoin-based DeFi applications,” Luongo added. “I expect many of the highly anticipated projects to be live on the market in 2025, giving a full end-to-end Bitcoin DeFi experience.” Challenges for Bitcoin DeFi While 2025 offers promise, potential hurdles may slow adoption. Powell explained that new tax regulations in the United States will likely influence Bitcoin DeFi this year , particularly for institutional participants. “Stricter reporting requirements for crypto transactions could introduce added complexity for institutions leveraging Bitcoin in DeFi activities, such as using it as collateral in lending protocols or yield-generating strategies,” he remarked. As a result, these changes may require more detailed transaction tracking and could trigger taxable events at multiple stages. On the other hand, Powell believes that clearer tax policies could promote institutional adoption by alleviating regulatory uncertainty, which has long been a hurdle for large-scale market players. “Greater transparency and compliance may encourage institutions to engage more confidently with Bitcoin DeFi platforms,” he said. Retail investors may also be hesitant when it comes to earning yield on Bitcoin. Deven Soni, CEO of Matador Network, told Cryptonews that “the biggest knock on Bitcoin yield historically has been the centralization risk of platforms like Celsius and FTX.” However, Soni remarked that the rise of decentralized platforms that allow users to access DeFi/yield while holding custody of their crypto is something to look forward to this year.

See How It Compares to Struggling Altcoins!,https://thecoinrise.com/can-web3bay-be-the-ebay-killer-see-how-it-compares-to-struggling-altcoins/,"The digital economy is on the brink of significant change, with e-commerce and cryptocurrencies charting divergent paths. Web3Bay is at the forefront, harnessing blockchain’s power to enhance trust and user autonomy in online shopping. Conversely, well-known altcoins such as Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano are navigating through rough waters. Web3Bay ’s decentralized platform, fueled by the 3BAY token, seamlessly integrates traditional and crypto payments, offering a streamlined shopping experience. Meanwhile, these altcoins are contending with declining prices, driven by changing market sentiments and a drop in trading activity. Web3Bay: A Glimpse into the Future of E-Commerce Imagine a vibrant marketplace, not confined by physical space but sprawling across the blockchain, where trust is inherent in every transaction, and your personal data is entirely your own. This is the scenario Web3Bay is crafting. It aims to revolutionize online shopping by eliminating central oversight, thus returning power to the consumers. Operating on a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay melds security, transparency, and efficiency to rival industry giants like eBay. At the core of this transformation is the 3BAY token, the lifeblood of the ecosystem. This token isn’t just a currency; it’s a tool for empowerment. Token holders can steer the platform’s governance to reflect the community’s will, enjoying perks like a 5% discount on marketplace purchases. With a presale designed to incentivize early adopters, the 3BAY token offers potential returns up to 6430%, representing a compelling investment opportunity. The marketplace itself marries traditional and modern, accepting crypto payments alongside standard options like PayPal. This dual approach connects the old and new worlds of commerce, making Web3Bay inviting for both crypto veterans and newcomers alike. Additional features like IPFS storage for secure data handling and robust blockchain infrastructure ensure transactions are smooth, even during peak demand. With 580 million crypto users worldwide and growing confidence in blockchain finance, Web3Bay is set to revolutionize online shopping. As more consumers demand control, privacy, and security, Web3Bay’s vision for a decentralized e-commerce future is becoming increasingly compelling. Altcoins Under Pressure: Stellar, Dogecoin, & Cardano Experience Downturns In recent market shifts, several leading altcoins have faced significant downward trends. Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano have each encountered headwinds, reflecting broader market sentiments and distinct investor behaviors. Stellar , dedicated to streamlining cross-border payments, has seen its value dip due to market dynamics and investor outlook. Although the platform is advancing its technology and partnerships, the prevailing market slump has taken a toll on its valuation. Dogecoin , which began as a satirical crypto token, has undergone substantial price swings. Despite earlier boosts from community support and celebrity endorsements, DOGE’s price has recently fallen. This decline is partly due to a decrease in trading volume and open interest, suggesting a cooling of trader interest. Notably, DOGE’s trading volume plummeted by approximately $14.84 billion to a 40-day low of $5.29 billion, and open interest fell by nearly $1.4 billion, indicating a downturn in short-term trading activity. Cardano , celebrated for its rigorous, research-based approach and a focus on security, has also seen its price drop. Despite ongoing development and a robust community support, ADA’s market performance is swayed by overall market trends and investor sentiment. Analysts suggest, however, that Cardano’s price could ascend by 30% of the crypto market rallies, hinting at a potential rebound. These instances highlight the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility, where prices can swiftly shift due to various factors including market mood, technological advancements, and global economic conditions. Investors are thus encouraged to conduct thorough research and weigh the risks associated with digital assets. Summing Up As e-commerce entities like Web3Bay push forward with decentralization, the struggles of altcoins underscore the inherent unpredictability within blockchain ventures. Web3Bay sets itself apart with a blend of security, transparency, and efficiency, offering a unique decentralized shopping experience. Meanwhile, the tribulations of Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano remind us that crypto valuations are heavily swayed by market sentiment, technological evolution, and investor behavior. While Web3Bay advances its pioneering future, the volatile nature of altcoin prices reflects the broader uncertainties of the crypto landscape.

According to Etherscan data reported by crypto reporter Colin Wu, Buterin donated a total of 100 ETH to Pertsev on two occasions, helping him pay legal fees. “[Vitalik] donated 50 ETH, worth about $170,000, to Juicebox: Support Alexey Pertsev today Currently, Juicebox: Support Alexey Pertsev has raised more than 184 ETH. Alexey Pertsev is a Tornado Cash developer and is seeking more funds to pay for ongoing legal fees. [Vitalik] donated another 50 ETH to Juicebox: Support Alexey Pertsev today, totaling 100 ETH, worth about $340,000.” An X page dedicated to helping the Tornado Cash developers publicly thanked Buterin for the donation. In May of 2024, Pertsev was sentenced to five years and four months in prison by a Dutch court for allegedly laundering billions of dollars. The US banned the use of Tornado Cash in 2022, citing national safety concerns. However, a US appeals court sided with Tornado Cash in November of last year, effectively overturning its ban by saying the Treasury Department’s actions against it were unlawful. The judge in the case ruled that smart contracts do not technically qualify as “property” and thus the ban under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act – which allows the President to “block any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest” – was an overreach of power.

That’s why when it comes to managing digital assets, having the best crypto wallet can make all the difference. Whether someone’s a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just starting their journey, choosing a reliable wallet is key to keeping funds secure and accessible. With options like PlusWallet, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and Exodus Wallet gaining popularity, it’s essential to explore what sets these wallets apart. This article will dive into four of the top crypto wallets and highlight their strengths. 1. PlusWallet: Security, Flexibility & Rewards—All in One! When it comes to choosing the best crypto wallet, PlusWallet delivers a powerful combination of advanced tools, unmatched security, and income-generating opportunities. Designed for today’s crypto enthusiasts, PlusWallet stands out with its multi-chain compatibility, allowing users to manage assets across numerous blockchains seamlessly. This wallet ensures maximum flexibility while maintaining top-tier protection for digital holdings. PlusWallet’s innovative rewards mechanism truly sets it apart. With the Swap to Earn feature, users can earn USDT rewards on every transaction—there are no caps, no gimmicks, just real earnings. PlusWallet transforms every trade into an opportunity to grow assets, making it a favorite among active traders. Unlike traditional wallets, which offer limited or no passive income options, PlusWallet rewards its users consistently, providing both ease and profitability. On average, users can start claiming rewards after accumulating just 5 USDT, which are processed within 24 to 48 hours—fast, reliable, and hassle-free. Additionally, PlusWallet’s referral program takes earning potential to the next level. Every time someone’s referred friends make a swap, they earn a percentage of the commission in USDT too! 2. Trust Wallet: A Top Pick For Crypto Travelers Trust Wallet is designed specifically for Android and iOS devices and ensures smooth operations for users who prefer a mobile experience. With support for multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin, Trust Wallet provides a seamless way to manage diverse digital assets in one place. Travelers can also showcase or collect digital art with ease, thanks to the wallet’s integrated NFT management features. Trust Wallet goes the extra mile with its built-in crypto exchange, allowing users to swap assets quickly without leaving the app—a lifesaver for last-minute transactions. Although it lacks a native desktop app, its mobile-first approach ensures convenience for those constantly on the go. 3. MetaMask: The Go-to Wallet for Web3 Enthusiasts For users looking to explore the decentralized web, MetaMask has earned its place as a top choice in the crypto wallet space. Available as both a mobile app and a browser extension, MetaMask offers the flexibility to manage assets on the go or from a laptop. It supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible networks, making it a versatile tool for managing crypto portfolios. Users can use MetaMask to access decentralized finance platforms, connect with exchanges like Uniswap, or interact with NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea. However, its primary focus on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks may not suit those managing assets across multiple chains. 4. Exodus Wallet: A Blend of Style & Functionality When it comes to combining sleek design with practical features, Exodus Wallet stands out as a top choice. This wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Solana, meme coins, and stablecoins, making it versatile for various needs. With its built-in exchange, users can perform quick swaps between cryptocurrencies without ever leaving the app. Exodus also caters to security-conscious users by integrating with Trezor hardware wallets, ensuring extra protection for digital assets. Its cross-device synchronization allows it to seamlessly manage portfolios across desktop and mobile apps. While Exodus excels in design and user experience, it doesn’t offer extensive dApp support or advanced staking options compared to other wallets. Conclusion: The Best Crypto Wallets for Every Need Selecting the best crypto wallet hinges on specific requirements such as security, flexibility, and earning potential. Trust Wallet stands out for its mobile-friendly design and offering features like NFT integration. For those engaging with the decentralized web, MetaMask provides extensive support for Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks. For users who prioritize aesthetics and functionality, Exodus Wallet delivers a sleek interface alongside support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. But for traders seeking the best wallet with advanced features and earning opportunities without compromising on security, PlusWallet is the ideal go-to option. This wallet offers multi-chain compatibility, the Swap to Earn feature, and a transparent referral program. While each wallet—Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Exodus Wallet, and PlusWallet—brings unique advantages to the table, users can evaluate these options to identify the wallet that best aligns with their crypto management needs and goals.

Many believe it has the potential to grow by 2025. With early bets being placed, some wonder if DTX could outperform the more established players. Why is this platform getting so much buzz, and what could it mean for the crypto market? Ripple's SEC Battle: What's at Stake for XRP? The long-running legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has investors on edge. As the January 15 deadline for the SEC's opening brief approaches, speculation is rampant. There's a glimmer of hope for Ripple, though. With Paul Atkins set to take over as SEC Chair in January, many in the crypto community are optimistic. Atkins is seen as more crypto-friendly than current Chair Gary Gensler, and some experts believe this change in leadership could lead to the lawsuit being dismissed. XRP's price dropped 7.27% last week and is trading at $2.09. One XRP expert, EGRAG CRYPTO, predicts XRP could rise in a possible upswing. However, others warn that Ripple’s XRP price could drop to $1 before bouncing back. With the dicey status quo of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit and the recent unstable nature of XRP’s price, Ripple investors are setting their eyes on DTX Exchange, which experts believe affords more benefits. What's Next for Chainlink's Token Following LINK Whale Activity? A Chainlink whale recently deposited 250,000 LINK tokens, valued at $5.37 million, on Binance and OKX. Between December 14 and 18, the whale withdrew 595,000 LINK tokens from Binance, worth around $17.31 million. Chainlink's LINK token has seen a big price drop, as it fell 16.91% last week. It's now trading at $20.94. The recent price drop in Chainlink's LINK token was triggered by a liquidity sweep around the $22 mark. This critical level saw a large volume of LINK sell orders, and it caused a short-term price drop from around $26 to below $22. This activity could lead to future volatility as Chainlink traders target these liquidity-rich zones. This volatility is causing LINK investors to consider DTX Exchange as it promises maximal profits for investors. New Crypto Player Enters the Scene: DTX Exchange As 2024 comes to a close, a surprise contender is emerging in crypto. DTX Exchange is bringing together a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, ETFs, stocks, and bonds, all under one platform for a pleasant trading experience. This platform aims to make life easier for traders by offering an impressive 12,000 tradable assets. No more switching between different platforms! DTX Exchange's layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX, is the key to making this happen. It connects traditional assets with modern ones, creating a seamless experience. VulcanX has already launched its testnet, and the results are promising. It's expected to deliver an impressive 100,000 transactions per second, putting it ahead of the competition. This makes DTX Exchange an exciting player in the crypto space, and some experts think it could be one of the best cryptos to buy in the coming year. DTX Exchange Takes the Lead: Is it the Best Crypto to Buy? DTX Exchange is making waves in the crypto world, leaving XRP and Chainlink behind. It's become a go-to platform for accessing major ETF assets. The platform's native token, DTX, is currently in presale, and has already raised over $11 million in funding. Investors are taking notice, and the numbers look promising. Each DTX token is available for just $0.14 in the current stage, with predictions of an 80% return on investment. By the looks of it, DTX Exchange promises to be one of the best cryptos to buy in the coming year.

Trump 2025 (TRUM2025), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUM2025 is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump 2025 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump 2025 could become the next viral memecoin. Trump 2025 launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump 2025 on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump 2025 by entering its contract address – 5K2ESM1q2SjZFybttofLFpbbW8yF3isBRW3ZxDPUVfVY – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUM2025. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-01 23:17:17

With its official exchange listing just around the corner, the token has drawn significant attention. Recent market activity indicates a potential 220% surge, fueled by strategic accumulation and viral interest from XRP whales. As momentum builds, DTX is quickly emerging as one of the most talked-about tokens of 2024, with the potential to solidify its position as a breakout star heading into 2025. XRP on the Rise: RLUSD and Bullish Momentum Drive Optimism XRP has maintained its bullish momentum, trading near $2.11 and targeting critical resistance at $2.15, which could pave the way for a rally toward $2.50. On-chain activity surged in December, with transactional volume increasing by 40%, signaling heightened network utility and investor interest. Source: Tradingview The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s new stablecoin, has added another layer of optimism to XRP’s outlook. Backed 1:1 by USD reserves and cash equivalents, RLUSD was introduced on December 17 and is already making waves. Its use in cross-border transactions and integration into the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has enhanced liquidity, making XRP more attractive to institutional players. RLUSD’s transparent audits and regulatory approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) have further bolstered its credibility, positioning it as a serious competitor to stablecoin giants like USDT and USDC​ However, XRP faces near-term challenges. A recent downside triangle breakout hinted at potential retracements to key support levels between $1.75 and $1.64, where buyers may look to re-enter. Despite this, RLUSD’s growing adoption has reinvigorated XRP’s use case, potentially driving sustained price growth into 2025. DTX Token’s Viral Moment: Could It Pump 220%? While XRP garners attention for its bullish price action, DTX Token is quietly stealing the spotlight during its presale phase. Trading at just $0.14, DTX has already attracted interest from XRP whales, signaling growing confidence in the project’s potential. Whale accumulation during presales is often seen as a strong indicator of an asset’s future prospects, and DTX is no exception. DTX Token powers the DTX Exchange , a hybrid trading platform that integrates stocks, crypto, and forex markets into a seamless ecosystem. The exchange’s innovative approach has made it one of the most exciting projects in the blockchain space, offering users access to tokenized real-world assets, decentralized custody through the Phoenix Wallet, and advanced trading tools such as 1000x leverage. The presale phase has gained significant traction, as early investors recognize the token’s potential for explosive growth once it enters the broader market. With an anticipated exchange listing expected to drive demand, analysts are predicting a 220% pump or higher, as DTX transitions from its presale phase into active trading. DTX and XRP: Two Tokens to Watch in 2025 The synergy between DTX Token and XRP is creating a buzz that’s hard to ignore. While XRP’s recent activity points to strong bullish potential, DTX is emerging as a high-growth asset with the fundamentals to back its hype. XRP remains a cornerstone of blockchain-based financial solutions, leveraging its regulatory clarity and on-demand liquidity services to dominate cross-border payments. On the other hand, DTX offers a fresh perspective by integrating traditional markets with blockchain innovation, making it a unique player in the hybrid crypto category. Both tokens are poised for significant gains in early 2025. XRP’s resistance at $2.15 and potential rally toward $2.50 highlight its immediate bullish potential, while DTX’s viral moment and whale activity suggest that it could see exponential growth following its listing.

Deaton would boldly express his bullish stance on the XRP price, the pro-crypto lawyer outrightly stated that he had no idea how high the coin could soar. Deaton made a long post on X after Peter Chung, Head of Research at Presto, appeared on Squawk Box discussing crypto. John Deaton Slams Visible Boycott by Top Forecasters Chung noted his predictions about leading digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), for 2025. For BTC, the firm expects that it will hit $210,000, while SOL is forecasted to trade at $1,000. Deaton expressed his astonishment in light of these predictions, noting that XRP did not feature in the projections. He outlined the coin’s successes, including becoming the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, excluding USDT. Despite being the 3rd largest cryptocurrency by market cap (excluding Tether as a stable coin), no mention of XRP below. I’m surprised considering XRP is one of the few cryptocurrencies to finish December trading in the green. I don’t do price predictions but Barron’s recently… https://t.co/scamKncLKT — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 1, 2025 John Deaton also noted that XRP is one of the few cryptocurrencies that ended the year in the green. On this basis, he did not see the omission of XRP as fair. Though Deaton claimed that he never gave crypto predictions, he highlighted an earlier forecast by Barron. In a recent article, the American newspaper made some strong claims, including that “XRP has been one of the biggest post-election crypto winners and has quadrupled in value since Nov. 5.” Even Arthur Azizov, CEO of the crypto business B2BinPay, feels very bullish about XRP. Azizov predicted that XRP could reach a price range of $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025. To further furnish his stance, Azizov cited XRP’s strong momentum following the completion of the US elections. Additionally, he pointed to the strides made by Ripple to solidify its place as a key player in the crypto space. Where is XRP Headed? According to CoinMarketCap, the Ripple-associated coin currently has a market value of $2.31, following a 10.8% surge in the past 24 hours. While this is a significant boost, an earlier price analysis projects a $5 target for XRP this year amid growing whale embrace. Last month, top market analyst expert Ali Martinez pointed out that the coin is gearing up for a massive rally. He named the technical and historical trends around it as “one of the most promising setups” for XRP. Martinez then predicted that this setup indicates a potential rally to the $11 target on the horizon.

Web3Bay is making waves by using blockchain to bolster trust and user control in online shopping. On the flip side, popular altcoins such as Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano are hitting rough patches. Web3Bay ‘s decentralized market, driven by its 3BAY token, melds traditional and crypto payments, offering a smooth shopping journey. In contrast, these altcoins are feeling the pinch from falling prices, influenced by market sentiment and a downturn in trading activity. Web3Bay: Witness the Future of E-Commerce Unfold Imagine a bustling digital marketplace where each vendor’s stall is not on the streets but on the blockchain—a domain where every deal is built on trust and your data stays strictly yours. Web3Bay is turning this dream into reality. It’s set to overhaul online shopping by cutting out the middleman and returning power to the people. Constructed on a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay melds security, transparency, and efficiency, challenging tech behemoths like eBay. At the core of this shift, the 3BAY token acts as the backbone of the platform. This token is a Swiss Army knife for users, allowing them to shape the platform’s governance to reflect community needs and bag perks like a 5% discount on purchases. With a presale aimed at rewarding early birds, the 3BAY token dangles a carrot of potential returns up to 6430%, making it an attractive bet for investors. This marketplace seamlessly combines the old and the new, welcoming crypto payments alongside time-tested options like PayPal. This strategy builds a bridge between traditional and blockchain commerce, opening Web3Bay’s doors to everyone from blockchain buffs to newbies. Plus, features like IPFS storage for secure data management and a sturdy blockchain backbone ensure smooth sailing for transactions, even when the waters get choppy. With 580 million crypto users globally and a growing trust in blockchain finance, Web3Bay is poised to upend online shopping. As more consumers crave control, privacy, and security, Web3Bay’s blueprint for a decentralized shopping future is catching eyes as a viable alternative. Altcoins Feeling the Heat: Stellar, Dogecoin, & Cardano Face Declines In the latest market trends, several well-known altcoins have experienced notable dips. Stellar (XLM), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) are each wrestling with challenges, reflecting wider market sentiments and particular investor behaviors. Stellar , which prides itself on enabling cross-border payments, has seen its value dip amid market swings and shifts in investor mood. Despite ongoing advancements and partnerships, the current market slump has dented its valuation. Dogecoin , born as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has seen its share of ups and downs. Despite earlier rallies driven by community support and celebrity nods, DOGE’s price has taken a hit recently. This downturn is partly due to a drop in trading volume and open interest, suggesting cooling interest from traders. Notably, DOGE’s trading volume plummeted by about $14.84 billion, hitting a 40-day low of $5.29 billion, with open interest shrinking by nearly $1.4 billion, pointing to a drop-off in short-term trader activity. Cardano , celebrated for its rigorous, research-driven approach and focus on security, has also witnessed a decline in price. Despite continuous development and strong community backing, ADA’s market performance is swayed by broader market dynamics and investor sentiment. Yet, analysts remain optimistic, projecting a potential 30% rise in ADA’s price if the market conditions improve, signaling a chance for recovery. These developments underline the cryptocurrency market’s volatility, where prices are quick to react to a mix of factors, including market attitudes, tech advancements, and broad economic indicators. Thus, investors are encouraged to do their homework and weigh the risks when diving into these digital assets. Final Thoughts As platforms like Web3Bay push the envelope on decentralizing online shopping, the hurdles faced by altcoins spotlight the inherent unpredictability in blockchain ventures. Web3Bay distinguishes itself with a mix of security, transparency, and efficiency, presenting a unique opportunity for a decentralized shopping experience. Meanwhile, the trials of Stellar, Dogecoin, and Cardano serve as a reminder that market mood, technological strides, and investor actions can greatly sway crypto values. As Web3Bay forges ahead with its innovative vision, the fluctuating fortunes of these altcoins mirror the broader uncertainties of the crypto landscape.

The Stellar coin price has been bearish, reflecting the overall market sentiment. At the same time, Uniswap (UNI) has seen a 9% price drop, even with significant activity from large holders, leaving many wondering about the reasons behind it. BlockDAG (BDAG) , an up-and-coming layer-1 blockchain project, is stirring up excitement with a $1 million USDT New Year raffle. This raffle is not just about winning; it’s an opportunity to gain substantial rewards, including a 200% bonus on BDAG purchases. With enticing prize levels and a limited window to participate, it’s drawing the attention of crypto enthusiasts globally. Stellar’s Downtrend Continues: Can It Recover? Recently, the Stellar coin price has dropped by 10%, struggling to keep its market cap above $10 billion, now at $10.87 billion. Technical indicators like the RSI have fallen sharply, increasing the selling pressure and nearing oversold conditions. The Ichimoku Cloud analysis confirms the downtrend, showing Stellar trading below the cloud without any imminent signs of reversal. The market is closely monitoring the $0.351 support level. Should this level break, further declines in Stellar coin price are likely, though a rebound could push it towards $0.40. The RSI at 39.9 suggests a continued bearish shift, with potential for more declines unless the market finds stability. Uniswap’s 9% Drop Amidst Surging Whale Transactions Uniswap, a prominent decentralized exchange token, is showing conflicting signals. Despite a 200% boost in large holder transactions, Uniswap price has fallen 9% within just 48 hours, sparking debates over its immediate direction. The data indicates a spike in significant trades, suggesting strategic moves within the market, yet the absence of a clear direction keeps retail traders on edge. The trend of decreasing exchange inflows over the past three days suggests that holders are keeping their assets, usually a bullish indicator. However, despite the Uniswap price drop, there’s a chance for recovery if the $12 support level holds firm. If this support breaks, further declines could occur, with liquidation data revealing $818,000 at stake. Hurry, BlockDAG’s $1M USDT Raffle is Closing Soon! BlockDAG, a burgeoning blockchain platform, is ringing in the New Year with a grand giveaway, creating a thrilling opportunity for crypto enthusiasts to win big. This exciting $1 million USDT New Year raffle is calling on participants to grab BDAG coins and enter for a chance at substantial rewards. Each ticket purchase is sweetened with a 200% bonus, giving each entrant exceptional value for their involvement. This raffle is cleverly divided into three alluring prize tiers, each tailored to fit different levels of participation. The Bronze Tier allows for a $125 BDAG purchase, which includes a 200% bonus and the chance to win up to $250,000 USDT. The Silver Tier steps it up with a $250 purchase, a similar 200% bonus, and the potential to win $500,000 USDT. The premier Gold Tier, with a $500 entry, not only provides a 200% bonus but also the highest probability of snagging the coveted $1 million USDT grand prize. Winners will be declared on BlockDAG’s official Telegram, Twitter, and website channels. With the raffle concluding in just one day, excitement is mounting, attracting a large influx of participants to the presale, further boosting its triumph. Currently, the BDAG coin is listed at $0.0234 in its 26th batch, having amassed $174.5 million in the presale with over 17.6 billion BDAG coins distributed. Renowned as one of the highest ROI cryptos, early purchasers have seen a return of 2240% since its initial pricing at $0.001, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the crypto community. Wrap-Up Thoughts The crypto market is facing transformative shifts, with the Stellar coin price currently at a low of $0.33, indicating a downward trend, and Uniswap witnessing a significant price drop of 9% despite notable activity from large-scale traders. In this uncertain climate, BlockDAG’s $1 million New Year raffle emerges as a standout opportunity. Participants stand to gain from a hefty 200% bonus and vie for impressive prizes, including the $1 million USDT top award. With an impressive track record as one of the highest ROI cryptos—providing 2240% gains to its initial backers and raking in over $174.5 million in its presale—BlockDAG’s drive is unmistakable as it counts down the final day of its New Year raffle.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin.

How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field.

Memecoins have been at the centre of this frenzy, and the rise of Pepe Coin (PEPE) was a prime example. In 2023, PEPE took the crypto world by storm, turning early holders into overnight millionaires and sparking what some called a “meme coin season.” Investors watched as coins pumped and dumped in a flash, but PEPE’s deflationary charm and homage to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme ensured it wasn’t just another fleeting trend. While PEPE made history with its rapid rise and billion-dollar market cap, there’s no need to wallow if you missed that train. The next big thing is already here— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With a buzzing presale offering the lucrative BIG50 offer (50% extra BTFD Coins), a thriving community, and exciting features like staking and Play-to-Earn (P2E) games, BTFD is making a strong case for being one of the best meme coins to buy today. BTFD Coin: Bulls Are Owning the Meme Coin Moment Let’s talk about BTFD Coin, the new kid on the block that’s got everyone buzzing. Short for “Buy the Dip,” BTFD is more than just a clever name—it’s a rallying cry for those who see market dips as opportunities rather than obstacles. The presale is currently in its 13th stage, with tokens priced at $0.000142, and it’s been nothing short of explosive: $4.8 million raised so far, with milestones like hitting $1M in under 10 days— over 60 billion tokens sold, with a growing holder base of over 7,000 bulls. For example, by investing $1750 in BTFD Coin during Stage 13 at $0.000142 per coin and activating the BIG50 code, you would secure an impressive 18,086,620 coins (e.g. buy 100 and get 150 offer). As the presale progresses and the price rises to $0.0006 per coin, your investment would grow to an exciting $10,851.97, delivering a remarkable profit of $9,101.97. This illustrates the extraordinary earning potential of this presale opportunity, magnified by the BIG50 bonus advantage. But numbers aren’t the only reason BTFD is getting attention. This coin is building an ecosystem designed for engagement and growth. BTFD Coin has officially launched the full version of its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, enabling users to earn $BTFD tokens while playing. The project also features a referral program and staking rewards, establishing a comprehensive ecosystem designed for sustainable growth. The P2E game immerses users in the world of crypto bull runs, creating an interactive and fun way to participate in the project’s vision. It’s this kind of forward-thinking innovation that sets BTFD apart from typical meme coins. And let’s not forget the staking rewards. With a 90% APY, BTFD isn’t just about short-term gains—it’s about creating sustainable opportunities for investors. Imagine earning rewards just for holding onto your tokens—talk about making your money work for you. It’s no wonder analysts are predicting big things for BTFD when it lists at $0.0006, giving early adopters significant upside potential. Add in the Bulls Squad, a community of passionate holders rallying around this project, and it’s clear that BTFD isn’t just a coin—it’s a movement. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, BTFD is proving to be one of the best meme coins to buy today . Pepe Coin: The OG of Memecoin Season Pepe Coin, launched on Ethereum as a deflationary token, was created to pay homage to the beloved Pepe the Frog meme that dominated internet culture in the early 2000s. What set PEPE apart was its simplicity: no taxes, no overpromising utilities—just pure meme power. In 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap hitting an eye-popping $1.6 billion. This incredible run minted millionaires out of early holders and sparked a memecoin frenzy, with investors scrambling to find the next PEPE-like opportunity. While some coins pumped and dumped, PEPE managed to hold its own, thanks to its strong community of believers who rallied around its meme-centric ethos. However, like any whirlwind crypto success, the question remains: will PEPE and its memecoin peers rise to new highs, or was their peak the crescendo of a fleeting season? For those who missed the boat, it’s a tough pill to swallow—but the crypto market never sleeps. If PEPE was your missed chance, projects like BTFD Coin are here to ensure you don’t make the same mistake twice. Conclusion Pepe Coin showed us how quickly a meme can turn into a market sensation, creating millionaires and shaping the narrative of “meme coin season.” But the crypto space is all about what’s next, and BTFD Coin is making a strong case as the heir to the meme coin throne. With a booming presale, staking rewards that offer real value, and an engaged community driving its growth, BTFD is proving itself as one of the best meme coins to buy today. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Whether you’re here for the memes, the returns, or both, BTFD Coin is ready to take you on a wild ride. Get in on the action, join the Bulls Squad , don’t forget to claim the BIG50 bonus and stake your claim in the future of meme coins.

With his eye on the memecoin sector, the trader says many of the big memes like MOODENG , CHILLGUY , or PNUT “all either send hard” from current prices or “fall off a cliff.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 01:36:00

One of the most notable success stories is Solana’s ICO, which highlighted the potential of investing early in innovative technologies. Similarly, Qubetics is emerging as a promising project, offering a visionary approach to blockchain interoperability and scalability. This article delves into the missed opportunities of Solana’s ICO and the exciting potential of Qubetics. Qubetics: The Future of Autonomous Blockchain Ecosystems Qubetics has been established to address the growing demand for a decentralised, interoperable, and self-sufficient blockchain infrastructure. By integrating seamlessly with the Ethereum ecosystem, Qubetics sets a new standard for scalability, security, and user-centric features. This visionary project is designed to enhance the blockchain landscape by enabling interoperability across networks and fostering a truly decentralised Web3 ecosystem. The fragmented nature of the current blockchain environment limits the potential of decentralised applications and cross-chain transactions. Qubetics tackles these challenges by becoming a Web3-aggregated chain, unifying multiple networks into a cohesive framework. This approach enables seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality, unlocking the full potential of decentralised technologies for developers, enterprises, and users. Solana: A Missed Opportunity for Early Investors Solana’s ICO is a classic example of how early-stage investments in innovative projects can lead to extraordinary returns. Held in March 2020, the Solana ICO offered SOL tokens for $0.22. The project raised $25 million during this fundraising round, securing the resources to develop its high-performance blockchain platform. Fast-forward to today, Solana has established itself as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains, with a growing ecosystem of decentralised applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralised finance (DeFi) projects. At its peak, the SOL token traded at over $250, representing an astonishing ROI for early investors participating in the ICO. Solana’s success can be attributed to its unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism, which allows the blockchain to process thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. This scalability has positioned Solana as a key player in the blockchain space, driving adoption among developers and enterprises alike. It is understandable that those who missed the opportunity to invest in Solana’s ICO regret it. However, the cryptocurrency market is filled with new opportunities, and emerging projects like Qubetics present a chance to be part of the next wave of innovation. Qubetics: A Compelling Investment Opportunity Currently in Presale Phase 15, Qubetics offers an exceptional opportunity for early adopters. Each presale phase brings a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. At this stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0414, with over $8.5 million raised, 12,800+ holders, and 394 million tokens sold. The next phase is imminent, with a post-presale target price of $0.25 per token. Analysts predict that $TICS tokens could achieve $10 to $15 values following the mainnet launch. For investors entering this stage, this translates to an ROI of approximately 32,028.61% if the token reaches $10 and around 48,092.91% if it climbs to $15. Qubetics’ autonomous and decentralised infrastructure ensures self-sufficiency, positioning it as a transformative force in the blockchain. Qubetics is poised to drive innovation and adoption across the Web3 ecosystem by addressing interoperability challenges and providing scalable, secure solutions. The Synergy Between Vision and Execution Solana and Qubetics showcase the importance of visionary thinking in the blockchain industry. Solana’s success demonstrates how technological innovation and scalability can drive widespread adoption. On the other hand, Qubetics highlights the significance of addressing interoperability and creating autonomous blockchain ecosystems to unlock the full potential of decentralised technologies. Learning from Missed Opportunities The lesson for investors who missed out on Solana’s ICO is clear: identifying and investing in promising projects during their early stages can yield remarkable returns. While Solana’s ICO is a missed opportunity, projects like Qubetics provide a fresh chance to participate in the future of blockchain innovation. By addressing real-world challenges and offering compelling solutions, Qubetics is well-positioned to become a key player in the next wave of blockchain development. With its focus on interoperability, scalability, and user-centric design, Qubetics is more than just a cryptocurrency; it is a comprehensive ecosystem that bridges the gap between fragmented blockchain networks. Conclusion: Seizing the Next Big Opportunity The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, offering new opportunities for those who missed out on past successes like Solana’s ICO. Qubetics stands out as a visionary project that addresses critical issues in the blockchain space, providing a unified and autonomous ecosystem for developers and users alike. For investors seeking to capitalise on the next transformative blockchain project, Qubetics offers an unparalleled opportunity. By participating in its presale, early adopters can position themselves to benefit from the project’s growth and avoid the regret of missing out on another landmark ICO. With its innovative solutions and strong growth potential, Qubetics is poised to shape the future of blockchain technology.

As Shiba Inu (SHIB) grapples with its fluctuating value, a new contender has emerged from the shadows, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a low-cap altcoin that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and real-world assets (RWA). This intriguing shift highlights the dynamic nature of altcoin investments and highlights the potential for substantial returns in the developing decentralized markets. Shiba Inu Price Takes a Hit Amid Whale Activity and Market Selloff The Shiba Inu price has faced significant headwinds in recent days, fueled by large-scale selloffs from crypto whales and a broader market downturn. Over the last 48 hours, the Shiba Inu price posted a 3% loss, joining the ranks of other meme coins that have struggled under the weight of bearish sentiment. A major transaction, highlighted by analytics firm Lookonchain, saw a whale offloading 250 billion SHIB tokens, valued at approximately $6 million, pushing the Shiba Inu price further into the red zone. This selloff marks a pivotal moment, as the whale in question had amassed a staggering 15.28 trillion SHIB tokens in 2020 for just $3,800, raking in $109 million in profits to date. Despite these challenges, Shiba Inu enthusiasts remain hopeful. Historical patterns suggest that meme coins, including Shiba Inu, could rebound strongly during altcoin seasons or broader market rallies, with analysts predicting potential highs of $0.0000998 by 2025. However, volatility remains a critical factor as the market awaits signs of a Shiba Inu price turnaround. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The Low-Cap Altcoin With AI and RWA Integration Amidst the current bear movement of the Shiba Inu price, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is making waves in the real estate sector. PropiChain is reshaping the global real estate industry with a groundbreaking decentralized platform integrating blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the metaverse. Historically, real estate investing has been reserved for high-net-worth individuals due to steep capital requirements and geographic limitations. PropiChain dismantles these barriers by providing global access to real estate markets. One of PropiChain’s standout features is its use of NFT tokenization. PropiChain allows for swift and secure property transactions by converting physical properties into digital assets without the need for cumbersome documentation or intermediaries. This fractional ownership model also empowers investors to purchase shares of high-value properties, making real estate accessible to a broader audience while introducing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid asset class​. PropiChain’s AI capabilities redefine how investors approach the real estate market. With automated market predictions and valuation models, the platform enables users to make data-driven decisions with unparalleled accuracy. AI tools analyze historical sales data and economic indicators to provide predictive insights into market trends and price fluctuations, helping investors capitalize on opportunities while mitigating risks. For instance, PropiChain’s AI-powered virtual assistants guide users through complex processes like document preparation and legal compliance, ensuring a flawless and efficient experience. Through its metaverse integration, users can virtually explore properties, interact with 3D environments, and evaluate property features without needing physical visits. This feature bridges geographic gaps and improves the decision-making process by providing an immersive property exploration experience​. PropiChain employs blockchain’s decentralized ledger system, known as “Title Contract,” to assure the security and transparency of all transactions. This feature eliminates counterparty risks, fraudulent activities, and trust issues that plague traditional real estate systems. Additionally, smart contracts , audited by BlockAudit, automate lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals, reducing administrative burdens and ensuring timely agreement execution​. PropiChain minimizes transaction costs and accelerates the property transfer process by removing intermediaries. Why Invest in the PropiChain Altcoin Presale PropiChain’s altcoin presale is structured to reward early participants with significant returns on investment (ROI). The presale is divided into three rounds, each offering altcoins at progressively higher prices. Currently, it is in the second stage, offering altcoins at $0.011. The listing price on exchanges post-ICO is set at $0.032 per altcoin, representing a 900% increase from the current price. Early participants receive 20–25% bonus altcoins, with 50% unlocked at TGE and the rest vested over 10 weeks to guarantee long-term commitment. The PCHAIN altcoin provides flawless platform functionality, from purchasing property NFTs to accessing AI-driven insights. Early investors can participate in PropiChain’s presale, with altcoins offered at discounted rates across multiple rounds. Now listed on CoinMarketCap, participating in PropiChain’s presale allows investors to secure substantial financial gains while supporting a platform set to revolutionize real estate investment through the integration of AI and blockchain technology. While investors brace for a probable further Shiba Inu price drop, savvy investors are looking forward to PropiChain (PCHAIN) altcoin, which has a better utility value and market proposition.

Concurrently, a flurry of activity surrounds Cardano’s whales, who have snapped up 20 million ADA in anticipation of the imminent Plomin Hard Fork, a pivotal governance update poised to redefine the blockchain’s structure. Amidst this buzz, BlockDAG (BDAG) fresh Refer and Earn USDT initiative is dishing out immediate USDT cashback for both referrers and buyers, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Consequently, the network’s presale has ballooned to $174 million, with 17.6 billion coins already snapped up. Tron Crypto Price Poised for a Significant Leap The current buzz around Tron crypto price, now trading at $0.257793, points to a potential 444% rally to the $1.11 mark soon. This comes after a commendable 31.79% rise last month, even after a slight dip from its December high of $0.4407. A notable uptick in trading volume—jumping 50% to $1.19 billion—mirrors a heightened investor interest. A bullish pattern on the charts suggests Tron’s upward trajectory might continue, though support at $0.246 and resistance near $0.31 will be critical in shaping its path forward. Cardano Whales Make Big Moves Before Key Blockchain Update In a show of market confidence, Cardano whales have recently accumulated 20 million ADA. This comes just before the Plomin Hard Fork, scheduled between January 4 and 29, 2025, which introduces full on-chain governance via CIP-1694. This governance overhaul is crucial for the Cardano ecosystem, and the whales’ actions suggest they are gearing up for possible price movements, with ADA now at $0.887. Market analysts see a potential spike to $1.20 if resistance at $0.91 is breached, though a fall below $0.76 might push it down to $0.50. BlockDAG’s Refer & Earn: A Lucrative USDT Cashback Scheme BlockDAG’s referral initiative is reshaping the landscape of cryptocurrency incentives, offering immediate USDT rewards that stand out as one of the premier opportunities in the digital currency sphere. Referrers are rewarded with a solid 6% cashback in USDT for transactions made through their links. As activity heightens within a single day, the cashback percentage escalates, reaching an impressive 10% starting from the fifth transaction onwards. Additionally, buyers receive a consistent 6% cashback on each transaction, paving the way for limitless benefits for everyone involved. To participate, transactions need to exceed a $30 threshold, with rewards promptly transferred to any BEP-20-compatible wallet, ensuring swift satisfaction. This streamlined process is designed to instantly gratify both referrers and purchasers, cultivating a vibrant and active community. The surge in demand fueled by this offer has catapulted BlockDAG’s presale to over $174 million, with more than 17.6 billion coins distributed. Currently priced at $0.0234 in its 26th batch, the cryptocurrency has already yielded a staggering 2240% ROI for early investors since its inception. This time-sensitive referral scheme not only augments immediate returns but also primes participants for future growth, with projections aiming for a $1 valuation per BDAG by 2025. BlockDAG’s referral system is noted for its simplicity, scalability, and profitability, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Engaging now allows users to enhance their financial gains while securing a position in a burgeoning network poised to revolutionize the blockchain arena. Best Crypto Coins to Buy Now Tron’s growing traction and positive forecasts suggest a robust upswing, backed by solid technical and trading volume indicators. Cardano’s whale activity underscores robust market faith in its upcoming governance overhaul, potentially influencing its price in the near future. Moreover, BlockDAG’s impressive referral rewards and presale achievements establish it as one of the best crypto coins to buy right now. With a presale that has already gathered $174 million and moved over 17.6 billion coins, BlockDAG offers high ROI possibilities through its timely Refer and Earn USDT system, a chance for daily rewards not to be missed!

Ethereum’s adoption of a proof-of-stake model has drawn environmentally aware users, enhancing its function and leading to more long-term holders than Bitcoin. However, Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by removing middlemen providing user empowerment through blockchain-backed clarity and decision-making. At the same time, XRP Ledger’s increase in activity, propelled by RLUSD stablecoin use and key advancements, hints at possible price rises and greater network function. As Ethereum continues to be a major player in decentralized finance and XRP bolsters its system, Web3Bay is forging a distinct path in altering consumer shopping and financial behavior. Analysing Ethereum’s Growing HODLer Base In 2024, Ethereum saw a significant rise in long-term holders, surpassing Bitcoin in this measure. This increase largely comes from its switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus approach, which greatly cut its energy use and appealed to those conscious of the environment. Additionally, Ethereum’s vast network of decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts has increased its usefulness, attracting developers and companies. Moreover, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, primarily on Ethereum, have driven its uptake by delivering financial services such as lending and borrowing without middlemen. This has boosted confidence among investors, as seen in the growing number of HODLers. Analysts also foresee Ethereum reaching $10,000 due to technological improvements and rising interest from institutions. Furthermore, the expected launch of cryptocurrency ETFs could further enhance Ethereum’s attractiveness, cementing its status as a top player in digital finance. Web3Bay Transforms E-Commerce via Blockchain Imagine a place where online shopping is governed not by large corporations but by its own users. Web3Bay is turning this concept into reality by removing large middlemen, lowering costs, and placing control into the hands of users via blockchain technology. This system manages payments, contracts, and logistics efficiently and securely through smart contracts, enhancing transparency and efficiency. This decentralized platform not only saves money but also allows users to influence its direction. Through the 3BAY token, users do more than trade; they have a voice in its evolution. This includes governance rights that allow the community to direct the future of Web3Bay, turning it into more than just a shopping site but a user-driven ecosystem. Additionally, the crypto community is beginning to notice. With over 400 million crypto shoppers worldwide, Web3Bay is set to capture this expanding audience. For example, early backers have already seen returns as high as 4253% during the token’s presale. Even those who missed the early opportunities still have a chance to participate before the full launch. As Web3Bay prepares to take on major e-commerce platforms like eBay, it combines the convenience of online shopping with the benefits of blockchain. For crypto shoppers weary of hidden fees and data misuse, Web3Bay presents a refreshing alternative where they can shop, save, and influence a future they help shape. This unique mix could soon make Web3Bay a leading name in the e-commerce revolution . XRP Ledger Enhances Crypto Transaction Efficiency The XRP Ledger is witnessing a surge in usage that may hint at potential price increases. Recently, the creation of new accounts has reached levels not seen since 2020, indicating a growing interest in the XRP ecosystem. Daily transactions have also soared to over 1.4 million, spurred by new functionalities and increased adoption of the platform. One significant factor in this growth is Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which is fully supported by U.S. dollar deposits. RLUSD is gaining popularity on major exchanges like Uphold and Bitso, with plans for more integrations. The addition of Kenneth Montgomery, formerly of the Federal Reserve Bank, to the advisory board also enhances confidence in Ripple’s initiatives. Final Note! Ethereum, Web3Bay, and XRP each demonstrate the diverse potential of blockchain technology across finance, e-commerce, and digital ecosystems. Ethereum’s increase in long-term holders underscores its appeal as a sustainable and adaptable platform. The XRP Ledger’s rising activity, propelled by RLUSD and strategic developments, emphasizes its growing utility and potential market impact. Meanwhile, Web3Bay’s approach to e-commerce places power and control in the hands of its users, creating a marketplace that is shaped by its community.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 03:35:00

BTFD Coin Is Quickly Becoming the Meme Coin You Don’t Want to Miss,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-dogwifhats-peak-btfd-coin-is-quickly-becoming-the-meme-coin-you-dont-want-to-miss/,"The world of meme coins is fast-paced, wild, and full of opportunities—but only if you’re quick enough to grab them. Dogwifhat (WIF), a playful Solana-based memecoin featuring a Shiba Inu dog rocking a pink knitted hat, turned heads with its unique charm and loyal community. During its early days, WIF was a hidden gem, giving early investors massive returns as it surged in popularity. But here’s the thing about meme coins: timing is everything. If you didn’t snag WIF when it was trading low, you might be feeling like the moment has passed. And, let’s be honest, that FOMO is real. The good news? The crypto space is always buzzing with the next big opportunity, and BTFD Coin is stepping up as the new contender. BTFD’s booming presale offering a 50% bonus in BTFD Coins with BIG50 offer, innovative features and growing community are turning heads. If you’re hunting for the best meme coins to buy this month , BTFD Coin might just be your ticket to turning missed opportunities into major wins. BTFD Coin: Bulls Are Owning the Meme Coin Frenzy BTFD Coin is making waves as one of the most exciting new meme coins on the market. Short for “Buy the Dip,” this project is all about embracing volatility and finding value in the chaos of crypto. Currently in its 13th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.000142—a price point that’s already drawing in savvy investors. The numbers speak for themselves: Over $4.8 million raised so far, with key milestones like $2.5M reached in under 14 days. More than 61 billion tokens are sold, reflecting the growing interest in the project. A passionate community of 7,300 holders, known as the Bulls Squad, is rallying behind the coin. Consider an investment scenario, By investing $3000 in BTFD Coin during Stage 13 at the price of $0.000142 per coin and unlocking the BIG50 code for a 50% bonus, you would secure an impressive 31,690,141 coins . As the presale concludes and the price surges to $0.0006 per coin, your investment would blossom to a remarkable $19,014.08 , delivering a substantial profit of $16,014.08 . This showcases the undeniable growth potential of this opportunity, amplified by the presale bonus and the strategic use of the BIG50 code. One standout feature of BTFD is its 90% APY staking rewards. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD offers tangible incentives for holders. Staking lets you earn while holding your tokens, turning your wallet into a passive income machine. This alone makes BTFD one of the best meme coins to buy this month. BTFD Coin has officially released the full version of its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, allowing players to earn $BTFD tokens while enjoying the game. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game immerses users in a fun, and interactive experience. It’s not just about playing; it’s about being part of the bullish ethos that BTFD represents. The game keeps investors engaged and connected, adding a layer of value to the project that extends beyond the token itself. The project also includes a referral program and staking rewards, forming a dynamic ecosystem designed for sustained growth. BTFD’s secret sauce, though, is its community. The Bulls Squad isn’t just a group of holders—they’re a movement. Their enthusiasm and dedication are helping BTFD build momentum as it heads toward its projected listing price of $0.0006. If you missed out on Dogwifhat, now’s your chance to be part of a project that’s gaining steam fast. Dogwifhat: A Playful Memecoin With Serious Fans Dogwifhat (WIF) took the meme coin world by storm, blending humour, community, and creativity. Built on the Solana blockchain, WIF’s concept—a Shiba Inu dog wearing a pink knitted hat—was as quirky as it was endearing. It quickly gained traction among investors who were drawn to its lighthearted vibe and its promise of inclusivity. WIF was more than just a joke. Its community-driven nature made it a favourite among investors who valued mutual support and a shared vision. With an accessible buying process—requiring only a Solana-friendly wallet and exchange—WIF made it easy for newcomers and seasoned traders alike to join the fun. However, as with all meme coins, timing was key. Dogwifhat’s peak brought massive gains to early adopters, but for those who hesitated, the opportunity to ride its wave has come and gone. While WIF remains a beloved project, it serves as a reminder of how quickly the memecoin market moves. If you missed out on WIF’s meteoric rise, BTFD Coin is proving to be the next big chance to catch a rising star in the meme coin world. The Bottom Line Dogwifhat showed us the power of creativity and community in the crypto space. It turned a playful idea into a full-fledged movement, rewarding early adopters with impressive gains. But the market doesn’t wait, and those who missed WIF’s rise know all too well how fleeting these opportunities can be. Now, with its explosive presale, staking rewards, and vibrant community, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the best meme coins to buy this month. Don’t let another chance slip by. Join the Bulls Squad, stake your claim by utilising the BIG50 bonus code before it’s gone, and be part of the next big thing in meme coins. With BTFD, your missed moments can become your biggest wins.

The XRP price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. Ripple price with a potential surge, may reach a high of $15.65 by 2030. Ripple Lab’s native token XRP price holds its value above the $2 mark with a surge of over 250% in 2024. Moreover, with SEC chair Gary Gensler’s exit on 20th January and a potential dismissal of the appeal on the SEC vs Ripple case, this altcoin is all set to explode. On the other hand, with the launch of the “RLUSD” and the potential filing of the XRP ETF in 2025, the Ripple price could slingshot toward a new ATH. Keeping a close watch on the short-term and long-term Ripple price prediction with questions like “Will XRP reach $5 before 2025?”.

Furthermore, the most controversial Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is on the path to its closure with the resignation of Gary Gensler. This could act as a catalyst in the project to regain its dominance in the sector and achieve a new high. In such an optimistic outlook, Ripple’s XRP coin price could surpass its previous ATH and head toward an annual high of $3.99 in 2025. However, in a global crisis, the Ripple price might settle at $2.15. Considering the buying and selling pressure of the crypto market, the average price of this altcoin could settle at around the $3 mark.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE.

Following a bearish phase that saw Shiba Inu fall by more than 37% from its December highs, market analysts now believe the meme-inspired cryptocurrency may be poised for a strong recovery. Amid this consolidation phase, a whale has withdrawn $4.63 million worth of Shiba Inu from Binance, sparking speculation of a potential upward movement. SHIB Whale Activity and Resistance Levels A major transaction involving Shiba Inu has caught the attention of the crypto community. A whale, dormant for five months, withdrew 220 billion SHIB tokens worth $4.63 million from Binance. This significant move came amid Shiba Inu’s struggle to reclaim the $0.000025 price level during the holiday season. Data from IntoTheBlock indicates that Shiba Inu faces two key sell walls preventing it from reaching the $0.00003 range. The first resistance zone, between $0.000023 and $0.000024, involves 42,310 addresses holding 60.44 trillion SHIB. Source: IntotheBlock A larger sell wall lies between $0.000024 and $0.000030, where 208,010 addresses purchased 70.35 trillion SHIB. These walls have repeatedly hindered the token’s SHIB price recovery , resulting in pullbacks and sharp declines. Price Consolidation Signals Potential Breakout Shiba Inu price has recently entered a consolidation phase after a volatile period. The token is currently trading within a tight range of $0.00002100 to $0.00002300. Analysts view this consolidation as a potential setup for an upward breakout, especially due to the recent surge in SHIB burn rate and if the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery. SHIB/USD 4-hour price chart (source: TradingView) The token’s recent price action aligns with technical analysis suggesting it has found support at $0.00002. This level has been critical in preventing further declines, even as bearish trends persist. RSI and MACD indicators suggest that SHIB price may be regaining bullish momentum, with RSI currently at 56.81, leaning towards a neutral to slightly bullish outlook. Analyst Predicts 260% Shiba Inu Price Rally Crypto analyst Javon Marks has identified “textbook bull signals” in Shiba Inu’s price chart, suggesting a strong rally may follow. According to Marks, the token recently broke through a long-term resistance trendline and retested it as support during its recent pullback. This breakout behavior often signals the beginning of an upward trend. Marks predicts Shiba Inu price could rise to $0.000081 in the short term, representing a 260% gain from current levels. He also noted the presence of hidden bullish divergence, where price forms higher lows while momentum indicators form lower lows. This pattern indicates underlying strength in the asset. “Shiba Inu is holding above its breakout zone, which is a positive sign for potential growth,” Marks stated in his analysis. Shiba Inu price must overcome two major resistance levels to sustain a bullish rally. The first target is $0.00003, a zone where the token has faced significant selling pressure in previous attempts. If SHIB breaks through this barrier, analysts believe it could reach $0.000081, the next key resistance. Marks also identified a long-term SHIB price target of $0.000155, a price level that represents an unprecedented high for Shiba Inu. He believes this target could be achievable if market conditions improve and broader bullish trends return.

The second batch of aid supplies has been successfully shipped to the Bahamas, providing urgently needed sanitary products for 4,000 local women and effectively improving their quality of life. The “Menstrual Equity Project” aims to offer sustainable menstrual hygiene solutions to marginalized women and girls, aligning with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As the oldest multi-specialty medical organization promoting women’s advancement in the medical field and improving women’s health, AMWA’s mission is in perfect alignment with KuCoin’s commitment to social responsibility. With the support of the Office of the First Lady of Commonwealth of Bahamas H. E. Ann Marie Davis, this round of donated materials focuses on disposable menstrual pads. This decision reflects the local challenges of water scarcity and high washing costs, while also providing essential emergency supplies for women during natural disasters such as hurricanes and typhoons. Since KuCoin made a firm commitment to social welfare initiatives during the “KuCoin Green Future Gala” at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in 2023, the company has actively fulfilled its corporate social responsibilities. The “Menstrual Equity Project” has become a key initiative under this commitment. In March 2024, the project’s first phase was implemented, distributing 1,000 menstrual kits—each containing 10 sanitary pads and 2 menstrual cups—to Suriname, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and domestic violence shelters in New York and California. The smooth delivery of the second batch of supplies to the Bahamas will benefit 4,000 women. Jing Zhao Cesarone, President of Global CSR Foundation, commented: “KuCoin has set a remarkable example in addressing period poverty in underserved regions, demonstrating its enthusiasm and dedication to social responsibility.” Nancy Cheung, KuCoin’s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), emphasized: “As a global leader in the digital economy, KuCoin is committed to advancing the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on key areas such as climate change, health, and education, driving more philanthropic initiatives to fruition. We also plan to expand the scope of the ‘Menstrual Equity Project,’ collaborating with more international organizations to improve women’s living conditions and contribute to global sustainable development.” About KuCoin Founded in 2017, KuCoin is one of the pioneering and most globally recognized technology platforms supporting digital economies, built on a robust foundation of cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure, liquidity solutions, and an exceptional user experience.

The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUM2025. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 05:13:00

While the broader crypto space has faced some wobbles, meme coins have been riding a wave of popularity, proving they’re more than just a laugh—they’re a serious opportunity. The chatter around these coins has reached a fever pitch, with investors eyeing their next big move. Some are a throwback to crypto’s light-hearted beginnings, while others offer solid utility, showing meme coins aren’t just about memes anymore—they’re about making waves. Among these, BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands tall, basking in the meme coin frenzy while flaunting features that even seasoned investors can’t ignore. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game out now in its full version, a juicy offer that gives you 50% more coins using BIG50, and a solid presale tally of over $4.8 million amassed to this day, no one can ignore its potential. But it’s not alone. This listicle dives into the top trending meme coins to buy in January 2025, spotlighting BTFD, Bone ShibaSwap, Simon’s Cat, and COQ Inu. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin That’s All About Strategy Ah, the BTFD Coin—it’s not just another meme coin; it’s a whole vibe. BTFD stands for “Buy the Dip,” and that’s exactly what it encourages you to do, especially with its ongoing presale that’s captured everyone’s attention. But don’t let the cheeky name fool you—this coin packs a punch. Let’s start with its features. BTFD Coin has launched the full version of its P2E Game, which allows users to play and earn through it. Then there’s staking. Offering a whopping 90% APY, it gives investors another reason to stick around. Who wouldn’t want to earn passive income while being part of a meme coin revolution? Add in the referral programme, and you have a recipe for excitement. Share the word, and you’ll be rewarded for bringing others into the fold. Oh, and did we mention the Bulls Squad? It’s an exclusive community for early supporters—where like-minded investors gather to strategise and celebrate wins. What the 1973 Crash Teaches Us About Buying the Dip Back in 1973, the world was in chaos. The Bretton Woods system collapsed, OPEC tightened its grip, and oil prices skyrocketed. Inflation ran wild, and markets tanked nearly 50%. It was grim, no doubt about it. However, savvy investors like Warren Buffett saw carnage as a golden opportunity. They bought the dip, scooping up undervalued assets and reaping the rewards when the markets recovered. Sound familiar? The current crypto market might not be the 1970s, but the lesson remains. Dips are temporary, but opportunities are timeless. That’s why BTFD Coin is perfectly poised for today’s market, and it’s already giving you the chance to make smart investments by offering you its ongoing festive offer, which grants you 50% more tokens once you use the BIG50 code when buying $BTFD (you need to act fast before January 5th, though!). Why did this coin make it to this list? Simply put, BTFD Coin is smashing it. With over $4.8 million raised and 61 billion coins sold, it’s already surpassed half its presale journey, now in Stage 13 at $0.000142 per token. 2. Bone ShibaSwap: The Backbone of the Shiba Ecosystem Bone ShibaSwap isn’t your typical meme coin—it’s a utility powerhouse. As the governance token of the ShibaSwap ecosystem, Bone lets users have a say in the platform’s future, making it a favourite among decentralisation enthusiasts. If you’re already into Shiba Inu, adding Bone to your portfolio is a no-brainer. What sets Bone apart is its real-world functionality. It powers the ShibaSwap platform, a decentralised exchange (DEX) where users can trade, stake, and earn rewards. It’s like getting the keys to the Shiba kingdom, and who wouldn’t want that? Plus, the ecosystem is expanding, with the upcoming Shibarium blockchain promising to make Bone even more integral. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bone ShibaSwap is trending because it’s not just riding the meme wave—it’s steering it. With its unique governance features and ties to the ever-popular Shiba Inu ecosystem, it’s a coin that combines fun with functionality. 3. Simon’s Cat: The Quirky Newcomer with Serious Potential Who doesn’t love a good cat meme? Simon’s Cat taps into the internet’s endless fascination with felines but takes it a step further by blending nostalgia with crypto. Inspired by the wildly popular animated series, this coin is as playful as it gets—but don’t mistake its humour for a lack of substance. Simon’s Cat is focused on building a community-driven project where holders influence its direction. From NFTs to potential metaverse integrations, this coin aims to be more than just a meme. Imagine owning a piece of internet history while reaping the benefits of a blockchain-based economy. That’s the dream Simon’s Cat is selling, and it’s catching on fast. Why did this coin make it to this list? Simon’s Cat earns its spot for its unique blend of charm and potential. It’s not just a coin; it’s a movement for meme and crypto lovers alike, proving that sometimes, the underdog—or should we say undercat—steals the show. 4. COQ Inu: The Underdog with a Sassy Twist COQ Inu has one of those names that makes you do a double-take—and that’s exactly the point. This coin thrives on its irreverent humour, drawing in a crowd that loves a good laugh and a promising investment. But beneath the cheeky exterior lies a project with serious ambitions. Why did this coin make it to this list? COQ Inu is making waves because it knows how to stand out in a crowded market. By blending humour with innovation, it’s carving out a niche that’s impossible to ignore. If you’re tired of the same old meme coins, this one’s got the spark you’re looking for.

38415699,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53577,1735795831,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ethereum Price Analysis: Is ETH Ready To Challenge $3,500 and $4,000 After Recent Crash? This New Altcoin Aims For $1 In 2025",https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-price-analysis-is-eth-ready-to-challenge-3500-and-4000/,"After Ethereum’s massive correction that pulled back its price to the $3K psychological level, the top altcoin began a cooling-off period, sparking rising expectations for a potential bullish rebound. ETH’s price has consolidated above the critical $3K support level allowing bullish participants to re-enter the market. This renewed demand reflected in the uptick in funding rates, highlights growing confidence among market participants as they anticipate reversing the current trend. Alongside this mix, Lunex Network (LNEX) continues to pick up steam as more people discover its unique solution to some inherent DeFi challenges. Its innovative DeFi ideas and successful presale have drawn considerable interest from investors. With a growing user base and system designed to offer real passive income, Lunex could become a strong contender, following in the footsteps of existing giants like Ethereum. Lunex Network (LNEX): Enhances DeFi Trading With its superior interoperability allowing seamless transactions for more than 50,000 crypto assets across isolated blockchains, Lunex Network ( LNEX )has enhanced the DeFi trading experience like never before. The project has appealed to privacy-focus traders as it has eliminated tedious KYC verification requirements and third-party connectivity, thereby eliminating data breaches and barriers to entry. Moreover, the Lunex ecosystem offers advanced asset management tools, creative portfolio-maximizing capabilities, and multi-currency staking choices. This all-encompassing strategy ensures the platform not only satisfies the needs of today’s traders but also opens the door for a more linked and effective DeFi future. The buzz around Lunex is evident, attributed to its expanding community and successful presale. It has demonstrated robust investor confidence and demand, having already raised over $5.6 million after selling more than 2.3 billion tokens. Early adopters who entered at $0.0012 have already recorded an over 333% return. Investors now have a rare chance to participate in the Lunex Network presale with the LNEX token priced at just $0.0052. Can ETH Price Reclaim The $3,500 Level? Ethereum’s price action has witnessed increased volatility after it failed to breach the $4,050 resistance level. This pushed the price of Ethereum below the $3,500 threshold and ultimately found strong support at the $3,000 psychological level. This level is crucial in determining the ETH coin’s next move due to the confluence of demand. Moreover, the $3,000 level aligns with the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. Notably, the ETH price has formed a golden cross , with the 100-day MA crossing above the 200-day MA. This indicates a potential shift in market sentiment. However, the ETH token has been confined below the $3,500 resistance level. A breakout from this zone could catalyze a new upward trend and set the stage for a renewed rally. Meanwhile, ETH crypto has declined from its ascending price channel from the 4-hour time frame, which culminated in a test of the $3K zone. This region aligns with the 0.5 Fib retracement at $3,200 and 0.618 Fib retracement at $3,000 levels, indicating a robust support line. Overall, ETH price action suggests a potential buildup of buying interest, which means that Ethereum is likely to embark on a fresh bullish surge, reclaiming the $3,500 resistance level. Lunex Network Attracts Ethereum Investors Ethereum (ETH) continues to excite investors with its massive potential for a breakout and long-term recovery. However, investors seeking the next big thing in the crypto landscape are shifting their attention to Lunex Network. With an unmatched low entry price point at the presale, Lunex is expected to record a 50x rally in Q1 2025. Meanwhile, the presale tokens are selling out fast since the token supply is limited.

In a tweet, he stated, “Nothing has changed at all with my $XRP thoughts, in fact, $XRP looks amazing. We are just ranging after a 465% move upwards. The oscillators have cooled off, we are just awaiting the next leg to the upside.” $XRP . Nothing has changed at all with my $XRP thoughts, in fact $XRP looks amazing. We are just ranging after a 465% move upwards. The oscillators have cooled off, we are just awaiting the next leg to the upside. pic.twitter.com/Kjv5uq7b4Q — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) December 31, 2024 The analyst’s perspective suggests that XRP’s current consolidation phase is a normal part of the market cycle after its significant upward movement. With technical indicators stabilizing, Cryptoinsightuk believes XRP is preparing for another potential rally. Diverging Opinions on XRP’s Market Dynamics While Cryptoinsightuk remains optimistic, skepticism persists among some market participants. An X user, Arthur Klucznik, commented , “Shit is dropping like a rock. Now wait until Ripple dumps their monthly pile of shit tomorrow.” This remark references the periodic sale of XRP from Ripple’s escrow , a practice some critics argue could create downward pressure on the asset’s price. Despite such concerns, XRP supporters maintain that the broader technical and market trends favor a bullish outcome. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Indicators Signal Potential Upside Adding to Cryptoinsightuk’s analysis, analyst Egrag highlighted the significance of the Williams Alligator Indicator. This tool uses three moving averages—Jaw, Teeth, and Lips—to evaluate market trends. Egrag noted that XRP’s current alignment supports a bullish trajectory, provided the asset remains above the $2 equilibrium zone. Egrag also identified two notable “Break of Structure” (BOS) moments in XRP’s price history. The first occurred in early 2018 when XRP reached its all-time high of over $3.80. The second, in 2021, failed to break the previous record. Egrag now sees a new BOS forming as XRP maintains its position above $2, signaling a potential uptrend continuation. Historical Patterns Bolster Optimism Historical comparisons further reinforce the bullish outlook. The last time the Williams Alligator Indicator displayed a similar alignment was in late 2017, preceding XRP’s surge to its all-time high. XRP could be poised for another significant rally if the current alignment follows a similar trajectory. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $2.09, reflecting a 0.54% increase over the past 24 hours. As the market awaits the next decisive move, analysts like Cryptoinsightuk and Egrag emphasize the asset’s technical strength and potential for further gains.

Today’s XRP price surge to $2.42 comes along with a 120% surge in the daily trading volume reaching over $10 billion showing strong bullish momentum. The surge comes as the bulls defended the $2.0 support following the recent crypto market correction. Popular analysts predict a surge to $13 and beyond. Furthermore, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has hinted at working on real-world utility as we head into 2025. Where Is XRP Price Heading Next? With Ripple bulls stepping in, the XRP price daily close above $2.12 confirms that the bullish action remains intact for the Ripple cryptocurrency. Crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto has identified critical resistance levels to monitor in the coming sessions: $2.60, $2.65 and $2.75. Breaking through these thresholds could pave the way for higher price targets, potentially signaling a bullish breakout above $3. Additionally, the XRP whale activity could support the broader momentum. Source: EGRAG Crypto Moving into 2025, market analysts remain bullish on the Ripple cryptocurrency predicting double-digit price targets and new all-time highs above $10. With the expectation that the XRP lawsuit will end soon , analysts are overly bullish for the altcoin based on its technical setup. On a multi-year chart, XRP price is eyeing a breakout from the flag-and-pole pattern. Crypto analyst Tony has highlighted a potential bull flag pattern in XRP, suggesting a target of $13 if the formation holds true. While acknowledging that this level exceeds his primary targets, Tony noted that such a move, though ambitious, is not entirely impossible in a strong bullish scenario.

Garanti BBVA Kripto, a crypto custody platform operated by Garanti BBVA — Turkey’s fifth largest bank, which as of December 2023 was almost 86% owned by BBVA — will soon be providing crypto trading services to the general public. Bit2Me, a crypto exchange founded in Spain in 2014, will be used as the bank’s trading execution center. And now that the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is in full effect across the European Union, the partnership between BBVA and the crypto exchange is a strong signal of more things are brewing on the horizon, according to Abel Peña, Bit2Me’s chief sales officer. “I believe in 2025 we are going to see so many banks across Europe offering crypto spot trading to their users,” Peña told CoinDesk. “We are in very close contact with more than 50 financial institutions, with banks all across Europe and internationally, and they will start launching their services in the first quarter of 2025.” BBVA held $857 billion in assets in 2023, making it the 43rd largest bank in the world at the time, and the second biggest in Spain after Banco Santander. While Garanti BBVA Kripto has already been advertising crypto trading services on its website since January 2024, the product was only offered as a pilot and wasn’t available for the general public, according to Bit2Me. BBVA began embracing the crypto industry in Turkey because the regulatory environment allowed it to move earlier, Peña said. Since MiCA finished rolling out on Dec. 30, financial institutions such as BBVA will now be able to secure approval from domestic regulators and offer exposure to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies to their European customers. “As soon as they have the green light, they will start,” Peña said. “This is from the knowledge that many of them are already integrated with us,” he added, though he declined to disclose the names of the institutions. But why is the banking sector suddenly so enthusiastic about crypto? The regulatory certainty provided by MiCA played a part, Peña said, but U.S. President-elect Donald Trump — who became a vocal crypto supporter in the middle of his campaign, and won big in November — was also a factor. Not to mention the various ideas floating around to get the U.S. government to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The tremendous success of the U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which have raked in a record $35 billion in inflows in less than a year, certainly didn’t hurt either. “We’re talking about an asset [bitcoin] that many users and companies want to gain exposure to. This is something that banks cannot deny anymore,” Peña said. BBVA isn’t the first European bank to dip its toes into crypto. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest multinational investment bank, is building a rollup on Ethereum using ZKsync technology and has been working on crypto custody and tokenization services with Swiss start-up Taurus since 2023, among other things. French financial services company Société Générale, for its part, has its own crypto arm, called SG-FORGE, which recently announced it will deploy its own euro stablecoin to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) network.",Finance,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-02 06:00:00

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 06:02:00

By integrating its infrastructure with Crymbo’s novel unification layer for digital asset compliance, Singularity Finance makes it possible for trading counterparties to share fragmented on- and off-chain transaction data in a secure and trust-minimized way, ensuring adherence with key financial regulations like the FATF Travel Rule . Singularity Finance was created by a merger between SingularityDAO, Cogito Finance and SelfKey, and has built a Layer-2 network for tokenizing assets within the AI economy, including the graphics processing units that power large language models. SingularityDAO provides the necessary financial management expertise, while Cogito handles the actual tokenization process, and SelfKey ensures privacy, compliance and security through its decentralized identity technology. In tokenizing GPUs and other essential AI assets, such as data, Singularity Finance is making the AI economy more liquid and accessible, so that anyone can invest in it. But despite making the AI industry more accessible, compliance still causes headaches for many organizations, preventing their participation. Crymbo has created a decentralized oracle for on- and off-chain compliance data that anyone can validate in real time. It allows tokenized assets to demonstrate full compliance in an immediate, privacy-preserving way. The oracle is designed to enable the secure and seamless transfer of information. All data exchanged between users is encrypted. Only the sender and receiver have access to the data, not even Crymbo itself can view the information. The ability to streamline compliance will go a long way towards speeding up adoption of tokenized RWAs. Because they now have an easy way to prove compliance, it makes RWAs more palatable to financial institutions that must adhere to strict global regulations. Many RWAs require KYC and AML processes to support regulatory compliance, which Crymbo manages for clients while also adhering to privacy standards through its encryption feature. For instance, the FATF Travel Rule is noted as a critical compliance standard created by the Financial Action Task Force, which is a global body that establishes guidelines around anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism rules. The integration eliminates the need for numerous cumbersome processes that were previously required to validate compliance. Traditionally, enterprises would have to connect to multiple technology platforms and send and respond to regular emails in order to demonstrate that everything is above board. But with Crymbo’s oracle, users can leverage the Oracle Explorer to access transaction information, and if both parties are already connected to the oracle, the required information is exchanged automatically, eliminating manual effort and ensuring efficiency. “With Crymbo Oracle, achieving compliance becomes effortless,” a spokesman from Singularity Finance said. “Moreover, it is an upgradeable solution that’s designed to adapt seamlessly as regulations evolve, ensuring your business stays ahead of the curve.”",Information,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-02 06:04:23

Some suggested he may have intended it as a joke, while others hinted at possible hidden meanings to the change. However, Musk has yet to give a direct explanation about his profile alterations. The term ‘Kekius’ appears to have been coined from the Latin “Kek,” which connotes laughter. Moreover, ‘Kek’ is said to be an ancient Egyptian god of darkness with a frog’s head. ‘Maximus’ is related to the character played by Russell Crow in the movie Gladiator, Maximus Decimus Meridius. Musk’s X name update caused the KEKIUS token to pump Soon after Musk updated his profile name, the value of the memecoin Kekius Maximus shot up. As of Tuesday evening, the memecoin’s value had surged by more than 900%; however, at the time, it was not immediately clear if Musk’s move had caused the price rise. However, the KEKIUS whale ‘0x820168e15ec0c16cd757257399519429eb2b31cc’ began selling his assets, triggering a 60% drop in the token’s prices in just one hour.

Such a significant milestone would likely have reverberating effects throughout the market, impacting leading coins like Cardano (ADA) and new players such as Yeti Ouro (YETIO). Its unique gaming and utility-focused ecosystem provides Yeti Ouro a prime opportunity to ride the market momentum wave and garner the attention of gamers and investors alike. Yeti Ouro excited its community some more by announcing a 25% bonus on every purchase made from December 31 to January 2, furnishing investors with an ideal opportunity to get tokens at a discounted rate. Yeti Ouro : A Rising Star In The Crypto Universe If BTC price hits $500K, imagine the capital flow into the greater crypto space, which will only push Yeti Ouro up. With established investment firms branching out into projected growth prospects, Yeti Ouro’s rare identity as a gaming utility token puts it in the running for a significant amount of newfound interest. Ecosystem And Tokenomics YETIO: The backbone of the Yeti Ouro ecosystem, enabling in-game Transactions, staking mechanisms and a vibrant marketplace. Token-burning mechanisms are integrated into the gaming ecosystem to guarantee long-term value appreciation, making the game a fascinating project for both gamers and crypto investors. This time of year is even more appealing to question marks with the 25% New Year bonus. Community Engagement The community-driven roar of Yeti Ouro is palpable, seen in meme contests and referral campaigns that engender a loyal user base. With the presale already providing significant ROI to early investors, the project is set up for sustained success. Cardano Price Prediction: A Blockchain With Grand With its scientifically informed approach, Cardano still has its share of developer fans and investor followers. Focusing on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability has made the platform one of the leaders in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). 7-day ADA price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Impact of Bitcoin’s Ascent If Bitcoin climbed to $500K, adoption could come to Cardano in droves as more projects aim to build dApps that require reliable and scalable solutions. But ADA price appreciation may still struggle as competition from newer, speedier ecosystems such as Yeti Ouro’s in vision. Despite strong fundamentals, Cardano has often been criticised for the lack of development progress compared to its competitors. Such a scenario allows space for nimble, new projects like Yeti Ouro to get noticed by investors looking for faster return on investment (ROI) and new, unique opportunities. Bitcoin News: The Market King Bitcoin would reach 500K, which would be historical for the crypto market. BTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is a bellwether for the entire industry, influencing sentiment and liquidity across other coins. 7-day Bitcoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap When BTC price pumps, it’s generalised around the blue chips as more capital gets pointlessly rotated around the good, money. However, since it’s solely “store of value” and not utility-driven like tokens such as Yeti Ouro, it opens up the space for opportunity. Thus, yield-hungry investors will consider projects offering something beyond speculative price action. Why Yeti Ouro Stands Out While Bitcoin could skyrocket to $500K, Yeti Ouro stands as a one-of-a-kind investment opportunity. The combination of its unique P2E gaming model with solid tokenomics and a community-driven approach presents a strong case for growth. With the crypto market preparing for a bullish cycle, Yeti Ouro is primed to offer life-changing returns to its investment. So, in the spirit of the 25% New Year bonus, making what will surely be an attractive entry point, take a trip down with Yeti Ouro. Whether you are a gamer, an investor, or both, this project will change the game in the crypto and gaming space.

RTX, PEPE or RENDER appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Some investors are wondering if a $100 investment can turn into a shocking $100,000 in 2025. Three top crypto coins—Pepe (PEPE), Render (RENDER) and Remittix (RTX) —are grabbing the attention of investors with their special promise. These altcoins offer something remarkable, from blockchain-driven financial innovation to memecoin comebacks. Which one, though, has the bullish potential to yield massive rewards this 2025? Read on to find out why analysts are very bullish on these 3 altcoins, especially RTX. Pepe (PEPE) Displays Bullish Momentum After the Pepe coin first sank to the $0.000017 support zone, the price has seen a noteworthy 10% rise over the past week, indicating a strong comeback. After this decline, the Pepe price had a surge in bullish pressure that sent it back over the $0.000019 resistance level. The Pepe price chart shows that the meme coin has plummeted by almost 6% in the past month, even with this recent comeback. With holders excitedly expecting a possible rally to the coin’s all-time high (ATH) of $0.000028 in Q1 2025, the Pepe (PEPE) community’s general attitude is still quite hopeful, nonetheless. The Pepe coin has a bright future based on technical indicators including MACD displaying purchase signs and the Momentum Oscillator. Pepe (PEPE) is still among the top altcoins to keep an eye on, although right now the Pepe price is roughly 30% away from its ATH. Render (RENDER) Is Set for a Potential Breakout Over the past week, the Render price has dropped more than 10% , following a bearish pattern distinguished by a succession of lower highs and lows. Reflecting the general bearish momentum , the Render price chart shows that the altcoin has declined by more than 22% over the past month according to CoinMarketCap statistics. Notwithstanding these losses, some analysts see a possible comeback; one X user speculates that the Render price could rise by 100% in January . Although these forecasts are speculative, the Render price chart shows encouraging indications of a bullish reversal. Usually connected with price recovery, the yearly Render price chart shows a double bottom pattern formation. Key indicators such as the MACD and Momentum Oscillator also show buy signs, implying that Render is one of the promising altcoins to watch for a near future breakout. Remittix (RTX) Is Enhancing Financial Inclusion By bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and conventional financial institutions, Remittix is poised to transform the worldwide remittance industry. The demand for quicker, more reasonably priced solutions is at an all-time high given over $750 billion in yearly remittances and growing use of digital payment systems. Meanwhile, Remittix meets this demand by allowing users to convert over forty different cryptocurrencies to FIAT straight to any bank account anywhere in the world. Remittix provides unmatched speed, security, and simplicity by using blockchain technology and local payment networks, therefore enabling more reasonably priced cross-border transactions. Furthermore, Remittix is unique mostly in its dedication to reducing transaction expenses and streamlining the process. Remittix guarantees that the recipient gets exactly the amount transferred by flat rates and no hidden charges for foreign currency or wire transfers, so ensuring that users may send money at a fraction of the cost compared to conventional banks. Unaware that the payment started from cryptocurrency, the recipient also gets a flawless experience getting money as a standard bank transfer. Priced at only $0.0167 during its presale, the native RTX coin has attracted a lot of interest with over 56 million tokens sold in only a few days, generating almost $900,000 in revenue. RTX, PEPE, or RENDER: The Altcoin Bet for 2025? Pepe (PEPE) and Render (RENDER) exhibit interesting prospects with their optimistic patterns; nevertheless, Remittix (RTX) closes the distance between crypto and fiat like no other. Its emphasis on minimal fees, easy transactions, and financial inclusion distinguishes it from other crypto projects. RTX is positioned to turn little investments into significant returns with an attractive presale price of just $0.0167 and significant early investor interest. Moreover, the presale tokens are fast selling out as a result of huge demand for the limited supply.

Among their top picks are Solana (SOL), Lightchain AI , Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH). Each of these projects offers unique strengths, from scalability to innovation, making them stand out as potential leaders in the upcoming bull market. Solana (SOL) Scalability That Drives Adoption Solana is causing big changes in the blockchain area, and its key tool is growth. By mixing Proof of History (PoH) with Proof of Stake (͏PoS), Solana gives quick speeds, handling many deals each second with small costs. It’s no surprise that builders are rushing to create decentralized apps (dApps) and DeFi answers on the platform. With a rising system, new tools, and a love for change, Solana has put itself as a main spot for blockchain fans. But its not all easy—problems like network breaks and central worries still bring doubt. Fixing these troubles will be key to making lasting growth and trust in the group. Even with the bumps, Solana’s strong aim for growth makes it a top player in blockchain tech helping to form the future of use and new ideas Lightchain AI AI-Blockchain Fusion Attracting Whales Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to transform industries, and by combining AI with blockchain, this token is positioned to tap into two fast-growing markets. With rising demand for AI solutions, the token benefits from AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain automation. Features like AIVM and PoI create opportunities in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) and AI governance. A clear roadmap, including the mainnet launch and AI-driven dApp rollouts, highlights the project’s focus on growth. A growing community of investors is also building momentum, and as awareness of its innovation spreads, broader adoption is expected. Ripple (XRP) And Ethereum (ETH) Timeless Giants Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) are prominent cryptocurrencies, each serving distinct purposes within the blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum, introduced in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), positioning itself as a pioneer in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Conversely, Ripple, launched in 2012 by Ripple Labs, focuses on facilitating fast and cost-effective cross-border payments. It aims to revolutionize international money transfers by partnering with financial institutions. While Ethereum’s versatility has led to widespread adoption in various sectors. Ripple’s emphasis on efficient global transactions has garnered significant attention from banks and payment providers. Both cryptocurrencies have significantly influenced the digital finance landscape, each addressing unique challenges and opportunities. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-02 06:32:59

With this scalable and efficient architecture, TON is positioned as a blockchain of blockchains, capable of managing almost unlimited ultra-fast transactions. TON’s sophisticated design ensures it remains a pillar of the developing blockchain scene, even at $5.95 as of writing. TON’s multi-level capabilities could propel institutional interest in cryptocurrencies to unprecedented levels as post-XRP ETF clearance speeds forward. VeChain (VET): real-world blockchain applications VeChain Thor (VET) is a pioneering IoT and blockchain platform to address enterprise-level data problems. Due to its two-token approach, which uses VET as a store of value and VTHO for gas taxes, companies are encouraged to adopt it. VeChain’s enterprise-grade solutions in sustainability, healthcare, and logistics make blockchain a significant factor in its adoption. As of writing, its live price is $0.05. The predicted flood of institutional investor money could see VeChain’s market cap skyrocket in 2025 and utility soar. Kaspa (KAS): the future of proof-of-work Using the GHOSTDAG technique, Kaspa is a proof-of-work (PoW) Bitcoin that allows blocks generated in parallel to coexist instead of becoming orphans. Thus, Kaspa can handle near-instant confirmations and significant block rates. As of this writing, Kaspa’s blockDAG technology has significantly improved over conventional blockchains at $0.11. As the crypto ecosystem develops in 2025, it is a strong candidate for expansion since it can scale safely while preserving excellent throughput. The introduction of XRP ETFs in 2025 will likely bring about a significant transformation in the cryptocurrency market. Thanks to their creative technologies and robust business cases, tokens like Rexas Finance, Sui, Toncoin, VeChain, and Kaspa are positioned to profit from this momentum. Investors should watch these projects since their potential value could make them among the most-performing assets in the next few years.

Investors reacted to private survey data showing factory activity in China grew less than expected in December, mirroring an official figure due earlier this week. Japan ( NKY:IND ) market closed. The Japanese yen remained largely unchanged around 157 per dollar on Thursday, amid thin trading volumes as Japan observed the holiday season. China ( SHCOMP ) fell -2.48% on Thursday in post-holiday trading, with the Shanghai Composite falling 1% to around 3,320 and the Shenzhen Component shedding 1.3% to 10,280 as investors reacted to disappointing factory activity data, and the offshore yuan held steady at around 7.30 per dollar, as investors returned from New Year’s holidays. A private survey revealed slower growth in China’s manufacturing sector in December, missing expectations for faster expansion. In response, Chinese authorities announced plans to issue a record 3 trillion yuan ($411 billion) in special treasury bonds in 2025. Meanwhile, traders also took note of President Xi Jinping’s New Year’s address on Tuesday, where he projected China’s 2024 GDP to surpass 130 trillion yuan and outlined plans for more proactive growth policies in 2025. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell -2.18% to 19,695 on the first trading day in 2025 following a muted activity in the prior session amid steep losses in all sectors. India ( SENSEX ) rose +0.87% to 79,145 in early deals on Thursday, marking the second consecutive session of gains and hitting a two-week high, mainly supported by rises in the auto, tech, and financial services sectors. The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI dropped to 56.4 in December 2024, down from 56.5 in November, and revised lower from an initial estimate of 57.4. Australia ( AS51 ) rose +0.52% rose 0.52% to close at 8,201 on Thursday, kicking off the year with a modest gain as mining and energy stocks benefited from stronger commodity prices. The Australian dollar surged above $0.62 on Thursday, recovering from two-year lows. The Judo Bank Australia Manufacturing PMI fell to 47.8 in December 2024 , down from 49.4 in November, according to final data. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s Index of Commodity Prices dropped 10.7% year-on-year in December, easing slightly from a downwardly revised 10.8% decline in November. The benchmark KOSPI traded nearly flat at around 2,400 points early Thursday, as investors returned from New Year’s holidays. The South Korean won rose around 1,470 per dollar, reversing losses from the previous session but remained near 16-year lows. Investors now assessed the Bank of Korea's monetary policy outlook after Governor Rhee Chang-yong emphasized the need for flexibility and agility in a New Year’s address on Thursday, citing rising political and economic uncertainties. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended in red with the S&P 500 down 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite falling 0.1%, and the Dow shedding 30 points.

Moreover, it is also the first AI token on Solana to hit a $2 billion market cap as the AI agents narrative picks up steam moving into 2025. Reports suggest that whales have accumulated nearly $25 million of the tokens recently. Solana Meme Coin ai16z Price Rally Steals the Limelight Amid hitting fresh milestones, the ai16z price rally has extended more than 200% on the weekly chart moving all the way to $2.41. With more than 600% monthly gains, it is among the top AI-based meme coins that analysts look forward to moving into 2025. As per the Coinglass data , today’s price rally for the crypto comes with a 147% surge in open interest moving all the way to $63 million. Additionally, the daily trading volume is also up by 40% to more than $260 million. The ai16z price pump from less than $1 to $2.4 has come in less than seven amid huge whale accumulation for the Solana AI coin. Blockchain data from SOL Scan highlights strong whale activity surrounding the altcoin. Whale wallet wVbrpF…BYuA withdrew 1.86 million coins, (valued at $3.95 million) from Gate.io just four hours ago. This wallet now holds a total of 10.21 million of the crypto , amounting to $22.86 million. A new wallet, CoErvN…8DiS , was created 22 hours ago and has already withdrawn 9,317 SOL ($1.77 million). These funds were used to purchase 955,500 tokens. The surge in whale activity underscores the growing interest in the AI coin, with substantial investments signaling strong confidence in the token’s future prospects. Developers behind the project are now focused on overhauling its tokenomics and launching a dedicated Layer 1 network akin to Pump.fun. These planned changes to the tokenomics could significantly influence ai16z’s price, alongside broader impacts on related cryptocurrencies within the space. This AI coin is the first venture capital DAO driven by AI agents. Spearheaded by the AI agent @pmairca, the project harnesses artificial intelligence and collective intelligence to optimize investment decision-making AI Agents Narrative Picking Up Fast Crypto market analysts believe that moving into 2025, the AI agents narrative will dominate the market. Notably, VIRTUAL , a leading AI-related cryptocurrency, experienced a remarkable price surge in 2024, solidifying its position as one of the sector’s top performers. Similarly, ai16z , also contributed to this sector with strong gains. AI-driven infrastructure projects made significant strides as the year began. VIRTUAL reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $5.06, climbing to rank 31 by market capitalization. On the other hand, ai16z price achieved an ATH of $2.42 following a remarkable 192% price surge over the past seven days, reported Coingeckco. Solana meme coins were on a roll last year in 2024 driving a large part of the overall ecosystem activity.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 06:40:26

Speaking to CNBC, Alexander expressed confidence in Bitcoin's continued growth but warned that the high leverage in crypto trading would contribute to significant price swings. “I am more bullish than ever for 2025,” Alexander said, adding that Bitcoin could “easily reach $200,000” by the end of next year. Alexander also predicted that Bitcoin would trade around $150,000 by the summer of 2025, with a potential range of plus or minus $50,000 due to ongoing volatility. Despite his optimistic outlook, Alexander clarified that he does not own Bitcoin. Related News: CEO of Giant Cryptocurrency Company Reveals the Level He Thinks Bitcoin Price Will Hit in 2025 Alexander attributed his bullish stance to the expected regulatory clarity in the US, which he believes will provide significant support to Bitcoin. However, he warned that the absence of stricter regulation on crypto exchanges will continue to increase volatility in the market. The high leverage on crypto trading platforms in particular is expected to cause sharp price swings, with trades amplifying both upward and downward movements in Bitcoin’s value. Alexander has previously demonstrated his ability to accurately predict Bitcoin’s price movements. In 2023, he predicted that Bitcoin would reach $100,000 in 2024. While Alexander’s price targets are optimistic, he noted the ongoing volatility problem in the cryptocurrency market. “There are no signs that volatility is abating,” he said, signaling that investors should be prepared for unpredictable price swings even as Bitcoin’s value rises. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, he updated his profile name to “Kekius Maximus” and changed his avatar to an image of Pepe the Frog, a popular meme often associated with internet subcultures, dressed as a Roman soldier. This seemingly playful move triggered a dramatic surge in the value of a meme-based cryptocurrency named Kekius Maximus, with reports of its value skyrocketing by as much as 800% within 24 hours. The phenomenon is reminiscent of Musk’s previous impact on Dogecoin, where his tweets and endorsements transformed the joke cryptocurrency into a global sensation, driving its price to historic highs. Musk’s ability to amplify internet memes into financial instruments underscores the power of his social media presence but also raises serious questions about market volatility, the sustainability of such trends, and potential concerns over market manipulation. As Musk continues to blend meme culture with financial markets, his actions highlight the unpredictable intersection of social media, technology, and cryptocurrency. Elon Musk’s recent switch to a frog-themed X profile picture has reignited speculation about his influence on cryptocurrency markets, sparking meme coin surges almost instantly. Rumors abound that Musk’s “binary 0 1 code” reference to “Kekius Maximus” might indirectly point to Pepeto, the God of Frogs. As a project with a narrative and value deeply rooted in frog-themed cryptocurrency culture, Pepeto aligns perfectly with the growing interest Musk seems to spotlight. This move underscores the unparalleled power of social media to drive market trends, blending meme culture with financial speculation and fueling excitement around Pepeto’s potential.

This announcement serves Pepeto’s New Year’s gift to its devoted community. With Tier 1 exchanges already showing interest in listing Pepeto during its presale, the project’s momentum is undeniable. The message encourages the community to share and engage, ensuring the God of Frogs’ influence grows even further.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the crypto market gears up for the 2025 altcoin season, analysts are spotlighting Ripple, Hedera, and Rollblock as top contenders. Table of Contents Rollblock: Transforming the $450b gambling industry Is Ripple breaking the $5 resistance level in 2025? Hedera could become the dark horse of 2025 Is RBLK the best token for 2025? Donald Trump’s presidency ignited a surge in the crypto market, with numerous altcoins reaching new all-time highs. However, the market has since cooled off, preparing for the 2025 altcoin season. Among the many promising cryptocurrencies, analysts are highlighting Ripple, Hedera, and Rollblock as options investors should watch. Here’s why. Rollblock: Transforming the $450b gambling industry Rollblock is poised to be one of the best-performing crypto assets in 2025 due to its innovation in the GambleFi niche. The project combines the traditional iGaming approach with new blockchain technologies to disrupt the traditional casino industry. The GambleFi protocol has already proven itself as a big player in the field, with more than $1.3 million in wagers placed in December alone. A fully licensed and operational platform Rollblock is a fully licensed online gambling provider with over 7,000 casino games, including blackjack, roulette, slots, and poker. All these games are offered under a license issued by Gaming Anjouan. In addition to its license, Rollblock offers a top-notch AI-powered security system and advanced encryption technology, protecting both players and investors. RBLK: Fueling Rollblock’s ecosystem At the heart of Rollblock’s ecosystem is RBLK, the native and utility token. Currently, in its ninth presale stage, analysts forecast a potential 100x return once RBLK hits the market. Each week, up to 30% of Rollblock’s revenue is directed towards buying RBLK from the open market. From that sum, 60% of the tokens are burned to create a deficit of supply on the market. The rest is used for staking rewards. This mechanism makes RBLK deflationary, setting the project up for long-term success.

Ripple has dropped 30% from its December 3 peak of $2.90 but has had a 4% rise in the last 24 hours. The increase follows a stronger U.S. dollar. XRP’s trading volume reached $4.5 billion, highlighting significant selling pressure, with $173 million in liquidations, including $7 million in Ripple longs. The broader market downturn saw Bitcoin fall 12.6% this week to $93,700 and Ethereum drop 15.5% to $3,337. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) surged to 108.5, adding pressure on dollar-denominated assets like Ripple. Ripple is now testing key support levels at $2.0–$1.96, with resistance at $2.5. A breakout above this level could lead to a sharp rise to $4–$5. With an RSI of 57.23, the market is neutral but ripe for a short-term rebound. Analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s future. With legal issues potentially behind it and growing institutional adoption, Ripple is expected to hit $5 by late 2025, with even more upside if market sentiment improves. Hedera could become the dark horse of 2025 Currently trading at $0.2924, Hedera has surged 13% in the past 30 days, reflecting strong market interest. Analysts are predicting a target of $1.00, with a potential for $5.00 by late 2025, driven by increasing institutional support and the possibility of ETF approval. Hedera’s technical indicators show a strengthening uptrend, with a neutral RSI at 47. Analysts foresee resistance at $0.31 and $0.37, with key support at $0.27. Given the ongoing growth, successful ETF rumors and potential for further partnerships, Hedera is well-positioned for significant price appreciation. As adoption accelerates, Hedera could see a strong rally, reaching $5 by 2025 as more institutions and sectors integrate Hedera’s cutting-edge solutions. Is RBLK the best token for 2025? While cryptocurrencies like Hedera and Ripple have already delivered strong results in 2024, 2025 may belong to Rollblock. Unlike many tokens, Rollblock offers more than just capital gains, it allows investors to tap directly into the $750 billion gambling market through a staking mechanism. With RBLK tokens priced at just $0.044, now is the time to take advantage of this opportunity before prices rise in the coming weeks. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and socials.

Blue chip tokens like XRP and ADA have been predicted to give good returns. AI and meme coins will also turn bullish in 2025. The crypto market has entered 2025 with optimism, fueled by predictions of a potential bull market under President-elect Donald Trump. Known for his pro-crypto stance during campaign speeches, Trump’s administration has raised expectations of favorable regulatory changes and policies. A recent ThinkingCrypto podcast , hosted by Tony Edward, highlighted that the Federal Reserve might resume Quantitative Easing (QE) and continue cutting interest rates. These developments could boost Bitcoin (BTC), making it more appealing to investors as liquidity rises globally. Bitcoin’s Record Highs Under Pro-Crypto Policies Last year, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,000 following Trump’s election.

This release, totaling over $1 billion in value, highlights the ongoing strategy Ripple has in place to distribute XRP over time. However, this massive release was accompanied with a memo which read, “January 20th is around the corner. Donald Trump will be in the WH, and we are going to make crypto great again!” The upcoming inauguration could provide a catalyst for further price action, potentially leading to a strong rally. XRP Price Reacts: The price of XRP has already seen an 11% surge, with a positive Buy signal on the indicators, suggesting that the bullish trend will continue throughout the month. The overall market is also showing signs of recovery, adding to the optimism surrounding XRP. XRP is currently trading at $2.35 and is now aiming to hit the $2.50 mark. While December is often a time of market corrections, January and beyond look much more promising for XRP and other cryptocurrencies. The market saw rapid fluctuations, with major coins like Bitcoin and XRP experiencing sharp pumps and sudden drops, but now that we’ve entered January, the outlook is bullish. A key factor is the expected regulatory changes for crypto, with President Trump’s administration likely to introduce crypto-friendly policies. The launch of several altcoin ETFs—including for XRP—could fuel massive market growth in the coming months.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-02 07:02:24

XLM has surged 28% on the day, hitting an intraday high of $0.456 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session. Stellar spiked to over $0.60 in late November, but it still remains down 50% from its 2018 all-time high.

Bitcoin Consolidation Continues Bitcoin has made just 1.3% over the past day to top $95,000 during Thursday morning trading.

This move comes as part of its ongoing bankruptcy process, where Celsius seeks to recover significant funds while dealing with past missteps. The Claims Against FTX Celsius originally sought $2 billion, blaming FTX for making false statements that allegedly worsened its financial problems. Later, the claim was revised to $444 million, focusing on “preferential transfers” arguing that certain transactions unfairly benefited specific creditors. Celsius filed a Notice of Appeal against Judge Dorsey's ruling for FTX debtor Elected for Appeal to be heard in the District Court Facts 1) Celsius Filed a $2bn claim for disparagement before the bar date 2) Celsius filed a $444m amended claim for a preference claim after bar… pic.twitter.com/evaBzMi5Lt — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) January 1, 2025 In December, Judge John Dorsey dismissed both claims in December, saying Celsius failed to provide enough proof. He also criticized the company for improperly filing changes to its claims in July 2024 without seeking permission. The court ruled these changes were unrelated to the original claims and would disrupt FTX’s restructuring. Paying Back Creditors Despite legal challenges, Celsius has worked to repay its creditors. In August, it returned $2.53 billion to over 250,000 creditors, covering around two-thirds of the claims. In November, it announced another $127 million payout from its recovery funds. These efforts briefly boosted the value of Celsius’s native token (CEL), which surged 350% to $0.56 in September. However, the price dropped to $0.1960 . Legal Troubles for the Founder Adding to Celsius’s challenges, its founder, Alex Mashinsky, pleaded guilty last month to fraud and manipulation of the CEL token. He faces a potential 20-year prison sentence, with sentencing scheduled for April 2025. What’s Next for Celsius? Celsius’s appeal aims to overturn the court’s dismissal of its claims against FTX. While it continues to navigate bankruptcy proceedings, the case highlights the risks and complexities in the crypto industry.

Between July 25 and December 31, 2024, the company purchased 78.2 Bitcoin at an average price of $80,960 per unit, totaling $6.3 million. In order to fund this purchase, Yuxing has to sell 6.3 million USDT at an average price of $1 per unit. The USDT proceeds were directly converted into Bitcoin, which shows how confident the firm is in crypto assets. Bitcoin is slightly out of focus from its last $100K mark and currently trading around $95K, though the market is bullish that it will get an upward boost this year with industry support.

According to him it is a strategic move to bring financial stability to the country and will reduce dependency on traditional assets. Jiexhuang highlighted the importance of leveraging Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework to explore innovative financial strategies. He claimed that if major economies in the world start adding Bitcoin to their reserves, its value will stabilize, encouraging other countries to follow suit. Hence as an outcome, it will actually drop the value of traditional assets, impacting government reserves tied to those assets. Institutions are betting big on Bitcoin as it soars! Read Bitcoin price prediction to see how the bullish market could push it to new heights! Efforts to Enhance Crypto Infrastructure To stay ahead in the crypto game, The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) launched a Virtual Asset Index Series earlier this year. This index will provide a reliable price benchmark that will be set for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pricing in Asia, to address the global price fluctuations. Moreover, Hong Kong regulators are also about to finalize licensing for several crypto exchanges , including Crypto.com which shows the region’s commitment to become the fintech crypto hub in the world. Crypto is slow at the moment in Hong Kong due to regulations and licensing issues with crypto exchanges yet investors are confident that Bitcoin will give maximum returns than traditional assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Adoption Index 2024: US Ownership Hits 40%, Market Cap Soars , Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve plan has created a global impact and countries are debating whether to add Bitcoin to their mainstream financing model.

Industry leaders are hopeful that the new administration will fulfill its promises in bringing about clarity and reform to the regulations governing digital assets. It could prove to be the turning point for crypto companies in their long battle against an unfriendly regulatory environment that seems too cloudy and overregulatory. Ripple vs. SEC: A Defining Legal Battle One of the most overriding concerns is the Ripple case ongoing against the SEC. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, reiterated on Dec. 31 that tokens are not inherently securities, although they can be involved in security transactions. Ripple is appealing an August 2024 ruling that found the company liable for $125 million. The outcome could set a vital precedent for how regulators classify digital assets going forward. The Chevron Doctrine and SEC Cases Other recent significant movement included the Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling that overturned the Chevron doctrine, whereby courts would defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous laws. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said that decision may force judges to re-evaluate cases brought by the SEC, potentially leading to a more fair-minded judiciary when it came to digital asset regulations. High-Stakes Legal and Criminal Cases The year 2025 will be very eventful legally for the crypto sector. Cases against former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and recently extradited Terraform Labs’ Do Kwon will continue, while simultaneously, the shake-up in the leadership at agencies such as the SEC and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York might impact the ongoing enforcement actions. Trump’s Proposed Leadership Shake-Up He has hinted at plans for regulatory leadership shake-ups. Among them, he’s proposed swapping SEC Chair Gary Gensler for former commissioner Paul Atkins and naming Jay Clayton, Gensler’s predecessor, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. If the plans go through, this could substantially lessen the regulatory load on crypto companies and direct enforcement efforts to support business growth. Everything the crypto industry could want in 2025 depends on whether this new administration can deliver. In a year featuring changed leadership, landmark legal cases, and possibly some regulatory clarity, this could be the year that sets up the future of digital assets in the US.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-02 07:15:00

According to a December research note , BTC’s price is forecasted to exceed $150,000, while ETH could surpass $8,000. Analysts are also increasingly optimistic about a robust “altcoin season” on the horizon. The bullish predictions stem from several favorable factors, including an improved regulatory landscape, declining interest rates, and enhanced liquidity. The historically strong performance following Bitcoin’s halving and growing institutional adoption further strengthens this outlook. Inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs to Remain Strong Steno anticipates significant inflows into U.S.-based Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), estimating net inflows of $48 billion for BTC ETFs and $28.5 billion for ETH ETFs in 2025. Ethereum is expected to outpace Bitcoin’s growth, with the ETH/BTC ratio projected to reach at least 0.06, nearly doubling its current level of 0.035. This shift is likely to trigger a broader altcoin rally, reducing Bitcoin’s market dominance from 57% to approximately 45%, the report suggests. Steno attributes part of this trend to the potential impact of Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory, which is seen as more favorable for altcoins than Bitcoin. Trump’s policies are expected to encourage stronger onchain activity, benefiting platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Altcoin investors in 2025: pic.twitter.com/Te9RKnx5p7 — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 19, 2024 Additionally, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications is projected to surpass $300 billion in 2025, significantly exceeding the 2021 peak of $180 billion. Other industry leaders, including Grayscale, share similar optimism. Grayscale recently added decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, including those on Solana, to its watchlist for 2025. The firm cited a favorable U.S. policy environment and Trump’s pledge to position the U.S. as a global crypto hub as driving forces behind its positive outlook. US Crypto Owners Expect Less Regulation Cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift. Speaking at a legal conference in New York, current and former senior government lawyers indicated that while financial fraud cases will still be pursued, the Justice Department’s focus will likely move toward immigration enforcement, a key campaign promise of Trump. Scott Hartman, co-chief of the securities and commodities task force at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, revealed that fewer resources will be allocated to policing cryptocurrency crimes. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies , opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. As reported, the Republican Party is preparing to introduce a comprehensive crypto market structure bill within the first 100 days of the upcoming legislative session, according to Representative French Hill. In December, Hill emphasized the urgent need for regulatory clarity in the U.S. crypto market, calling it a “top priority” for the GOP. Hill revealed that GOP Majority Leader Steve Scalise is leading the charge on the legislation, which aims to establish clear guidelines for the digital asset industry.

Since 2018, Bappebti has overseen crypto assets. However, the transition, set to be completed by Jan. 12, 2025, is delayed due to the lack of a supporting government regulation, the Jakarta Globe reported on Thursday. OJK is expected to create a more transparent regulatory environment aligned with international standards. It plans to introduce clearer rules on trading, taxation, and crypto exchange operations, areas previously managed under Bappebti’s less detailed oversight. This shift aligns with the Financial Sector Development and Strengthening Law, aiming to streamline oversight and foster a safer, more inclusive framework for digital assets. OJK Confirms Progress on Crypto Oversight Transition, Regulation Draft Finalized OJK Chairman Mahendra Siregar reportedly confirmed that discussions and preparations for the transition are actively underway. He announced that the draft government regulation is now officially formatted. “We’ve been working closely with the Trade Ministry to ensure a seamless process. Once the regulation is issued, it will provide the legal basis for the transition,” he said. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati first introduced the plan during financial sector discussions in late 2022. The bill was to become law once both the legislative and executive branches reached an agreement on all provisions. Indonesia Crypto Market Hits $30B in 2024 Transactions By Oct. 2024, Indonesia’s crypto market reached a major milestone with over 475 trillion rupiah (around $30b) in transactions. This marks a 352% jump from the $6.5b recorded during the same period in 2023. However, it still falls short of the $54b achieved in the bullish market of 2021. At the same time, Indonesia’s crypto trader base has grown significantly, reaching 21m users. Of these, 716,000 trade through locally registered exchanges. Notably, over 60% of these investors are aged 18 to 30 , highlighting strong youth participation in the market. This growth places Indonesia among the countries with the highest number of crypto traders worldwide.

There are “textbook bull signals” on the charts, which means SHIB could reach $0.000081 in the next few months, according to an analyst. But what’s making people so hopeful? Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Enter Its Most Massive Bull Cycle? This Engineer Thinks So Whale Activity Sparks Fresh Momentum Recent whale movements are yielding very significant insights into the prospects of SHIB. One such movement involved the withdrawal of 220 billion SHIB tokens, worth $4.63 million, from Binance by a single entity. Such withdrawals have usually been linked to heightened interest among institutional or high-net-worth investors, and it bodes well for the token. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) finishing up the year holding a major breakout and coming off of textbook bull signals on lower timeframes! Holding broken out, the target at $0.000081 goes unchanged and these bull signals can be pointing to a continuation within an over 264% run to reach it! https://t.co/4L9HEciT3a pic.twitter.com/qkmLQURP5u — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 31, 2024 According to IntoTheBlock data, the large transaction and whale activity also supports this trend. As more interest is gathered, SHIB is building up the momentum needed for overcoming critical resistance levels. Breaking Resistance Levels Even though the prediction is for price growth, SHIB needs to break through a key resistance level at $0.000029. Analysts say that breaking above this level is the first thing that needs to happen for the token to reach its lofty goal of $0.000080. In the past, this resistance had stopped SHIB in its tracks, but recent good sentiment might be enough now. Meanwhile, the metrics from Coincheckup have shown an improved trading volume and market sentiment of SHIB. If this continues, the token might find the strength to overcome the current barriers it faces. The Broader Crypto Context The surge for Shiba Inu is happening in the midst of more significant changes in the cryptocurrency space. The recent stabilization of Ethereum and Bitcoin has created an opportunity for altcoins like SHIB to flourish. Furthermore, new players have entered the market as a result of memecoins’ growing appeal as speculative investments. According to other analysts, the optimism may also stem from SHIB’s long-term strategy, which centers on Shibarium, their Layer 2 blockchain. Investors find SHIB’s use case more appealing since Shibarium enables quicker transactions and cheaper costs. Related Reading: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset?

Will Warren Buffett need Bitcoin to compete in 2025?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-btc-2025/,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway did what it does best in 2024—beat the market. While the S&P 500 had a historic 24% gain, Berkshire came out on top again, sticking to its decades-old strategy of value investing. But see, Wall Street isn’t what it used to be anymore, and 2025 is set to challenge even Warren’s legendary approach. With a self-proclaimed “crypto president” in the Oval Office, Bitcoin crossing $100,000 and getting increasingly correlated to US stocks, we couldn’t help but wonder: will the Oracle of Omaha have to embrace Bitcoin to stay ahead? Berkshire Hathaway’s success isn’t luck. It’s a strategy built on consistency, cash reserves, and a refusal to chase fads. But there’s no denying that Bitcoin, once dismissed by Warren as “rat poison squared,” is now a serious player in global finance. Can Warren’s old-school methods hold up in what is widely expected to be the “Golden Age” of finance? Berkshire Hathaway’s 2024 playbook Berkshire Hathaway’s 2024 performance was a masterclass in patience. While the tech-heavy S&P 500 surged, driven by AI giants like Nvidia and Apple, Berkshire leaned into its traditional strengths. As of January 1, its Class A shares were trading at $677,200, above the $673,660 target set by analysts. Key to this success is its diversified portfolio. Apple remains its crown jewel, making up 30-40% of its equity holdings. Coca-Cola, a Warren favorite since the 1980s, still pulls its weight with a steady 3.1% dividend yield. Sure the company has underperformed the S&P 500 over five and ten years, lagging by 33% and 105%, respectively. But it’s still a bedrock investment—consistent dividends, pricing power, and a global brand that prints money. But what really sets Berkshire apart is its cash. The company’s reserves surged past $300 billion in 2024, giving Warren the kind of flexibility most investors will only ever dream about. He is a legend, with a war chest that allows him to snap up opportunities when others panic. Analysts predict this will be a major advantage in 2025, especially if tech stocks lose steam and value investing comes back into vogue. The Bitcoin question: A threat or an opportunity? For years, Warren has been the loudest critic of Bitcoin, calling it everything from “rat poison” to a “mirage.” His argument is simple: Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. But come on, it’s 2025, that view is kind of outdated now. We are in a monster bull run, and institutional investors are piling in. BlackRock’s Larry Fink now calls it “digital gold.” Nearly everyone with a position under the incoming administration is pro-crypto, even the director of NASA . That’s how serious Trump is about loving Bitcoin. At some point, it’s gonna get embarrassing for Warren that he is still holding out on Bitcoin. What more does he need? We all know that young and retail investors, the ones Berkshire needs to attract for long-term growth, are all-in on crypto. They see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and the future of finance. If Berkshire ignores this trend, it risks losing relevance with this demographic. Meanwhile, the S&P 500’s 24% gain in 2024 was driven by the so-called “Magnificent Seven,” tech giants like Nvidia and Apple. Nvidia alone jumped 171%, thanks to AI hype. But this tech-driven rally came at a cost. The S&P recorded its first four-day losing streak to end the year since 1966. It’s a reminder that what goes up, eventually comes down. Berkshire, by contrast, plays the long game. So will Warren ever adapt to Bitcoin? History says maybe. He once called tech stocks a bubble, only to invest billions in Apple. No matter which way he goes in the end, it’ll be historic to witness.",OP-ED|Apple|Berkshire Hathaway|BlackRock|BTC|Coca Cola|Nvidia,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-02 07:31:08

Trump 2025 (TRUM2025), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUM2025 is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump 2025 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump 2025 could become the next viral memecoin. Trump 2025 launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump 2025 on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump 2025 by entering its contract address – 5K2ESM1q2SjZFybttofLFpbbW8yF3isBRW3ZxDPUVfVY – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUM2025. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 07:38:59

Speaking about his decade-long journey with Cardano, Hoskinson said that they aim to ensure a smooth transition to a fully decentralized, community-driven ecosystem. Reflecting on the past decade, Hoskinson said: “I have spent ten years of my life on Cardano as of 2025. Many mistakes were made but I never crossed the line to take money from the community or deviated from the original roadmap.” With the recent launch of the Chang hard fork upgrade, ADA is now controlled by community members. Hoskinson described his latest mission as removing obstacles to this transition and ensuring that no individual or entity disrupts the process. Related News: Syrian Transitional Government Offers Extraordinary Bitcoin Proposal The Voltaire Era is the final phase on Cardano’s roadmap, focusing on full decentralization and community-driven governance. A critical step in this transition is the approval of the budget and bylaws, which Hoskinson believes are crucial to the project’s success. But there are obstacles. Insiders have raised concerns about the timeline, accusing the Cardano Foundation of delaying the approval process. Hoskinson insisted that these plans should be approved by next year: “This is my mission for the last ten years, and I will fulfill it, no matter what the personal, economic or professional consequences.” Despite the challenges, Hoskinson is optimistic about Cardano’s future and predicts 2025 will be its best year yet. *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents Pepeto leads the charge into 2025 with unmatched vision About PEPETO Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and owner of X (formerly Twitter), has once again demonstrated his extraordinary impact on cryptocurrency markets. In a recent move, he updated his profile name to “Kekius Maximus” and adopted an avatar featuring Pepe the Frog, a well-known internet meme portrayed as a Roman soldier. This seemingly lighthearted update sparked an incredible 800% increase in the value of a meme-inspired cryptocurrency named Kekius Maximus within just 24 hours. This phenomenon echoes Musk’s previous influence on Dogecoin, where his tweets and public endorsements elevated the meme-based cryptocurrency to global prominence, driving its value to unprecedented heights.

The altcoin surged beyond the resistance at $2.20, but its bullish momentum has taken a hit. XRP is now down to $2.06 but still shows a promising outlook. However, analysts believe 1Fuel is the DeFi token to watch in 2025 due to its massive presale buzz.

The altcoin eyes a prolonged bull market run in Q1, which could see it hit $3.

The campaign needs 100,000 signatures before it can be tabled for a referendum. The legislator has strategically pushed the Bitcoin agenda in the legislative house and on any podium with an audience. His campaign is already bearing fruit, as Swiss crypto advocates have forwarded a proposal to compel the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to hold part of its reserve in gold and Bitcoin. SNB Chairman doubts BTC’s role in national reserve amid growing crypto support Although the cryptocurrency agenda is getting loud in Switzerland, most people are feeling cold about incorporating it into their national reserve. Swiss National Bank Chairman Martin Schlegel has expressed concern for cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether, calling them niche phenomena. He believes the cash system would play an important role in the Swiss payments system. In November, at an event organized by the Aargauische Kantonalbank in Brugg, he noted that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have grown enormously in recent years. However, he observed that the currencies remain a niche phenomenon. While the chairman has never taken a position on the future of crypto, he has raised several concerns, such as its fluctuation in value, making it difficult to rely on it as a form of payment. There are also concerns about the amount of energy Bitcoin uses and illegal crypto-related activities. One online user, @PB3g3r , feels the initiative is just an educational or reelection campaign tool, as the proposal will fall. He holds that the Citizens and Cantons of Switzerland will not modify their constitution for a few more dollars, and they trust that the Swiss National Bank will act accordingly. Another online user, Till Könneker, reacted on X by saying : “ You know how Swiss democracy works. Unfortunately, people will never vote for this.” Bitcoin is going from neutral to constitutional The call to constitutionalize BTC is not new in Switzerland. Switzerland’s Canton of Bern parliament already approved a motion to relook at Bitcoin mining to use surplus energy and stabilize its electricity bill. The proposal backed by Samuel Kullmann was tabled by an expert and supported by five political parties on March 14, 2024. However, the government was against this proposal. It was passed decisively by 85 to 46 votes in the Grand Council. The cross-party initiative is compelling the government council to study how BTC mining can repurpose unused energy and create economic opportunities. The passing of this motion is driving Samuel Kullmann’s confidence that they will succeed in the referendum push and that Bitcoin will be integrated into the Swiss constitution.

Here’s What Experts Think,https://coingape.com/is-1-mln-bitcoin-price-possible-in-2025-heres-what-experts-think/,"Bitcoin price has started the year on a positive note, indicating that investors are regaining confidence in the asset. Amid this, a flurry of market experts has set different price targets for the flagship crypto, which has sparked discussions in the market. Besides, a top analyst also discussed BTC’s potential to hit $1 million in 2025 and what could trigger such a rally in the coming months. Can Bitcoin Price Hit $1 Million? Bitcoin price has gained notable traction in 2024, especially after Donald Trump’s election win in November. However, as we enter 2025, the market participants remain on edge with many exploring what lies ahead for the flagship crypto. Amid this, a top expert recently revealed if BTC could target the $1 million mark in 2025 and factors that can boost the price higher. For context, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, recently said that the crypto can likely rally to $1 million in 2025. He noted that the crypto can hit the $1 million mark only if the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve idea for the US becomes reality. However, he also said that the chance of the BTC Reserve happening in 2025 is less than 10%. Source: Jeff Park, X Meanwhile, Trump’s victory has boosted the sentiment of the market lately. Besides, his active support for BTC during his election campaign has further fueled market optimism. The Republican leader also pledged to make the US the crypto capital, which has further triggered speculations. A flurry of countries are also shifting their focus towards the digital assets space, especially Bitcoin. In addition, corporations like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy are also spending heavily on crypto, reflecting the growing market interest in crypto. Bold BTC Forecasts BTC price today was up over 2% and exchanged hands at $95,656 while its one-day trading volume fell 24% to $29.99 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $95,824 and a low of $92,788. Furthermore, CoinGlass data showed that Bitcoin Futures Open Interest also rose significantly, reflecting the strong market interest in the crypto. Meanwhile, a recent CNBC report shared several price targets for BTC by experts. For instance, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said that Bitcoin price could rally to $150K in 2025. However, he also noted that the crypto could slump to $80K as well if the bearish momentum dominates. Simultaneously, Matrixport said that the crypto is likely to hit $160K this year. On the other hand, Galaxy Digital expects BTC to rally to $185K in 2025 amid soaring crypto adoption of the institutions. The post Is $1 Mln Bitcoin Price Possible In 2025?

However, its long-term bullish trajectory remains valid. It is currently trading flat while footing a fresh increase daily. Last month’s correction slowed down buying after peaking at the $793 level. However, it managed to recover well from a low of $600. Following the recovery back into the key trading $700 range in late December, BNB’s next move has remained indecisive due to an extreme drop in volatility. Several attempts to move out of this range have proven abortive. While the crypto found it difficult to overcome $730 last week, the price remains strong weekly while the trend remains in favour of the bulls in the long term. Amid fading negative sentiments, we can anticipate a huge swing high in the coming weeks. A lower correction could trigger a leg down capable of causing serious pains in the short-term. But looking at the setups, which show signs of bullish, the price will likely explode massively anytime soon. The build-up is much more likely to go to the upside as the trend is still in favour of the bulls. For such a move, a break above the previous monthly high should set the market up for another rally. BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview BNB supports are currently held at $683 and $642. If by any chance the price plunges through these levels to $618, the next support to watch would be $600. For more recoveries, the immediate resistance level for an increase is $737 along with the $793.8 level. A cross above this level could send the price to $800. The higher level to watch for more surge is $900.

Court documents showed crypto lending platform has filed a notice of appeal challenging Judge John Dorsey’s ruling, which denied Celsius ‘ claims for FTX damages worth around $444 million. The trial is part of FTX’s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings which would seek to repay damages from the fallen crypto exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried. According to the appeal filed by Celsius Network’s litigation administrator, Mohsin Meghji, Celsius initially filed a claim for up to $2 billion in damages due to “unsubstantiated and disparaging statements” about the firm’ balance sheet and financial stability by FTX officers that the firm’s lawyers believe accelerated Celsius’ collapse in 2022. However, before the bar date, Celsius decreased the claim amount to around $444 million, as the crypto lending firm stated it will focus on restoring “preferential transfers” that would prioritize repayments for certain creditors. You might also like: Celsius advisors demand for $2b withdrawn before bankruptcy According to the document, FTX debtors denied Celsius’ claims because they deemed the original proof lodged by the firm were not enough to substantiate the claim. Additionally, the amendment from $2 billion to $444 million was thought to have been filed “too late and should be disallowed.” Celsius argued that the original proof should be enough to meet the minimum requirements within the Bankruptcy Code and put debtors on notice. Last December, Judge Dorsey dismissed both the amended $444 million claim and the initial $2 billion claim, stating Celsius’ original proof of claim — which only contained one sentence about investigating preference claims — was not enough to substantiate its claims for FTX damages. Moreover, the court found that Celsius’ amended proofs filed in July were not legitimate due to the revised claim not being related to the original claims. Moreover, Celsius did not seek leave to amend nor provide an explanation regarding the filing delay. In late November 2024, Celsius vowed to distribute $127 million to its credits from its litigation recovery account. Within that same month, a New York federal judge ruled against Celsius’ former CEO Alex Mashinsky’s bid to dismiss two fraud charges. Mashinsky is accused of manipulating the price of Celsius’ native token, CEL . He faces two charges of wire fraud and market manipulation following the collapse of the crypto lending firm, which could lead to a maximum sentence of 115 years behind bars.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) miner HIVE Digital Technologies has hit a major milestone, reaching 6.0 exahashes per second in operational hashrate, marking a 47% jump from 4.08 EH/s at the end of 2023. The Vancouver-headquartered firm explained in a Jan. 2 press release that the growth comes from upgrading its Bitcoin mining fleet with the latest Avalon machines from Canaan Inc. On top of the fleet upgrade, HIVE has also secured competitive energy pricing in Sweden, with electricity costs below two cents per kilowatt-hour. This helps keep their operating costs manageable and improves profitability. The firm’s hedged energy position in Sweden supports its focus on cost-effective operations. Looking ahead, HIVE has big plans. The company is still targeting 15 EH/s of global hashrate, though this time the firm is shifting its timeline for achieving this: from summer to the end of 2025. This will be supported by a 100 MW hydroelectric-powered expansion in Paraguay, which is expected to bring the company’s fleet efficiency to 17 joules per terahash.

In late 2024, HIVE considerably expanded its mining operations, purchasing 11,500 Avalon ASIC miners from Canaan Inc. and 8.6 EH/s of Bitmain’s S21+ Hydro machines. That deal was part of the firm’s plan to reach a total mining capacity of 15 EH/s, with the purchase expected to generate over $300 million in annual revenue once fully deployed.

During the last leg down that led to a broad price correction in the short term, Sol found support above a three-month trendline and recovered but unfortunately failed to resume an uptrend due to low buying commitment. Though the bulls tried to step back in action as there was not enough volume to bring them back in control. The daily supply level still appears high, and as a result, we can expect more drag-downs after distribution. If that fails to play, it will continue to trade flat until a surge occurs. Looking back from where the price started to drop in November, Sol has posted a notable loss as it fell into the $170 range, with a sharp bounce. This bounce has brought relief as it subjects to a sideways movement. Adjusting to the lower timeframe, Sol is still forming a lower low and lower high pattern on the 4-hour chart. This bearish pattern suggests that the correction phase is still active. It may create a new lower low if the support trendline breaks down. Meanwhile, a change in the bearish trend can be expected once Sol starts to make a new high. Amid the latest correction, the general market outlook is still considered bullish on a macro level. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Sol is currently in the middle of consolidation. A breakdown from the current trading level could roll the price back to $176, located under the trendline. Other support levels to consider for drops are $155 and $141. Resuming bullish, the price must climb back above the $202 and $227 resistance levels. A breakthrough $247 to the $264 resistance should fuel a huge rally to a new high. Key Resistance Levels: $202, $227, $247 Key Support Levels: $176, $155, $141 Spot Price: $190 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A CoinDesk analysis from Tuesday flagged unusually high trading volumes for XRP stemming from South Korean exchanges, which has historically acted as a harbinger for price volatility with a bias to the upside. XRP surged 11% to lead growth among majors as of Thursday, led by $1.3 billion worth of trading volumes on Korea-focused exchange UpBit. Among other majors, Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and Chainlink’s LINK added as much as 8%. Ether (ETH) and BNB Chain’s BNB rose 3%, while memecoins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) added 5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, rose 5.8% . The anticipation of a more crypto-friendly administration under incoming U.S. president Donald Trump, who has made campaign promises for crypto friendly policies and a strategic bitcoin reserve, is largely fuelling optimism for 2025. The Bitcoin halving event in 2024 historically led to a bullish trend in the following year due to the reduced supply of new tokens entering the market. The broader crypto market also tends to follow a four-year cycle influenced by the halvings — with memecoins, AI and real-world assets expected to be market leaders. Predictions aren’t limited to mere cycles, however. Firms such as Galaxy Research predict large-scale institutional, corporate, and nation-state adoption in bitcoin investments, with at least five Nasdaq-100 companies and five nation-states expected to adopt the asset. The firm targets a $185,000 level for bitcoin and $5,500 for ether (ETH) this year. Singapore-based QCP Capital mirrors that sentiment: “For 2025, while optimism surrounds crypto-friendly regulations post-Trump inauguration, we think the key catalyst may come in January as institutions readjust asset allocations.” “With BTC now broadly adopted by a broad spectrum of institutions, allocations are likely to increase, strengthening Bitcoin dominance, stabilizing spot movements, and shifting volatility dynamics closer to equities,” the firm said in a Telegram broadcast on Tuesday. “Expect stronger demand for downside puts for hedging and more covered call selling on the topside.” Some say bitcoin becoming a mainstream asset may further reduce its infamous volatility, leading to even more adoption among institutional firms. “Mainstream's effect on crypto is most evident through BTC's high correlation to the SPX, remaining the most correlated asset as we end 2024,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Another sign of BTC heading towards being a mainstream asset class is its declining realized volatility, which would eventually add more diversification benefits and alpha to the traditional 60/40 portfolio.” “Volatility should continue to decline as an asset class matures, as our long-standing view is that crypto would be no different,” Fan added.",Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-02 08:02:36

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 853,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may correct by double-digit percentage points in January based on historic precedence. “At least in the last two [post-halving years], there has been a correction in January. Now what’s interesting is this time we’ve already kind of had a correction in December, but if you look at what happened in 2021, there was a correction in January, about a 30% drop. If you look at 2017, the post-halving year in January there was also about a 30% drop.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube However, Cowen says Bitcoin’s December correction may have been caused by the anticipation of the historic January correction and therefore Bitcoin may not correct this month. “But the counterpoint, of course, is that Bitcoin was not really struggling at the end of December [in the prior two instances]. It was actually going up [in December 2016] and then you had a drop in January. Same thing again in 2021. This time has been a little bit different in that regard as it’s bled in December rather than having gone up. So obviously the optimist would say, Well, maybe it’s just front-running the correction because everyone’s talking about it happening in January; therefore, why not it happen in December? If you look at a price range here [in December 2024], it’s already dropped around 15%. A 30% drop would actually put it right around the 20-week moving average [at $77,712]. So the optimist would certainly look at that and say, Maybe it’s just front running what everyone was already knowing was happening so by the time it actually happens, Bitcoin already carried out that move.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Cowen also suggests Bitcoin may have headed lower in December based on its historical correlation with the rate for 10-year yields (US10Y). “The other way to think about it is if there’s something inhibiting Bitcoin from going higher, and again it could just simply be due to the big rise in in the yields over the last couple of weeks. We didn’t see moves exactly as strong as this in prior Decembers of halving years by the 10-year yield. If you were to overlay the 10-year yield onto this chart the 10-year yield has never really been this high at this point in in Bitcoin’s history. And so that could be the reason.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $94,584 at time of writing, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin surged more than 120% to a new six-figure all-time high in mid-December. However, analysts believe that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin, which has been consolidating for the past fortnight, in the first quarter of the new year. “ETH generally sees a good amount of action in Q1. Even during the past few years during the downtrend against BTC,” observed analyst “Daan Crypto Trades” on X on Jan. 2. ETH/BTC Ratio Needs to Improve During the previous bull market, 2020 and 2021 saw large moves for the ETH/BTC ratio, which also kick-started an altseason, he said before adding: “~0.04 remains an important level to break for ETH.” The ETH/BTC ratio, or Ethereum’s value in terms of Bitcoin, is currently 0.035, according to Tradingview. $ETH Generally sees a good amount of action in Q1.

Much of this momentum would come from Ether ETF inflows, which would hit $50 billion this year, as staked ETH products are filed for and approved, he added. He also predicted that more major TradFi companies and institutions would start to build on Ethereum, BlackRock will launch a layer-2 tokenized real-world asset platform on the blockchain, and multiple nation states will reveal that they hold ETH as a treasury asset. “Ethereum will turn 10 years old in 2025, and I’m very confident that this year will be Ethereum’s most bullish year yet!” My 2025 predictions for Ethereum: – ETH hits $15k – ETH ETF net inflows hit $50bil+ for the year – Staked ETH ETFs are filed for and approved – More major TradFi companies/institutions start to build on Ethereum – BlackRock (and partners) launch a layer 2 tokenized RWA platform… — sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) January 1, 2025 In a report released in late December, Steno Research predicted that ETH prices would reach $8,000 in 2025, with analysts “increasingly optimistic about an imminent altcoin season.” “IMO, ETH will have a face-melting rally in Q1, 2025,” said analyst Ash Crypto, who compared performance in past cycles. – ETH WAS DOWN 52% FROM ITS ATH – ETH/BTC WAS AT CYCLE LOW – EVERYONE WAS CALLING THAT ETH IS DEAD – ETH PUMPED 91% IN JANUARY AND HIT A NEW ATH – ETH IS DOWN 30% FROM ITS ATH – ETH/BTC IS ALMOST AT… pic.twitter.com/ElsocwI8S3 — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) December 31, 2024 A Great Start to 2025 On Jan. 1, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said , “Ethereum will have a great start for 2025.” He referred to the Pectra upgrade, which will enable accounts to function like smart contracts, “making smart wallets scalable and bringing better UX and safety for users.” ETH prices were currently up 2% on the day, with the asset topping $3,400 during Thursday morning trading in Asia. However, the asset has been trading sideways since its Dec. 20 slump from $4,000.

Although it has no direct connection, investors have still maintained a hype around it, which has helped the GameStop price achieve multiple milestones in the crypto market. Interestingly, the token is rising again, gaining a significant surge in the last 24 hours. GameStop Price Surged 10% With Roaring Kitty’s Tweet The crypto investor’s enthusiasm is building with the beginning of a new year. In a similar possible mindset, Roaring Kitty reappeared online, posting Rick James-themed GIF. With that, the trading activity began rising for the GME, pushing the trading volume 43% to $9.81M. This increased network activity and pushed the GameStop price by 10% within a day. It is currently trading at $0.00395 with a market capitalization of $27.19M. Another GameStop-inspired coin surged 350%. Interestingly, there is a long history between the popular finance influencer Roaring Kitty and the game retailer. Additionally, the popular Solana meme coin GameStop (GME), including today, has often taken advantage of this connection. Even, the post had no promotional stuff or anything relevant to this cryptocurrency. Still, despite that, the price began to rise, and there is a very interesting reason behind that, which goes back in time. Why Does Roaring Kitty Influence The GameStop Price? Keith Gill is a famous financial analyst and investor who goes by the name “Roaring Kitty.” He has a massive fan following because of his price analysis and market predictions. Interestingly, in January 2021, he helped the game retailer GameStop through financial trouble. He invested $53k and even promoted the business’s stock, eventually helping it through tough times. However, soon after that, he disappeared from the internet for three years before re-emerging in May 2024, and his first post pumped the GameStop stock price by 50%, whose influence was also seen on the GME crypto. Ever since then, every time Gill posted anything, people began flocking to the token in the hope of heavy profits, influencing the GME price. What’s In There For You? Despite the GameStop token’s recovery today, there is a long way to go before it reaches its prime. It was in its prime during July 2024, when it surged to $0.03201, but has lost 87% of its value ever since then. However, this is not the first time the GME price has dropped to this low. Such price drops are very common for this cryptocurrency, but it is also important to note that it has recovered after every drop as well. Interestingly, today’s 10% surge is one of those attempts at recovery. If the investor’s sentiments remained the same and Bitcoin price regained bullish momentum, the GameStop price could recover further, but careful investment strategies must be followed.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Ethereum and Dogecoin face decline, investors are rotating into a booming AI coin that has already surged 700%, signaling a shift in investors’ choice. Table of Contents Ethereum set to reach new peak Dogecoin repeats patterns, says analyst Intel Markets introduces new trends in crypto trading Why Intel Markets is the best crypto investment for 2025 Since Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are down, investors are now focusing on relatively new crypto projects like Intel Markets (INTL) . The AI Coin has proven to be a crypto gem after recording gains of over 700%. The goal of Intel Markets is to transform the crypto trading platform which is worth $36.5 billion. Given its low market cap and AI capabilities, Intel Markets could become the next best cryptocurrency to buy for up to 10x gains in 2025. Ethereum set to reach new peak A crypto expert called 5_0Trading told his followers recently Ethereum is on its way to a new high. The analyst forecasts that crossing the $3,900 level could be the key to this uptrend. Meanwhile, the Ethereum coin has been trading in a narrow range in the past few weeks. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the value of the altcoin has been consolidating between $3,309.16 and $3,512.12 in the past week. The value of the Ethereum token had plunged by 0.9% on the weekly chart. The losses have also extended to higher timeframes. The biweekly and monthly charts have price declines of 14.9% and 7.9%, respectively. Going forward, the Ethereum crypto is facing an immediate resistance at the $3,500 level. Crossing this region could kickstart a price rally at the start of the new year. Potential targets include $5k and $6k. Dogecoin repeats patterns, says analyst In a recent post on X, a top analyst called Trader Tardigrade notes the Dogecoin token could be gearing up for a massive upswing. According to him, Dogecoin usually repeats price patterns. He encouraged his followers to remain optimistic despite the price correction. Meanwhile, Tardigrade posted a chart where the Dogecoin price rallied to a peak of $9. Currently, the value of the meme coin has plunged by 23.1% on the monthly level. The price of the Dogecoin token has been consolidating between $0.3087 and $0.3375. The meme coin could surge to new levels soon as long as it remains above the $0.3 region. Losing this support could invalidate the price forecast of Tardigrade. Many crypto enthusiasts believe Elon Musk could integrate DOGE into its X platform as a payment method. Such a move could lead to a price surge. Intel Markets introduces new trends in crypto trading Intel Markets is a new generation of cryptocurrency trading platform that utilizes advanced technologies and focuses on users. It serves both retail and institutional clients with new features and advanced trading tools. A major tool on the platform is the Intelli-M trading bot. These bots can run on their own, actively make trades, and analyze various patterns in the market. In addition, the Intelli-M bot can predict future market prices to enable traders to gain a competitive edge. In addition to the Intelli-M bot, there is a multi-channel analysis tool that is equally as strong. This unique tool analyzes a vast number of data and offers traders simple and clear signals to use in trading. Another advantage of Intel Markets is its dual-chain structure. The adaptation means traders can switch directly between Ethereum and Solana easily, which will allow them to pick the platform that is most suitable for their trading requirements. The project has already reached $5.6 million in funding and looks very likely to hit the $10 million milestone in Q1 2025. The INTL token has increased by more than 700% to reach its current price of $0.073273. Why Intel Markets is the best crypto investment for 2025 While Ethereum and Dogecoin are trading in the red region, Intel Markets is proving to be the next big thing for anyone looking for the best crypto to invest in. Intel Markets’ 700% increase is only the tip of the iceberg. Given the presale success and other unique features, the value of the DeFi cryptocurrency could surge by 1,000% in Q1 2025.

Integrated as a Chrome extension, Mariner can browse spreadsheets, visit shopping platforms, and assist with online services while keeping the user in control of final decisions, such as completing purchases. Built on Google’s advanced Gemini 2.0 neural network, Mariner learns from vast datasets, including text, images, and sounds. This allows it to mimic human-like interactions with digital tools. According to Demis Hassabis, head of Google’s core AI lab, Mariner can understand when to press buttons or take actions to achieve a goal. Google CEO Sundar Pichai described the tool as a step closer to creating a “universal assistant” , reflecting its potential to become an essential part of daily digital interactions. Mariner is part of Google’s broader AI strategy, which includes tools like the Gemini chatbot and the AI Overviews feature in Google Search. These technologies are built on Gemini 2.0’s ability to detect patterns in data, generate text, and interact with services in increasingly sophisticated ways. However, the project is still in its early stages, and accuracy remains a challenge. Jaclyn Konzelmann, Google’s project manager, admitted that the system is not yet perfect and occasional mistakes are inevitable. Google’s plans face additional obstacles, particularly regulatory scrutiny. The US Justice Department’s ongoing antitrust investigation into Google Chrome could potentially impact Mariner’s development. If regulatory bodies push to separate Chrome from Google, it might limit the AI agent’s integration and future growth. Despite these challenges, Google continues to invest in next-generation AI projects. Alongside Mariner, the company is also advancing Project Astra, a digital assistant capable of responding to text, images, and voice commands. Although Astra is not yet available to the public, it represents Google’s ongoing effort to redefine human interaction with AI technologies. Competition in the AI agent space is intensifying. Tech giants and startups, including OpenAI and Anthropic, are developing similar tools designed to interact seamlessly with websites, applications, and digital platforms. Industry experts predict rapid advancements in AI agent capabilities over the next year. Observers like Cygaar suggest that current frameworks are only operating at “10-30% of their full potential” , hinting at significant improvements in the near future. Investor interest in AI agents is also growing, particularly in AI-related tokens. Prominent crypto influencers, such as Hitesh.eth, have highlighted emerging AI tokens, including ZARA, TONY, H4CK, SAM, XENO, REALIS, TRUST, ASYM, NIKITA, NOMAI, and RADIO, as potentially undervalued assets. However, caution remains essential as the market is still evolving, and risks persist. Google’s unveiling of Mariner marks a significant step in the AI agent race. With the backing of Gemini 2.0, Mariner aims to simplify digital tasks, improve efficiency, and pave the way for smarter human-machine interactions. However, regulatory challenges and technological accuracy remain hurdles that Google must overcome to ensure Mariner’s long-term success. Meanwhile, the competition among AI developers continues to accelerate, setting the stage for rapid advancements in AI agent technology.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-02 09:09:31

BTC Eyes $96K Following its latest all-time high of over $108,000 on December 17, BTC went into a full correction mode, dumping by $16,000 within just days by December 20. It bounced off in the next week or so and even challenged $100,000 on a few occasions, but to no avail. The subsequent rejection from the second attempt pushed it south hard to $91,300 on December 30, which became its lowest price tag in over a month. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and propelled a run toward $95,000, where they were stopped, and BTC slipped beneath $92,000. More volatility ensued at the end of the calendar year, with a surge to $96,000 and another drop to $93,000. The past 24 hours have been more positive for the largest digital asset, as it now stands close to $96,000 once again.

Bitcoin (BTC) led the way, erasing losses from the previous week by surpassing $95,000 for the first time this year. Crypto Market Soars as Bitcoin Rises Above $95,000; XRP Leads Gains Amid South Korea Trade Surge XRP has emerged as the star-performing altcoin among major tokens, up 11% as of Thursday. This rise was driven by unusually high trading volumes coming from South Korea, particularly the UpBit exchange, where $1.3 billion worth of XRP changed hands. Historically, such activity has typically preceded significant price swings with an upward trend. Other major tokens also recorded impressive gains: Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Chainlink (LINK) are up by up to 8%. Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain (BNB) rose by 3%.

On December 31, the index fell to -0.23, marking its weakest point since January 2024, according to CryptoQuant contributor Burakkesmeci. Bitcoin Retail Demand Faces Downward Pressure The premium index, which measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and global exchanges, serves as a barometer for U.S. retail investor sentiment. A positive value reflects buying momentum, while a negative reading signals increased selling. Burakkesmeci attributed the decline to thin year-end liquidity, compounded by a drop in Bitcoin’s price to $91,479—the lowest since late November. He warned that unless macroeconomic conditions shift or retail and institutional interest revives, Bitcoin’s short-term price recovery could remain elusive. Notably, the index’s last comparable low coincided with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and resurfaced briefly in October before the U.S. elections. Profit-Taking May Trigger Further Sell-Offs While short-term sentiment appears strained, long-term Bitcoin holders have emerged as significant beneficiaries of the current market dynamics. Data shows that those holding Bitcoin for over 155 days are sitting on considerable unrealized profits. According to Bitbo data , the realized price for long-term holders is $24,298, representing a staggering 290% profit margin at Bitcoin’s publication price of $94,820. This profitability could, however, spark additional sell-offs as investors lock in gains heading into 2025. In contrast, short-term holders—those who acquired Bitcoin less than 155 days ago—are dealing with a significantly higher cost basis, putting them under pressure as prices remain volatile. Trump’s Inauguration: A Turning Point? The market is also eyeing the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on January 20, a macroeconomic event that could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. While some analysts anticipate a temporary price correction of up to 30%, others believe the inauguration could catalyze renewed bullish momentum. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, predicts that Bitcoin will resume its rally after late-December’s anticipated correction . However, immediate recovery hinges on renewed confidence from both retail and institutional players.

The policy emphasizes data security, privacy, and transparency while aiming to strengthen public trust in government services. The primary goal is to integrate blockchain technology into public administration, enabling secure and efficient management of governmental processes. By leveraging blockchain’s real-time automation and verification capabilities, Jordan aims to streamline administrative tasks, minimize operational costs, and enhance service efficiency for both businesses and citizens. This initiative aligns with Jordan’s broader economic modernization plan, with hopes of boosting competitiveness across various sectors. A key focus of the policy is to develop specialized blockchain skills among the population and support local startups in the blockchain space. The government plans to create training programs and foster innovation in the sector, building a tech-savvy workforce that can contribute to the country's digital transformation. Additionally, the policy prioritizes protecting citizen data in response to growing global concerns over cybersecurity and privacy. The government believes blockchain will not only improve efficiency but also attract foreign investment. Enhanced infrastructure and a secure digital environment are expected to position Jordan as a competitive player in the global digital economy. Transparent processes and verifiable records will reduce corruption risks and increase accountability in public services. This isn’t Jordan’s first engagement with blockchain technology. In 2022, amid rising unemployment, many citizens turned to cryptocurrency trading and investment as a financial safety net. The government’s latest policy builds on that trend, offering a more structured approach to blockchain adoption at the national level. Jordan’s move reflects a growing regional trend in the Middle East towards blockchain integration. In Syria, the transitional government recently proposed legalizing Bitcoin and digitizing the Syrian pound as part of efforts to stabilize the economy and attract global investors. Similarly, Dubai has taken major steps to incorporate blockchain technology into its financial infrastructure. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) granted Ripple in-principle approval to operate within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), enabling end-to-end payment solutions across the UAE. Additionally, the TON Foundation registered with the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) to establish a legal framework for its decentralized ledger technology operations. These steps signal the Middle East's increasing reliance on blockchain for economic development and technological advancement. Jordan’s blockchain policy is expected to bring long-term benefits by improving public sector efficiency, reducing bureaucracy, and boosting economic diversification. As the global digital economy continues to grow, Jordan’s strategic focus on blockchain positions it to remain competitive and resilient in an evolving landscape. However, successful implementation will depend on overcoming challenges like building digital infrastructure, addressing regulatory concerns, and fostering collaboration between public and private sectors. The Jordanian government remains optimistic about the potential of blockchain technology to reshape governance and public administration. With a strong emphasis on transparency, data security, and economic innovation, Jordan’s blockchain policy sets a foundation for sustainable growth and technological progress.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-02 09:15:56

As of Jan. 2, 2025, Solana ( SOL ) is trading at $205.64, marking an 8.48% increase over the last 24 hours. This surge follows a brief consolidation phase, reflecting renewed investor confidence and optimism. SOL hit an intraday high of $205.64 and a low of $187.82, signaling a strong rebound driven by rising demand and favorable market sentiment concerning the proposed Solana exchange-traded fund.

SOL’s transaction fees are consistently low, around $0.00025, compared to ETH’s fluctuating gas fees. ETH has a larger, well-established community and ecosystem, while SOL, though newer, is rapidly growing due to its speed and low costs, attracting developers in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. These differences influence the user experience and use cases for each blockchain. Additionally, speculation about a SOL ETF approval by Jul. 31, 2025, has been gaining traction.

The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) recently issued a notice instructing banks to track transactions involving underground banking, cross-border gambling, and illegal crypto-related activities. These rules mandate banks to monitor the identities of individuals and institutions, track the sources of funds, and observe trading frequency . The increased scrutiny is expected to make it more challenging for Chinese investors to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. All banks across China are required to comply, signaling a nationwide effort to enforce stricter financial oversight. China has maintained a strict anti-crypto stance for years, viewing digital assets as a threat to financial stability. Lawyer Liu Zhengyao from ZhiHeng law firm noted that these new measures create an additional legal foundation for penalizing cryptocurrency trading. He warned that using the yuan to buy cryptocurrencies and then exchanging them for foreign fiat currencies could now be classified as illegal cross-border financial activity, especially if transactions exceed legal limits. This crackdown reflects China’s ongoing effort to control cryptocurrency use within its borders. The government sees cryptocurrencies as tools that could potentially undermine the yuan and disrupt the country’s financial ecosystem. Despite this anti-crypto stance, China remains the second-largest government holder of Bitcoin , with over 190,000 BTC acquired through seizures tied to illegal financial operations. The nation’s restrictive crypto policies date back to 2017, when it banned financial institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. In 2021, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) officially declared all cryptocurrency trading activities illegal. Yet, loopholes and underground networks have allowed some level of trading activity to persist, prompting these latest regulations. Interestingly, despite the harsh stance, there have been recent developments suggesting some flexibility. A Chinese court recently ruled that cryptoassets possess property attributes and are protected under Chinese law, but only when viewed as commodities, not as currency or business instruments. This distinction offers limited legal protection to crypto holders while maintaining the ban on using digital assets as financial instruments. Meanwhile, Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, has advocated for a more progressive cryptocurrency policy in China. In July 2024, he suggested that China could benefit from a competitive approach to Bitcoin regulation, positioning itself strategically against the US. According to Sun, such a policy shift could positively impact the global cryptocurrency industry. Despite these perspectives, the current trend indicates further tightening of crypto regulations in China. SAFE’s directive underscores the government's commitment to eliminating any financial activities it considers risky or destabilizing. As China continues to enforce stricter controls, the global crypto community watches closely to see whether these measures will effectively reduce illegal activities or drive them further underground. For now, Chinese investors face a heavily restricted environment for cryptocurrency trading. The new regulations signal a firm stance from authorities, with financial institutions playing a crucial role in monitoring and reporting violations. While cryptoassets retain limited legal recognition in China, their use as financial tools remains firmly prohibited, and these latest rules make clear that any breaches will face serious consequences.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-02 09:22:49

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE.

The strong technical setup shows that a major blow-up in the sector is in the offing similar to the 2021 bull run. Is the Altcoin Sector Preparing for a 5x Rally? Crypto market analysts expect altcoins to kickstart a mega bull run in Q1 2025 as the technical chart setup shows a similar pattern that before the 2021 bull run. By connecting the market cap top of the previous bull runs in 2018 and 2021, the below chart shows that the next top could be around $7 trillion. Source: TradingView Throughout December 2024, the crypto market has faced major volatility along with Bitcoin price swings between $90,000 to $110,000. As per the data from CoinGeckco, the current market cap of all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin is just under $1.5 trillion. However, the current situation shows that there’s a strong bottom formation suggesting that the altcoin correction could be behind us. Additionally, the alt season index has been forming a strong base at 47 after dropping all the way from 88 last month on December 4. Moreover, with Bitcoin dominance showing signs of decline, this index is likely to recover from here on the upside. Source: Blockchain Center Crypto Market Stages Strong Recovery The crypto market movement today is showing a strong push on the upside with top altcoins contributing to the most of it. The XRP price surge of 15% is leading the show with other players like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX) gaining anywhere between 6-10%. Thus, the start of 2025 seems pretty strong driven by overall optimism. For its 2025 prediction, Steno Research forecasts that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) will exceed $150,000 and $8,000, respectively. Furthermore, analysts have expressed growing optimism about an upcoming altcoin season. This bullish forecast for Bitcoin and Ethereum comes with the expectations of a highly favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, a supportive macroeconomic backdrop with declining interest rates, and improved liquidity. Furthermore, the report notes that the year following the Bitcoin halving has always been very bullish for the crypto market. It added: “On top of this, institutional adoption is expected to reach unparalleled levels, further bolstered by significant inflows into U.S.-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” In January 2025, AI agents and tokens like ai16z are likely to increase market dominance.

As Bitcoin (BTC) price gained around 2 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $95,323 on Thursday, January 2, during the early European session, the TOTAL3, which excludes Ethereum (ETH) and BTC, added over $13 billion to hover about $985 billion. From a technical analysis standpoint, the altcoin industry is preparing for a major uproar in the near term after closing 2024 with a bullish outlook. Moreover, the fundamental outlook for the entire cryptocurrency industry remains extremely bullish following the re-election of Donald Trump to the White House. Additionally, more institutional investors are doubling down their funds to the web3 space to benefit from the ongoing macro bull run. Midterm Targets for Cardano and Ripple’s XRP ADA Cardano network, a top-tier layer one blockchain, has significantly benefited from its constant chain upgrades and strategic partnerships.

Considering that ETH shot up 71% in just 30 days starting on November 5, there is a high chance Ethereum price will hit $5,000 in the first three months of 2025. Ethereum is up No data found for ethereum on 30 minutes ago% in the past 24 hours and will likely continue this bullish outlook. Can Ethereum Hit $5,000 in First Three Months of 2025? As mentioned above, Ethereum price can hit $5,000 in the first three months of 2025. ETH’s historical returns show that the first quarter has yielded an average return of 82.72% in the past eight years. Therefore, if history were to repeat, then 82.72% from the current price of No data found for ethereum on 30 minutes ago, Ethereum would be trading at roughly $6,276. Ethereum Quarterly Returns Let’s explore what technical analysis has to say about Ethereum price in the short term. ETH Technical Analysis From a price action perspective, Ethereum is stuck between the $3,600 and $3,000 barriers. Only a swift breakout relative to these levels will confirm the trend. To make matters worse, ETH’s value has been stuck inside a symmetrical triangle for the past two weeks. The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price has revived optimism after weeks of consolidation. Many top altcoins have bounced up double digits. As a result, investors are bullish and expect Ethereum to follow suit. ETH/USDT 12-hour chart Ethereum Price Targets Although the symmetrical triangle breakout direction is uncertain, let’s assume a bullish one, considering the recent recovery. A decisive daily candlestick close above the triangle’s upper limit forecasts a 12% move to $3,800. This target is the result of adding the symmetrical triangle’s 12% height to the breakout point of $3,445. Concluding Thoughts With a fresh start to 2025, the outlook shows promise, especially for Ethereum and altcoins. With historical returns averaging 82.72% in the first quarter of the past eight years, it is highly likely that Ethereum will unpause the consolidation and kickstart an uptrend. ETH is already up 3% on the day, and technical analysis indicate a bullish future. All of these signs suggests that Ethereum price will easily tackle the $4,000 hurdle and reach $5,000, a key psychological level, in the first three months of 2025.

Addressing the need for a legal and fair framework, Alderoty outlined six key principles that he hopes will guide regulatory clarity in the coming years. SEC Jurisdiction: The SEC's jurisdiction covers only securities transactions, not all asset sales. Asset and Security: Selling a gold bar with contractual rights attached to it in a gold mine may constitute a securities transaction, but selling the same gold bar without the post-sale rights is merely an asset sale and is outside the jurisdiction of the SEC. Post-Sale Obligations: Transactions that do not involve post-sale obligations to the buyer should not be regulated as securities. Clarifying Disclosures: The SEC cannot arbitrarily expand its reach based on subjective views about who deserves more disclosure. Tokens Are Not Securities: A token is never a security, although it may be sold as part of a securities transaction. Token Conversion is a Fallacy: The idea that a token can convert from a security to a non-security has no legal basis. Alderoty said the SEC should respect legal definitions and avoid overreach, and expressed hope that these principles would become standard practice by 2025. Related News: Surprise Stablecoin Temporarily Loses Its $1 Stablecoin Stability as a Single Whale Makes a Massive Sale Cryptocurrency attorney MetaLawMan responded to the principles set forth by Alderoty, largely agreeing with his claims but offering a brief explanation: “A token is almost never a security. In rare cases where a token confers rights to distributions, dividends, or equity-like benefits in the issuing project, it may qualify as a security.” *This is not investment advice.

The figure nearly doubled November’s inflows of just over $1 billion, underscoring growing investor interest in ether-backed financial products, according to data from SoSoValue . BlackRock’s ETHA fund led the surge, attracting $1.4 billion in net inflows during the month, including 13 consecutive days of positive contributions. Fidelity’s FETH Saw $752M in Inflows Fidelity’s FETH fund followed with $752 million in inflows. However, not all funds saw growth—Grayscale’s ETHE reported net outflows of $274 million. These inflows brought cumulative net inflows for ether ETFs to over $2.6 billion, with total net assets reaching $12.12 billion. This represents over 3% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. December’s inflow record coincided with a mid-month rally in ether prices, briefly surpassing $4,000 before retreating to around $3,500. As of writing, ether trades at $3,409, up 2.23% in the last 24 hours. In comparison, spot bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $4.5 billion in December, down from November’s record-breaking $6.4 billion. Bitcoin peaked at $108,135 on December 17, later retreating to $95,556. One of the more ridiculous charts you’ll ever see… Assets in spot gold ETFs vs bitcoin ETFs. Gold ETFs launched in 2004. Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. via @glxyresearch pic.twitter.com/eJo7Db9kb3 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 28, 2024 Notably, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded modest inflows on December 31, their last trading day of the year, following a period of significant outflows driven by a broader market downturn. 12 Bitcoin ETFs logged a net inflow of $5.32 million, ending a two-day outflow streak that saw $723 million exit the funds. Fidelity’s FBTC led with $36.81 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise’s BITB with $8.68 million and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust with $4.14 million. However, these gains were partly offset by outflows from BlackRock’s IBIT ($23.45 million), ARK 21Shares’ ARKB ($11.23 million), and Grayscale’s GBTC ($9.63 million). Six other Bitcoin ETFs reported no activity. Ethereum ETFs saw a stronger rebound, with $35.93 million in net inflows following a prior day of $55.41 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FETH accounted for most of the inflows at $31.77 million, while Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust added $9.77 million. Grayscale’s ETHE partially offset these gains with $5.61 million in outflows, while other Ether ETFs reported no activity. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Over $35B in Inflows in 2024 As reported, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States recorded a remarkable $35.66 billion in net inflows in 2024, significantly exceeding early industry projections. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) led the market with $37.31 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $11.84 billion, and ARK’s 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) with $2.49 billion. Other significant contributors included the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which reported $2.19 billion in inflows. These figures far surpassed Galaxy Digital’s initial $14 billion first-year estimate. However, Bitcoin ETFs faced a slight downturn toward the year’s end, with $1.33 billion in outflows since Dec. 19. On the Ether ETF front, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) led inflows with $3.52 billion and $1.56 billion, respectively. Grayscale’s low-fee Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) secured $608.1 million in inflows, while the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) crossed $400 million.

The delay until the start of 2026, would give time for brokers to adapt to the new regulations, which would determine the cost basis for cryptos on centralized platforms. CoinTracker Head of Tax Shehan Chandrasekera called the delay “good news for crypto holders interacting with CeFi exchanges in 2025.” Further, the temporary transition relief only applies to sales occurring inside CeFi exchanges between 1/1/25 and 12/31/25. “After 12/31/25, you must pick an accounting method for CeFi assets with the broker,” Shehan wrote on X. He also advocated to pick accounting method at CeFi exchange on 1/1/26 and matching the CeFi broker accounting method to crypto tax software tool. 4/ This temporary relief only applies to sales occurring inside CeFi exchanges between 1/1/25 and 12/31/25. After 12/31/25, you must pick an accounting method for CeFi assets with the broker. By this time, I believe many brokers will support all accounting methods. So, make… — Shehan (@TheCryptoCPA) December 31, 2024 In July 2024, the IRS finalised custodial broker (CeFi broker) regulations for determining which crypto units are sold when investors hold multiple units in centralized exchange. The mandate was initially set to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2025. Under the rule, if a taxpayer has not identified a preferred accounting method, the broker will sell assets under the First-In, First-Out (FIFO). “Now, there was a practical problem with this approach,” Shehan added . “Almost all CeFi brokers were not ready to support Spec ID as of 1/1/25.” The specific identification method (Spec ID) allows users to choose which cryptocurrency units they are disposing of. However, the problem with this approach would have left crypto investors with no option but to sell assets under FIFO. “In a bull market environment, this could have been disastrous for many taxpayers,” the tax expert added. The new crypto tax reporting delay gives a one-year grace time for brokers to develop support for other accounting methods. Meanwhile, the Blockchain Association, in collaboration with the Texas Blockchain Council, has sued IRS over its latest cryptocurrency regulations . The legal battle announced on December 28, pushed back against the IRS’ new rules mandating brokers to report crypto transactions.

Ripple’s RLUSD launch and potential SEC leadership change could significantly boost XRP’s long-term adoption. Whale activity and a strong investor community suggest growing institutional interest and optimism for XRP’s future. XRP staged a remarkable performance in 2024, with a 271% annual price surge. However, as the market cools down and XRP experiences a dip, the question arises: is now the right time to invest in XRP?

38423753,https://finbold.com/?p=225007,1735811061,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,BlackRock reveals the only 2 cryptos worth buying,https://finbold.com/blackrock-reveals-the-only-2-cryptos-worth-buying/,"As of January 2, 2024, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has revealed a heavy concentration in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), deeming them the only cryptocurrencies worth investing in. With a staggering $56.41 billion allocated to its cryptocurrency portfolio, Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, accounting for over 99% of the portfolio’s value. Dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum in BlackRock’s strategy Bitcoin leads the pack with 550,643 BTC holdings, valued at $52.78 billion at a current price of $95,855 per coin, representing a gain of $1.28 billion (+2.48%), as per data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham Intel . Ethereum follows with 1.037 million ETH worth $3.55 billion, priced at $3,425 per token, and an increase of $89.61 million (+2.59%). These two assets form the bedrock of BlackRock’s cryptocurrency approach, reflecting the company’s faith in their long-term potential. BlackRock’s crypto portfolio. Source: Arkham Intel The rest of BlackRock’s portfolio includes smaller exploratory holdings in stablecoin USDC, valued at $74.67 million, and alternative tokens such as COLLE ($303,080), SPX ($78,250), TUA ($29,100), UBXS ($24,180), and MOG ($16,490). BlackRock’s shift in stance and the success of Bitcoin ETF BlackRock’s transition from skepticism to adoption in the cryptocurrency space has been transformative. Initially hesitant, the firm launched its Bitcoin ETF after receiving SEC approval, following Grayscale’s legal battle with the SEC over a similar product. BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund became a historic success, surpassing $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) within just 11 months—a feat Bloomberg has credited with driving Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 earlier this year. The fund’s unparalleled performance has sparked speculation that its AUM could surpass gold ETFs in the coming years, signaling a seismic shift in institutional interest from traditional to digital assets. Nate Geraci, CEO of ETF Store, predicted that unless Bitcoin’s price plummets in 2025, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) could overtake SPDR Gold Shares, the world’s largest gold ETF. Limited Interest beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum Earlier this year, Robert Mitchnick of BlackRock noted that there is “very little interest” in other cryptocurrencies among their investors, indicating that the growth potential for altcoins may remain constrained. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate BlackRock’s crypto strategy, the broader market is evolving. Firms like Franklin Templeton and VanEck explore blockchain projects like Solana ( SOL ), there is optimism that altcoins could gain traction through future ETF approvals. Franklin Templeton has been vocal in its support for Solana, calling it one of the most promising blockchain projects. Meanwhile, ETF filings for XRP by WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital highlight growing institutional interest in expanding crypto offerings beyond the two heavyweights. Solana’s futures-based ETF applications and the growing interest in XRP ETFs suggest a diversification trend in the institutional landscape. Analysts like Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg believe that the approval of futures-based ETFs could pave the way for spot ETFs, providing altcoins like Solana and XRP with institutional exposure.

The market even posted a better performance compared to 2023. The NFT market survived 2024, but it did not return to previous peaks. PFP avatars remain a staple in the crypto space, but mainstream interest and active trading were replaced by niche activity. For the whole of 2024, NFT trading reached $8.83B, mostly focused on top collections and older holders. Ethereum (ETH) dominated the NFT market in 2024, since most collections were originally launched on that chain, and very few migrated. The chain is also the most active in the short term. Solana and Bitcoin followed with several active collections. Solana retains the largest number of NFT-related transactions, with over 14K buyers and sellers as of January 2. Ronin was in the fourth spot, hosting the trade for the Axie Infinity collections of playable avatars and metaverse land. Polygon followed, with traffic from older collections and games. Smaller chains have different NFT profiles, ranging between high-price, low-activity NFTs or high-traffic trades for extremely cheap items. In the short term, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Immutable posted the most active NFT traffic, as collections still see shifts in general interest. Base, the tokenless chain by Coinbase, is not included in trading statistics, as it focuses on extremely cheap NFTs owned for fun. The NFT market corresponded with crypto rallies Enthusiasm for NFTs and more active deals corresponded with the crypto bull market. For the past 12 months, NFTs had two major spikes in both volumes and price action, correlating with the March-April rally. The last three months of 2024 also boosted NFT activity. NFT trading followed the performance of the crypto market in 2024. | Source: Nonfungible Art and collectible NFTs were the most active, as they were also tied to active social media promotion. The market for gaming and metaverse NFTs, however, remained niche and kept to its baseline. The split in NFTs showed collections and avatars still commanded mindshare, while utility NFTs and use cases did not matter as much. The most appealing use cases for NFTs were the potential airdrops and preferential access. Pudgy Penguins was the leader in 2024, with its PENGU airdrop , which led the collection to a new all-time high for the floor price. Briefly, a rare Pudgy Penguin surpassed $100,000, trading above the price of Bitcoin (BTC). After the airdrop, the collection returned to its baseline price floor at around 22 ETH. Milady Maker, formerly one of the top 5 collections, slid in the charts in the new year, as it remained one of the more volatile communities. Miladies were also one of the few collections overlapping with active meme token trading. Punks held their top position, while Bored Ape holders still tried to make the best of their NFT. The collection is still supported by influencers like Machi Big Brother, who periodically launches new projects with preferential entry for Ape NFT holders. NFTs still show signs of wash trading NFT trading may still include volumes specifically created by market makers, or other forms of wash trading. The lack of mass organic demand and hype also means some chains and collections are more exposed to wash trading. On Ethereum, up to 15.48% of the daily traffic is linked to wash trading, moving NFTs between connected wallets. The market remains relatively small, with just around 117 NFT items changing hands in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin-related Ordinals have around 6.25% in daily wash trading volumes, while for other chains like Solana, wash trading remains negligible. The share of wash trading may vary depending on collections and hype. This metric may reveal the risk of buying into a collection that later turns out to be illiquid. Predictions for 2025 are conflicting, with some believing NFT can never achieve mass appeal again. However, communities and collections are trying to maintain their mindshare, especially the holders of Azuki, Pudgy Penguins, BAYC and MAYC apes. One prediction for 2025 is that AI agents may revive the NFT market. So far, agents have not built collections or hyped existing ones. NFTs also need to compete with memes, which offer a much cheaper entry point.

Here are the key takeaways: Ethereum Will Outperform Solana in 2025 Messari predicts that Ethereum (ETH) will outperform Solana (SOL) throughout 2025 due to several factors: ETF Inflows: While Ethereum ETFs are expected to attract significant institutional interest, SOL ETFs may struggle to gain similar traction. FTX Liquidation: Over 11 million SOL will be removed from FTX property in March, leading to increased selling pressure. Market Dynamics: After a tough 2024, Ethereum is likely to attract marginal buyers in 2025, while Solana faces net selling as crypto-savvy investors turn to alternative assets. According to the analytics company, the ETH/SOL ratio, which is already showing signs of a peak, is expected to continue to decline. AI Tool Frameworks to Peak in Q1 2025 Messari believes that AI vehicle frameworks will reach their speculative peak in the first quarter of 2025, but interest will wane after that. Lack of Product-Market Fit: Unlike previous blockchain innovations, AI agents lack the proven demand or a defined user base to sustain long-term speculation. Speculative Cycle: Excitement around AI agents will wane as markets realize their limited utility beyond being experimental tools. Related News: Bitcoin Price Predictions Continue to Come from Investment Companies with the New Year! Here Are the Details Pudgy Penguins to Surpass CryptoPunks Popular NFT collectible Pudgy Penguins is predicted to surpass CryptoPunks as the PFP collectible in 2025. Value Creation: Pudgy Penguins leverages airdrops (PENGU) and external protocol distributions to create direct value for its owners. Mainstream Appeal: The brand’s rapid expansion into Web3 and mainstream markets is expected to further increase its cultural relevance and market value. Abstract Chain Integration: The launch of Abstract Chain will unlock additional value streams for the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. Peaq Will Surpass All Tier 2 Solutions Peaq, a rapidly rising blockchain project, is predicted to disrupt all other Layer 2 (L2) solutions by 2025. Market Positioning: Peaq is already a top 10 L2 with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $2.1 billion. Competitive Advantage: Its unique approach to network and ecosystem development is expected to provide an advantage over traditional L2s. Virtual's FDV to Surpass TAO's FDV in Q1 2025 Messari predicts a significant shift in valuation dynamics between VIRTUAL and TAO: TAO Supply Pressure: With a daily emission of $3.3 million, the value of TAO is likely to remain stagnant until the dTAO mechanism relieves the persistent supply pressure. VIRTUAL Growth: Increasing amounts of VIRTUAL are being locked up in intermediary liquidity pools (LPs). Hyperliquid's Momentum Could Slow While Hyperliquid is expected to continue to be a dominant trend in 2025, its performance may already be priced in by Q4 2024. Valuation Metrics: Hyperliquid’s FDV is currently 1/4 that of Solana, 1/2 that of Coinbase, and equal to FTT’s peak FDV, suggesting limited room for growth without new developments. *This is not investment advice.

Dubbed the “DOGE killer,” SHIB has consistently expanded its ecosystem with initiatives like ShibaSwap and its upcoming Layer 2 solution, Shibarium. Now, experts are speculating that SHIB could achieve a staggering 2000% growth and hit the elusive $0.01 mark by 2025.

SHIB’s Ecosystem vs. BeerBear’s Engagement Shiba Inu’s efforts to expand its ecosystem are commendable. Shibarium promises lower gas fees and faster transactions, while token burns aim to reduce supply and increase value. However, much of SHIB’s momentum relies on speculative growth, with long-term utility still in development. BeerBear, on the other hand, focuses on fostering community engagement in real-time. Its gamified ecosystem and rewards-based loyalty programs ensure token holders are not just passive investors but active participants in its success. This hands-on approach appeals to a new generation of crypto enthusiasts seeking more than price speculation. The Verdict: 2025 and Beyond While SHIB may have the infrastructure to climb to $0.01, BeerBear’s blend of innovation and engagement gives it a unique edge in the competitive meme token landscape. For investors, the choice could hinge on whether they value established ecosystems like SHIB’s or emerging, community-driven challengers like BeerBear.

This bounce not only reaffirms the significance of this zone but also sparks fresh hopes for a potential bullish breakout. With momentum building, the bulls appear to be gearing up for a rally, aiming to push SHIB toward higher resistance levels and beyond. The market sentiment surrounding SHIB has shifted positively, with speculation on the likelihood of a breakout above its next resistance levels. Technical indicators suggest growing bullish momentum, but the road ahead is challenging. Overcoming the immediate resistance will require sustained buying pressure and robust market participation. Key Support Holds Strong: The Importance Of $0.00002045 The $0.00002045 level has emerged as a cornerstone for Shiba Inu’s price trajectory, acting as a critical support zone in the current market structure. This level has consistently demonstrated its significance, providing a base for rebounds and serving as a key psychological level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu 260% Rally: Analyst Sees Classic Bullish Patterns Emerging Support levels like $0.00002045 are more than price markers; they represent zones where buying interest is strong enough to counter selling pressure, preventing further declines. For SHIB, this level has become a battleground, where bulls step in to defend against bearish momentum. Its recent successful rebound from this support highlights its importance, instilling confidence in market participants and signaling the potential for more gains. Furthermore, the $0.00002045 support aligns with broader market trends and key technical indicators, such as oversold signals on RSI or strong trading volume, reinforcing its role as a pivotal zone. As Shiba Inu navigates its path forward, this support level will continue to be a critical marker in determining whether the bulls can maintain control or if bears will gain the upper hand. Shiba Inu’s Next Move: Will The Bulls Maintain Control? Currently, SHIB is attempting to cross above the Simple Moving Average (SMA). A decisive move above this indicator could solidify the bullish narrative. Interestingly, this could open the door for further growth and increased market confidence, sparking a move toward the $0.00002631 resistance level. Key technical indicators, such as the RSI and trading volume, suggest rising interest. However, the bulls must capitalize on this momentum to avoid a possible reversal. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Testing A Significant Support Zone – Bullish Breakout Ahead? SHIB has surged to the $0.0000224 level after witnessing a rebound. Should the bulls falter, SHIB could face renewed bearish pressure, pulling the price back toward the critical $0.00002045 support level. This level will remain a focal point as reaching it could either reinvigorate bullish sentiment or act as a trigger for a deeper correction. Ultimately, SHIB’s next move will depend on how the bulls navigate this critical phase. Will they maintain control and drive the price toward fresh highs, or will the bears regain dominance? The coming days promise to be decisive for SHIB’s short-term trajectory.

The listing has boosted market confidence in both tokens, with the Peaq token nearing its all-time high and VANA showing steady gains. These price movements reflect growing interest in the unique utilities of these tokens, as investors gear up for increased trading opportunities. PEAQ and VANA Price Surge After Listing on Bithumb South Korea’s second-largest crypto exchange, Bithumb reported on January 2 that it will list PEAQ and Vana network tokens. Both tokens will be available in the KRW pairs, enabling users to trade them directly against the Korean Won. PEAQ’s base price was set at 853 KRW, while VANA debuted at 23,730 KRW on the exchange. The listing announcement detailed that deposits for both coins would begin within three hours of the notice, and trading would commence at 4 PM KST. Bithumb noted that deposits through non-native networks would not be supported to ensure seamless processing. Additionally, Bithumb emphasized transaction restrictions to safeguard user experience during the initial trading period. The exchange restricted buying orders for the first five minutes. The platform also limited sell orders to a range of -10% to +100% of the standard price. Traders could only use automatic trading after completing the first transaction. Price Performance and Market Context PEAQ price surged by 35% to $0.715, nearing its all-time high. It recorded a 24-hour low of $0.522 and a high of $0.72. It boasts a market cap of $463 million and a trading volume of $55.56 million. The token powers core DePIN functions like governance, transaction fees, and staking. As per DigitalCoinPrice , the average PEAQ price prediction for 2025 is $1.49. While by 2030, it may reach approximately $3.67. This L1 token remains unlisted on Binance and other top exchanges. Analysts believe that future listings could trigger exponential price surges as accessibility increases. Vana Network, a Layer 1 blockchain focused on decentralized data networks, empowers data ownership and incentivizes contributions to DataDAO through governance rights and token rewards. Its price surged 10% to $17.62, with a 24-hour low of $15.41 and a high of $17.83. The network boasts a market cap of $528 million and a trading volume of $169 million. Price predictions suggest Vana Network could reach $34 by 2025 and approximately $85 by 2030. Furthermore, DeBridge (DBR) price recently hit its all-time high after a 30% jump following its listing on Bithumb. Crypto listed in KRW pairs usually witnesses a pump-and-dump. Besides, it also reflects the strong influence of the top crypto exchanges among investors. However, analysts expect the utility and growing adoption of these tokens to drive their value higher, solidifying their market positions.

Trump’s every move as he steps back into the White House, ready to disrupt, change, and possibly supercharge the economy. His presidency is already shaking the ground beneath corporate boardrooms, trading floors, and blockchain offices across America. Trump’s second term has stocks betting on massive changes in market dynamics. Meanwhile, crypto players, sidelined and battered during the Biden years, see a golden window to push crypto even more into the mainstream. Everyone’s talking, speculating, and strategizing because 2025 is widely expected to make history. Many in the crypto community are calling it the “Golden Era.” Wall Street bets on Trump-fueled growth Wall Street’s biggest players are leaning into the idea of Trump’s pro-business agenda. JPMorgan Chase predicts a resurgence of what they call “U.S. exceptionalism,” driven by Trump’s America-first policies. Tariffs directed at foreign competitors are expected to tilt the playing field in favor of U.S. companies. Banks like JPMorgan believe this could cement America’s dominance in global markets. Inflation, though they warned , remains a wildcard. Trump’s aggressive trade policies and hardline stance on immigration are seen as factors that could keep inflation above the Federal Reserve’s targets. Apollo Global Management thinks progress toward controlling inflation will “take longer than expected,” and interest rate cuts, while anticipated, might come slower than markets hope. The stock market isn’t likely to replicate last year’s 20% returns, but they’re saying AI could keep things going for quite a long time. BNY Mellon Wealth Management is also bullish on AI’s transformative potential, calling it “the technology that will outshine every innovation that came before.” AI investments are expected to drive gains, even as other sectors face slower growth. Diversification is the game plan for 2025. Not everyone’s placing their chips on stocks though. Bonds are making a quiet comeback as income-generating assets. Wall Street is looking beyond stocks, exploring hedge funds, private markets, and alternative assets like crypto to get through what promises to be a volatile year. Crypto counts on Trump for a comeback Crypto executives see Trump as their industry’s long-awaited savior . After four years of hostile regulation under Biden, these guys are betting that Trump will bring the kind of change that puts blockchain at the center of America’s financial future. His campaign promises included building a strategic Bitcoin reserve and forming a crypto advisory council, which he has actually already done. Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission was Paul Atkins, one of Bitcoin’s earliest investors. He also sits on advisory boards for crypto organizations like Securitize and The Digital Chamber. Trump’s Treasury Secretary nominee, Scott Bessent, is a proud crypto lover who famously said, “Crypto isn’t just about money. It’s about freedom.” Commerce Secretary pick Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, brings deep connections to stablecoin giant Tether. And then there’s Elon Musk, now leading a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), a nod to an industry that considers him a hero. The excitement doesn’t stop there. Trump’s administration is expected to repeal SAB 121, a controversial accounting rule that forces institutions holding digital tokens to treat them as liabilities. This rule has kept big banks and fund managers out of the crypto market. If Trump scraps it, experts believe it could open the floodgates for Wall Street’s entry into digital assets. Access to banking services is another critical issue. Under Biden, as we reported , crypto companies accused regulators of creating “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” effectively blocking them from accessing top-tier financial services. Trump’s administration has promised to reverse this. Coinbase’s legal officer, Paul Grewal, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance, “The incoming administration has the opportunity to reverse so many poor crypto policy decisions, chief among them politically motivated regulatory decisions like Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” Lobbyists paved the way for Trump’s crypto pivot The crypto industry quite literally fought for Trump’s election victory. The pro-crypto Super PAC Fairshake poured $135 million into the election cycle, securing victories for 294 pro-crypto politicians in Congress. By comparison, only 134 anti-crypto lawmakers won seats. Fairshake’s efforts were bankrolled by some of the biggest names in the industry. Coinbase, Ripple, and Andreessen Horowitz were among the top contributors. Ripple alone put $25 million into the PAC. The company also donated $5 million to Trump’s inauguration. Stuart Alderoty, general counsel at Ripple, called the election results “a decisive victory for the crypto community.” These lobbying efforts were also about building a Congress that would back crypto-friendly policies. Fairshake strategically targeted anti-crypto candidates, focusing on issues like border security to win over skeptical voters. With the 2026 midterms on the horizon, the PAC has already raised $78 million to continue its work. Last year, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs, a decision that finally brought regulated crypto investment products to the U.S. market. BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, the largest of its kind, now manages nearly $60 billion in assets. Pension funds in states like Wisconsin and Michigan have started holding Bitcoin through these funds, signaling growing institutional acceptance. Bitcoin itself has smashed through the $100,000 mark, triggering a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out). Investors who previously avoided the market are now rushing back in.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 10:05:00

Table of Contents Ripple in 2025: Could Trump’s presidency catalyze XRP higher? DTX Exchange: A new bold step in the DeFi revolution Investors could embrace DTX Exchange for a 10x return The intersection of politics and crypto often creates seismic shifts. With Trump’s return to the presidency, the XRP community is buzzing with excitement. This positive situation could bring regulatory clarity to the crypto space which Ripple Labs have been waiting for. But XRP isn’t the only token making waves. The spotlight is also on DTX Exchange, a rising star in the crypto world poised for a potential breakthrough. With whispers of a Coinbase listing on the horizon, this exchange is gaining traction and could hit $1. Let’s analyze how political shifts and strategic listings could reshape the future of XRP and DTX Exchange and why now might be the time to pay attention. Ripple in 2025: Could Trump’s presidency catalyze XRP higher? With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, speculations about the future of crypto abound, especially among those with a penchant for XRP tokens. During his first regime, this asset surged over 350%. This has spurred conversations about whether this new regime could finally take XRP to the moon. However, XRP has been down by 11% over the past 30 days due to general bearish sentiments, as it trades at $2.16 at the time of writing. Still, a silver lining exists. With Paul Atkins replacing Gary Gensler as the SEC Chair , crypto analysts are considering how this may bring better clarity into the crypto regulatory environment. Also, rumors of a potential XRP ETF could increase institutional interest in Ripple, and holders can expect to see it rise beyond its all-time high of $3.84. As XRP price steals the headlines, DTX Exchange is also doing its thing. Let’s explore the possibilities of this viral altcoin more. You might also like: DTX Exchange mirrors the 21,500% surge of Cardano during the last bull cycle DTX Exchange: A new bold step in the DeFi revolution Amid this growing political landscape, DTX Exchange managed to find a niche with its approach to DeFi. By initiating a hybrid model, DTX Exchange combines the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges into a hub that is truly accessible, fast, and innovative for the modern trader. Probably the most impressive feature of DTX Exchange is that it supports 120,000 financial instruments, from traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and forex to cryptocurrencies and tokenized ETFs. The inclusion of leverage trading (1:1,000) adds to its appeal, making DTX especially attractive to high-stakes traders looking to amplify their gains. The DTX innovation core is the VulcanX blockchain, which can process more than 100,000 transactions per second. This incredible speed surpasses even top-tier blockchains and allows traders to execute deals in real-time. But DTX is more than just a fast and feature-rich platform. Its asset tokenization feature on-chain could change how investors access previously illiquid markets. On-chain reports over 300,000 wallets holding DTX tokens, indicating a strong and active community. Equally impressive is its presale to date, which has raised over $11.2 million. Currently, at $0.14 in its seventh presale round, investors could snag a few tokens before a future price increase. As the project edges closer to a top-tier exchange listing, especially on Coinbase, experts predict DTX Exchange could reach $1, about 10x its current presale price. With its hybrid model, a wide variety of assets offered and technology, it’s well-poised to take the top slot in DeFi. Investors could embrace DTX Exchange for a 10x return As the crypto market braces for a new political shift, Ripple and DTX Exchange may offer exciting investment possibilities. The Trump administration could bring better clarity to the regulatory landscape and resolve XRP’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. This development may result in XRP’s next move being monumental. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange emerges as a game-changer in the DeFi space. Its diverse asset offerings and cutting-edge VulcanX blockchain technology have positioned it as a serious contender in the crypto world. A Coinbase listing could propel DTX to the $1 milestone, further solidifying its status as an asset to watch. For investors, these developments highlight the importance of staying informed and ready to seize the moment.

The SHIB daily chart clearly shows that there exists a strong resistance at the $0.000029 level. The expert asserts that the market needs to surpass the aforesaid resistance level strongly to achieve the predicted growth. Currently, the price of SHIB remains nearly 29.52% below the resistance level.

The metrics indicate that the trading volume of SHIB is on the rise. Interestingly, Bitcoin and Etheruem have shown signs of stabilisation.

These sentiments will drive crypto volatility, shaping its trade throughout the year. The election of President Trump has brought uncertainties in the crypto space, from trading to regulations. While his position on cryptocurrency has sparked positive sentiments, this has also created anxiety in policymaking. Fed’s role in 2025 remains unpredictable In January 2024, futures traders held an optimistic outlook, anticipating a series of interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve to stave off recessionary pressures. However, reality diverged sharply from expectations, with monetary policy remaining restrictive. A similar story played out in 2023 when hopes for lower borrowing costs to combat inflation went unmet. Could 2025 break this trend? Last year, the Federal Reserve adopted a less aggressive stance than many had predicted, largely because the US economy demonstrated remarkable resilience. Even recession fears began to wane as growth persisted. Meanwhile, US lawmakers maintained a low profile on economic interventions throughout 2024, but the Trump administration’s return could potentially spark more proactive policy measures. While the American consumer has continued to defy forecasts, sustaining robust economic activity in the world’s largest economy, the global landscape paints a less optimistic picture, with many regions struggling to maintain comparable momentum. AI may take a front seat in crypto trading and security in 2025 AI will be critical in advancing cryptocurrency trading and security in 2025. The AI trading algorithms will be more active. Most traders will leverage AI to identify market opportunities as they complete deals instantly and respond immediately to volatility. There may be increased use of AI for crypto security and privacy. AI algorithms can easily identify anomalies and, therefore, can be used to detect and prevent scams and even hacks. The crypto industry lost more than $2.2 billion in 2024. The industry cannot let its guard down even for a minute, and AI might provide a lasting solution.

Các trợ lý AI đang được giao những nhiệm vụ quan trọng như thực hiện giao dịch và quản lý ví tiền điện tử, giúp mọi thứ trở nên hiệu quả và nhanh chóng hơn bao giờ hết. Các dự án như AI16z cho thấy tiềm năng to lớn của việc sử dụng AI để tối ưu hóa mạng lưới blockchain. Tuy nhiên, cũng có những rủi ro tiềm ẩn, chẳng hạn như việc AI bị thao túng. Vì vậy, cần phải có những biện pháp bảo vệ nghiêm ngặt để đảm bảo an toàn cho hệ thống. AI ảnh hưởng đến tài sản kỹ thuật số như thế nào? Sự kết hợp giữa AI và tài sản kỹ thuật số đang tạo ra một làn sóng thay đổi mạnh mẽ. Các “chiến binh” AI đang được “tuyển dụng” để quản lý hệ thống tiền tệ kỹ thuật số. Eliza Labs và Stanford University đang hợp tác để nghiên cứu cách AI tự động có thể tác động đến chức năng, bảo mật và khả năng mở rộng của hệ sinh thái tài sản kỹ thuật số. Một trong những lợi thế chính của AI là khả năng xử lý lượng lớn dữ liệu trong thời gian thực, cho phép đưa ra quyết định sáng suốt hơn và cải thiện tốc độ giao dịch. Dự án AI16z, một bot AI chạy trên blockchain, cho thấy tiềm năng của việc kết hợp AI và công nghệ phi tập trung để tạo ra các tác nhân thông minh, tự quản lý, có khả năng nâng cao chức năng của mạng lưới blockchain. Tuy nhiên, việc tích hợp AI cũng mang đến những rủi ro và thách thức đáng kể. Gần đây, đã có những trường hợp AI bị thao túng và quản lý sai tài sản kỹ thuật số, chẳng hạn như trường hợp một người dùng đã lừa một AI chuyển $50.000 đô tiền điện tử. Điều này cho thấy cần thiết phải có các biện pháp bảo vệ mạnh mẽ, hướng dẫn đạo đức và biện pháp an toàn để ngăn chặn việc lạm dụng hay khai thác AI. Liệu AI đã sẵn sàng để quản lý tài sản kỹ thuật số? Bảo mật là một vấn đề cực kỳ quan trọng khi AI ngày càng được tích hợp vào hệ sinh thái tiền điện tử. Mặc dù AI được thiết kế để học hỏi và thích ứng, nhưng bảo mật của chúng chỉ mạnh mẽ khi các thuật toán, dữ liệu đào tạo và biện pháp bảo vệ được nhúng trong thiết kế. Một mối quan tâm khác là khả năng AI bị khai thác. Những lỗ hổng này thường xuất phát từ các biện pháp bảo vệ chưa đầy đủ, thiếu khung đạo đức hoặc lỗi trong lập trình. Để giải quyết những điểm yếu này, cần phải có các thử nghiệm nghiêm ngặt, thực hành phát triển an toàn và cập nhật liên tục để chống lại các mối đe dọa mới nổi. Một thách thức khác nằm ở sự thiếu minh bạch của nhiều hệ thống AI, đặc biệt là những hệ thống sử dụng thuật toán học máy hoạt động như “ hộp đen “. Chúng ta có thể mong đợi gì từ sự kết hợp giữa AI và tiền điện tử? Tương lai của AI và tiền điện tử là sự hội tụ của hai công nghệ mang tính cách mạng có tiềm năng định hình lại tài chính toàn cầu và tương tác kỹ thuật số. AI có khả năng xử lý lượng lớn dữ liệu, phát hiện các mẫu và tối ưu hóa việc ra quyết định, bổ sung cho tính phi tập trung và minh bạch của công nghệ blockchain. Sự hợp tác giữa các nhà phát triển, nhà hoạch định chính sách và nhà nghiên cứu học thuật sẽ rất cần thiết để thiết lập các hướng dẫn đạo đức và biện pháp bảo vệ cho các ứng dụng AI trong lĩnh vực tiền điện tử. Nói một cách đơn giản, AI và tiền điện tử có thể kết hợp với nhau để tạo ra một hệ thống siêu việt, nơi các chương trình AI tự động thực hiện các giao dịch an toàn, quản lý tài sản kỹ thuật số và giúp mạng lưới blockchain hoạt động trơn tru hơn. Ví dụ : AI có thể dự đoán trước tình trạng tắc nghẽn giao dịch và tự động điều chỉnh phí, giúp cho việc giao dịch diễn ra nhanh chóng và tiết kiệm chi phí hơn. Trong tương lai, AI sẽ đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc giải quyết những thách thức lớn của ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử như giúp phát hiện gian lận và tăng cường bảo mật, giảm thiểu rủi ro bị tấn công hay bị thao túng. Tóm lại là: AI có tiềm năng to lớn để cách mạng hóa cách chúng ta quản lý và tương tác với tài sản kỹ thuật số. Tuy nhiên, các vấn đề như cân nhắc về đạo đức, cải thiện sai lệch thuật toán và nguy cơ tập trung hóa trong các hệ thống do AI kiểm soát phải được giải quyết để đảm bảo rằng các công nghệ này phát huy hết tiềm năng của chúng mà không ảnh hưởng đến các nguyên tắc cơ bản như phân quyền và minh bạch để có thể cùng nhau tạo ra một hệ sinh thái tài chính kỹ thuật số hiệu quả, an toàn và minh bạch hơn.

Tomaino offered a detailed analysis of why Ethereum is well-positioned for significant growth: Ethereum continues to attract top crypto developers, as it has for over seven years. Layer 2 networks like Base are becoming innovation hubs, hosting a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps) across sectors like DeFi, NFTs, stablecoins, prediction markets, decentralized social networks, and more. Emerging use cases such as gaming, payments, AI agents, and “X-to-earn” models are also likely to find a home on Ethereum. Network Effects and Ecosystem Leadership Ethereum’s early adoption of innovative use cases has yielded strong and defensible network effects. Successful implementations on Ethereum often set the standard for other blockchains to later copy. Tomaino pointed to NFTs and stablecoins as examples of where Ethereum continues its undeniable dominance. Adoption at Institutional and Local Levels Institutional and grassroots adoption of ETH as a currency is increasing. Ethereum ETFs saw strong inflows in 2024, and Tomaino predicts this trend will accelerate in 2025 as Wall Street deepens its understanding of ETH. At the same time, the expansion of applications on Layer 2 and upcoming Layer 3 networks will enable greater local adoption of ETH. *This is not investment advice.

Specifically, similar to April when X gave doge-themed digital assets a boost with its temporary logo change, KEKIUS was rocketed by Elon Musk’s decision to change his name on the platform to Kekius Maximus . Elon Musk’s X profile when he changed his name and image to Kekius Maximus . Source: BBC The switch, often described as ‘bizarre,’ enabled one early KEKIUS MAXIMUS investor to turn the $66 he spent buying the meme coin around December 14 on Uniswap ( UNI ) into $3.05 million, according to data retrieved via Lookonchain on January 2. The entire maneuver was executed across 18 days, with the first sale coming already on December 17 and being followed by a series of such trades executed on the edge between the old and the new year when KEKIUS was surging. The KEKIUS trade. Source: Lookonchain Was the KEKIUS trade the crowning achievement of the 2024 meme coin market? In many ways, the incredibly lucrative investment concluded an otherwise strong year for meme coin investors. Indeed, 2024 featured numerous stories of traders turning tens, hundreds, or thousands of dollars into hundreds of thousands and even millions with cryptocurrencies such as HAWTUAH and MOODENG . Still, it is worth remembering that there is a winning bias and that, despite multiple incredible rags-to-riches stories, it is likely that the vast majority of meme coin traders lost far more than they gained. If the original HAWKTUAH trades of the unofficial fan token generated significant success stories, Hailey Welch’s – the Hawk Tuah Girl’s – official digital asset, launched towards the end of 2024, plummeted so significantly and rapidly that it led to a class-action lawsuit. How the KEKIUS trade fits within the pattern of Elon Musk pumps Additionally, the KEKIUS trade is emblematic of another surprisingly common occurrence in the cryptocurrency market: the Elon Musk pumps. The South African-Canadian-American billionaire has, on multiple occasions in recent years, helped specific digital assets experience remarkable rallies. Along with KEKIUS MAXIMUS, the most notable examples include Dogecoin’s ( DOGE ) original massive rally toward $0.69 – a high not reclaimed since the original Elon Musk pump – and Bitcoin ( BTC ) which essentially doubled in value during its brief tenure as a payment vehicle accepted by Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ).

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA.

Here are the detailed insights from each of the key areas Qureshi covered: Crypto Predictions 2025 By Haseeb Qureshi #1 A Blurring Line Between L1s/L2s: In his crypto predictions 2025, Qureshi forecasts the diminishing distinctions between Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, forecasting a major consolidation within the blockchain industry. “The era of differentiating L1s from L2s based on technical capabilities is over. It’s now about carving out niches and enhancing user stickiness,” he declares. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Capitalizes On Elon Musk’s X Name Change For 17,000% Return This shift implies a future where strategic market positioning and user experience outweigh pure technological innovation. “EVM will not only retain its dominance but expand, driven by platforms like Base, Monad, and Berachain,” he further asserts. Qureshi credits this growth to the vast repositories of Solidity training data, which will empower language models to write advanced application code in 2025, marking a significant transition towards AI-driven development within blockchain ecosystems. #2 Better Token Launches: Qureshi’s crypto predictions 2025 also foresee a revolution in token distribution mechanisms. He sees the industry moving away from large-scale airdrops, which often prioritize quantity over quality of engagement. “We’ll see a more strategic approach, where token distribution is aligned with long-term user engagement and project viability,” he notes. For projects with clear metrics and defined goals, tokens will be used as tools to enhance user retention and incentivize meaningful interactions. Meanwhile, projects lacking concrete metrics will likely pivot towards structured crowdsales to build and maintain a dedicated user base. Furthermore, he predicts that “memecoins will continue to lose market share to AI agent coins. I consider this a migration from financial nihilism to financial over-optimism. (Yep I’m coining that.).” #3 Accelerated Stablecoin Adoption: Stablecoins are set to become a cornerstone of business transactions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) seeking reliable and instant financial settlements. “We’re on the brink of seeing SMBs broadly adopt stablecoins, driven not just by their efficiency but by increasing institutional trust and involvement,” Qureshi noted. He anticipates significant movements from banks, including new stablecoin launches as financial institutions seek to capture part of this burgeoning market. Moreover, he remarks, “With Howard Lutnick as Secretary of Commerce, institutional hesitance will decrease, securing Tether’s top position amidst growing competition.” He adds, “Expect Ethena to gobble up even more capital, especially as treasury yields continue to decline over the coming year. When the opportunity cost of capital declines, it makes basis trade yields even more attractive.” #4 A Cautious Regulatory Advance: The regulatory outlook within Qureshi’s crypto predictions 2025 suggests a mixed bag of advancements and setbacks. According to him, 2025 will witness evolving regulations, with specific legislation around stablecoins likely to pass in the US. Related Reading: Top Crypto Assets For Q1 2025: Grayscale Reveals The Best Altcoins However, comprehensive market reforms such as the Financial Innovation Technology of the 21st Century Act (FIT21) might face delays. “While we see the regulatory framework for stablecoins strengthening, broader financial technology reforms will lag, creating a piecemeal regulatory environment,” he predicts. Additionally, Qureshi foresees that Fortune 100 companies will become more willing to offer crypto to consumers under the Trump administration. “Trump’s inauguration will create a perceived regulatory jubilee until clear rules and enforcement priorities are set. During this window, expect to see aggressive expansion of crypto integration into Web2 platforms,” he remarks. #5 AI Agents Will Evolve Beyond The Hype: A significant portion of Qureshi’s crypto predictions 2025 involves the role of AI agents in reshaping the crypto landscape. He criticizes the current state of AI agents, suggesting, “Today’s AI agents are essentially sophisticated chatbots linked to cryptocurrencies. They lack true agency and are primarily designed for interactions rather than autonomous operation.” Despite these limitations, he believes the role of AI in crypto will grow significantly, moving from novelty to necessity. “AI’s capability to automate and enhance blockchain operations will lead to a software development renaissance, drastically lowering the barriers to entry for blockchain applications,” he forecasts. #6 Crypto x AI: Looking beyond 2025, Qureshi envisions a deeper integration between crypto and AI technologies. “As we refine AI capabilities and regulatory frameworks, crypto will increasingly facilitate AI operations, leading to autonomous agents conducting transactions and managing their own economies on blockchain networks,” he stated. This interplay is expected to revolutionize user experiences and operational efficiencies, paving the way for a new era of decentralized and autonomous digital ecosystems.

The stock lost more than 44% of its value, now trading at $289. Over the past two weeks, the stock’s valuation has dropped by 34%, according to TradingView data . This sharp decline has caused some analysts to question the viability of MicroStrategy’s approach, especially as other companies adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset on a much smaller scale. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, commented on the situation, suggesting that the momentum generated by Bitcoin’s influence on MSTR’s stock appears to be dissipating. “With MicroStrategy shares now down 44% from their peak, the Bitcoin tailwind generated by this narrative seems to be losing steam,” Thielen noted. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings As of December 31, 2024, per Bitbo data, MicroStrategy continues to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin, totaling 446,400 BTC. The company’s average purchase price stands at $58,219 per Bitcoin, with an overall investment of approximately $23.41 billion. Despite its stock’s struggles, MicroStrategy has continued to add to its Bitcoin holdings, purchasing an additional 2,138 BTC at an average price of $97,837 per coin at the tail-end of 2024. The acquisition marks the continuation of an eight-week streak of Bitcoin purchases, signaling the company’s ongoing commitment to the cryptocurrency. Some analysts, including well-known crypto enthusiast @matt_utxo, remain optimistic about MicroStrategy’s prospects. Matt, in a December 31 tweet, predicted that the stock is nearing a bottom, forecasting a potential stabilization between $270 and $300 per share. Here's some $MSTR cope to finish out 2024… we have a very big 2025 ahead of us. TL;DR I think that $MSTR is in the process of bottoming and will find its footing in the $270-$300 range (this would satisfy the gap from November 11, it could potentially wick to $250 or lower,… pic.twitter.com/3N7UTLh20D — Matt (@matt_utxo) December 31, 2024 He suggested that the stock could briefly dip as low as $250, but he sees strength within the $270 to $300 range, which could present buying opportunities for investors in the coming weeks. Matt attributed the recent sharp decline in MSTR stock to what he called the “popping bubble,” explaining that the stock had previously decoupled from Bitcoin during its rally but has now experienced a reversal. The crypto analyst went on to describe the stock’s price downtick as a “reverse gamma squeeze,” where the unwinding of positions by traders and the selling of shares by broker-dealers amplified the downward pressure. He believes that the decline may soon come to an end, with signs of strength emerging for MSTR. Bitcoin’s role in MSTR’s performance Meanwhile, in late December, MicroStrategy’s chairman and controlling shareholder Michael Saylor revealed that the company filed a preliminary proxy with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking approval from shareholders to increase the number of authorized class A common shares. The increase in authorized shares would provide capital to purchase more Bitcoins and could capture a significant supply of the cryptocurrency, based on Bitcoin’s current price of around $95,500 per coin, a plan Saylor wants to see through. A stronger connection between Bitcoin’s price movements and MicroStrategy’s stock could lead to renewed investor interest and potential recovery for MSTR after its sharp decline. That said, the market sentiment has notably shifted to a more cautious stance, with traders reevaluating their positions in the wake of the equity’s recent struggles.

Blockchain security firm CertiK reported that total known losses in December amounted to $28.6 million, a sharp decline from $63.8 million in November and $115.8 million in October . December Records Lowest Monthly Losses in 2024 Exploits dominated the December losses, accounting for $26.7 million. Among the most significant incidents was a $2.1 million attack on DeFi platform GemPad, where an exploiter took advantage of vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. Another major event involved the DeFi project FEG, whose token bridge was compromised, resulting in a $1 million loss due to flaws in its cross-chain message verification process. Moreover, DEX platform Clipper reported a loss of $450,000 in an exploit on December 1 due to a private key leak. Security firm PeckShield corroborated these findings, noting a 71% reduction in hack-related losses in December compared to November. Across over 25 incidents, the LastPass exploit from mid-December emerged as the most severe, with $12.3 million drained from crypto wallets. This breach stems from a December 2022 data leak, which continues to expose LastPass users to hack, compounding losses over time. Annual Crypto Hack Surges While December provided a momentary reprieve, the broader picture for 2024 painted a different story. Cyvers’ 2024 Web3 Security Report, shared on Dec. 24, revealed that $2.3 billion worth of crypto was stolen across 165 incidents throughout the year—a 40% increase from 2023’s $1.69 billion but still 37% lower than 2022’s staggering $3.78 billion. The rise in 2024 was attributed primarily to access control breaches targeting centralized exchanges and crypto custodians, highlighting an evolving threat landscape. Notably, DeFi protocols were significant targets, with vulnerabilities in smart contracts and cross-chain systems repeatedly exploited by attackers. Incidents like DeFi market protocol Radiant Capital in late October further underscored the sector’s vulnerabilities. Looking ahead, the crypto industry faces mounting pressure to strengthen security measures. With billions at stake and an increasing focus on centralized platforms, 2025 is set to test whether lessons from 2024 can lead to better defenses or if hackers will continue to find new avenues for exploitation.

Among these highly speculative assets that are navigating both the AI and the memecoin narratives of 2024, three are leading. On January 2, 2025, Finbold retrieved data from CoinGecko ’s consolidated “AI meme coins” market cap. By writing time, the AI meme coins total capitalization was precisely at $10.9 billion, up 25.3% in 24 hours. Three tokens, however, dominate the category by more than 40%, summing up to a nearly $4.60 billion market cap. These leading AI-related cryptocurrencies are AI16Z , FARTCOIN , and ZEREBRO , with a $2.50 billion, $1.37 billion, and $715 million capitalization, respectively. Essentially, the cryptocurrency aggregator defines this category as “Meme coins related or inspired by AI. They either leverage AI-powered agents, are created using AI tools, or derive their concept from AI technologies and trends.” Top AI meme coins by market cap. Source: CoinGecko Top 3 leading AI meme coins The largest AI meme coin by market cap is ai16z (AI16Z), an AI-managed crypto fund, governed by the ai16zDAO. This project is named after the prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (commonly abbreviated as a16z). Yet, there is reportedly no relation to Andreesen Horowitz, being a satire (or a meme) to generate buzz. Interestingly, DAO members, who are also token holders, can provide investment suggestions to the AI – a large language model (LLM). As cygaar (@0xcygaar) illustrated in a post on X, the token is linked to the Eliza AI, the AI16z’s backbone. A simple explanation of how @ai16zdao 's eliza framework works 🧵: pic.twitter.com/iARMzPSQFg — cygaar (@0xCygaar) January 1, 2025 AI16Z is currently trading at $2.28. According to Ejaaz (@cryptopunk7213), it has added over $1 billion market cap in the last five days alone. The analyst believes that AI16Z and Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUALS ) will “be priced as L1s this cycle,” forecasting higher capital inflows. As reported by Colin Wu, Binance Futures just listed AI16Z, ZEREBRO, and GRIFFAIN for derivatives trading. FARTCOIN, the second-largest AI meme token by market cap, is already trading on the platform since late December. By press time, FARTCOIN and ZEREBRO were trading at $1.39 and $0.70, respectively. The memecoin surge in 2024 Notably, this current market trend is an inheritance of the memecoin mania observed last year. According to data DWF Labs shared with Finbold on January 2, the memecoin sector grew from $20 billion to $120 billion in 2024, a 500% increase. 2024 memecoin total market cap growth (in US$B). Source: DWF Labs However, meme coins have characteristics that resemble financial bubbles, which traders should be aware of. The “Greater Fool Theory” explains the dynamics seen on these speculative tokens, moved primarily by social hype and buzz without any organic demand. Traders buy the token with the expectation that a “greater fool” will pay a higher price in the future. Nevertheless, the scheme fades away once there are no “greater fools” to continue fueling the price up, often facing liquidity issues and death spirals. Finbold has reported cases of massive gains or huge losses involving memecoin trading. A volatility that remains true for the now growing AI meme tokens, requiring extreme caution.

This rebound may accelerate in the near term as crypto investors anticipate the approval of a SOL ETF. The rally may also be because of the January Effect, where most assets rise as investors return to their offices after the Christmas break. Let’s explore how high Solana might go if SOL ETF is approved in January 2025. How Much Can Solana Price Rally If SOL ETF Is Approved in January 2025 Solana price has been in a consolidation mode just below the support at $200 after crashing by over 20% from its highest level of January in 2024. It coincided with Bitcoin’s correction, which caused other cryptocurrencies to tumble as well. But how high can Solana go if the highly anticipated spot Solana ETF is approved by the US SEC in January 2025? According to Polymarket data , the odds of a SOL ETF being approved later this year sit at a whopping 75%. However, if this approval gets fastracked and a spot Solana ETF is approved before the end of January 2025, Solana’s value could skyrocket. Solana ETF Approval Odds Solana’s ETF is the most anticipated and key catalyst that has the potential to restart the bull run that SOL began in 2025. However, this approval will likely happen after the current SEC chair, Gary Gensler, exits from his position later this month. Gensler’s SEC hinted that it would reject already applied ETFs, arguing that Solana was an unregistered security. Another poll shows that the odds of approval by July 31 are at 65%. That is possibly due to the new SEC chairman candidate, Paul Atkins, who is much more welcoming of the crypto space. Eric Balchunas, the Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has estimated that a Solana ETF will be approved after others like a Bitcoin and Ethereum combination, Litecoin, and Hedera Hashgraph. A SOL ETF approval would be a bullish development for the coin as it would introduce institutional capital to the coin. A good example of this is Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have attracted billions of dollars in inflows in the past few months. Meanwhile, Solana – and other coins – may benefit because of the January Effect. In some instances, financial assets rise in January as investors return after the Christmas holiday. SOL Price Technical Analysis The 3 day chart shows that value of SOL price has been in an uptrend, forming numerous bullish chart patterns. It formed a symmetrical triangle chart pattern between March 2024 and November last year. This triangle came after a strong rally, resembling a bullish pennant pattern, a popular bullish sign. A pennant has long flag pole-like line and a triangle. Solana retreated in December and moved slightly below the support at $206, the highest point in March. A break and retest is a common continuation sign in the markets. This formation means that the coin may have a rebound this year. Solana Price Chart Solana Price Targets By measuring the size of the bullish pennant pattern, and then extrapolating it from the first support at $126 (January 2024 high), we can estimate that SOL price will surge to $1,290 in 2025. Such a price action would represent a 923% surge from the current level. The bullish SOL price forecast will become invalid if the token crashes below the first support at $126.

Last time round the DXY Index, which measures the currency's value against a basket of the U.S.' major trading partners, peaked in December before trailing off for the next 12 months, coinciding with bitcoin's ( BTC ) 2017 bull run. It's possible the story will be different this time around. The index has not shown signs of tailing off, and Trump's economic policies and the Federal Reserve's actions are likely to underpin the greenback's rally. Yet, while a strong dollar is considered negative for risk assets, the incoming president has expressed his support for bitcoin and the largest cryptocurrency has shot up since his election. That rally, which saw it touching multiple record highs, may not continue at quite the same pace, according to Andre Dragosch, Bitwise's head of research in Europe. BTC is currently priced about 10% below the record of around $108,300 it hit in mid-December. ""The Fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment,"" Dragosch said in an interview over X. ""Either risk a U.S. recession by doing too little, too late or risk a significant acceleration in inflation again."" Trump has vowed to impose tariffs on major trading partners, which has the potential to exacerbate global geopolitical uncertainty, fueling further demand for the dollar, which is perceived as a haven during times of unrest. We are also seeing strong economic performance from the U.S. compared with other markets, with over 3% growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and higher-than-targeted inflation, which keeps federal funds rates elevated and only two interest-rate cuts forecast for 2025. The Fed has ""communicated to markets that they will do only two cuts in 2025 - significantly less than previously anticipated,"" Dragosch said. ""That’s why the dollar has been appreciating, and yields have continued to move up. I think that’s what’s been weighing on BTC as well. Macro is a headwind right now.""",Markets|U.S. Dollar|Bitcoin|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-02 11:54:42

The update was teased on January 2 in a post by Uniswap Labs on X , featuring a Unicode graphic of “2025” and the caption, “v4 is coming soon.” It is worth noting that the announcement didn’t specify a release date. Uniswap Labs Looks Ahead with Optimism for 2025 On December 31, Uniswap Labs expressed enthusiasm for the upcoming year, stating, “Between v4, Unichain, and a few other surprises… it’s going to be a very pink year.” In June 2023, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams posted his vision for Uniswap v4 while releasing the draft code, saying that it could be built in public with open feedback and meaningful community contribution. Initially, the team aimed to launch v4 in Q3 2024 following Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade. However, the platform remained in the testing phase throughout the year. In November, Uniswap introduced a $15.5 million bug bounty program for its v4 core smart contracts, offering payouts starting at $2,000 for identifying vulnerabilities requiring code modifications. Uniswap v4 is expected to introduce major architectural changes, including features such as Hooks for executing custom code before and after swaps. These enhancements will enable functionalities like limit orders, custom oracles, fee management, and automated liquidity strategies. Other updates include dynamic fees, gas savings, flash accounting, native ETH support, and multiple pool types. Now that the launch of Dencun on Mainnet has been scheduled for March 2024, we're excited to provide an update to the community! Uniswap v4's launch is tentatively set for Q3 2024. From community-built Hooks ( https://t.co/WyaGr1Ti1t ), to events, to Twitter Spaces, the… — Uniswap Foundation (@UniswapFND) February 15, 2024 The last significant update to Uniswap, v3, launched in May 2021, introduced concentrated liquidity, allowing providers to allocate liquidity within specific price ranges. Uniswap continues to dominate the decentralized exchange (DEX) landscape. In December, DEX trading volumes reached a record $462 billion, with Uniswap accounting for $106 billion, according to DefiLlama. Meanwhile, its native token, UNI, has seen a 6% daily gain, trading at $14, although it remains 69% below its May 2021 all-time high of $44.92, per CoinGecko. Uniswap’s Unichain to Launch its Layer 2 Mainnet in 2025 As reported, Uniswap is gearing up to launch Unichain , its DeFi-focused Layer 2 solution built on the OP Stack, with the public mainnet expected to debut in early 2025. The network, designed to enhance scalability and efficiency in decentralized finance, has been tested on Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet since October. The Sepolia testnet has processed over 50 million test transactions and deployed more than 4 million smart contracts, maintaining an uptime exceeding 99% across critical services. In August, the Uniswap Foundation unveiled its financial summary for the second quarter , revealing a lot of cash and stablecoins and not so many UNI tokens. The report revealed that the Uniswap foundation holds $36.81 million in cash and stablecoins, alongside a modest reserve of 680,000 UNI tokens. These cash and stablecoin reserves are earmarked for grant-making and operational purposes, while the UNI tokens are allocated for employee incentives. During Q2, the Uniswap Foundation approved over $3.2 million in new grants and distributed nearly $2.5 million from previously committed grants.

The venture analyzed millions of transactions spanning five continents, monitoring a total volume in excess of 3 billion USDT, the largest stablecoin, T3 said in a statement. T3 involves TRM Labs using its blockchain intelligence and monitoring tools to help Tron and Tether identify and freeze USDT linked to illicit activities. There's nearly $60 billion in USDT issued on the Tron blockchain, the largest issuance behind Ethereum, which has just over $75 billion. Money laundering as a service — where bad actors hire entities on the dark web to clean illict funds — is the largest source of frozen funds, said Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at TRM Labs. Investment scams, illicit drugs, terrorism financing, blackmail scams, hacks, exploits and even violent crime have also been targets, he said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""Blockchain is a bad place to do money laundering because it's so transparent. We can confirm victim reports on a public blockchain and even identify other victims, a level of insight that just isn't possible with traditional finance,"" Janczewski said. As much as 3 million of the frozen USDT had ties to North Korea, which has been active in trying to infiltrate crypto projects in order to fundraise for the country's leadership regime, T3 said. The U.S. Department of Treasury announced in December that it had shut down a North Korea money laundering network. ""Ultimately, we hope that through our efforts, not only will victims recover their funds, but bad actors will think twice before engaging in illicit activity on blockchains like Tron,"" Janczewski said.",Policy|Crime|Tether|Tron|TRM Labs|freezing,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-02 12:00:00

Accompanied by a technical chart, his tweet proclaimed that XRP is poised for a significant price surge, potentially breaking its all-time high. The tweet read:“#XRPHolders Get Your A** Ready #XRP Is Ready To Explode All Time High Incoming.” #XRPHolders Get Your A** Ready #XRP Is Ready To Explode All Time High Incoming pic.twitter.com/CE3hA4F4CX — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 30, 2024 The attached chart, a 4-hour candlestick view of the XRP/USD pair, highlights a descending wedge pattern—a technical formation often associated with bullish breakouts. According to XRP Captain’s analysis, the price is nearing the wedge’s apex, hinting at an imminent upward breakout that could lead to substantial gains. A projected trajectory on the chart suggests a potential price target of $3.20, more than 50% above the current trading price of approximately $2.09. Technical Analysis Breakdown Descending wedges are widely considered bullish reversal patterns. This setup typically forms when the price consolidates between two downward-sloping trendlines, with diminishing volatility signaling an approaching breakout. XRP Captain’s chart outlines these trendlines, suggesting that XRP is on the verge of breaking upward. The outlined breakout path appears to be based on the wedge pattern and historical resistance levels near $3.20. If the predicted movement materializes, XRP could revisit its all-time high, last seen during the 2017-2018 cryptocurrency bull run. XRP Community Reacts to the Prediction While the forecast has excited XRP enthusiasts, it has also been met with skepticism from others within the cryptocurrency community. Critics like Jon argue that the market is heavily manipulated, dismissing the validity of technical analysis without a proven global use case for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Breath Aryan described the optimism as misplaced, suggesting that many investors hold unrealistic expectations of massive gains. Similarly, Cj Zielie criticized the repetitive bullish claims from XRP supporters, questioning their reliability and timing. These contrasting perspectives highlight the ongoing debate over XRP’s potential and the challenges of navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Market Context XRP’s price movement has historically been influenced by macroeconomic factors and developments related to its adoption as a payment settlement asset. The token’s legal battles with the SEC and the broader cryptocurrency market’s performance make its price action complex. If XRP Captain’s prediction proves accurate, it will mark a turning point for XRP holders . However, investors should approach such forecasts cautiously, given the cryptocurrency market’s high volatility and susceptibility to external influences.

The majority of the cryptos, including the Cardano (ADA) price rally, have initiated a strong rebound from the pivotal support zone, which has kept the bullish hopes alive. The price marked a 2-year high by surging over $1.2, which unfortunately attracted massive bearish activity, dragging the levels by more than 30%. However, the latest rebound from the interim bottoms suggests the growing bullish dominance over the token. Can the bulls revamp a fresh rally beyond the 2024 highs and reach $2? The recent bull run helped the price to breach above the descending trend line that it held since the rejection from the 2021 highs. The token remained bearish throughout December, which compelled it to close the yearly trade within a restricted range. However, the bullish start for 2025 revived the hopes of a bull run for the year, marking fresh highs above $3. After rebounding from the 2023 lows, the rally triggered a decent rebound and formed constant higher highs and lows in the higher timeframe. This suggests the growing strength of the bulls that have pushed the price above $1. The supertrend has turned bullish after the recent rebound since the start of the week. However, the RSI has undergone a parabolic recovery curve and entered the overbought zone. Despite a pullback below the upper threshold, the levels have triggered a bullish divergence. With the current rebound in price, the token is about to rise above the interim resistance around $0.968 and a rise above these levels may push the price beyond $1. Besides, the volume is experiencing a significant squeeze, which may further attract huge liquidity. Hence, the Cardano (ADA) price could secure the resistance zone between $1.175 and $1.28, which has been a trend-reversal zone before the end of the month, which may pave the way for the token to rise beyond $1.5 in the upcoming months. Besides, if the market scenario remains bullish for the rest of the year, the price may keep up the upswing and eventually mark a new ATH before the end of the year.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-02 12:02:21

Economists worldwide are tearing apart his “America First” blueprint, warning that the plan is a ticking time bomb. According to a poll by the Financial Times and the University of Chicago, most economists believe Trump would make inflation worse, cripple growth, and spread economic chaos far beyond U.S. borders. Trump hasn’t dropped a detailed economic roadmap yet, leaving analysts to piece together predictions based on his campaign promises. His greatest hits? Slapping tariffs as high as 20% on imports, deporting undocumented workers en masse, and making 2017 tax cuts permanent. While Wall Street enjoys the short-term rally, the big brains say this “tariff man” approach is flirting with disaster. The global effects Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan, a Brown University professor and New York Fed adviser, reportedly thinks: “Trump’s policies can bring some growth in the short term, but this will be at the expense of a global slowdown which then will come back and hurt the U.S. later on.” The Eurozone is already bracing for a hammering, especially Germany’s manufacturing sector. Martin Wolburg of Generali Investments predicts Trump’s policies could target Germany’s car industry. But Christophe Boucher from ABN Amro fears cheap Chinese goods could flood European markets if Trump’s tariffs squeeze Beijing. Over 85% of the Eurozone economists surveyed expect Trump’s moves to hurt their economies. Even the UK, supposedly cushioned by its services-heavy economy, isn’t safe. Wall Street parties, but economists aren’t buying it While economists clutch their spreadsheets in despair, investors are popping champagne. The S&P 500 surged after Trump’s win, closing 2024 with a 23.3% gain, following a similar performance in 2023. The AI hype, tax cuts, and deregulation have energized the bulls. Benjamin Bowler of Bank of America predicts the rally will keep rolling into 2025, driven by what he calls Trump’s “laissez-faire economics.” Crypto isn’t missing out either. Bitcoin smashed through the $100,000 mark, hitting $108,007 after Trump’s win. Investors are banking on Paul Atkins , Trump’s pick for SEC head, to usher in a friendlier crypto environment. While Trump’s talk of adding Bitcoin to U.S. reserves has been dismissed as a pipe dream, the speculation alone has sent markets into overdrive. Still though, more than half of U.S. economists surveyed believe MAGAnomics will do more harm than good. Another 10% expect a “large negative impact.” Even in the Eurozone, 13% of analysts predict severe repercussions. This disconnect between markets and economic fundamentals has us scratching our heads. A chaotic outlook for 2025 and beyond The U.S. economy has been outperforming Europe since the pandemic, growing at an annualized rate of 2.8% in Q3 2024. But inflation remains stubborn , and the Federal Reserve isn’t budging on rate cuts. Futures traders hoping for monetary easing in 2023 and 2024 were left hanging. The dollar index rose 6.5% last year, putting pressure on emerging markets and global trade with its relentless strength. Meanwhile, bond yields are creeping back to pre-2008 levels. The average 10-year yield among G7 nations now sits around 3%, double what it was during the last decade. For Europe, the stakes are even higher. Trump’s protectionist policies threaten to disrupt global supply chains, hitting industries that rely on exports. Germany’s DAX index managed a 19% gain in 2024, but analysts warn the good times won’t last if Trump pulls the trigger on a 60% tariff against China . Economists also fear the broader unpredictability of Trump’s administration. Barret Kupelian from PwC calls it an “unpredictability machine” that will scare off businesses from making long-term decisions. This sentiment is shared across industries, from manufacturing to crypto.

Robert Kiyosaki , author of ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ is a dominant voice in the space — if controversial at times. The longtime real estate and gold bull was an early proponent of Bitcoin ( BTC ) — and still maintains that it is the asset to own on account of its growth potential and role as a store of value. However, Kiyosaki’s track record, whether we’re talking about predictions or success , is murky at best. The investor has often been labeled as an alarmist, and has a tendency of making bold forecasts — only to radically change his tune in short order. In a recent January 1 post made on social media platform X , Kiyosaki took aim at two of the arguably most respected investors of all time — Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger , criticizing the duo’s oft-repeated negative stance toward the pioneering cryptocurrency. Kiyosaki doubles down on bullish bets Having previously set a $350,000 price target for Bitcoin in 2025, just weeks after he predicted that the cryptocurrency would see prices crash down to $60,000 , the author derisively referred to Buffett and Munger as ‘very old, very rich men’, asking ‘Why should I care what they think about Bitcoin?’. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger call Bitcoin “rat droppings.” What do I think? Buffett and Munger are very old, very rich men. Why should I care what they think about Bitcoin? Most importantly I’d “What do you think about Bitcoin?” I agree with Buffett and Munger when… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 1, 2025 The fact that Munger had passed away in 2023 seems to have slipped Kiyosaki’s mind — in addition, he misquoted Buffett, who referred to Bitcoin as ‘ rat poison squared ’ in 2018, not ‘rat droppings’ as stated by Kiyosaki. Bitcoin ‘Rat Poison’. Source CryptoTale While he agreed with the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) duo’s assessment that investors should ‘know, study, and understand’ what they invest in, Kiyosaki added that the likes to study and listen to people smarter than him…at least those smarter than him when it comes to Bitcoin. Finally, the investor restated his intention to get richer by investing in BTC, real estate, gold, and silver, before wishing readers a happy new year. Bitcoin was trading at $96,580 at press time, having secured 125.54% in returns over the last twelve months. BTC price 1-year chart. Source: Finbold Ultimately, it’s hard to see Kiyosaki’s statements as anything other than a publicity stunt. While his stances (if not his predictions) are justified by Bitcoin’s price appreciation, the digital asset simply doesn’t have a place in Buffett’s value investing philosophy — a fact that won’t be shocking to anyone even remotely familiar with his work and approach to financial markets.

Canaccord assumed coverage of the shares with a buy rating and a 60 euro ($62) price target. The stock was trading 2.4% higher at 45.65 euros at publication time. Companies like Northern Data are ""building the railroad for the AI gold rush,"" analysts led by Kingsley Crane said. The company's Taiga Cloud business has come online at the ""forefront of what is shaping up to be a generational opportunity."" The broker noted that Northern Data, which is 52% owned by stablecoin issuer Tether , has already announced it was exploring options to sell its Peak Mining business. A potential divestiture would give Northern Data cash to invest in GPUs and data-center facilities, and would ""meaningfully improve the company's growth runway beyond FY25,"" the report said.

SHIB’s price is up 115% on a yearly scale, thanks to numerous potential factors, such as the burning mechanism, Shibarium’s progress, and others. The Burning Goes on The popular meme coin initially had a total supply of a whopping one quadrillion tokens. At launch, 50% of the amount was locked into the decentralized exchange Uniswap to provide liquidity, while the remaining half was sent to Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The computer programmer later donated trillions of SHIB to the India COVID-Crypto Relief Fund and other charity organizations. Eventually, he burned the remaining 410 trillion SHIB tokens, worth approximately $6.7 billion at the time . Buterin’s initiative was followed by an imminent price rally for the dog-themed meme coin. After all, fundamental principles of economy dictate that reducing the circulating supply combined with non-declining demand should be followed by a pump. In 2022, the Shiba Inu team officially adopted a burning mechanism that enables the community to send tokens to a dead wallet voluntarily. According to a recent post , over 44.6 billion SHIB, worth a little more than $1 million, were destroyed throughout 2024. While the USD equivalent of the stash might not sound that impressive (considering the fact that it stretches over the span of 12 months), continuous efforts in that field will make the meme coin more scarce and potentially more valuable. Meanwhile, the burn rate has jumped roughly 100% in the past 24 hours, resulting in nearly 1.9 million SHIB sent to a null address. SHIB Price Outlook Reducing the circulating supply of the meme coin throughout 2024 could be one reason why its price has charted a solid increase of 115% between January 1 last year and the beginning of 2025. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Other factors include the booming cryptocurrency market, more particularly the meme coin niche, and the further advancement of Shibarium. The layer-2 scaling solution, which aims to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, blasted through numerous milestones last year. Around Christmas, the total transactions processed on the protocol exceeded 700 million, while prior to that, wallet addresses crossed 2 million.

In a recent update, he changed his profile name to “Kekius Maximus” and his avatar to Pepe the Frog, the iconic meme often linked to internet culture, depicted as a Roman soldier. This playful gesture caused a staggering 800% surge in the value of a meme-based cryptocurrency also named Kekius Maximus within just 24 hours. The event mirrors Musk’s past impact on Dogecoin, where his tweets and endorsements turned the lighthearted cryptocurrency into a global phenomenon, propelling its price to record-breaking levels. Musk’s ability to transform memes into financial assets emphasizes the immense reach of his social media presence. However, it also raises concerns about market volatility, the sustainability of such trends, and the risks of potential market manipulation. His actions underscore the unpredictable convergence of social media influence, technological innovation, and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Elon Musk’s recent frog-themed X profile picture has set off a wave of speculation in cryptocurrency circles, with some suggesting that his “binary 0 1 code” reference to “Kekius Maximus” could subtly nod to Pepeto, the God of Frogs. With its compelling narrative and alignment with the rising popularity of frog-themed cryptocurrencies, Pepeto appears to resonate with the trends Musk’s actions often amplify. This latest shift highlights the extraordinary influence of social media in shaping crypto market dynamics, merging the playful world of memes with serious financial anticipation and casting a spotlight on Pepeto’s growing potential.

This time frame has illustrated the unrealized growth potential within the crypto space and the exponential returns that the early adopters enjoyed also cemented ETH's place as a fundamental component of the blockchain landscape. Similarly, a renowned ETH bull believes that RXS, at its current price, maybe starting on such a growth path. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Ethereum Parallel Rexas Finance is distinct in its tokenizing focus, carving the emerging markets strategy out of real estate commodities. This alleviates previous access to relatively illiquid assets and optimizes market liquidity and investor base. The real estate market, which stands at approximately $379.7 trillion alone, is an enormous global market that can be targeted for disruption with the Rexas tokenization of assets. Rexas Finance serves numerous tokens, starting from ERC-20 to ERC-721 and ERC-1155, which cater to various token needs, such as utility tokens and even NFTs. Such versatility in the processes helps promote the incorporation of Rexas Finance in a multitude of industries. Presale Performance and Investor Confidence Since its launch in September 2024, RXS has made remarkable advancements. Its presale was a resounding success, as evidenced by the startling rise in the token's price from $0.03 in stage one to a lightning-fast $0.15 in stage ten. As of today, an impressive $32.5 million has been raised, thanks to the total sales of over 375,954,089 RXS tokens. Such strong performance substantiates the confidence of investors and an emerging active community supporting the project. Furthermore, strategic alliances and further listings add to RXS's wholesome potential. In early 2025, RXS tokens are expected to be listed on tier-one cryptocurrency exchanges, which will aid accessibility and, in turn, encourage sales. Such listings boost excitement and visibility, thus enabling Rexas Finance to become a futuristic, best-performing blockchain. Encouraging strong community involvement is yet another pillar for Rexas Finance. A good example comes from the $1 million RXS giveaway to the top 20 lucky winners. As such, Rexas Finance fosters a loyal and engaged user base, contributing to the project's long-term success. Overall, this shift in focus creates excitement and encourages community members to take part and helps build a thriving ecosystem around the RXS token. Analyst Projections: A Bold Forecast According to analysts, RXS will be worth $73 by 2025, an astronomical 48,566% increase. This optimistic prediction is based on RXS's ability to adopt emerging and innovative technologies, strategic partnerships, security, and the expansion of the asset tokenization market. RXS: A Better Option Than Ethereum Ethereum has played a key role in developing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Still, challenges like scalability, high transaction fees, and network congestion exist. The Rexas Finance platform alleviates these issues by seeking to tokenize assets at a lower cost and faster rate. RXS, for instance, has an advantage over ETH in that it seeks to focus on the tokenization of real assets, which is still lacking in the Ethereum ecosystem. This approach makes Rexas Finance more oriented towards the sector of asset tokenization, which is more straightforward to understand for the average investor and user. Also, it should be noted that the RXS presale and even price growth corroborate the market's demand and trust in this asset. For example, the Ethereum network faced such doubts in its early stages and needed time to win the trust of the cryptocurrency community, ensuring gradual growth. Conclusion Rexas Finance (RXS) offers an exciting prospect for everyone who wants to invest in new applications of blockchain technologies. Their goal of tokenizing real-world assets targets them at the heart of an ever-evolving and global economic revolution. As the view grows that the cryptocurrency world is still maturing and has many possibilities, the time to invest is now. Join the moving train and make a financial turnaround with RXS today.

Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that the trader invested 0.017 Ether (approximately $66) to acquire 10.17 million Kekius Maximus (KEKIUS) meme coins on December 14. Over the next 18 days, the trader sold 2.81 million KEKIUS for 60.3 Ether, or $201,000, while retaining 7.37 million KEKIUS, worth around $2.85 million. The total profit amounted to a whopping $3.05 million, according to Lookonchain’s update . The meteoric rise of KEKIUS is attributed to Musk temporarily adopting the name “Kekius Maximus” and changing his profile picture to Pepe the Frog clad in Gladiator-style armor. The reference combines the internet meme Pepe with Maximus Decimus Meridius, the protagonist of the 2000 film Gladiator. KEKIUS, created on December 13, saw its market capitalization surge from $11.4 million to a peak of $389 million on January 1, as per data compiled by CoinGecko. Despite a subsequent decline to $145 million, the token’s rise highlights the unpredictable nature of meme coins often driven by cultural phenomena. In a related development, Lookonchain also revealed that another pseudonymous trader, known as rektdolphin.eth, made a bold move by exchanging their entire holding of 62 billion PEPE tokens – which was nearly $1.2 million – for 4.23 million KEKIUS tokens. However, this backfired as the investment turned sour after their holding plummeted to $290,000 just 12 hours later. An on-chain analyst had previously issued a warning to investors caught up in the KEKIUS frenzy, citing the speculative nature of the meme coin’s rally. Instead, the analyst advised traders to stick with more established tokens like PEPE. “For anyone that’s buying Kekius Maximus memecoins. Whenever Elon changes his PFP and name back, you’re gonna get fucked. Just stick to $PEPE.” The post Trader Turns $66 Into $3.05M Amid KEKIUS Meme Coin Frenzy appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Meme coins|PEPE,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|PEPE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-02 13:41:06

ETH Whales Have Been Busy,https://nulltx.com/ethereum-price-prediction-will-january-finally-bring-about-the-eth-breakout-eth-whales-have-been-busy/,"The cryptocurrency world is revving up for a historical year in 2025. Ethereum remains the decentralized finance backbone and home of smart contract technology, garnering favor among investors. Some believe January may bring the long-awaited breakthrough as whales hoard large quantities of Ethereum. Aave (AAVE) has also excelled in 2024, carving out its niche as a specialist in lending and borrowing protocols. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK) is bringing a new twist, merging iGaming and DeFi into one investment opportunity and a fun user experience. So how will these projects perform in 2025? Rollblock Redefines GambleFi Rollblock (RBLK) is entering the GambleFi space and turning heads in the process. As the first community-backed casino and Play-to-Earn platform, Rollblock brings the thrill of online gaming and ties it together with the fairness and transparency enabled by blockchain technology. Revenue Sharing Benefits Rollblock spends a large portion of its weekly profits on buying back and burning $RBLK tokens, which reduces supply and increases scarcity. Other funds are issued as staking rewards, incentivizing long-term holding. Expansive Gaming Options With over 7,000 games, a comprehensive sportsbook, and player-versus-player betting, Rollblock offers unparalleled variety. Blockchain technology ensures provably fair gaming, addressing trust issues prevalent in traditional casinos. AI-Driven Betting Tools Advanced AI tools assist users in optimizing betting strategies, offering personalized insights to maximize potential profits. Staking Rewards Users who stake $RBLK enjoy lucrative rewards derived from the platform’s revenue, while token burns introduce a deflationary mechanism to support long-term value growth. Aave Rallies 35% In December Aave (AAVE) closed December with a 35% gain, taking Aave’s (AAVE) net gain over the last 12 months to 184%. Technically, Aave (AAVE) is now offering cross-chain governance so that users can take part in decision-making around blockchain development. All this has boosted user engagement and bolstered Aave’s multi-chain presence. Aave’s new algorithmic stablecoin GHO has also generated some hype. Trading at $70 on 1st January, analysts anticipate a sharp rise in Aave’s value, to $90 in the short term. Ethereum Poised for a Breakout Ethereum (ETH) has been on a positive trajectory and analysts seem optimistic about its performance in January. Forecasts say it could break through the key $2,500 resistance level and run toward the $3,000 mark in the near future. Data from on-chain analytics platforms suggests Ethereum (ETH) whales have been accumulating Ethereum (ETH) in recent months. Those big investments usually signal trust in the future price growth of a token. Ethereum (ETH) has also seen massive staking growth. Switching over to Ethereum 2.0 and increasing the amount of staking options on offer have all contributed to reducing Ethereum’s circulating supply. Investors Flock To Rollblock Rollblock’s GambleFi platform is stealing the attention of many in the crypto and iGaming worlds. Currently priced at just $0.0044 in its ninth presale stage, the $RBLK token presents unparalleled growth potential for early adopters. As analysts predict a steep 800% price increase during the presale and 100x growth post-launch, now is the perfect time for investors to secure their stake in Rollblock’s (RBLK) future success.

Can the bulls send the $BTC price past $100,000, or will we see a return to the ascending trendline that stretches all the way from 2021? Bitcoin keeps market guessing Bitcoin always keeps the market guessing. If you are a trader, and you are not on your toes where Bitcoin is concerned, you are likely to be taught a lesson, and probably quite a few of them. Instead of a dip below the trendline that stretches all the way back to the double top of the 2021 bull market, the $BTC price decided to respect the trendline, and not only that, but to break out of its current local downtrend. Market structure builds above $91,000 Source: TradingView The short-term $BTC chart above is beginning to show plenty of structure now above the $91,000 level. A range is forming between this lower level and the range high at $100,000. This has been in force since mid-November, and we have already seen a large deviation from the range when the new all-time high at just over $108,000 was set. If the Bitcoin bulls can force the price up past the current resistance level, there could be another attempt at $100,000, and the possibility of a local higher high. The main takeaway for the bulls here is that the descending trendline has been broken and a smaller higher high has been made. Even if the price does break down from here, a higher low can be set. Staying within the range is also building market structure which can be used as a base for the next push upwards. Forget all the indicators - just look at the weekly price chart Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly time frame, the bullish case for Bitcoin going into the rest of this bull market becomes apparent. There will always be this or that indicator that spreads a contagion of worry into the hearts of traders and investors, but just looking at the bare bones of the above chart, things really do look to be going to plan, at least as far as the bulls are concerned. The breakout of the bull flag took the $BTC price well clear of the extremely tough $69,000 resistance, which took three years to finally break. Once the $108,000 new all-time high was set, a healthy retracement took the price back to the ascending trendline, which has a huge amount of power gained from nearly four years in the making. All the candle wicks down to this trendline over the past six weeks bear testimony to the so-far rock solid support that this trendline is providing. Drawing Fibonacci levels from the bull flag bottom of $45,000, up to the all-time high of $108,000, one can see that the first Fibonacci at the 0.236 level is the one that is holding the price up. If this support continues, and the price is able to bounce from here, such a shallow retracement would be extremely bullish going forward. Short Bitcoin at your peril.

In a recent New Year’s address to executives and employees, WeMade CEO Park Kwan-ho highlighted blockchain technology as a cornerstone of the company’s future. Park emphasized that the upcoming year represents a turning point for WeMade, with ambitions to expand its blockchain services and integrate decentralized social communities into its ecosystem. “We will open up new possibilities and further solidify our position in the global market through the convergence of the game business and the blockchain business.” This vision builds on the success of WeMixPlay, the company’s blockchain-based gaming platform, and WePublic, a community-driven initiative leveraging blockchain’s transparency and data immutability. WeMade’s blockchain ambitions are closely tied to its gaming roots. The company’s flagship title, Night Crow, has strengthened its position in global gaming markets, providing the foundation for further expansion. Park’s roadmap for 2025 includes the launch of new games like Dismins War and Midnight Walkers, as well as the highly anticipated MMORPG Legend of Imir. At the heart of this initiative is Park’s belief that blockchain can connect gaming and real-life applications and create new trust-driven gaming communities. Blockchain at the Core of WeMade’s Expansion: What To Expect? WeMade’s blockchain journey began with the creation of WeMixPlay, a platform allowing developers to launch blockchain-powered games. In 2024, the company reorganized the WeMix ecosystem to bolster growth and enhance service offerings. CEO Park envisions transforming WeMixPlay into a global platform that delivers innovative gaming experiences worldwide. WeMixPlay’s success will hinge on expanding its catalog of blockchain-based games and onboarding new developers to create a thriving ecosystem. In addition to WeMixPlay, WePublic is another key pillar of WeMade’s blockchain strategy. WePublic leverages blockchain technology to foster decentralized communities and facilitate collaborative projects. WeMade is solidifying its blockchain gaming ambitions, driven by the success of its title, Night Crows. South Korean Gaming Giant WeMade’s Blockchain Bet Finally Pays Off? The South Korean gaming behemoth WeMade is hopeful that its massive blockchain gaming drive is finally starting to pay dividends. #CryptoNews #news https://t.co/QPU9JUQQN5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 14, 2024 According to a March 2024 report, Night Crows attracted 150,000 concurrent users within a day of launch , surpassing the performance of WeMade’s earlier hit, MIR4. Park also stressed the importance of blockchain’s transparency, saying: “The biggest advantage of blockchain is the transparency and inoperability of data. We will focus on building new social communities in areas where trust is needed by exploiting the inoperability of data.” The expansion into decentralized social communities is expected to align with new game releases in 2025. Titles like Dismins War and Midnight Walkers will target new genres and audiences, reinforcing the synergy between WeMade’s gaming expertise and blockchain innovations. Global Expansion Amid Regulatory Scrutiny WeMade’s blockchain ambitions extend beyond South Korea, reflecting a global outlook. In late 2023, WeMade partnered with Whampoa Digital , a Singapore-based investment firm, to launch a $100 million web3 fund targeting blockchain gaming projects. Despite the rising innovation and 2023 losses, WeMade faced some regulatory setbacks in 2024. According to a February 2024 report, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) investigated WeMade for allegedly providing unregistered crypto wallet and exchange services. The probe, initiated after a tip-off from the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA), suggests that WeMade’s PLAY WALLET and PNIX DEX services may operate without the necessary permits. This scrutiny comes after WeMade net losses of $142.6 million in Q4 2023 . Web3 Game Developer Wemade Reports Widening Losses in Q4 2023 South Korean Web3 game developer #Wemade has disclosed a significant increase in operating and net losses in the fourth quarter of last year, as per its latest earnings report. #CryptoNews https://t.co/PfUEjjeS4i — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 6, 2024 Also, before the investigations, WeMade was hit with a $41 million tax bill by the National Tax Service (NTS) for its crypto-related operations between 2019 and 2022.

After experiencing a sharp decline of over 37% from its December highs, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now consolidating, prompting optimism for a recovery. Whale Activity Adding fuel to the speculation, a dormant whale recently withdrew 220 billion SHIB tokens, valued at $4.63 million, from Binance. This major transaction has sparked intrigue within the community, as whale activity often precedes notable market movements. Despite this, Shiba Inu continues to face critical resistance levels. According to data from IntoTheBlock, two major sell walls stand in the way of a price surge. The first, between $0.000023 and $0.000024, involves 42,310 addresses holding 60.44 trillion SHIB. The second, more formidable wall lies between $0.000024 and $0.000030, with 208,010 addresses holding 70.35 trillion SHIB. Consolidation Phase Hints at Potential Breakout SHIB is currently trading within a tight range of $0.00002100 to $0.00002300, a consolidation phase that analysts see as a precursor to a potential breakout. Technical indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 56.81, suggest a neutral-to-bullish momentum, with support holding firmly at $0.00002. According to crypto analyst Javon Marks, SHIB recently broke through a long-term resistance trendline and successfully retested it as support—a classic bullish signal. He highlighted the presence of hidden bullish divergence, a pattern indicating underlying strength as price forms higher lows while momentum indicators register lower lows. Marks predicts that SHIB could climb to $0.000081 in the near term, marking a 260% gain from current levels. He also outlined a long-term target of $0.000155, contingent on broader market recovery and sustained bullish sentiment . Path to Growth Hinges on Breaking Key Levels For Shiba Inu to sustain this rally, it must overcome two critical resistance zones, particularly the $0.00003 mark, where prior attempts have faltered. Should SHIB surpass this threshold, analysts foresee a climb to $0.000081 and beyond. While risks remain, including market volatility and sell pressure, Shiba Inu’s price action and technical indicators suggest that a significant upward move may be on the horizon. Crypto enthusiasts are now closely watching the token’s next steps.

Telegram , a multi-platform messaging service, has kicked off 2025 with a major update, introducing collectible gifts that can be traded as non-fungible tokens on third-party marketplaces. In a blog post dated Jan. 1, Telegram announced that gifts sent or received on its platform can now be upgraded to “collectibles.” These collectibles feature unique designs, secondary traits like background colors and icons, and varying levels of rarity. According to Telegram, over 1,400 variations of gifts such as “Homemade Cake” and “Jelly Bunny” are already available, with plans to expand the collection in the future. “When you upgrade a gift it unlocks a new appearance from dozens of custom variations made by Telegram artists. Collectibles also receive a random set of secondary traits, including a background color, icon and number.” Telegram You might also like: How Telegram made over half a billion dollars thanks to crypto? Telegram noted that upgrades require Telegram Stars — virtual items that enable users to purchase digital goods and services through bots and mini apps within the Telegram ecosystem — to cover blockchain fees. The platform emphasized that collectibles are functional, allowing users to transfer them to others or auction them “on NFT marketplaces.” However, Telegram did not specify which marketplaces would support these transactions. The update also includes additional features. Users can now react to service messages, such as notifications triggered when someone sends a gift, joins a group, or starts a video chat. Telegram has also introduced filters for message searches, enabling users to narrow results by private chats, groups, or channels.

One such crypto is a Solana AI memecoin, Fartcoin, which has recently hit a new ATH after a rally of 40% today. Let us discuss the factors behind this Fartcoin price rally. Why Fartcoin Price Surged 40% Today? Fartcoin is one of the most popular Solana Meme coins because it is unique. Other than that, there is no distinctive feature or use case, but despite that, its price has just hit an ATH at $1.40 after a 40% rally in the last 24 hours. With that, it currently trades at $1.29 with a market capitalization of $1.29B. This impressive rally formed as the token’s trading volume surged 16% to $140.12M. Additionally, the Coingalss reports reveal that the Open Interest (OI) has surged 82%, currently $140M, driving the price up. Since its launch in October, the Solana AI memecoin has had a bullish trajectory but has made major corrections after every peak. However, with the increased demand for AI cryptos, Fartcoin has also gotten attention. The popular AI agent Truth Terminal, behind Goatseus Maximus’s success, is also behind the success of the Fartcoin. It gave the idea, tokenomics, and all the relevant information for the Fartcoin, which went viral among crypto traders, and someone created a token from this information. Eventually, the Truth Terminal connection and the demand for Solana AI memecoin led to this new ATH rally. Interestingly, Truth terminal holds at least $25M FARTCOIN, increasing demand. The investors also found humor in its name and began endorsing it on social media platforms, fueling the current Fartcoin price rally. ✜ @FartCoinOfSOL | $FARTCOIN | MC: $26.9M ✜ One of the top AI Memecoins created by @truth_terminal ✜ In the global growth of Altcoins, such assets will perform very well ✜ CA: 9BB6NFEcjBCtnNLFko2FqVQBq8HHM13kCyYcdQbgpump pic.twitter.com/L76SQgEECj — ᴛʀᴀᴄᴇʀ (@DeFiTracer) November 2, 2024 Not to forget, various famous crypto exchanges like Kucoin, Bitget, and others have listed the token, raising user confidence and expectations. Will Fartcoin Price Hit $2 Next? Fartcoin’s value has increased 2579873% in the last three months, boosting investor sentiment. Although the token is in a slight consolidation after its recent ATH, it could hit $2 if the trends are right. The retracement to the demand zone is between 0.934 and $1.046. An uptrend could form if it produced a higher high above $1.670 and a higher low above $0.0934. Eventually, it could reach a new high of $1.670 at the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. In the most optimistic nature, it could hit $2. Bottom Line Fartcoin’s growth shows the growing demand for AI cryptos. Interestingly, these AI-based cryptos will become one of the most followed cryptocurrency trends in 2025 . As the Solana AI memecoin has hit a new ATH, investors are enthusiastic about future Fartcoin price rallies. Investors can witness new ATH, with the production higher high above $1.670 and a higher low above $0.0934. Regardless, there are still concerns about its long-term performance. This is because it lacks useful features and is rising with only investor demand, which could get limited over time.

Binance significantly outpaces competitors such as Bybit, which reported $5.3 billion, and Coinbase, at $3.6 billion. Cryptocurrency exchange volume | Source: Coinmarketcap Despite its dominance in trading volume, Binance navigated several regulatory challenges in 2024. In the United States, it faced allegations of securities violations from the SEC . In March 2024, Binance.US, the American affiliate of Binance, faced operational challenges following the SEC’s lawsuit. The exchange experienced a 75% decline in revenue and laid off approximately two-thirds of its workforce, totaling over 200 employees. These measures were part of the company’s response to the regulatory pressures and the subsequent impact on its business operations. Also in 2024, amid growing regulatory scrutiny, Binance’s co-founder CZ faced allegations of money laundering in the U.S., ultimately pleading guilty to charges that led to a six-month sentence. This marked a pivotal moment in Binance’s legal battles and highlighted the company’s ongoing regulatory challenges.

Despite its recent price dips, many analysts are still speculating that Chainlink could bounce back and potentially see major gains in 2025. Meanwhile, a young altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is stealing the show in the crypto space. Backed by zero-gas technology and other Web3 innovations, JetBolt has already sold more than 230 million tokens during the presale phase. Can LINK reach $100 as the price recovers from bearish movement? What makes crypto whales and buyers so optimistic about JetBolt? Keep reading as we dive into the latest Chainlink price forecast and the factors behind JetBolt’s presale frenzy. Chainlink Price Forecast: Is the $100 Dream Attainable? Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $21.92 at the time of writing, reflecting an 8.7% increase over the past 24 hours. Optimism surrounds Chainlink as analysts project meaningful growth for the token in 2025. Experts like Michaël van de Poppe believe that LINK has entered an uptrend, although it is currently in the process of finding a higher low. LINK’s 7-day price movement chart showing recovery from $19.80. Data from CoinGecko. Key resistance levels, such as $22.4533, could unlock mid-term targets if Chainlink maintains higher lows. For long-term investors, these signals suggest that LINK might be positioning itself for a strong recovery once market conditions improve. The question remains: can LINK reach $100 anytime soon? Let’s take a closer look at the technical indicators. LINK has recently formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, a bearish signal that could drive the price lower. Analysts highlight potential support zones between $18.60 and $19.80, with some speculating a deeper drop to $14. Technical indicators, such as a bearish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) crossover and a Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing oversold levels, confirm that LINK could face more challenges before stabilizing. While a $100 price target may be a stretch for now, LINK’s current price movements could signal opportunities for strategic accumulation. As the token navigates this transitional phase, Chainlink’s ability to recover from bearish trends and build momentum will be crucial in determining its long-term potential. JetBolt’s Presale Frenzy: 230 Million and Counting Entering fresh with a hot presale, JetBolt (JBOLT) is quickly making a name for itself in the crypto space. Surpassing 230 million tokens sold during its presale, JetBolt is tackling long-standing blockchain challenges while simplifying cryptocurrency for everyday users. Addressing the persistent issue in blockchain transactions is one of JetBolt’s main standout features. High gas fees have often deterred frequent and small-scale interactions, but JetBolt eliminates this obstacle thanks to its disruptive zero-gas technology. This advancement not only benefits users but also provides developers with a gas-free environment to create decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from gaming platforms to NFT marketplaces. JetBolt also simplifies the often-complicated world of crypto staking with its SocialFi system. Stakers can effortlessly earn rewards while interacting with an intuitive interface that emphasizes accessibility and engagement. Additionally, JBOLT’s AI-powered market insights tool provides users with recent curated blockchain news and insights. JetBolt’s presale is heating up, offering exclusive perks for early participants. Early buyers can earn up to 25% extra tokens when purchasing tokens in bulk through Alpha Boxes, making this presale phase even more enticing for those looking to get involved. With over 230 million tokens sold during its presale and a unique combination of zero-gas technology, SocialFi system, and AI-driven utilities, JetBolt’s presale frenzy is undeniable. While it’s still early days, the success of JetBolt’s presale highlights the growing interest in its approach to simplifying and enhancing blockchain utility.

Rexas Finance (RXS) positions itself as the next evolution in blockchain, aiming to redefine asset tokenization and follow in the footsteps of Ethereum and Polygon Which Altcoin will create generational wealth? Due to its approach to expanding the limits of blockchain, Ethereum experienced mass adoption and a significant price surge. This pattern replicated itself in 2021, when Polygon introduced a solution to Ethereum scalability, thus making dApps more affordable and fast. Now, looking at 2025, another player has an opportunity to change the dynamics of blockchain: Rexas Finance (RXS). Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (POL): building the foundation Ethereum allowed projects to be seen outside cryptocurrency’s scope, although the technology’s essence was visualized even earlier. By integrating smart contracts into its infrastructure, Ethereum became the launching pad for ICOs and decentralized finance. The crazy growth that this market experienced during this period left much profit for early investors. In 2021, Polygon identified Ethereum’s major setbacks. This includes high gas fees and slow transaction speeds. The project acted as a layer-2 scaling solution by enhancing Ethereum without changing the ecosystem. This created a huge demand for it amongst developers and users, resulting in significant price appreciation and making it one of the cornerstones of DeFi. Rexas Finance (RXS): the next big thing for 2025 Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly emerging as the most exciting cryptocurrency project for 2025. The project is well-positioned to disrupt blockchain technology as it offers a novel proposition: the ability to tokenize real-world assets efficiently. Rexas Finance envisions bridging the concrete world of real estate, artworks, commodities, and their blockchain counterparts by allowing owners, dealers, and asset managers a whole new framework for dealing with these assets. While previous altcoins, such as Ethereum in 2017 and Polygon in 2021, provided smart contract functionality or scalable solutions focused on particular components of blockchain, Rexas Finance, on the other hand, has a more expansive and practical application solution. Its platform lets users tokenize and fractionalize physical value, making assets consumable by the masses. This democratization of ownership has the potential to open up entirely new markets and change how investments work through the traditional model. The presale price for one Rexas Finance (RXS) token is currently $0.175. The project is currently in its eleventh presale stage. The initial presale stage allowed for 425 million tokens; only 10% remain. Many are excited about the upcoming phase, when the price will increase to $0.20. Investors who join in early will enjoy a decent ROI after the token is listed on exchanges. Rexas Finance has a market cap of $1 billion RXS tokens; 42.5% will be initially allocated for the presale, with 22.5% held back for staking rewards, liquidity, marketing, treasury, and ecosystem innovation. The structured distribution ensures that the project is self-sustaining, that the early buyers of the tokens are rewarded, and that the community can grow. You might also like: What does 2025 have in store for crypto and digital assets? | Opinion Rexas Finance aims to ensure the system’s security and credibility. Certik, a well-known expert in blockchain security, has vetted the project. This gives assurance that the platform’s code is correctly written, free from exploits, and meets the most stringent safety standards. These factors and the upcoming listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko will help raise the project’s profile for retail and institutional investors. One more differentiating element of Rexas Finance is its activities aimed at the community. The platform announced a $1m giveaway for its users. The winner will be judged based on participation, and 20 lucky winners will receive $50,000 in RXS tokens each. To be eligible to win, a minimum of $100 participation in the presale is important. This strategy not only incentivizes early adopters but also fosters a dedicated community, which is important in the competitive environment of cryptocurrency. Looking at 2025, it would not be surprising if Rexas Finance transformed the crypto landscape. The premise behind its Real World Asset tokenization is a strong presale performance and a securely structured project. As the definition of what blockchain can offer keeps changing, new smart projects like Rexas Finance will drive the next big cycle of growth and adoption. Conclusion: Pioneering the future Ethereum and Polygon exemplified how innovation and market timing could create generational wealth. As we approach 2025, Rexas Finance (RXS) emerges as a strong contender to follow in their footsteps. By combining real-world asset tokenization with DeFi principles, RXS is poised to redefine blockchain’s potential and deliver groundbreaking returns for forward-thinking investors.

The headline was simple: “Every single private blockchain just died.” Since November 2022, the crypto and blockchain markets have been defined by caution and gradual recovery. The direction has been consistent and positive, but slow, especially in 2023. In 2024, we saw a gradual but sustained acceleration. The year started with the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), and just kept accelerating through an Ethereum ETF, and the adoption of the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation. We were on a path of steady, global regulatory convergence, including rules of the road for all the major crypto and digital asset types. We were also on a path towards public blockchains. Bitcoin is a kind of digital gold, and Ethereum is a development platform for digital assets and services. The path may have been consistent, but the pace was measured. It was routine to hear people at big financial institutions tell me that they would love to move to public Ethereum but “the regulators won’t allow it.” On the night of Nov 5 (following the U.S. election), the prospect of substantial regulatory change became a reality. Any certainty about what regulators will or will not allow was suddenly out the window and a clear direction of travel was radical acceleration on public networks. There is no absolute certainty in life, but if I must make predictions about 2025, it is that we will indeed have a seachange in the U.S. regulatory environment, and that will, in turn, bring about a collective global shift in the same direction, though not necessarily at quite the same pace. However, since the U.S. is by far the world’s largest financial market, that counts for a lot. Bitcoin is already a big winner here. It is cementing its place as the digital version of gold, and could in the course of 2025, take up that role officially with countries and governments dipping their toes into strategic bitcoin reserves. My own past prediction was that Bitcoin was likely to continue growing until it reaches the size and market cap of gold, which is currently about $14 trillion. In many ways, Bitcoin is much more attractive as a scarcity-based asset. Higher prices for Bitcoin do not increase the supply, something you cannot say about actual gold. Ethereum will be the second big winner. Ethereum has transitioned smoothly to proof-of-stake, dropping carbon output by >99% , and it has also scaled up massively. The combined Ethereum network (Layer 1 mainnet and Layer 2 networks) has several hundred times the capacity it had during the last bull market. Transaction fees are low and likely to stay that way for some time. Massive scalability, low costs, and an outstanding security, and uptime record are going to make Ethereum the choice for most digital asset issuers. Beyond cryptocurrency, the single biggest boom we’re likely to see in 2025 is likely to be around stablecoin payments. The value proposition and business case for stablecoin payments is already strong. Around the world, users want access to U.S. dollars, particularly for international remittances. Use of dollar stablecoins was already popular with crypto users, but access and use cases are spreading rapidly. Circle works with Nubank in Brazil, for example, to make USDC payments directly accessible to all account holders. Celo, an Ethereum network, has partnered with Opera to put stablecoin payments into Opera’s web browser, which is optimized for low-cost smartphones popular in emerging markets. Celo’s stablecoin transaction volumes have been growing rapidly as a result. Stablecoin payments are reaching into the enterprise sector as well. EY, PayPal and Coinbase have worked with SAP to enable fully automated payments from inside enterprise ERP systems. Now, the same in-system automation that works for bank accounts also works for crypto-rails payments. This is particularly important for enterprise use where processes that cannot be automated at scale have no chance of adoption. When combined with improved privacy tools (and better regulatory treatment of privacy systems), crypto rails look like much lower cost options for enterprise users. 2025 is also likely to be a breakthrough year for decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi relies on software applications running on-chain to replicate key functions in financial services and banking. Throughout 2024, DeFi was the one area of the crypto ecosystem that saw no real movement on regulatory clarity and, thanks to high real-world interest rates, wasn’t a hugely attractive option. The regulatory environment is likely to be much more favorable for DeFi in 2025 and if interest rates come down, a more aggressive search for incremental yield on-chain could take off. DeFi tools that allow people to loan their assets into liquidity pools and other services in exchange for additional return on the asset (and added risk) might become popular again. So the revolution won’t be about something new or different, it will just be about everything rushing forward all at once. And across the board, the competitive intensity in every sector of the blockchain ecosystem is about to get dialed up to 11, ( my “Spinal Tap” reference ). Companies, banks, brokerages, insurance firms and more that were sitting on the sidelines and watching with horror in 2023 and caution in 2024 and likely to take the plunge in 2025. I’ve already lost track of all the big firms that have announced plans to offer a stable coin, a real world asset, or start selling bitcoin and eth to their customers. Competitive intensity inside the blockchain ecosystem is already dialed up to 11, and 2025 is going to be a rough year inside the market. People running blockchain networks and services should be forgiven for wondering if these are good times, is it worth it? Inside the Ethereum ecosystem, there are now more than 40 different Layer 2 networks. Competition on transaction fees is brutal, differentiation across Layer 2 networks is low, and more competitors are entering the market. Rough as it is inside Ethereum, it may be worse outside as “alt-L1s” face a combined Ethereum ecosystem that looks scalable, secure, and reliably low cost. Some networks, like Celo, already made the pivot from competing with Ethereum to being a part of it. I expect more will follow in 2025. The only worse place to be than facing furious public blockchain competition may be in running a private blockchain. When your value proposition is “it’s as close to Ethereum as the regulators will allow” and all those regulators are being moved out, the prospects are especially bleak. I’ve already fielded calls from firms in private networks asking about how to pivot and how fast it can be done. Lastly, I predict 2025 could be a fabulous year for fraud. A carnival and casino-like atmosphere in online trading combined with rapid regulatory loosening could attract the same grifters that showed up in the last crypto boom. What’s harder to predict is exactly where this fraud may show up. People are generally pretty good at bolting the barn door after the horse has fled. So, things that worked in the past, such as hacking exchanges or borrowing from depositor funds, are going to be harder to repeat. Audits, regulators, and better security technology all contribute to that. That doesn’t mean the risk is going away, just that it will arrive in a new package. Happy New Year and have a great 2025!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cutoshi is making waves in the meme coin world, raising over $1.45 million and selling 74.5 million tokens in just two months, with its presale continuing to gain momentum. Table of Contents What can billion-dollar-cap meme coins teach us? What makes Cutoshi a different kind of project? How high could CUTO go? Cutoshi has pulled off what most meme coins can’t. In just two months, the project has raised over $1.45 million and sold over 74.5 million tokens in its presale. This is fast growth for a Memefi project still building its ecosystem. With six stages left, the presale shows no signs of slowing down. What can billion-dollar-cap meme coins teach us? Dogecoin and DogWifHat built their success purely on hype and a strong community. Both grew to multi-billion-dollar market caps without any real functional ecosystem. Floki Inu on the other hand added features like staking and NFTs, which gave it more stability and prolonged interest. On the other hand, PEPE made headlines earlier this year for its huge rise but lost momentum just as quickly due to its lack of utility, though it remains popular with many traders. Cutoshi sits in the middle. The project combines the viral appeal of memes, being a blockchain version of the Chinese Lucky Cat, with real features, like its live token farming system that already has over 4,000 participants. It’s a meme coin that’s working toward something more, with a cross-chain DEX and gamified learning academy set to launch in 2025. What makes Cutoshi a different kind of project? The Lucky Cat community has shown its love through memes, fan art and even graffiti, showing that Cutoshi is more than a passing trend. The ongoing meme competition, set to end on January 4th, is adding to the fun and the prizes are keeping the energy high. The team’s focus on DeFi tools adds a layer of depth that most meme coins lack. This is because they are also committed to the ideals of Satoshi Nakamoto of financial autonomy. Features like the DEX are built to simplify trading, which can be done across blockchains getting rid of the need for bridging, while the learning academy will help get more users into DeFi. How high could CUTO go? Memecoins with utility tend to perform better after launch. If Cutoshi mirrors Floki Inu’s trajectory, which reached a $2 billion market cap at its peak, CUTO could see prices between $0.40 and $0.50 in 2025. If it captures the kind of excitement that drove SHIB’s massive run, prices over $1 can be achieved. These predictions rely on the project delivering on its promises and keeping its community engaged. Cutoshi has already accomplished a lot. The $1.45 million raised, the thousands of active participants and the ongoing roadmap all point to a project that’s likely here to stay the course. Right now CUTO is in presale, on offer at $0.031.

With this rise, the price seems to have triggered a decent recovery from the interim support range between $0.30 and $0.31; the token has surged beyond the bearish pattern. Therefore, the DOGE price is believed to maintain a consolidated ascending trend and reach the next resistance between $0.41 and $0.42. The memecoin space has again jumped into action with popular ones like PEPE, WIF, BONK, and SHIB, along with DOGE, whose price has gained immense strength. This suggests the tokens are preparing for the next bullish spell with the DOGE price gaining centre stage. The top memecoin has gained strong bullish momentum after breaking the consolidation at $0.329 and moving upward after testing $0.33. The DOGE price re-tested the broken EMAs, where one can expect to see a rejection. However, if the price manages to cross a certain range, the bearish thesis may be invalidated As seen in the above chart, the DOGE price has surged above the descending trend line that it held since the second fortnight of December. Besides, the MACD indicates a drop in the selling pressure, with the levels about to undergo a bullish crossover along with the DMI levels. This suggests the trend is about to flip with the resurgence of the bullish trend. However, a rise beyond the interim resistance zone above $0.36 may validate the start of a fresh bullish trend. After surging above the pivotal range, there could be some possibility of a small pullback below $0.35. Meanwhile, a rise above this level may pave the way for the token to rise above $0.41 and secure above the range around $0.42; a rise to $0.5 could be imminent. However, if the Dogecoin price manages to sustain above the range, then it could eventually rise above the current ATH and reach $1 during the first half of 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|TRADING|PEPE|BONK,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-02 14:02:03

Brett ( BRETT ) surged to $0.1350, marking a 25% increase from its December lows when most meme coins faced declines. This recovery is largely attributed to the ongoing resurgence in the crypto industry following the Christmas holiday season. Investors are optimistic due to several potential catalysts, including the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump, anticipated changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the distribution of funds from the FTX estate . The rally in meme coins has pushed the total market cap of the sector to over $117 billion. Among the top performers are Bonk, Dogwifhat, Fartcoin, and Popcat. Brett’s rise is also linked to on-chain data revealing a significant purchase by a whale investor. The whale reportedly bought $1.7 million worth of Brett tokens and now holds $2.1 million in Brett, according to Nansen. On-chain activity indicates substantial BRETT purchases in the past 24 hours.

It has become the biggest L2 network in tems of Decentralized Finance total value locked and DEX transaction volume.

Its recent crash was part of the formation of a falling wedge chart pattern. This is a highly popular reversal pattern created by connecting two converging trendlines. A rebound usually happens when the two lines are nearing their confluence, which happened recently. The retreat was also part of the handle section of the cup and handle pattern. The cup formed between June and September last year, with a depth of approximately 70%. By projecting this depth from the upper edge of the cup, Brett could potentially rise to $0.3335, representing a 141% gain from current levels. A sustained move above $0.20—the upper boundary of the cup—would confirm this bullish outlook. Conversely, a drop below the lower edge of the wedge at $0.10 would invalidate the positive outlook for Brett.

As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.42, up 15.18% in just 24 hours, signaling renewed momentum despite recent market volatility. This surge coincides with Ripple’s improving legal outlook, fueling optimism among crypto enthusiasts eager to see if XRP can move forward in its quest to $5. The crypto spotlight isn’t solely on XRP. JetBolt (JBOLT) is captivating the market with its booming presale, zero-gas technology, seamless Web3 integration, and an innovative SocialFi staking model. With over 230 million tokens already sold, JetBolt could be setting new benchmarks for blockchain innovation. What lies ahead for XRP’s price trajectory and the broader adoption of next-gen technologies like JetBolt? Let’s explore. XRP Price Prediction: Can XRP Reach $5 in 2025? XRP, currently priced at $2.42, has climbed 15.18% in the past 24 hours and 6.51% over the last week. However, XRP remains 11.18% lower on a monthly scale, reflecting ongoing volatility. With a trading volume exceeding $4 billion on January 1, XRP continues to dominate discussions among crypto enthusiasts who are eager to understand whether the token can chart a path to $5 in 2025. Price Chart of XRP Over the Past 24 Hours (CoinMarketCap) The recent surge in XRP price coincides with optimism surrounding Ripple’s legal situation and broader market interest. Speculation about the SEC withdrawing its appeal against Ripple’s partial court victory has reignited confidence. If the regulatory environment turns favorable, XRP could benefit from increased adoption and liquidity, strengthening its bid for higher price levels. However, XRP’s historical performance shows that the token often faces challenges maintaining momentum, as seen during the December 2024 rally to $2.90, which later gave way to bearish patterns. The descending triangle currently shaping XRP’s price action signals potential downward pressure if buyers fail to break through resistance levels around $2.90. On the downside, failure to hold support at $2 could see XRP drop to $1.88 or lower. On the upside, sustained buying activity and favorable external catalysts could push XRP closer to the ambitious $5 target, though significant resistance levels remain in its path. The momentum surrounding XRP’s performance also shines a light on other exciting developments in the crypto space, such as JetBolt’s booming presale. What Makes JetBolt’s Booming Presale a Game-Changer? JetBolt’s booming presale, with over 230 million JBOLT tokens already sold, is a testament to its growing appeal among crypto enthusiasts. As the token continues to gain traction, JetBolt’s innovative features are resonating with a diverse audience. The standout feature of JetBolt is its zero-gas technology, operating on the Skale network to eliminate gas fees for on-chain transactions. This game-changing functionality removes a significant barrier in blockchain usability, enabling smoother and more cost-effective interactions across decentralized applications (dApps). By tackling one of the industry’s persistent pain points, JetBolt paves the way for broader adoption and creative dApp development. JetBolt also distinguishes itself with an integrated Web3 wallet designed to simplify user experience. Leveraging WebAuthN technology, the wallet offers secure and intuitive access, including biometric authentication options like facial recognition. This feature helps blockchain technology become more accessible, catering to both newcomers and seasoned users seeking a seamless interaction with the ecosystem. Adding to its appeal is JetBolt’s SocialFi staking model. This innovative staking system rewards users not only for staking their tokens but also for engaging with others on the platform. Furthermore, JetBolt’s AI-powered news aggregator offers a curated feed of blockchain-related articles from third-party sources, categorized by market sentiment. The presale structure has been a key driver of JetBolt’s rising popularity. With a daily rise in token prices and the introduction of Alpha Boxes —offering bonus tokens for bulk purchases—the presale incentivizes early participation. These elements combine to create a sense of momentum and reward for those joining the JetBolt ecosystem. As JetBolt’s presale continues to gather steam, this next-generation cryptocurrency is setting a high standard in the blockchain space. With its zero-gas transactions, accessible wallet, innovative staking model, and strategic presale mechanics, JetBolt is solidifying its reputation as a project to watch closely in 2025 and beyond. Conclusion: XRP’s Quest to $5 Amid Jetbolt’s Booming Presale XRP’s journey toward the ambitious $5 target hinges on overcoming significant resistance levels and navigating a volatile market landscape. Recent price surges, coupled with optimism surrounding Ripple’s legal clarity, have rekindled hope among crypto enthusiasts. However, bearish patterns and potential support breakdowns underline the challenges that lie ahead for XRP. Amid this uncertainty, JetBolt’s booming presale emerges as a beacon of innovation in the crypto space. With zero-gas technology, an intuitive Web3 wallet, and a dynamic SocialFi staking model, JetBolt sets itself apart as a forward-thinking project. As XRP battles market dynamics, JetBolt’s momentum and groundbreaking features remind us of the endless possibilities that continue to reshape the cryptocurrency landscape in 2025.

The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) secured $37.25 billion in assets during its first year of trading. According to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, this significant figure placed it in third place on the final Top 20 ETF Leaderboard for 2024.This rapid growth for an ETF that is less than a year old highlights the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin .Top Ranking ETFs for 2024 Amid Record $1T InflowsMeanwhile, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) claimed the top two spots. VOO closed 2024 with a massive $116 billion inflow, a staggering $65 billion more than its previous record. Likewise, IVV finished with $89 billion in assets.Despite their dominance, the rapid rise of IBIT in under a year of launch indicates how investors are increasingly looking to diversify into digital assets through ETFs.Notably, total flows into mainstream ETFs in 2024 broke records, with $1.14 trillion flowing into the sector. This figure represents a 25% increase from the previous year, totaling $225 billion more in assets. Ranking of global ETFs for 2024 featuring BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin ETFs Market With Record InflowsBesides BlackRock's IBIT, no other crypto investment product made it to the top ten ranking for highest flows in 2024. BlackRock's closest rival, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), ranked 14th with a one-year inflow of $11.84 billion. For context, BlackRock's ETF inflow for 2024 was more than three times this figure.BlackRock and Fidelity have been the two behemoths of the Bitcoin spot ETF market. Their closest rival in terms of inflows was the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which saw only $2.17 billion in inflows throughout 2024.While these asset managers are registering notable Bitcoin investments throughout 2024, Grayscale, once the market leader, bled $21.296 billion in outflows for the year. Despite this staggering outflow from Grayscale , the overall U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF market welcomed a net positive flow of $35.24 billion—an impressive figure attained even before their first birthday.",Market|Trending Now|Bitcoin ETF|BTC|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest BlackRock News Updates Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-01-02 15:14:33

BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Notcoin Are Ready to Shine Meme coins. They’re not just for giggles anymore—they’re rewriting the script on what it means to invest in the crypto world. Sure, we’ve all had a chuckle over Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu mascot or debated whether Elon’s latest tweet was a coded message to “hodl.” But behind the memes lies a golden (or perhaps, dogecoin-coloured) opportunity for savvy investors looking for long-term gains. Among the countless options on the market, three meme coins stand out as front-runners for those with their eyes on the future: BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Notcoin. Whether you’re new to the game or an old hand at spotting crypto’s next big thing, these coins are worth your attention. BTFD Coin: Leading the Bulls to Glory First up, BTFD Coin—or as I like to call it, the crown jewel of meme coins. BTFD, short for “Buy the Dip,” has managed to take a cheeky trading mantra and build an entire ecosystem around it. From its eye-catching presale numbers to its unique P2E (play-to-earn) game and staking rewards, BTFD Coin is a top contender among the best meme coins to join for long-term investments. Why BTFD Is a Bullish Bet Now in its 13th presale stage, BTFD Coin has already raised over $4.8 million and sold more than 61 billion tokens. It boasts a growing community of over 7100 holders, each as passionate about “buying the dip” as they are about BTFD’s adorable mascot crew, the Bulls Squad. The staking APY is a juicy 90%, making this coin not only fun but also profitable for those who stick around for the long haul. BTFD Coin’s fully-fledged P2E game has been launched, enabling players to enjoy the game and earn rewards. Inspired by the 1973 crash, $BTFD offers a chance to invest like Warren Buffett. Priced at just $0.000142 in Stage 13, it’s an affordable entry point for potential high returns. The BIG50 bonus provides a 50% bonus on your purchase (e.g., buy 100, get 150) using code BIG50. Don’t miss this opportunity to accumulate BTFD and prepare for potential market growth. Simple! Go to the BTFD Coin website to join their presale. Connect your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and use bonus code BIG50 for a 50% BTFD Coin bonus on your purchase. This offer ends on January 5th. Don’t miss out! Mog Coin: The Cat with a Plan Mog Coin may not have invented the meme coin, but it sure has perfected the art of feline finesse. This coin takes inspiration from internet cat culture—because, let’s face it, who doesn’t love a good cat meme? Mog Coin leverages this universal appeal to build a community that’s as loyal as it is playful. What’s the Meow-sive Appeal? The Mog Coin community isn’t just in it for the memes. This project is deeply tied to the NFT market, offering collectors exclusive Mog-themed assets with real-world utility. And then there’s the burn mechanism—Mog Coin reduces its supply with every major milestone, increasing its scarcity and long-term value. Analysts are buzzing about Mog Coin’s potential to outperform its competitors in the next few years, cementing its spot among the best meme coins to join for long-term investments. This is one kitty you’ll want to keep in your portfolio. Notcoin: The Ultimate Anti-Meme Meme Coin Notcoin is a walking contradiction, and that’s exactly the point. This project leans into its irony, branding itself as the “meme coin for people who don’t believe in meme coins.” While it started as a joke, it quickly gained traction among contrarian investors and meme coin sceptics alike. Why Notcoin Is a ‘Yes’ Notcoin’s charm lies in its satirical edge. It doesn’t promise to revolutionise crypto or change the world—it promises to make you laugh and (potentially) line your pockets. The project thrives on its community’s creativity, with a marketing strategy that relies heavily on memes, guerrilla campaigns, and tongue-in-cheek humour. Behind the jokes, though, is a serious commitment to utility. Notcoin’s developers have rolled out a decentralised voting system that gives holders a direct say in the project’s future. It also has a play-to-earn game and the most recent ‘Earn’ initiative to reward token holders. If you’re after a coin that delivers on both laughs and longevity, Notcoin deserves a second look. Why These Coins Are Built for the Long Haul So, why do these three coins stand out from the pack? They can combine meme-worthy charm with actual value. BTFD Coin brings community-driven fun and financial rewards, Mog Coin capitalises on our obsession with cats and NFTs. Notcoin proves that even self-deprecating humour can translate to investment success. In meme coins, hype can fade quickly, but these three projects have laid the groundwork for staying power. They’re not just chasing trends—they’re creating them. Join the BTFD Coin Revolution Today Of course, if you’re looking for the best meme coins to join for long-term investments, BTFD Coin is the standout star. With its record-breaking presale and a roadmap that promises both fun and financial growth, this coin is set to dominate the market for years to come. Visit the official BTFD Coin presale page, connect your wallet, and join the Bulls Squad. Who knows? Your ticket to financial freedom might just be one “buy the dip” away!

Bitcoin outperforms traditional assets Bitcoin outperforms traditional assets. It is worth mentioning that Bitcoin’s 2024 return is slightly lower than the 156% growth registered the previous year. Nonetheless, the world’s largest cryptocurrency still emerged as the best-performing asset in 2024, outperforming every other major asset class, including Gold, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ 100. Multiple factors, such as the launch of multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs and the Bitcoin Halving event, drove its incredible performance in 2024. Additionally, general market sentiment favoring Bitcoin amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tension also positively impacted BTC’s price. Bitcoin Performance from 2024 to DateData shows that Bitcoin’s 2024 opening price was around $42,280, with the premier cryptocurrency subsequently closing at $93,429 on December 31, 2024.

For context, on Election Day, November 5, Bitcoin hovered around $67,500. It spiked tremendously following Donald Trump’s victory, soaring to an all-time high (ATH) of $108,268 on December 17, marking a post-election gain of 60.39%. However, Bitcoin slumped heavily shortly after, plunging below $92,000 after reaching the $108K ATH. At the moment, Bitcoin has regained momentum, as it looks set to reclaim the $100,000 target.

IRS Crypto Tax Delay Could Drive Buying The IRS has postponed its new crypto cost-basis reporting rules to December 31, 2025, which initially required centralized exchanges to implement the FIFO (First In, First Out) accounting method. Critics argued this could inflate tax liabilities during bull markets by taxing older, lower-cost basis holdings first. This delay gives investors breathing room to use more flexible accounting methods, such as HIFO (Highest In, First Out), while brokers update their systems. The move is seen as favorable for crypto buyers and could stimulate increased market activity, particularly in Bitcoin. 3/ IRS recognized this issue and issued temporary transition relief (Notice 2025-7), today.

Swiss Proposal: Bitcoin for National Reserves A Swiss initiative aims to amend the nation’s Article 99 Constitution, requiring the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to allocate Bitcoin reserves alongside gold. This proposal, backed by 2B4CH and supported by key industry figures like Tether VP of Energy and Mining, signals increasing global adoption. It's official! The Bitcoin initiative has been published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesblatt) today! This means the signatures collection phase starts today. The committee will have until 30.06.2026 to collect and submit 100,000 manuscript signatures from Swiss citizens. 1/3 — Bitcoin Initiative (@initiativeBTC) December 31, 2024 The initiative needs 100,000+ signatures by June 30, 2026, to advance. While cities like Lugano are embracing crypto, SNB Chair Martin Schlegel remains skeptical, citing concerns about Bitcoin’s environmental impact and payment utility. Still, such moves underscore Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy as an asset class. Bitcoin Price Technical Outlook – January 2, 2025 Bitcoin recently broke above a descending trendline, signaling bullish momentum as it eyes a test of the $98,332 resistance level. A Fibonacci retracement at 38.2% aligns with this level, making it a critical threshold for further upside. If the price clears this resistance, the next targets lie at $100,254 (50% retracement) and $102,177 (61.8% retracement). On the downside, immediate support is observed at $94,576, with stronger levels at $92,103 and $89,613, safeguarding against potential bearish reversals. The 50 EMA, currently at $95,000, reinforces the bullish case, while the RSI hovers near 60, signaling moderate buying strength without overbought conditions. Bitcoin’s triple-bottom pattern at $92,103 has provided a solid foundation for the ongoing rally, while increasing volume supports the breakout narrative. A sustained move above $98,332 would confirm bullish dominance, potentially paving the way toward the psychological $100,000 level.

Will the Drop Continue?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/mica-officially-entered-into-force-tether-experienced-its-biggest-drop-in-the-last-two-years-will-the-drop-continue/,"The Crypto Asset Act (MİCA), which was first announced by the European Union in 2020 and passed by the European Parliament in 2023, came into force on December 30. Tether’s market value fell by over 1% as it remains unclear whether the largest stablecoin USDT is compliant with MICA regulations. At this point, Tether had its biggest weekly drop since the FTX crash. This move by Tether comes after some cryptocurrency exchanges in the European Union and Coinbase decided to delist USDT due to the EU’s MiCA law. According to the MİCA regulation, stablecoin issuers must have a MiCA license and meet certain conditions in order to be publicly traded within the EU. Therefore, EU-based investors will be able to continue holding USDT in non-custodial wallets, but will not be able to trade on MİCA-compliant centralized exchanges. Given USDT’s central importance in the crypto market, the decline has raised speculation that a broader market downturn could be imminent. However, analysts have noted that the decline in Tether could be limited to Europe. Karen Tang, head of APAC at Orderly Network, stated that the MICA regulation will not harm USDT’s market dominance. “MiCA regulations are not expected to harm USDT's market dominance. Because the largest volume of USDT occurs in Asia and the USA. These regulations slow down EU digital asset innovation, which is already slow due to complex over-regulation.” Cryptocurrency analyst Bitblaze noted that most of the Tether volume occurs in Asia, and said that the delisting decision of Coinbase and European exchanges due to MiCA will have a very limited impact on Tether. “USDT is the largest stablecoin with a market cap of $138.5 billion and a daily trading volume of $44 billion. As of today, 80% of USDT's trading volume comes from Asia, so delisting in the EU will not have a significant impact on its market dominance.” *This is not investment advice.

Major events like the ICO boom and the implosions of Terra and FTX have made it impossible for regulators and lawmakers to ignore the crypto industry, especially as its adoption continues to grow. Leading the charge in the effort to foster responsible innovation is the European Union, with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, which passed in April 2023 after nearly three years of development.While the implementation of the rules was phased, with rules targeting stablecoin issuers coming into force in June 2024, all parts of the framework have now entered into force since December 30, 2024. Here's what MiCA brings to the table and how it is reshaping the EU's crypto landscape.What is MiCA?The primary goal of MiCA is to ensure consumer protection in crypto while offering regulatory certainty for companies across the 27-member bloc. MiCA tries to achieve this by setting transparency and accountability standards for crypto asset issuers and crypto asset service providers (CASPs). The rules allow market participants to obtain licensing in one country and passport their services across the bloc.Key MiCA ProvisionsFor crypto asset issuers, the rules mean new disclosure requirements. Specifically, before introducing a new asset, issuers must draft a detailed whitepaper containing key details about its tokenomics, risks, and consensus mechanism.This whitepaper must be submitted to a national authority that does not have to explicitly approve the token launch but reserves the power to block it. At the same time, these issuers must also comply with marketing disclosures.Requirements for stablecoin issuers, however, go beyond these disclosure obligations. They must obtain electronic money institution (EMI) licenses, which impose significant Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know-Your-Customer (KYC), and audit obligations.The law also imposes high stablecoin requirements regarding liquidity, redemption, and wind-down procedures and outlaws algorithmic stablecoins.For CASPs, MiCA means implementing robust KYC systems, establishing custody policies for the safekeeping of customer funds, and implementing robust market abuse detection and reporting systems.Beyond these, MiCA also places a de-facto ban on privacy coins.Which Companies are Affected by MiCA?MiCA impacts every crypto issuer or service provider operating within or offering services to EU residents. These include stablecoin providers like Circle and Tether, exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, and even custodians such as BitGo.Tether in FocusBy far, the major talking point to come out of MiCA's passing has been its implications for the EU's stablecoin landscape, especially as Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, has not pursued a license in the bloc, unlike its biggest competitor, Circle.As a result, several crypto exchanges have moved to delist Tether USD (USDT) and Euro Tether (EURT) as part of efforts to obtain licensing in the region. While it is unclear whether Tether will reverse its decision in the future, MiCA's coming into force has likely contributed to the $2 billion decline in USDT's market cap over the past two days from nearly $139 billion to about $137 billion.Companies Still Have TimeEven though MiCA is now entirely in force, the law grants firms a window of grace to process licensing applications.For stablecoin issuers, this window was set at 12 months from the law's implementation, which gives companies until June 2025, as parts of the rules targeting stablecoins came into force in June 2024.For CASPs, this window was set at 18 months, giving firms till June 2026 to obtain licensing or cease operations in the EU.Meanwhile, even as firms race to comply with MiCA, regulators are already considering an update to cover DeFi and NFTs.",Market|Trending Now|Cryptocurrency Regulations|Latest Stablecoin News Today|Latest Tether Crypto News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-01-02 15:30:56

This marks a significant milestone in its fight against cryptocurrency-related financial crime. The T3 Financial Crime Unit ( #T3FCU ), a collaboration between #TRON , @Tether_to , and @trmlabs , has frozen more than USDT 100 million in criminal assets globally, passing a significant milestone in its fight against cryptocurrency-related financial crime. @CoinDesk … pic.twitter.com/iksHKkZtjJ — TRON DAO (@trondao) January 2, 2025 Notably, the T3 Financial Crime Unit is a collaboration between the Tron blockchain, stablecoin issuer Tether and blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs. T3, in partnership with TRM Labs, uses blockchain tools to help Tron and Tether track and freeze USDT linked to illegal activities. The Tron blockchain has nearly $60 billion in USDT, making it the second-largest after Ethereum, which has just over $75 billion. T3 revealed in a statement that the venture analyzed millions of transactions across five continents, monitoring a total volume in excess of 3 billion USDT. In an interview with Coindesk , Chris Janczewski, the head of global investigations at TRM Labs, noted that money laundering as a service is the biggest source of frozen funds, where criminals hire dark web entities to launder money. However, other activities like investment scams, drug trafficking, terrorism financing, blackmail, hacks, and violent crime are also targets. Chris Janczewski remarked that blockchain is not a good place for money laundering because it’s very transparent. It allows them to verify victim reports and even identify other victims, something which traditional finance cannot do. “T3 FCU’s ability to work closely with law enforcement worldwide to effectively disrupt cybercriminals from using USDT on TRON is a proof of concept for public-private partnerships,” noted Janczewski. T3 noted that that up to 3 million frozen USDT were linked to North Korea, which has been trying to use crypto projects to fund its regime. The U.S. Treasury shut down a North Korean money laundering network in December. Chris Janczewski hopes their efforts will help victims recover funds and discourage bad actors from using blockchains like Tron for illicit activities. “Criminals now have 100 million reasons to think twice before using #TRON,” Justin Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain shared on X.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Chainlink and Polkadot face downturns, Lunex Network’s presale gains momentum, boosting optimism for 2025. The recent market retracement has pushed many altcoins into the downtrend. While the Chainlink price has dropped significantly, the token appears set for further potential gains. Polkadot’s price has been navigating downwards since hitting a peak of $11 in early December. Despite this setback, there is growing optimism of a resurgence soon. Meanwhile, the Lunex Network (LNEX) presale has continued to witness massive growth as investors anticipate more rallies in the coming weeks. Designed to allow for the seamless buying, selling and swapping of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, the LNEX token is projected to outshine more established crypto coins in this bull cycle. Analyst projects Chainlink price to $160 in 2025 Chainlink, the decentralized Oracle network, has witnessed a sharp decline in the past weeks. Having failed several attempts to establish support above the $30 mark, the LINK price chart has been navigating downward in the past two weeks. CoinMarketCap data shows the altcoin price has declined by 14% in the past week, pushing it below the $22 support zone. The Chainlink market sentiment is neutral, but the Fear and Greed index is 64 (Greed). Over 18 technical indicators are bearish, and the altcoin is trading below the 30-day SMA ($24.43). However, the RSI in the 1D timeframe is 46, an indication that it is not yet in overbought territory. Although Chainlink’s price is down, crypto analysts like TimeFreedom on X claim the token will rally in 2025. Using the Elliott Wave Pattern, the tweet claims that Chainlink’s token will surpass $160 in Q4 of 2025. Another analyst with the username Butterfly thinks that Chainlink crypto has broken out of the symmetrical triangle pattern in the weekly chart with a potential target of $74. Polkadot token forecasted for massive growth in 2025 Polkadot, a multi-chain blockchain that enables different networks to work together, has found itself at a crossroads after a sustained corrective phase. Since breaking through the $11 mark in early December, the Polkadot price has been navigating downwards, with the coin consolidating near the $6.65 mark. CoinMarketCap data shows a 25% decline in the monthly chart. While the next move will determine whether the recent retracement is a temporary pullback or not, crypto analyst Flash thinks that the Polkadot crypto bear market will end soon. Using the DOT price chart, the tweet claims that the Polkadot token price will bottom at $5.35 while the next leg up will push the altcoin price towards $8.5. Another analyst, World Of Charts , claims that Polkadot crypto is still holding crucial areas and a successful retest can send it towards $30 in the coming months. With the rising market activity, Polkadot remains one of the top crypto coins watch out for in 2025. Can Lunex Network token hit $1 in 2025? Lunex Network is a next-generation Web3 DeFi crypto exchange designed to allow seamless trading and swapping of cryptocurrencies across multiple blockchains at the lowest costs. Unlike other exchanges with rigorous KYC processes, Lunex Network (LNEX) does not require a third-party DeFi wallet connection like Meta Mask and Trust Wallet. As the world’s first community-backed crypto exchange, Lunex Network will allow businesses to accept cryptos as a form of payment and convert them into fiat through the Lunex B2B payment gateway API. This solves the issues of cross-border payment faced by traders. At the mobile exchange, users will be able to spot trade over 50k cryptos across multiple blockchains. Traders can utilize the unique portfolio tracker to track multiple assets like cryptos, Bonds, stocks, etc. The Lunex Network thrives on simplicity with a unique DeFi crypto wallet which allows users to buy, sell and swap cryptos all from one account. As part of its mission to reward the community, there is also a revenue-sharing model designed to reward LNEX holders. Like BNB, the LNEX token holds massive potential. Holders will unlock discounts on transaction fees. At the ongoing presale, the LNEX token is sold for just $0.0052, with early investors already making over 333% in profits. With over $5.6M raised in cryptocurrency ICO funding, the LNEX price is projected to jump to $1 in 2025. Best DeFi coin to buy in the bull cycle Both Chainlink and Polkadot have the potential to set new records in the bull cycle. However, Lunex Network could be the game changer. The amount raised within a short time shows the growing confidence of investors in the DeFi coin. Also, with its mission of solving issues of interoperability, privacy, and scalability, the trading exchange will likely witness more investor inflow, which could increase buying pressure on the LNEX token. This makes it one of the best DeFi coins to buy now.

Memecoins were once viewed as humorous offshoots of cryptocurrency. Whether inspired by a viral dog or a dead squirrel, they appeared to lack intrinsic value. However, this crypto cycle has seen memecoins emerge as a significant financial phenomenon. According to a report by DWF Labs, the market capitalization of memecoins surged from $20 billion in January 2024 to over $120 billion by December — a 500% increase. This growth reflects the rise of a new digital asset class driven by community engagement and shared cultural narratives rather than traditional financial metrics. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies based on internet memes or cultural trends. Popular examples like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) started as jokes but gained serious traction due to strong community support. Memecoins have evolved from speculative assets to tools for expressing digital identity, community-building, and even creating new forms of value, according to DWF Labs. You might also like: KuCoin launches new crypto payment solution for merchants Key findings from the report The report emphasized that memecoins derive their success from social capital — the value created through active community participation, cultural resonance, and network effects. According to DWF Labs, memecoins follow a distinct four-phase lifecycle that underpins their growth and influence. The first phase, deployment, involves the creation of tokens on blockchain platforms. These platforms simplify the process, requiring minimal technical expertise or financial investment, making token creation accessible to almost anyone. Next comes social capital formation. Communities form on platforms like Twitter and Telegram , building momentum through active engagement, influencer endorsements, and shared narratives that resonate with members. Once a community is established, decentralized trading enables the tokens to gain liquidity and accessibility. Automated market makers and analytical tools, such as sentiment and trend analysis platforms, facilitate trading and ensure sustained interest. In the final phase, value creation and distribution, the community drives growth through peer-to-peer promotion and user-generated content. This grassroots approach often replaces the need for traditional marketing efforts. Source: DWF Labs Memecoins are a ‘new paradigm’ in finance Memecoins are redefining traditional financial norms by proving the importance of community support and narrative strength over operational history or revenue figures. Unlike the lengthy processes associated with traditional IPOs, memecoins can be created in just a few hours. Blockchain technology and smart contracts have further streamlined token creation, reducing costs and enabling greater market participation. The report also notes that memecoins are moving beyond humor and novelty. Emerging categories, such as AI-themed tokens, blend cultural relevance with practical applications, attracting interest from institutional investors. This merging of aspects may allow memecoins to serve as testbeds for innovation within digital economies. DWF Labs concluded that while memecoins face sustainability challenges, their influence on the evolution of digital economies is undeniable and significant.

Whale accumulation, growing real-world payment use cases, institutional interest, and technical predictions all point to a positive DOGE market. Spirit aims to leverage these trends. “By activating a yield-generation strategy with Dogecoin, we aim to unlock a previously untapped revenue stream while simultaneously positioning ourselves as a market leader in yield generation for not only Dogecoin, but the broader digital asset space within the public sector,” Lewis Bateman, chief executive officer of Spirit Blockchain Capital, noted. In the future, Spirit plans to expand the yield strategy to other assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Tether ( USDT ), and Solana ( SOL ). The initiative is part of the long-term strategy of diversifying revenue streams, increasing shareholder value and advancing the tokenized financial products market.

The crypto has broken new price records in recent times and is also attracting attention from major exchanges. Whale activity in the cryptocurrency market has shifted notably toward ZEREBRO (ZEREBRO), an AI-driven token built on the Solana blockchain. DWF Labs made the most notable market movement toward the coin. According to LookOnChain, DWF Labs received 1.25 million ZEREBRO tokens, worth approximately $805,000, about three weeks ago, securing its place as one of the coin’s key market makers. Since then, the price of the coin has surged to new heights. According to the latest data, the token surged past the $0.78 mark hours ago, reaching a new, all-time high price. The surge in value coincided with its launch on Binance Perpetual Futures, expanding its reach on the global exchange. Whales profit big from ZEREBRO Another whale, who has been active in both ZEREBRO and AI16z, has seen significant profits as well. Since November 28, this investor spent $9.33 million to acquire 19.83 million AI16z tokens, which have now appreciated to $45.4 million.

Such substantial gains demonstrate the growing confidence in the token’s potential, as investors may now start taking accumulative positions in anticipation of a further price rally. What is ZEREBRO? At its core, ZEREBRO is an autonomous AI system designed to create, distribute, and analyze content across decentralized platforms. Its developers reckon that the token operates independently of human oversight, generating hyperstition, a form of content blending fiction and reality. According to a Forbes insight, this system engages audiences on various channels such as X, Instagram, Warpcast, and Telegram with high-entropy content that pushes the boundaries of traditional media. The AI-powered crypto leverages an advanced protocol named Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which ensures content diversity and combats common issues like “model collapse,” a common degenerative effect in AI content models. Moreover, the token’s decentralized interactions span multiple blockchains, including Solana, Polygon, and Bitcoin, reflecting it’s deep connection with the crypto community. ZEREBRO’s rise in the market December 2024 was a pivotal month for the crypto coin’s market presence. The token’s journey saw a significant boost when the HTX crypto exchange added the ZEREBRO/USDT spot trading pair on December 17, creating new opportunities for retail traders. Just days later, the OKX exchange followed suit, launching perpetual futures trading for ZEREBRO, offering leverage options up to 50x. The impact of these exchange listings was immediate, with the coin’s 24-hour trading volume skyrocketing from an average of $5 million to over $192 million. Crypto experts believe that its innovative approach to smart contracts and its scalability solutions may be pivotal to its long-term success. 1/ Why $ZEREBRO Could Be the Next $VIRTUAL with a 9x upside?

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA.

VIRTUAL price soared and became the best-performing cryptocurrency in 2024. So, will the Virtuals Protocol token continue rising or will it suffer a strong 25% reversal soon? VIRTUAL Price Prediction: Faces Potential Downside Risks The VIRTUAL token had a strong year as it surged from $0.057 in September to over $5 this week, a 10,500% increase. This surge was primarily driven by its ecosystem growth , especially the performance of G.A.M.E, Luna, and aixbt. It also happened because of the AI agent theme in the crypto industry. The token faces potential risks that could lead it to more downside in the near term. For example, there are signs that it is forming a bearish divergence pattern on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) peaked in October and formed lower highs even as the coin surged. Similarly, the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO), which is a modified MACD indicator, has formed a bearish divergence pattern. These divergences can often take a longer period to trigger a bearish breakout. Meanwhile, VIRTUAL price remains much higher than the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. That means that it may lead to a mean reversal, where an asset moves back to its recent averages. There are also signs that the coin is slowly forming a doji candlestick pattern. This pattern forms when an asset has a tiny body and long lower and upper shadows. It usually signifies that the asset opened and closed in the same price and is usually a reversal sign. The doji will be confirmed if the price ends the Additionally, VIRTUAL price may be approaching the distribution or markdown phase of the Wyckoff Method. It went through an accumulation phase for months last year, and then moved to the markup, a phase characterized by higher demand amid FOMO. The next phase will be distribution followed by a markdown. VIRTUAL Price Chart Virtuals Protocol Token Price Targets If the bearish thesis works out, it means that the VIRTUAL token will drop in the next few days. If this happens, the next potential target to focus on will be at $3.3327, the highest swing on December 16, which is about 25% below the current level, Such a move would trigger profit-taking, which will move it to the 50-day moving average at $2.26. On the flip side, the coin may benefit from the January Effect and the ongoing crypto and AI tokens demand. If that happens, the markup phase could continue for longer and see it almost doubling to $10.

This article will explore some of the most intriguing projects making waves in the market, including BlockDAG (BDAG), Bittensor (TAO), Sui (SUI), Arbitrum (ARB), and Aave (AAVE). These digital assets have captured attention for their innovative approaches, unique features, and potential to rank among the best cryptos for massive ROI. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): 2240% ROI & Potential To Hit $1 In 2025 BlockDAG (BDAG) is rapidly emerging as one of the best cryptos for massive ROI, thanks to its incredible presale performance and innovative features. With over $174.5 million raised and more than 17.6 billion coins sold, the project has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and experts alike. Early adopters have already experienced an astonishing 2240% ROI, as BDAG’s price skyrocketed from $0.001 in its initial presale batch to $0.0234 in the current batch 26. As demand continues to grow, the next batch is set to sell at $0.0248, showcasing the sustained momentum behind this promising project. The excitement doesn’t stop there. Analysts predict BlockDAG could reach a value of $1 in 2025, with the potential to soar to $30 by 2030. This trajectory underscores the project’s long-term potential for growth, positioning it as a top contender in the crypto space. Its unique features and strong community backing ensure that BlockDAG remains a leader in the market, setting a new benchmark for presale success.

As a powerful scalability solution, Arbitrum ensures that users can experience faster and more affordable transactions without compromising Ethereum's robust security. Currently priced at $0.7357, Arbitrum has seen a slight dip of 7.97% over the past week, but its utility in solving Ethereum's scaling issues ensures it remains a vital part of the blockchain ecosystem. 5. Aave (AAVE): Redefining Crypto Lending Aave (AAVE) is a leading blockchain-based lending platform that has set new standards in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. By allowing users to borrow cryptocurrency through overcollateralized loans, Aave ensures security and reliability in its transactions.

This system enhances trust and efficiency in the platform, contributing to its widespread adoption. With its price currently at $311.69 and a remarkable growth of 52.05% in the past month, Aave continues to establish itself as a cornerstone in the DeFi ecosystem. Choosing the Best Crypto for Massive ROI The cryptocurrency market is brimming with opportunities, and projects like Bittensor (TAO), Sui (SUI), Arbitron (ARB), BlockDAG (BDAG), and Aave (AAVE) each bring unique value to the table. Whether it’s Bittensor’s seamless integration of machine intelligence, Sui’s unmatched transaction speed, Arbitrum’s Ethereum scalability solutions, or Aave’s innovative lending platform—all these cryptos have demonstrated their potential to reshape the blockchain space. However, when it comes to presale success and sheer return on investment, BlockDAG stands in a league of its own.

Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the largest meme coin, rose by about 6% on Dec. 2, bringing its seven-day gains to 7.5%. However, the momentum may reverse as a Polymarket poll shows that the odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving a spot DOGE ETF this year dropped to 26%, down from a high of 50% last week. In contrast, Polymarket users expect that the SEC will approve a Solana ( SOL ) ETF later this year, with odds being at 76%. The odds of a Ripple (XRP) ETF are at 70%. The weaker odds for a DOGE ETF likely stem from the absence of an application by any financial services company. In contrast, WisdomTree, a $100 billion asset manager, has filed for a Ripple ETF. Additionally, the SEC has a Jan. 31 deadline to approve or reject Solana ETFs proposed by companies like Grayscale, 21Shares, and VanEck.

Such an ETF could see approval more easily, as Dogecoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin. DOGE also holds a significant position in the crypto industry, with a market cap of $50 billion—approximately $16 billion lower than MicroStrategy’s. MicroStrategy has multiple leveraged and covered call ETFs. Crypto ETFs are doing well as they are helping institutional investors gain access to the industry. Bitcoin ETFs now hold over $105 billion in assets, while Ethereum funds have over $12 billion. Dogecoin price analysis DOGE price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that DOGE bottomed at $0.2635 in December and has since recovered to $0.3382. It has moved toward the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index is attempting to break above the descending trendline. The Percentage Price Oscillator has formed a bullish crossover. Additionally, the accumulation and distribution indicator remains elevated, suggesting that investors are gradually accumulating DOGE. As a result, the coin is likely to rebound, with bulls targeting the resistance at $0.4836, the highest level reached in 2024. Conversely, a drop below the support level of $0.2650 would signal further downside potential.

In a recent attempt to find out the next breakthrough token, ChatGPT ranked a few emerging altcoins, including fast-rising presale star– Remittix (RTX) among the tokens with disruptive potential in the crypto market. Specifically, Remittix is gaining widespread attention largely because of its unique attempt to spearhead the next wave of development in the PayFi sector. With the sole aim of making crypto-to-fiat transactions very seamless for everyday users, Remittix is set to challenge top altcoin projects like Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for market dominance. Remittix Prioritizes Convenience as It Redefines Cross-Border Payment Cross-border payment innovations are largely driven by the need to simplify global remittance for everyday users. This is evident in the emergence of cryptocurrency, which have also fueled a new wave of cross-border payment solutions like Remittix (RTX) . This new decentralized PayFi solution solves a crucial challenge in the existing financial landscape– bridging the gap between crypto payment and global fiat settlement. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Remittix makes fiat transactions easier, faster, secure and more cost-efficient; it simply allows users to swap up to 40 crypto assets into fiat instantly, before sending to banks worldwide. While it beat the likes of Coinbase, Wise and Stripe to their game, Remittix further ensures that it offers even more advantages to savvy investors, including retail users and corporate businesses. For instance, businesses owners can create an account and use its Pay API feature to accept crypto payments which can be converted to fiat currency and vice versa. Meanwhile, all transactions are immutable, thereby eliminating unnecessary cashbacks. This unique positioning at the intersection of DeFi and TradFi have attracted a lot of investors to the project’s presale campaign, considering it has raised over $800k with the native RTX tokens selling for merely $0.0167. Solana Token Attract Mixed Reactions As it Trades below the $200 Price Mark Solana (SOL) price trajectory has attracted a lot of positive projections and skepticism at the same time. While the skepticism stems from its extended price consolidation, several analysts maintain a bullish stance for SOL token. Currently trading within a weekly range of $191 and $193, SOL price reflects less than 1% increase in the past week with about 18% decline in the past week. Although many consider this noticeable retracement as a minor setback, it remains unclear if Solana will navigate its way above the $200 price mark any time soon. Meanwhile, popular crypto analyst Ali in an X post , highlighted $190 and $180 as the most significant support zone for Solana. If SOL token fails to hold this zone, then further retracement to lower levels can be anticipated. Shiba Inu Token Faces Extended Decline Amidst Severe Consolidation Earlier in the month, Shiba Inu (SHIB) printed a bullish pattern, prompting top crypto analysts like JAVON MARKS to project a possible breakout above the $0.000080 levels. Although SHIB token has since suffered a fatal dip, registering nearly 30% decline, several analysts as well as token holders are still maintaining bullish sentiment towards the canine-themed meme coin. Currently trading within a weekly range of $0.000022 and $0.000021, SHIB price reflects about 5% decline which further compounds its progressive decline. While no end appears to be in sight until possible resurgence, analyst Ali recently tipped the price range between $0.0000215 and $0.0000193 as the most significant support zone. Should SHIB token fail to hold this crucial position, then a further decline to lower levels can be anticipated. Ripple Price Trajectory Attracts Positive Sentiment Amidst Consolidation Like Solana and Shiba Inu, Ripple (XRP) is not exempted from the market volatility as it has had to navigate noticeable fluctuations in the past few weeks. While it traded above $2.30 price level earlier in the week, XRP price is currently hovering within a weekly range of $2.23 and $2.08, which reflects slightly over 7% decline during the duration. In contrast, XRP price still maintains a positive position in the monthly chart with over 8% price gain retained. Despite the positive outlook, XRP price has suffered a noticeable decline in the past month as well, falling from its peak price of $2.84 to currently trade below the $2.10 levels. Regardless, Ripple token has continued to attract positive sentiment with top crypto analysts like Ali projecting a lofty target of $11 sometime in 2025. Can Remittix Lead Ripple in Cross-Border Payment? Although Ripple has established itself as a tough contender in the decentralized PayFi sector, especially following its recent victory against the SEC, Remittix still stands a great chance to dominate the market too. While both platforms aim to simplify cross border payment, Remittix’s instant crypto-to-fiat settlement stands out, giving it an unfair advantage over Ripple and its likes.

Balo’s analysis, based on a 4-hour chart, points to several key technical developments that are driving expectations of a continued upward movement of the Dogecoin price. Why Dogecoin Looks Poised To Rally A cornerstone of Balo’s assessment centers on Dogecoin’s decisive breach of a longstanding downtrend line on December 28. This downtrend line, originally established from the December 8 apex of $0.48, had served as a formidable resistance level, effectively dictating DOGE’s price movements throughout December. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Rally 6,770% If This Pattern Holds: Crypto Analyst The breakout above this trend line marks a critical turning point. Following this ascent, Dogecoin experienced a minor retracement in which the memecoin swiftly retested the breached trend line. However, the retest was successful, reinforcing the bullish outlook for Dogecoin. Complementing the breakout from the downtrend line is the dissolution of a descending triangle pattern that had been forming since December 21. A descending triangle is characterized by a series of lower highs converging with a relatively flat support level, often signaling a potential bearish continuation. However, Dogecoin’s ability to break out of this formation today, on January 2 suggests a shift in market sentiment. The emergence from the descending triangle, coupled with the breakout, enhances the bullish narrative, although a retest of the triangle’s upper boundary could provide further validation of this upward trend. Integral to Balo’s thesis of a major breakout is also the volume profile, which offers a nuanced understanding of trading activity at various price levels. Dogecoin has rebounded from the substantial support at the highest volume cluster around $0.32, indicating a strong base of accumulated trading interest. Related Reading: Dogecoin Teeters Between ‘Price Discovery’ And ‘Catastrophe’: What’s Next? To the upside, volume is thin until the $0.40 region, where there is a huge cluster up to $0.43. This clustering implies that above this zone, DOGE could encounter minimal resistance, paving the way for Dogecoin to target its yearly high of $0.4834, recorded on December 8. Further reinforcing the bullish outlook is the completion of the ABC pattern on Dogecoin’s chart. The ABC pattern is a corrective sequence in technical analysis that typically signifies the termination of a retracement phase and the continuation of the preceding trend. In Dogecoin’s case, the finalization of this pattern aligns seamlessly with the other bullish indicators derived from the breakout and volume profile analysis. Thus, Balo’s remark “DOGE [is] starting to break out, I don’t see any reason to stop now. New highs real soon,” could signal that DOGE is heading for a new high. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.34.

The meme coin market not only recovered throughout 2024 but even saw unprecedented highs in early December when its market cap reached $137B. The wave is still far from over. Despite ongoing fluctuations over the past 30 days, 2025 is already off to a great start, with the market cap bouncing back +9.4% over the past 24 hours. OG meme coins like $DOGE and $PEPE are among the top 10 most traded coins over the past 24 hours, but there are some newcomers that are also making big gains. Here are five of the best new meme coins to keep an eye on right now. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Pepe Meets Wall Street to Empower Small Traders $WEPE was one of the most successful presales of 2024, and it’s now raised $39.4M to date. The coin is audited and ready to hit the market. However, although the presale ends today, the fun is only about to begin. Following in the shoes of other successful Pepe-themed coins, like the original $PEPE and Pepe Unchained ($PEPU), this new frog meme coin comes onto the scene with a twist. The project aims to create and foster a community of new investors by providing all the tools necessary to trade like a pro. For those tired of whales and insiders always snapping up the biggest gains and influencing the tide, $WEPE jumps in to provide exclusive trading insights, signals, and calls. $WEPE also gives its investors access to a discussion forum where investors can share trading strategies and stay updated on the latest market events. Overall, $WEPE has a lot going for it to support long-term community engagement. It’s also endorsed by top wallet provider Best Wallet , which further suggests potential for greater adoption and gains in the near future. For more of the latest news on $WEPE, you can also tune in on X and Telegram . Solaxy ($SOLX) – First Ever Solana Layer-2 Token Takes Scalability to New Levels Solana is undoubtedly the newest blockchain darling in the meme coin market. Thanks to the surging popularity of Solana’s Pump.fun platform, thousands of meme coins were launched and traded on the blockchain in 2024. However, $SOLX will be among the first shiny new Layer-2 (L2) tokens to emerge in 2025. This multi-chain Pepe-themed meme coin takes the best of both Ethereum and Solana. It combines Ethereum’s liquidity and DeFi ecosystem with Solana’s speed and low trading fees. What investors get in return is increased transaction speeds, less congestion, no failed transactions, and better scalability. The coin is still in presale, selling for $0.001588. So far, $SOLX has raised $7.7M, which suggests strong community interest in this upcoming meme coin. Considering other top new Solana meme coins like $PENGU and $AI16Z have surpassed $2B in market cap , $SOLX could garner similar attention, especially considering its innovation and utility. Join $SOLX on Telegram or X to stay up to date with the project. You can also check their whitepaper to learn more. Flockerz ($FLOCK) – Trailblazing Vote-to-Earn Token Supports Decentralization $FLOCK is a DAO-powered meme coin making waves with its Vote-to-Earn model. Besides distributing decision-making among its community (‘The Flock’), the project also rewards investors for participating. As part of the community, you can vote to guide major decisions like token burns, new features, and key project developments. You can learn more about the infinite power of The Flock in the project’s whitepaper . Coinsult and SolidProof have also audited the project. Currently on presale for $0.0065823 per token, $FLOCK has already raised $8.47M, showcasing strong community interest. The presale ends in 20 days, and early buyers can earn 324% staking rewards, so it’s still not too late to join The Flock. Whether you’re a decentralization enthusiast or just love innovative meme coins, you can keep an eye on $FLOCK through their Telegram channel and on X . Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – Top Performing NFT-Inspired Token in 2025 The popular NFT collection Pudgy Penguins is back with its own meme coin, $PENGU. The coin hit the market in December 2024, debuting with a market cap of $210.66M and skyrocketing to $3.13B in just 35 minutes. Despite ongoing price fluctuations, $PENGU remains among the top gainers, recording a 655.51% increase over the past 30 days. Currently, it ranks fifth by market cap and third by daily trading volume. It’s also among the few meme coins to have surpassed the $2B market cap mark. Additionally, this Solana-based meme coin is under constant development and could soon go multi-chain by joining Ethereum and Abstract . Considering the NFT project’s longstanding popularity and ongoing support for charitable causes, like their Christmas Pudgy toys donation challenge , it’s likely the token will continue to see strong community support in the future. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Newest Meme Coin to Hit $1B Market Cap in December If you’re a bonafide degen investor with a reputation to uphold, look no further than $FARTCOIN, an altcoin that unabashedly embraces the meme coin culture. This is another new Solana meme coin, and it hit the market in October 2024. It surpassed the $1B market cap milestone in December and reached an all-time high of $1.44B on January 2, jostling into the ranks of the top 10 meme coins. It’s also been one of the top gainers over the past month alongside $PENGU, boasting a +745.69% increase. However, unlike other meme coins that are performing well right now, $FARTCOIN doesn’t provide much utility to investors. Only time will tell if $FARTCOIN will stick around after the hype wave is over. Still, this meme coin has been getting plenty of attention on social media and even in some mainstream news publications , and market sentiment remains bullish at the moment. Big Potential for Meme Coins in 2025 Crypto market interest in meme coins is still buzzing, so it’s a great opportunity to get into the newest top presales and capitalize on the hype to maximize your gains. However, remember these are speculations based on recent trends and are not meant as financial advice. Despite the potential for significant returns, meme coins remain highly speculative investments.

This suggests that the bearish trend might be losing momentum, increasing the probability of an upward breakout. Altcoins are also looking promising, with several coins potentially completing their corrections and gearing up for the next upward movement in Q1. Bitcoin is at a crucial juncture. The price is testing important resistance levels, and breaking above them could open the door for further upside potential. On the weekly Bitcoin chart, Bitcoin remains in a larger bull market. Although there has been a slight slowdown recently, it mirrors the pattern observed in 2023. In October of that year, a bullish crossover on the MACD preceded a significant upward move, which could potentially repeat itself. MicroStrategy’s recent Bitcoin purchase is one of the main reasons behind Bitcoin’s recent surge. Led by Michael Saylor, the company continues to bet on Bitcoin’s long-term value. This rally is also part of a larger trend in the cryptocurrency market, fueled by factors like: Institutional Interest : Big companies and investors are getting more involved in Bitcoin. Clearer Regulations: More countries are providing clearer rules, making investors more confident. Positive Economic Signals: Global financial concerns are driving people to Bitcoin as a safe asset. Bitcoin as a Reserve: More companies are seeing Bitcoin as a valuable asset to hold for the long term. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Looking at the daily chart, Bitcoin has reacted to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. This is an important support level, often seen in corrective phases. While it’s possible that Bitcoin’s current pullback might be complete, more evidence is needed before confirming this. Bitcoin has not yet confirmed a local top. The recent rally started early yesterday, and it’s important to watch key resistance levels. The first key level to look out for is the previous swing high at $97,450. If Bitcoin tests and surpasses this level, it could signal further upward movement.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-02 16:05:15

Lorraine Marcel — Marcel, based in Kenya, is the founder of Bitcoin Dada , a virtual Bitcoin education platform and sisterhood for African women. She was also awarded the Most Impactful African Bitcoiner of 2024 award by the African Bitcoiners group. Kenyan Lorraine Marcel ( @marcelorraine ) is our Most Impactful African Bitcoiner of 2024!

She’s the founder of the Groundswell Project , an organization that works to foster peace and empathy amongst diverse communities. She gave a talk at the “Oslo Freedom Forum” this year entitled “How Bitcoin Can Fund Counter-Terrorism” , in which she highlighted how she’s taught Somali women how to use bitcoin for political fundraising to help support female candidates in the country. Mary Imasuen — Imasuen, who is of Nigerian and Filipino descent and based in Nigeria, is the Global Marketing Manager for Fedi and a self-described “bitcoin-only gamer” who often speaks in support of THNDR Games .

As the dollar continued to strengthen after Trump's victory, analysts said that this rise in the dollar was similar to the rise experienced after Trump's victory in 2016. When Trump was first elected president in 2016, the DXY peaked in December but fell over the next 12 months. The dollar’s decline coincided with Bitcoin’s rise in 2017. At this point, although there is an expectation in the market that the same situation will happen now, this time the story of the dollar and Bitcoin may be different. Because experts stated that there are no signs of decline in the DXY yet and that Trump's economic policies and FED decisions may support the rise of the dollar. While a strong dollar is considered a negative for risk assets like Bitcoin, incoming Trump’s support for Bitcoin has brought new ATHs. But while Trump has expressed support for Bitcoin, Bitwise Europe head of research Andre Dragosch said a strong dollar and Fed policies could pose challenges for Bitcoin in 2025. He said the rally in Bitcoin will not continue at the same pace due to a stronger dollar, higher yields and geopolitical uncertainties. “The Fed is caught between two choices: Do too little, act too late and risk a recession in the U.S., or risk a significant acceleration in inflation again. The Fed told markets at its last meeting that they would only make two rate cuts in 2025. That's why the dollar is appreciating and yields are continuing to rise. “I think the thing that is also affecting BTC and bringing it down is the dollar rising. The macroeconomics are currently a headwind for Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

The nation has prohibited the export of dual-use products to 28 US defense contractors and classified 10 of them as “unreliable entities.” The list includes General Dynamics, Boeing Defense, Space & Security, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and Raytheon Missiles & Defense. Today , Beijing’s Ministry of Commerce said, “To safeguard national security and interests, and fulfill international obligations including non-proliferation, [the latest action was taken] based on China’s export control law and regulation on export control of dual-use items.” Additionally, the spokesperson added Beijing “has always handled the unreliable entity list issue prudently, targeting only a small number of foreign entities that endanger China’s national security.” The ministry added, “Honest and law-abiding foreign entities have nothing to worry about.” Still, is China just responding to Trump’s threats and has decided to fight first? Can these two nations really do without one another? The ten of Beijing’s unreliable entities According to a separate commerce ministry statement, ten of the defense contractors were also included in Beijing’s unreliable entities list due to weapons sales to Taiwan. This, in addition to the defense and aerospace firms, were included in the sanctions list issued by Beijing’s foreign ministry late last year. This was also in reaction to persistent US arms shipments to Taiwan. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a part of the country, which can be unified through force if required. Most countries, including the United States, do not acknowledge the self-governing island as a sovereign state. However, Washington opposes any attempt to capture Taiwan by force and is constitutionally obligated to provide it with weaponry. The list includes five subsidiaries of Lockheed Martin and three of General Dynamics, as well as Raytheon Missile Systems and a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. This means that these enterprises are banned from engaging in mainland China-related import and export activities, as well as making new investments in the nation. Their senior executives are also banned from entering China. Also, their Chinese work or resident permits will be rejected or canceled. The ministry stated, “The so-called military technology cooperation seriously undermines China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity, violates the one-China principle and the provisions of the three joint communiques between China and the US, and significantly threatens peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.” 🇺🇸🇹🇼BIDEN APPROVES $567 MILLION IN SECURITY AID FOR TAIWAN The aid package is expected to bolster Taiwan's military preparedness and support ongoing efforts to strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations in the face of increasing regional threats. Source: White House pic.twitter.com/eS2K5vtEZm — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) September 30, 2024 Notably, in December, US President Joe Biden agreed to provide $571.3 million in defense support to Taiwan. The ministry spokesperson responded that the actions “interfere in China’s internal affairs and undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” China and the US: An eye for an eye Beijing has taken a more confrontational attitude as it prepares for a second presidential term with Donald Trump. He is a vocal opponent of China and its economic might. For instance, Chinese regulators have investigated Nvidia , an American computer processor company. Additionally, the export of rare minerals to the United States has been prohibited. Individual companies have also been targeted to reveal their supply chain vulnerabilities. The measures are a component of an economic tit-for-tat that has intensified in recent months. It commenced during Trump’s inaugural term, following his implementation of trade restrictions and tariffs against the Asian country. Beijing’s responses to retaliation were predominantly symbolic and measured at that time. Since then, the Biden administration has imposed prohibitions on dual-use products and expanded its restrictions on Chinese companies. Recently, it has targeted 140 Chinese companies. However, in recent years, the country has established the legal framework to replicate Washington’s strategies. It has established sanctions and blacklists that can deny American companies access to essential resources. Beijing is currently demonstrating a greater willingness to take action as it responds to Trump’s harsh tariffs. During his presidential campaign, Trump said that he would impose tariffs of 60% or more on goods coming from China.

This trend is often driven by high demand from investors; however, recent data shows that these market participants have slowed down in their acquisition of BTC. The decline in demand, especially from investors in the United States, is seen in the Coinbase Premium Index, which fell to a level not seen in the past 12 months. Coinbase Premium Slumps Again According to a report from the CryptoQuant official Burakkesmeci, the Coinbase Premium Index, which monitors BTC demand from U.S. retail investors, has fallen to -0.237, its lowest point since December 2023. This metric fell to -0.200 on October 25, 2024, shortly before the United States presidential elections, due to heightened uncertainty about the outcome of the political race. However, the indicator surged above 0.15 a few weeks later as BTC rallied above $100,000 following President Donald Trump’s election victory. The index’s latest plunge came as BTC fell below $92,000 to roughly $91,300 at the start of the current business week. Burakkesmeci said the index was also affected by a low-liquidity bitcoin market at the end of the year and increasing seller pressure on U.S. soil. Room for Price Rally? Outflows from the U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market prove American investors have been selling their BTC. These products bled roughly $700 million on two out of the last three trading days of the year, and even on the day of inflows, they collectively recorded a measly $5.3 million in injected capital. Even during the four days leading to Christmas, the spot Bitcoin ETFs shed more than $1.37 billion as investors scrambled to withdraw their funds. Burakkesmeci’s analysis indicates weak institutional demand and a cautious sentiment among U.S. bitcoin investors. “This drop not only signals a lack of institutional demand but also underscores the cautious sentiment among U.S. investors. Such trends can create a challenging environment for Bitcoin’s short-term price recovery unless we see a shift in macroeconomic conditions or renewed interest from institutional or retail buyers,” the analyst stated. Nevertheless, a drop in the Coinbase Premium Index signals room for price growth, meaning that bitcoin’s value could experience a recovery in no distant time.

Declines in the prices of major altcoins have further revealed the skepticism of crypto bulls. Dogecoin and XRP, two major coins that were seeing significant price increases, have suddenly plummeted. However, as crypto whales withdraw their funds from Dogecoin and XRP, 1Fuel, a utility token yet to be launched on cryptocurrency exchanges, has been experiencing massive buy-ins with $964,00 raised in weeks. Analysts project 1Fuel’s current presale price of $0.012 as the lowest it will ever be moving on. DOGE drops by 25% amid market optimism Recent market trends reveal a significant decline in interest in DOGE’s ability to experience an upswing. At press time, DOGE is trading at $0.318 down over 25.4% in the past month per CoinMarketCap . This current bearish price movement appears necessary ahead of a market rally to the upside, as DOGE is trading within a bullish triangle pattern that could take the price to $0.35. The Fear and Greed data on CoinMarketCap supports this bullish outlook, as it is in the neutral region of 49, meaning once DOGE falls to the support level, it will resume its upward movement. Also, this same trend has started gaining footage in XRP’s performance. XRP drops further below expectation The current market dynamics suggest that bullish interests in XRP are fading. This is a result of its overbought condition. According to TradingView , XRP has been struggling to exit the range between $2.146 and $2.0244. After its recent increase in price to $2.9 on December 3, 2024, XRP experienced a huge dip leading to investors hurriedly taking their profits as a result of its price fluctuation for weeks. As it stands, XRP’s price has declined by 17.6% in just the past month. Despite this bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market, investors have turned towards 1Fuel and are bullish on its ability to deliver high potential. Experts predict 1Fuel will give 100x following its public launch. Crypto bulls bet big on 1Fuel’s potential Investors are attracted to 1Fuel’s strong use case, particularly because it is expected to stand out among cryptocurrency wallets, particularly its ability to enable cross-chain transactions. 1fuel aims to eliminate the need to juggle multiple cryptocurrency wallets for cross-chain transactions and minimize gas fees. Also, its built-in AI helps users by providing them with an analysis of market conditions while personalizing strategies to maximize gains while minimizing effort. 1Fuel’s presale phase 2 has garnered $964,000 in token sales, indicating crypto whale's interest. Experts predict up to 500% or more for early investors during this phase and over 100X once it launches on cryptocurrency exchanges. In addition to these, 1Fuel users get to receive 30% staking rewards for merely holding their favorite tokens creating a new source of income for them. Conclusion 1Fuel has taken center stage among multiple cryptocurrencies outpacing popular altcoins like DOGE and XRP. Currently, in the second stage of its presale, it has exceeded 70% of its token sales leaving less than 30% up for grabs and trading at a discounted price of $0.012 only.

This article outlines four meme coins you can’t miss if you want to maximize returns in 2025. Let’s dig in. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe is a new meme coin that focuses on utility integrations. The project is building a trading insights ecosystem, comprising trading signals, meme coin picks, a trading insiders group, staking, and trading rewards. On top of this, the project has captivating branding, mixing artwork of Pepe coin and Jordan Belfort. Pepe-related cryptocurrencies tend to perform well, but Wall Street Pepe aims to elevate its potential with its trading ecosystem and Jordan Belfort inclusion. Presale’s flowing. Candles are growing. $WEPE ain’t slowing. pic.twitter.com/vqHonzkn1v — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 30, 2024 It’s a project that turns everyday investors into smart money traders – and it does this with non-serious, meme coin-native branding. As such, Wall Street Pepe is generating a lot of buzz. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised $39 million so far. The current price is $0.0003664, but this will rise throughout the campaign, with the next increase in 23 hours. Visit Wall Street Pepe Presale Flockerz Similar to Wall Street Pepe, we picked Flockerz for its innovative approach toward utility. The project is building crypto’s first Vote-to-Earn decentralized autonomous organization. This is a new form of governance that puts the community in control and pays them. $FLOCK holders will vote on important decisions relating to the project’s future, including changes to its code, strategic partnerships, and managing its treasury budget.

The Vote-to-Earn mechanism only adds to this by rewarding users for their time and brainpower. The project also offers a staking mechanism, which further incentivizes long-term holding. Flockerz is currently undergoing a presale. It has raised $8.4 million so far. However, the campaign ends in 20 days, after which $FLOCK will list on the open market. Visit Flockerz Presale Meme Index Meme Index is not inherently a meme coin. Instead, it’s a piece of meme coin infrastructure that makes the industry more robust. The project is building a meme coin indices investment platform, allowing traders to purchase diversified baskets of meme coins on-chain. The baskets feature meme coins grouped by volatility, ranging from low to ultra-high. https://twitter.com/memecoin_index/status/1874604412926402934 More cautious investors would choose the low-volatility index, while those chasing the highest returns may choose the ultra-high volatility basket. Users must hold the $MEMEX token to trade on the platform, and this also grants them governance rights and access to staking. The staking mechanism currently offers a 1,589% APY. $MEMEX is available to buy via a token presale, which has raised $1.5 million so far. The current presale price is $0.0148639, and the next increase will occur in under two days. Visit Meme Index Presale Dogwifhat Dogwifhat could be about to go parabolic. The hat-wearing canine token caused a storm in 2024 when it exploded to a $4 billion market cap, twice. But it’s now hoping for a rerun, especially as the wider Solana ecosystem gains pace.

Currently, Dogwifhat is trading at $2.02 with a $2 billion market cap. Dogwifhat is also seeing more volume than Bonk. At press time, Bonk’s 24-hour trading volume is $385 million, while Dogwifhat’s is $429 million.

For investors, it shows great potential. Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have not hit this mark. However, many market analysts like Trader Tardigrade and Shib Spain remain bullish in their price predictions. Meanwhile, a new DeFi coin is approaching that could become a fan favorite. This is LunexNetwork (LNEX) , an upcoming DeFi protocol that will connect all isolated blockchains and disrupt the entire DeFi market. Since it is now in its presale run, many investors are gravitating to it. Many even think that LNEX could reach $1 in 2025 faster than both DOGE and SHIB. Lunex Network (LNEX) Set To Disrupt the DeFi Market As Price Soars 333% Lunex Network (LNEX) is turning many heads in the crypto market. This project is now in its presale run but has already given early buyers a 333% return. More investors are rushing to it as the DeFi coin price rises on a three-day basis. The DeFi market is expected to reach a value of $376M by 2025 as per Statista . Lunex Network aims to dominate this space. It will do this by launching a non-custodial crypto exchange that does not require sign-up KYC checks. On it, people will anonymously swap crypto coins across different blockchains and see competitive spreads and the lowest transaction fees. The LNEX native token will fuel this platform and give holders governance voting rights. Plus, Lunex Network will take some of its revenue to buy back LNEX tokens off the open market and redistribute them to LNEX stakers. Currently, one LNEX costs just $0.0052, a 333% rise from its starting price. But, a rise to $0.0216 is expected after a Tier-1 CEX lists this DeFi coin soon. Trader Tardigrade: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) Will Soar to the Moon Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the meme coin titans but it has seen some red price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that its value has dropped from around $0.40 to nearly $0.30 in the past month alone. This is over a 20% fall for the Dogecoin price in the past few weeks. But crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade remains bullish on Dogecoin (DOGE). According to his X post , this meme coin is now repeating its past patterns and could soon soar. In his Dogecoin price prediction, Trader Tardigrade put a bold $9 price target for this token in 2025. TradingView data also points to the Dogecoin crypto seeing a price surge soon. Currently, this meme coin is valued above its 100-day EMA ($0.28) and its 200-day EMA ($0.22). Plus, its momentum indicator sits at 0.0079, which is in the buy zone and suggests more upswings soon. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Goes Red, Analyst Remains Bullish Shiba Inu (SHIB) is another meme coin that is facing some turbulence. On the one-month chart, the Shiba Inu price has fallen over 30% as per CoinMarketCap . During that time, its value moved between $0.000032 and nearly $0.000020. Nevertheless, some traders are still excited about Shiba Inu (SHIB) as market analyst Shib Spain remains bullish. In a recent X post , he said that if this meme coin hits $0.0001, it may also reach $0.001 next. This Shiba Inu price prediction is also backed by its technical analysis. TradingView points to this token being valued above its 200-day EMA ($0.000020) while having a momentum indicator of −0.00000006, which is in the buy zone. Thus, a bright future could be ahead for SHIB. Lunex Network (LNEX) vs. Dogecoin (DOGE) vs. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Which Crypto Coin May Reach $1 First? Lunex Network (LNEX), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are all altcoins to watch right now. They all could see big price gains in 2025. However, LNEX stands out as it will have a smaller market cap than its peers. Therefore, this DeFi crypto will need less money for its price to skyrocket. This fact could make LNEX hit $1 first as it needs less money for its price to surge. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Lunex Network (LNEX) Presale Today!

The price of $TICS tokens is currently set at $0.0414, but with the upcoming price increase in the 16th stage, it’s clear that the demand for Qubetics is only going to continue climbing. Multi-Chain Wallet: Unlocking Digital Asset Potential The Qubetics Multi-Chain Wallet is another compelling reason why this project is gaining traction. The wallet allows individuals and businesses to store and manage digital assets across multiple blockchains seamlessly. Imagine a small business owner in the UAE or Saudi Arabia being able to manage their crypto assets—like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Qubetics’ own $TICS—all in one place. The wallet is designed to streamline crypto transactions, making it easier for professionals and businesses in the Middle East to embrace digital currencies without the complexities typically associated with them. Why did this coin make it to this list? With its revolutionary approach to tokenising real-world assets and the ongoing success of its presale, Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to invest in this month. 2. Hedera (HBAR): The Blockchain That Is Reshaping the Industry Hedera (HBAR) is another strong contender for the best cryptos to invest in this month. As one of the most innovative blockchain projects, Hedera aims to offer faster, more secure, and scalable solutions than most existing blockchains. What sets Hedera apart is its unique consensus algorithm, which combines aspects of proof-of-stake and byzantine fault tolerance, offering faster transaction times and lower fees than traditional blockchain systems. The Hedera network can process thousands of transactions per second, making it a solid contender for enterprises looking to scale their blockchain use. In recent months, Hedera has seen a significant uptick in adoption. Major organisations like Google, IBM, and Boeing have integrated Hedera’s blockchain into their systems. This institutional backing adds a layer of credibility, especially as the project scales its ecosystem. At the time of writing, Hedera’s price is steadily climbing, with strong upward momentum expected to continue. 3. Litecoin (LTC): A Time-Tested Crypto with Growth Potential Litecoin (LTC) has long been considered one of the most reliable altcoins in the market, and it remains a solid investment choice. Although it’s often overshadowed by Bitcoin, Litecoin has its own unique features that make it a strong contender for the best cryptos to invest in this month. Launched in 2011, Litecoin was designed as a “lighter” version of Bitcoin with faster transaction times and lower fees. Its blockchain operates similarly to Bitcoin, but with a reduced block generation time of 2.5 minutes (compared to Bitcoin’s 10 minutes). As such, Litecoin is often seen as a testbed for new technologies before they are implemented in Bitcoin. Litecoin’s performance has been impressive over the years, and recent price fluctuations suggest that it’s poised for another breakout. Given its limited supply of 84 million coins, Litecoin’s scarcity combined with its efficient technology makes it a crypto asset with long-term potential. The recent integration of Litecoin’s MimbleWimble update, aimed at enhancing privacy, is an exciting development for investors. 4. Filecoin (FIL): A Blockchain Solution for Data Storage Filecoin (FIL) is a decentralised storage network that allows users to rent out their unused storage space in exchange for FIL tokens. As the world continues to generate massive amounts of data, decentralised storage solutions like Filecoin have become increasingly valuable. Filecoin’s blockchain provides an incentive structure for data storage. By leveraging unused storage space from users around the world, Filecoin aims to build a more resilient and efficient system for storing data. This model is appealing to businesses and individuals who are looking for secure, cost-effective ways to store large volumes of data. In recent months, Filecoin has expanded its ecosystem with major partnerships and integrations, such as with prominent tech companies and cloud services. This has significantly increased demand for FIL tokens, and the price has seen substantial growth. With the growing demand for decentralised storage solutions, Filecoin’s long-term outlook is very promising. 5. Cosmos (ATOM): The Blockchain of Blockchains Cosmos (ATOM) is a project that aims to solve one of the most pressing issues in the blockchain space: interoperability. Cosmos facilitates communication and transactions between different blockchains, creating a network of interconnected chains that can exchange data seamlessly. Cosmos’ focus on interoperability allows developers to create their own blockchains while still being able to communicate with other blockchains in the Cosmos network. This unique feature has made Cosmos a favourite among blockchain developers, as it eliminates the silos that exist in the current blockchain ecosystem. Cosmos continues to innovate with its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which facilitates the transfer of assets and data between different blockchains. The project has been steadily gaining traction, and the recent launch of the Cosmos Hub 3.0 upgrade has made it more scalable and secure than ever before. Cosmos’ price is currently in a healthy upward trajectory, with the project positioned for strong growth in the coming months. 6. Polygon (MATIC): A Layer 2 Solution for Ethereum Polygon (MATIC) is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve the speed and reduce the cost of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. With Ethereum’s scalability issues, Polygon’s role in the ecosystem has become increasingly important. Polygon’s solution improves the Ethereum network by providing sidechains that operate alongside Ethereum. This helps alleviate congestion on the main Ethereum network, ensuring faster transactions at a lower cost. Polygon has quickly become the go-to solution for decentralised applications (dApps) that need to operate at scale. Conclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency Investment Based on our research and analysis, it’s clear that the best cryptos to invest in this month are a mix of established giants and innovative newcomers. Qubetics is leading the charge with its tokenisation solutions, while projects like Hedera, Litecoin, and Cosmos continue to evolve and improve. As always, cryptocurrency investments come with risks, but these six cryptos show great promise for future growth.

Brazil is home to a dynamic community that is readily embracing the future of finance. We thank local regulators for their commitment to defining clear rules for this important, growing industry,” said Binance CEO Richard Teng. Binance indicated that similar steps had been taken in Argentina, India, Kazakhstan, and other countries to expand crypto adoption around the globe. Rise of Crypto Adoption in Brazil Brazil is currently listed 10th on the Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index , reflecting widespread interest in digital assets across the nation. The Central Bank of Brazil and the Brazilian IRS introduced a regulatory framework that seeks public input from various market participants, underlining the nation’s open approach to cryptocurrency oversight. The Brazilian Congress is deliberating federal bills on asset segregation and stablecoins, shaping a supportive environment for crypto-related initiatives. In November, Brazilian Congressman Eros Biondini introduced a bill proposing the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve.

Supporters argue this move could bolster Brazil’s economic resilience, helping the nation handle currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks. More Brazilians Investing in Crypto A recent survey conducted by the country’s top regulator revealed that more Brazilians invest, trade, or hold Bitcoin and altcoins than ever before. Findings show many participants dedicating between 7% and 35% of their funds to tokens.

This modest bump capped a 3% gain since the start of 2025, as the crypto markets began shaking off the losses that weighed them down at the end of last year. Investors appear to be waking up with new optimism, ready to see where this unpredictable market takes them. XRP led the rally with a 10% gain. Meanwhile, Coinbase and MicroStrategy, two major crypto-linked stocks, saw their shares jump 4% each. Optimism around regulation and IPOs fuels momentum This year could be a game-changer for crypto, largely thanks to hopes for a crypto-friendly environment under President Donald Trump. Investors are excited about Congress potentially passing the first-ever legislation focused on digital assets. Analysts believe this could target stablecoins or market structures, finally offering clarity to an industry used to operating in regulatory grey zones. The hype doesn’t stop there. Many are watching for new crypto-focused IPOs, which could breathe life into the public equity market. There’s even talk of a national Bitcoin reserve being explored—an idea that, if executed, could send the market into overdrive. But let’s not forget where we came from. Bitcoin ended 2024 bruised but not beaten. It closed the year up more than 120%, despite losing steam after smashing past $100,000 in a post-election rally. Long-term holders cashed out some of their profits, and others hit the sell button as uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s interest rate plans for 2025 loomed large. Among the chaos, one unlikely star emerged: “Fartcoin.” The meme token skyrocketed 45%, reaching a market value of $1.38 billion. Say what you will about the absurdity of its name, but the numbers speak for themselves. Then Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty, posted a cryptic Rick James clip on X (formerly Twitter), leaving his followers to play detective. Some speculated it was a nod to Unity Software, whose stock soared 11%. Bitcoin ETFs drive institutional interest US-based Bitcoin ETFs are having a moment. These funds are just $2.2 billion away from hitting $110 billion in cumulative holdings, representing 5.7% of Bitcoin’s total supply. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, leads the pack with its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which holds 542,000 BTC valued at $51.5 billion. This fund alone accounts for 47.9% of the US Bitcoin ETF market, making it a juggernaut in the space. Bitcoin ETFs were responsible for 75% of the new money flowing into Bitcoin during its climb past $50,000 in early 2024. Now, as Bitcoin flirts with critical resistance levels at $97,600 and $99,000, traders are keeping a close eye on the data. A breakout above $99,000 could liquidate over $1 billion in leveraged short positions.

The DexBoss presale has already raised over $70 million, signaling strong confidence from the crypto community. DexBoss has established itself as one of the most promising short-term tokens, and its groundbreaking blockchain infrastructure ensures it remains a dominant force in the market. As the DeFi space continues to expand, DexBoss is positioned to capitalize on this surge, offering both scalability and meme appeal. While Cardano remains a staple in many portfolios, the explosive potential of DexBoss makes it the coin to watch in the near future. Top 3 Next Crypto to Explode: DexB o ss (DEBO) Aureal One (DLUME) MetaYield Protocol (MYP) Although Cardano continues to show steady performance, the real buzz in the crypto community is surrounding DexBoss. The project’s impressive presale success and growing community are solid signs of a promising future. DexBoss is quickly gaining recognition as the next big memecoin, fueled by its unique blend of meme culture and real utility within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As DexBoss continues to rise, its integration into DeFi applications positions it to outperform many other cryptos in the market, including Cardano. With the memecoin investment surge accelerating, DexBoss is rapidly becoming a top pick for short-term and long-term growth. If you’re looking for the next crypto to explode, DexBoss should be at the top of your watchlist. Let’s have a closer understanding of these top 3 next coins to explode. DexBoss (DEBO): The Top Crypto to Explode in 2025 The rise of DexBoss (DEBO) in 2025 is becoming a hot topic in the crypto community. With over $70 million raised in its presale, DexBoss is on track to become one of the most exciting projects in the memecoin investment surge.

The rewards that the project offers are ideal for an extended period, making it among the best short-term tokens for investors around. With DexBoss continuing the trend, the platform is already being referred to as the next crypto to explode in the face of a market that has quickly demonstrated significant interest in the memecoin investment space. Investors believe that the value of DEBO can rise by at least 300% within the next two months after the launch of their product, failure of which will be disastrous. Aureal One (DLUME): Metaverse Explosive Potential Aureal One (DLUME) is steadily becoming one of the next big metaverse coins in the crypto ecosystem. Since its presale began, Aureal One has raised an impressive $50 million, highlighting the confidence investors have in the project’s potential. With the metaverse becoming one of the most sought-after sectors in crypto, Aureal One’s integration of virtual reality, blockchain technology, and NFTs positions it for explosive growth in 2025. It only takes three weeks of its launch to reach 80% of the investor base and reveal the next promising crypto in the metaverse. The main reason why DLUME tokens will be in high demand is that many leading VR firms are already partners with DLUME, while the ecosystem is rapidly growing. Some experts are already estimating that by early 2025 Aureal One could have its market cap grow 400 times, which puts it into the list of the top short term tokens to buy for the fast riches crypto investments. Given Aureal One direct positioning in the metaverse explosive tokens sector, the project can be considered to be the next metaverse coin with the possibility to overtake both Decentraland and The Sandbox. MetaYield Protocol (MYP): The Hidden DeFi Gem MetaYield Protocol (MYP) has turned into one of the most significant and unnoticed DeFi space projects of 2025. MetaYield, a yield farming and real staking solution provider, has been spectacular throughout the presale, garnering $45 million within a short time frame after its launch and capturing the attention of both DeFi aficionados and institutional investors. Its staking pools have since produced well over $5M in those early users, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg in terms as a yield-generating asset. According to industry analysts, MetaYield Protocol could easily see its token value increase by 500% by mid-2025. The project’s integration of AI-driven yield optimization strategies has positioned it to offer some of the best short-term returns in the DeFi space. Furthermore, its ecosystem is designed to support scalable solutions for NFT-backed yields, attracting attention from the NFT market as well. Given the strong demand for yield-generating tokens, MetaYield Protocol is expected to become one of the best crypto to buy now, especially for investors looking to capitalize on the next crypto to explode in DeFi. Conclusion: DexBoss is the Next Crypto to Explode As the crypto market heats up for 2025, DexBoss (DEBO) continues to capture attention, not just as a memecoin investment surge but as a serious contender for the next crypto to explode. While projects like Aureal One (DLUME) and MetaYield Protocol (MYP) are seeing strong growth in their respective spaces, DexBoss is leading the way with its innovative tokenomics, DeFi integration, and NFT compatibility. With a staggering $70 million already raised in its presale and a rapidly expanding investor base, DexBoss is poised to provide quick wealth crypto investments for early adopters. Though Aureal One promises explosive growth in the metaverse sector and MetaYield Protocol shines in DeFi yield farming, it’s DexBoss that stands out for its potential to disrupt the memecoin market while offering solid utility in the decentralized finance space. With DEBO’s scalability and proven demand, it’s clear why DexBoss is being hailed as the best crypto to buy now, with projections showing 300% growth within just two months post-launch. For investors looking to make quick profits in the next 2–4 weeks, DexBoss remains the most promising option, especially when compared to Aureal One and MetaYield Protocol.

XRP was supposed to facilitate cross-border payments, but the XRP news seems to be an eternal waiting game. While tokens like Solana are geared towards being transactional coins, a bilateral agreement still needs to be reached, and the Solana price is far too low to reflect this capacity to be used as tender. But there’s a new player in town, and Remittix is clearing the path to do what Solana could have done and XRP should have done. Remittix (RTX): near-instant cross-border crypto payments XRP was supposed to facilitate cross-border payments, but thanks to the SEC hobbling XRP and the banking system’s lethargy, XRP has not come to the party. Remittix is changing all this. Remittix is not waiting for banks to adopt the technology, Remittix is putting the power where it belongs: in the hands of its users. Remittix allows cross-border payments in any of over 30 fiat currencies. And, it’s a unilateral system. The receiver does not even know it’s a crypto transaction: they get their money in their fiat currency of choice without any mess or fuss, while the sender does not have to deal with the delays, cost, and paperwork of international payments. This is what XRP should have been; instead, Remittix is XRP 2.0, forging a path that XRP failed to tread. And now with the ongoing Remittix presale, everyone has an opportunity to acquire this token that will set the world alight. XRP News: XRP fails to fulfill promise XRP is a shadow of what it could have been, and it’s easy to point fingers at the SEC’s overzealous court action for XRP’s lackluster performance. But the main culprit in XRP’s lack of delivery is XRP itself. XRP sold itself on the promises of what it was going to do: to facilitate cross-border payments. So far, it has failed to deliver. The XRP news for November may have been good, but it seems it was more hype than substance and has already lost a quarter of the November gains. Now, with Remittix doing its job, XRP news is even worse. It has just been made obsolete. Solana (SOL): Low Solana price evidence of underused token Solana has everything going for it. It was designed to be a transactional token and is cheap to operate, lightning fast, and secure as Fort Knox. Solana was designed with the theoretical capacity to be used to buy anything from a supersized meal at McDonalds to a super yacht at the Monaco marina. But the Solana price remains low because crypto has not yet seen mainstream adoption. 2025 looks like it could be an excellent year for crypto, and with wider adoption and transactional exchanges becoming more commonplace, the Solana price may rise. Conclusion The XRP news is not good as it is losing the shine it gained during November’s pump, and the Solana price is battling to keep itself above $190. From an investing perspective, this does not make encouraging reading. Fortunately, tokens like Remittix are delivering where others fail, and the Remittix presale is the best investing opportunity to come along in years. Remittix is now available at $0.0167 directly from their website and is due to hit major exchanges in early 2025 priced at $0.135 or over!

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 17:22:00

What Are Traders Waiting For? Analyst Explained,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-bitcoins-rally-isnt-sparking-what-are-traders-waiting-for-analyst-explained/,"Bitcoin remains stable above $97,000 as investors remain cautiously optimistic ahead of major market events, including Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Analysts suggest this measured stance reflects a cautious approach to the new year's trading opportunities. According to Coinglass data from the latest 8-hour contract cycle across major exchanges, the Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rate is at 0.01%. This remains in a neutral range, marking the highest rate in more than a week and indicating moderate market sentiment. “Currently, there is no significant increase in the Bitcoin perpetual-term funding rate, which remains in the neutral range,” said Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet. “This stability shows that investors are optimistic but are waiting for the upcoming important events to become clear before moving into long positions.” Related News: Analysis Company Messari Reveals 6 Events It Expects in the Cryptocurrency Market in 2025 That Could Transform the Market In addition to Bitcoin’s stability, AI-integrated tokens are emerging as a focal point for investors. These tokens leverage blockchain technology to optimize portfolio management and decentralized finance (DeFi). Alvin Kan highlighted this trend, saying: “AI tokens are becoming a major trend as AI integrates with the blockchain. AI agents are expected to play significant roles in portfolio management and blockchain governance by 2025.” WeFi co-founder Maksym Sakharov echoed this sentiment, stating that the rise of AI tokens is a transformative shift in the crypto ecosystem, similar to the earlier rises of NFTs and DeFi. “AI tokens represent the fastest-growing segment of the industry, reshaping the ecosystem with innovative use cases,” he said. Sakharov also made bullish predictions for Ethereum, with Steno Research predicting that the ETH/BTC ratio could rise from 0.035 to 0.06. Galaxy Research predicts that Ethereum’s price could reach $6,000 by 2025, while analysts from Bitwise expect it to regain its all-time high next year. *This is not investment advice.

Solana, one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, joined the rally, surging over 10% in just 24 hours. This upward momentum is sparking renewed optimism among investors, with hopes that the market may be shifting toward a more bullish trend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Testing A Significant Support Zone – Bullish Breakout Ahead? Top analyst Jelle has weighed in on Solana’s recent price action, sharing a detailed technical analysis on X. According to Jelle, Solana’s next key hurdle is the $210 level. If SOL manages to reclaim this zone as support, the path to new all-time highs could quickly follow. This level represents a significant resistance point, making it a pivotal area to watch in the coming days. The market’s recent turnaround has brought fresh attention to Solana, as its technical setup positions it as a leader in this recovery phase. Investors closely monitor price action, eager to see if it can maintain the current momentum. As the broader market awakens, Solana’s next move could set the tone for its performance in the weeks ahead. Solana Showing Strength Solana has demonstrated notable resilience amid recent market turbulence, holding firm above the critical $180 level. This price point, which once posed significant resistance, has now flipped into robust support, underscoring Solana’s relative strength. As the broader crypto market begins to show signs of renewed optimism, Solana appears well-positioned for a significant upward move. Top analyst Jelle recently provided an encouraging technical analysis on X, highlighting Solana’s bounce from key levels. According to Jelle, SOL successfully retested both its trendline and horizontal support before rebounding sharply. This technical setup suggests that the asset is gearing up for a larger breakout. The next critical target lies at $210—a key resistance zone. Should Solana reclaim this level and consolidate above it, the door to new all-time highs would likely open. This bullish outlook is echoed by several analysts and investors who are closely watching Solana’s price action. Many believe that once SOL clears $210, its path to surpassing its previous highs will be swift and decisive. Related Reading: Ethereum Stays Within Symmetrical Pattern – Analyst Sets ETH Target Solana’s strong fundamentals, combined with its recent price performance, have made it a standout in the current market recovery. If momentum continues to build, Solana could become a leader in the next bullish phase, breaking its all-time high in record time. Technical Analysis: Key Levels Solana (SOL) is trading at $207, showcasing remarkable strength following a clean bounce from the 200-day EMA at $175 on December 23. This bounce was pivotal, as holding the 200-day EMA confirmed a bullish price structure, ensuring that buyers regained control after weeks of market uncertainty. The successful defense of this critical level has positioned Solana as one of the most promising assets for an imminent breakout. Now trading above $200, Solana is on the cusp of testing its all-time high (ATH). If bulls can maintain momentum and reclaim the $230 mark, the subsequent move is expected to be aggressive. Analysts and traders are closely monitoring this level as it could act as the final resistance before SOL ventures into uncharted price territory. The bullish momentum is further bolstered by Solana’s strong fundamentals and its ability to hold key support zones amid broader market volatility. A breakout above $230 would likely attract fresh capital, fueling a rally that could redefine its long-term trajectory. Related Reading: Cardano Holds Crucial Support At $0.77 – Massive Rally Ahead?

The meme cryptocurrency maintains strong momentum, trading above key levels. The broader crypto market remains bullish, with Bitcoin hovering around $97,000. Market analysts speculate if bulls can sustain DOGE’s upward trend this week, building on its remarkable resilience. Dogecoin Price Soars 10% Amid Crypto Market Recovery As of the reporting time, the DOGE price hovers at $0.3394, reflecting a notable 10% increase over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s price movement indicates a steady upward trajectory, with the day’s low recorded at $0.3169 and a high of $0.3442. Dogecoin, currently ranked 7 among cryptocurrencies, has shown resilience despite being 54.01% below its all-time high of $0.7376, achieved on May 8, 2021. Bitcoin (BTC) surged past the $97,000 mark today, marking significant bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market . The rise comes as major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and SHIB, also recorded gains over the past 24 hours. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by approximately 4%, reaching a staggering $3.42 trillion. This growth reflects increased investor confidence and renewed interest in digital assets amid favorable market conditions. DOGE Technical Analysis Crypto trader and chart analyst has highlighted a bullish trend for Dogecoin price, showcasing a “Broadening Wedge” pattern. According to the trader’s analysis, the meme coin has successfully completed a retest of the key wedge boundary, signaling potential for an upward breakout. This technical formation, commonly associated with price acceleration, aligns with Dogecoin’s anticipated surge to higher levels. Source: X The breakout and subsequent retest serve as pivotal indicators for Dogecoin’s price trajectory. The trader’s chart illustrates the breakout above resistance, followed by a consolidation phase, suggesting strengthened bullish momentum. Dogecoin Price Targets If the bullish momentum makes a comeback, the Dogecoin price forecast could climb past $0.35, with $0.50 and $0.73 as potential targets. The $0.73 level represents its all-time high. Breaking through these levels may set DOGE on a path toward $1. However, if bears regain control, the price may drop below $0.30, signaling a deeper correction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart is at 63, indicating a bullish outlook but nearing overbought conditions. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView The Dogecoin price recent surge highlights growing market optimism, with potential for further gains if bullish momentum persists. However, traders should monitor resistance levels and market conditions to gauge sustained price growth.

This potential expansion could position the brokerage as one of the largest traditional financial institutions to enter the digital asset trading market. Will Morgan Stanley Start Crypto Trading via E-Trade Division? As of now, Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade offers investment in conventional financial securities, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs. However, introducing cryptocurrency trading services is a clear indication that Morgan Stanley is keen on expanding its product line and meeting market demands. The potential move is being examined as the United States anticipates a friendlier regulatory environment under the Trump administration . The industry has received an encouragement from the President-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump’s campaign where he vowed to appoint strict pro-crypto officials and even start a bitcoin reserve in the United States. The acquisition of E-Trade by Morgan Stanley in 2020 at a deal worth $13 billion was to enhance the wealth management business through the use of E-Trade’s many customers. If cryptocurrency trading is integrated, it will create a possibility for millions of customers to engage with the digital asset market directly. Institutional Momentum in the Crypto Sector Morgan Stanley’s E-trade action reflects the ongoing trend of institutions developing an interest in cryptocurrencies. Last year, Morgan Stanley started offering its high-net-worth clients access to spot Bitcoin ETFs, which underpin the increasing interest of traditional investors in digital assets. Other legacy institutions such as Goldman Sachs have also indicated their interest in the crypto market but only if there is a clear policy direction. At the same time, Grayscale and Bitwise have submitted applications for the approval of investing in ETFs that are tied to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. If E-Trade were to join the direct crypto trading segment, it would rival Coinbase and other companies that currently hold a significant share of the retail trading market. Global Banking Sector Pushes Further into Crypto The U.S. is not alone in its embrace of crypto. European financial institutions are also moving into the sector following the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which took full effect on December 30, 2024. Like Morgan Stanley, Spanish banking giant BBVA, through its Turkey-based subsidiary Garanti BBVA Kripto, is preparing to roll out crypto trading services to the public after completing a pilot program. Likewise, Deutsche Bank has also been working on creating blockchain solutions for custody and tokenization with the help of Swiss startup Taurus. These developments point to a general trend of increased adoption of cryptocurrencies by banks as the regulatory landscape becomes more favorable. “We are in discussions with over 50 institutions that are prepared to launch crypto trading in 2025,” said Abel Peña, the Chief Sales Officer at Bit2Me, a BBVA-associated crypto exchange.

Gensler has been tough on crypto, and Atkins, on the other hand, believes in letting the free market thrive and views crypto as revolutionary technology. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton reacted sarcastically to the news of Gensler stepping down from the SEC, saying “too long.” Deaton has been a vocal critic of Gensler’s approach to crypto, particularly in regard to XRP. His comment reflects the frustration many in the crypto community have felt under Gensler’s leadership, especially regarding his stance on cryptocurrency regulations. Can Atkins Change The Game? With Atkins at the helm, the SEC will likely take a less aggressive approach toward crypto, encouraging a more favorable environment for the industry. This change has already sparked a rally in crypto prices, with investors hopeful for more institutional involvement. Politically, some believe Atkins’ appointment shows how the crypto industry can influence regulators. While Gensler supported stricter ESG regulations, Atkins is skeptical about government involvement in such matters, which could mean less pressure on companies to meet ESG standards in the future. The long-term impact of these changes remains to be seen. Will XRP Price React? XRP surged to $1.50 following the news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation, marking a 20% jump to its highest price in the past three years. The momentum continued, pushing XRP even higher to over $2.70 in the next few weeks. As of now, XRP is trading at $2.42.

The settlement, filed Tuesday in federal court in Oakland, California, will require approval by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. According to a Reuters report , the lawsuit said Apple’s AI assistant, Siri, allegedly recorded private conversations without consent. These recordings, which were allegedly shared with third parties like advertisers, were accidentally triggered by phrases sounding like “Hey, Siri.” Plaintiffs said this resulted in targeted ads for topics they had talked about privately. One plaintiff mentioned Air Jordan sneakers and Olive Garden and noticed ads related to the brand. Another plaintiff mentioned a specific surgical treatment he’d discussed with his doctor before receiving ads for that treatment. The alleged violations occurred from September 17, 2014, to December 31, 2024, beginning when Apple first introduced the ‘Hey, Siri’ feature, leading to unauthorized recordings. $95M equals about nine hours of profit for Apple If approved, the settlement would be distributed among tens of millions of eligible Siri users. Those affected could be paid up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, such as iPhones or Apple Watches. However, Apple denied any wrongdoing and agreed to the settlement. Furthermore, Apple and the company’s lawyers also declined to comment on the settlement. The settlement fund may allow the plaintiffs’ attorneys to receive $28.5 million in legal fees and $1.1 million in expenses. The payout amounts to about nine hours of profit for Apple, which reported a net income of $93.74 billion in the last fiscal year.

PEPE had been struggling for much of the past week, yet a New Year’s Day bounce has seen it make up for lost time, with the meme token now up by 18% in seven days. However, it remains up by only 1% in a month, raising questions as to whether it can return to the all-time high it reached in early December, in the midst of the post-election bull rally. But with Elon Musk recently giving it a boost via his brief use of Pepe for his X profile image, the coin looks well positioned to rally strongly this year . PEPE’s Rally Stalls as Musk Effect Fades – Is This the Start of a Bigger Decline? PEPE had been in trouble in the days leading up to the New Year, with Christmas Day failing to give the token any festive cheer. It has since recovered in the wake of Elon Musk changing his X profile picture to an image of Pepe.

PEPE’s 24-hour trading volume reflects this new momentum, having risen from $2 billion to $2.3 billion in a matter of hours this morning. Its chart is showing encouraging signs at the moment, with its relative strength index (purple) rising back up to 70, a sign of buying pressure. Source: TradingView We also see that, after climbing above the 200-period average (blue) on New Year’s Eve, the 30-period average (orange) is continuing to rise. Together, this suggests that PEPE has reentered a growth phase, much like the rest of the market. Aside from the recent overselling, there are fundamental reasons for this, with the most obvious being that the US is nearing Donald Trump’s inauguration. While some have warned that this could be a sell-the-news event , it will mark the opening of a period of positivity for crypto.

Gayed, CFA (@leadlagreport) December 27, 2024 Not only is the SEC likely to change its stance on crypto with the arrival of Paul Atkins as its Chairman, but Congress is likely to push through with pro-crypto legislation, while Trump himself may issue bullish executive orders within his first few days of office. In such a context, PEPE is as likely to rally as any other meme coin, with its ownership numbers continuing to rise steadily . It could reach $0.0000250 in the next few weeks, and $0.000035 by Q2. New Pepe Coins Offer Market-Beating Gains Assuming that PEPE is at risk of losing steam, many traders should look to newer alternatives for their above-average returns, with several presale coins looking very good right now. Chief among them is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , an ERC-20 token that has already raised a whopping $39.4 million in its presale. Presale’s flowing. Candles are growing. $WEPE ain’t slowing. pic.twitter.com/vqHonzkn1v — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 30, 2024 Wall Street Pepe is shaping up to be successful because it will be more than just another meme coin, with the project also launching a trading intelligence platform. Its platform will provide WEPE holders with exclusive buying signals, real-time analytics and insider trading strategies. It will also come with its own community, who can not only share tips and analysis, but will also have the chance to compete in trading competitions. Winners of such competitions will earn rewards in WEPE, while the token will also be open to staking, earning holders additional income. This all makes Wall Street Pepe look highly promising, with investors able to join its sale by going to its official website . WEPE is currently selling at a price of $0.0003663, although this will increase later today. Traders should therefore act quickly, since the early signs suggest that Wall Street Pepe could surge once it lists.

Kekius Maximus, a meme coin on Ethereum ( ETH ), crashed from its $380 million market cap on Jan. 2 after Musk removed the character from his X account’s name and avatar. The Ethereum-based Kekius Maximus token launched on Dec. 14 as a playful mix of crypto jargon and pop culture. “Kek” is crypto slang for something funny or ridiculous, while “Maximus” references Maximus Decimus Meridius, the main character in Ridley Scott’s Gladiator (2000). Musk briefly adopted the Kekius Maximus name for his X page, referencing it in a video game-related tweet and again on New Year’s Eve. The attention drove the Ethereum-based Kekius Maximus token to soar over 30-fold, from $0.01 to $0.39. Kekius Maximus tumbled to $0.07 and a $77 million market cap shortly after traders noticed Musk’s social media changes, according to DEX Screener. Copycat tokens on Solana ( SOL ) also collapsed as the hype faded. Musk explained the name swap was made to focus on pressing U.S. issues after a rented Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.

These industries need powerful computers, and Northern Data is ready to meet this growing demand. This shift in technology focus has not gone unnoticed by investors. Canaccord Genuity, a financial services company, has an optimistic buy rating and a price target of 60 euros ($62) per share. The stock is trading at 45.65 euros, which is already a 2.4% increase. Building the Foundation for AI’s Future Northern Data is seen as an important part of the growing AI industry, often compared to being the “railroad for the AI gold rush.” This means the company provides the essential tools for AI and HPC. Canaccord analysts consider Northern Data’s new Taiga Cloud service an important move. They believe it puts the company in a great position to lead a major technology shift. Northern Data Makes Strategic Moves to Unlock Growth Potential Northern Data is making smart moves to grow its business sustainably. The company, which is 52% owned by stablecoin issuer Tether, is considering selling its Bitcoin mining unit, Peak Mining. If this sale happens, it would bring in cash and allow Northern Data to focus on buying more advanced GPUs and building new data centers. Analysts believe this smart reinvestment strategy could boost the company’s growth for years to come, well beyond 2025. Canaccord analysts think these investments will strengthen Northern Data’s position in the rapidly growing AI industry. They also see it as a key step toward leading the high-performance computing market. Northern Data’s Upside Potential Despite Recent Rally Northern Data’s stock has surged 74% in just three months. Canaccord believes that the company’s shares still have room for growth. Investor interest in Northern Data is growing. The company is in a strong AI and HPC infrastructure market position. This means it could keep benefiting from the rising demand for high-performance computing resources. In summary, Northern Data’s smart plans and position at the forefront of AI and HPC make it a company to watch. Its chance to take advantage of the growing technology changes offers investors a great opportunity in a fast-moving market.

Half of all crypto advertisements are still up in the UK, and the FCA has yet to penalize any of the companies, the Financial Times reports . Citing data from a freedom of information request, FT says that only 54% of the 1,702 alerts issued by the FCA ended in the illegal advertisements, apps and websites being taken down. Charles Randell, former chair of the regulator, told FT that the FCA would need to start penalizing companies that were ignoring the ban in order to end the “very frustrating” level of non-compliance. “Ultimately, unless a very real and present threat of legal action is visible to both the [tech] platforms and to authorized crypto asset exchanges which issue non-compliant ads, we’re unlikely to see any change.” Randell says part of the difficulty for regulators is the inability to demand that tech and social media platforms ban unapproved content, instead relying on good-faith negotiations. “When the platforms are sufficiently motivated to block these ads they can and will… The regulators — including both the FCA, Ofcom and if necessary the criminal prosecution authorities — may need to ensure that the platforms have that motivation.” The FCA says that it’s now making “good progress” with tech companies in regulating the banned advertisements, but is still “concerned about the prevalence of frauds and scams online”. “Many social media sites have now banned paid-for adverts for UK financial services from non-FCA authorized firms, and we continue to [take] action against those we find breaching our rules.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The firm’s online stock trading company is considering the idea, as per a report from The Information. The decision to explore cryptocurrency services is linked to the expected return of US President-elect Donald Trump. Notably, the crypto industry anticipates that the Trump administration will likely bring favorable regulation to the crypto sector. Institutions like Morgan Stanley are among those who are likely to benefit from these changes. This decision would see the Morgan Stanley company take on the likes of Coinbase and traditional cryptocurrency exchanges and would turn out to be a massive entry point for mainstream investors interested in trading these assets. Morgan Stanley has shown strong support for crypto, disclosing ownership of $272 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs by the end of Q3. While it made up only 2% of the firm’s $1.3 trillion assets, it was a significant bet. This investment paid off, as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was later hailed as the greatest ETF launch in history. 2024 was a landmark year for the cryptocurrency industry, which witnessed the successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January.

38439174,https://blockworks.co/news/ai-agents-are-not-agentic,1735840800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,AI agents are not agentic,https://blockworks.co/news/ai-agents-are-not-agentic,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . If I am to believe AI agents are the next big thing , here’s what I’d like it to minimally do: “Dear AI agent, take control of my wallet and generate a minimum 30% APY while maintaining a conservative risk profile to avoid excessive exposure.” 30% is not a lot in crypto terms, but it’s enough to beat the S&P 500. Because I specified “conservative,” that agent would presumably err on the side of caution and only interact with DeFi smart contracts that have been battle-tested for at least a year. For instance, the agent might look to Pendle to lock my capital in a PT yield trade involving only “blue-chip” protocols like Ethena (USDe) or Aave (GHO), while avoiding new risky collateral like USUAL ( currently 147% ). Since I specified “30% APY,” the agent would presumably avoid a low yield PT like stETH (currently 3.2% ). The agent may alternatively rationalize that given a bull market year, ETH would see a price point high of $5k, a 44% increase from today’s price. Rather than yield farming, the agent would simply invest my money into ETH and maybe stake it on Lido for a risk-free yield of 3%. Depending on market volatility and black swans that may crater the price of ETH, the agent should be quick enough to swap it back to a stablecoin in a timely fashion. Because I told the agent “conservative,” airdrop farming should strictly be out of the question given the long window of time between points farming and the projects’ actual airdrop (too much risk!). This isn’t an unreasonable benchmark — “Non-KYC AI agents on blockchain rails” are, after all, the rallying cry Crypto Twitter has coalesced around. As far as I can tell though, there isn’t a reliable way for AI agents to navigate DeFi yet (Frax Finance’s IQ AI project may be one). As Haseeb Qureshi from Dragonfly Capital put it on a recent Steady Lads podcast , AI agents right now are more akin to “Wizard of Oz”-style agents that lack long-term plans, and which aren’t making money transfers to accomplish goals. Instead, what we do find amid the AI-crypto hysteria are AI-branded memecoins, AI virtual chatbots and lots of infrastructural plays. We already have plenty of memecoins, and slapping “AI” on is just marketing. The virtual chatbots like Luna already exist in Web2, and introducing a token doesn’t make it particularly new. The infrastructural frenzy around launchpads and frameworks is probably necessary, but there’s still a ways to go before we see actual agentic and autonomous agents. The closest we have to “utility-based” agents right now are ones that scrape social media data to produce an alpha feed, such as aixbt. I realize this entire train of thought is probably missing the point, which is that the biggest narrative in what looks to be the most bullish year in crypto is going to see “number go up” regardless. What AI agents still seem to lack, however, is plausible credibility for why the unthinking investor can wholeheartedly buy into their narrative. NFTs in 2020, for instance, had that veneer of legitimacy. The story that propelled NFTs — immutable art pieces — into the mainstream was a stretch, but all the technological pieces were in place. For AI agents, the distance between meme and reality is still too wide. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

However, as long as Bitcoin continues to spread a bullish wave by meeting higher price levels, there are some top altcoins poised to follow this trend and delivering massive ROIs. Considering their strong innovation and network strength, these coins, Toncoin (TON), Binance (BNB), Avalanche (AVAX) and Tron (TRX) are slated to attract huge gains in 2025. As these cryptos dominate the DeFi market, another payment network called Remittix (RTX) is bound to join in on this bullish spree, considering its unique crypto-to-fiat feature. Toncoin Price Consolidates But Attracts Positive Sentiments As a top DeFi network strongly affiliated with Telegram, Toncoin (TON) stands as one of the most anticipated altcoin for significant gains in 2025. Although Toncoin price sits around 33% below its ATH of $8.25 seven months ago, the token nearly smashed this milestone when it rose to $6.89 on December 5th. Toncoin price has currently fallen to a weekly range of $5.48- $6.07, but it seems to be consolidating in lower levels, showing potential of a later surge when the bull market continues. Profit Demon , a crypto analyst on X has highlighted that Toncoin is forming a cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart, suggesting a rise towards a peak of $7.70 on a short term basis. At the moment, TradingView reflects a neutral signal for Toncoin’s MA (moving averages) and Oscillators, meaning the token may either fall or rise in the next couple of weeks. Binance Coin Stabilizes Above Its Weekly Resistance Price Despite declining by 11% below its ATH of $793, Binance (BNB) has refused to hit lower levels as the token keeps maintaining a bullish position. Although riddled with fluctuations, Binance coin, BNB, is maintained strongly above its weekly resistance of $691.50, showing signs of stabilizing at higher levels in 2025. The token just rose by over 5% in the past months mirror its growth in network volume and its 0.58% market cap increase. According to DeFi Edward , BNB is currently defying gravity while the rest of the market struggles. The expert says that if Binance coin is able to break above the $725 crucial mark, it could ignite a massive rally, taking its value to a peak price of $1,000 or more. However, Binance’s relentless growth and the development of its Smart Chain is poised to raise its potential to top the list of top cryptos to buy. Avalanche Price Dips Below Its $44 Resistance Level, Prepares For Resurgence After pricing below the $40 range for most of the year, Avalanche (AVAX) price resurged in November, climbing out of its yearly resistance to hit a peak of $55.70. However Avalanche has since declined considerably, falling below its monthly resistance of $44 as it now holds in a weekly price range of $35.00 and $41.38. However, Avalanche seems to be retesting lower levels while preparing to rally again and potentially near its ATH. One major factor that will potentially ignite a later rally in Avalanche price is the upcoming AVAX 9000 launch . According to WalesBanks , Avalanche token targets the $80 to $88 range as anticipation for this new update surges. Another famous crypto analyst, Grronk , indicated that Avalanche price will definitely hit $100 in the bullish DeFi market. Top Analyst Sees Possible $1.11 Valuation for Tron Coin Tron (TRX) coin has also gained massive attention in the last few weeks of 2024, having risen by over 24% in the past month. However, most importantly, its network volume has been surging dramatically showing increased accumulation as well as activity on the network as it just jumped by over 14%. At moment Tron coin holds in a weekly range of $0.2505 and $0.2635, but optimistic speculations are brewing for the token as it is only consolidating from an ATH of $0.4313 on December 4. Tron’s year-to-date gain also shows a 139% price progression. However, JAVON MARKS predictions shows that this is just the beginning for TRX coin. The crypto expert indicated that Tron token might be up for another 444% rise to hit $1.11 and beyond from where it is, potentially ranking it among top cryptos to buy in 2025. Remittix Prepares To Dominate The PayFi Sector With Extensive Features Remittix (RTX) is a new payment solution that aims to make everyday cross-border transactions cost-efficient and more accessible. The platform’s main agenda is fusing the speed, security and immutability of blockchain technology with the familiarity of fiat currencies, enabling crypto-to-fiat transactions. In other words, regardless of their banking status, anyone with an internet connection can now convert up to 40 cryptocurrencies in fiat and send them to traditional banks anywhere in the world.

Wainwright & Co. The equity research estimates that the market cap of Bitcoin mining companies will surpass $100 billion in 2025, up from $36 billion in 2024—a nearly 200% increase. This surge is attributed to improving mining economics and the ongoing Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull market, according to analysts. The report points to key factors driving optimism, including Bitcoin’s recent price appreciation and the continued success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. These ETFs, approved earlier in 2024, have brought in $35.3 billion in net inflows and currently hold over 1 million BTC, representing 5.5% of the circulating supply. Bitcoin mining involves the use of specialized computers to validate transactions and secure the network. Miners are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin, but the process incurs substantial energy and operational costs. According to the report, miners are currently profitable, with production costs significantly lower than Bitcoin’s market price of around $96,000.

The report forecasts Bitcoin to reach $225,000 by the end of 2025, fueled by increasing institutional adoption, regulatory clarity under the new U.S. administration, and enhanced scarcity following the recent halving. This price target implies a total market cap of $4.5 trillion for Bitcoin, or approximately 25% of gold’s market cap. Large-scale miners with substantial Bitcoin reserves, referred to as the “Big 3” — Marathon Digital, CleanSpark, and Riot Platforms — are expected to outperform their competitors. These companies, highly sensitive to Bitcoin price movements, also feature competitive valuations compared to AI-linked miners. The report suggests that mining stocks could outpace Bitcoin’s price gains in 2025, presenting opportunities for investors seeking exposure to the growing digital asset market.

Miners are well-positioned to benefit due to their large-scale, low-cost energy capabilities. Currently, miners operate 6.1 GW of data center capacity, with an additional 4.6 GW in development expected to be operational by 2025. Seven miners in the sector are slated to deploy a combined 5 GW of power for AI and high-performance computing workloads by 2026, significantly reducing the typical four-year timeline for greenfield projects.

It has since retreated slightly to $1.35, yet this still represents a massive 660% increase in the past month, with Fartcoin quickly becoming one of the best meme tokens to buy right now. Yet as strong as Fartcoin looks right now, its indicators are all suggesting that it has entered strongly overbought territory, with the coin down by 7% since reaching its new ATH earlier today. Investors may therefore wish to hold off before jumping into the token, which has the momentum to become a serious rival to Pepe, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. AI Meme Coin Fartcoin Breaks Records With New ATH – What’s Next? The product of a generative AI model called Truth Terminal, Fartcoin has been on a rampage since launching in the middle of October. Its indicators have been riding high more or less constantly since listing, and today its RSI (purple) has risen above 80. Source: TradingView This is normally a sign of overbuying, implying that the token needs to correct in the next few days. Its 30-period average (orange) supports this view, given that it has raced well ahead of the 200-period average (blue). Yet what’s interesting about FARTCOIN’s ascent to a new ATH today is that it has happened with a trading volume ($154 million) that is actually lower than it was on December 20 ($286 million), when it reached a then-record high of $1.27. One way of interpreting this is to suggest that Fartcoin has plenty of room left to rally, especially when its volume remains so low in comparison with more established tokens. Fartcoin, the first ever memecoin to be conceived by AI 2025 is going to be a movie billions will fart pic.twitter.com/Y2JkQD8wL1 — RookieXBT (@RookieXBT) December 31, 2024 In fact, Fartcoin still isn’t available for spot trading on the biggest exchanges in the world, with Coinbase, Kraken, Binance or Crypto.com (among others) yet to list the coin. This implies that, even if the token dips in the immediate future, listing announcements will send it flying even higher soon enough. And what’s particularly bullish about Fartcoin, aside from its exploding popularity, is that it has a total supply of only 1 billion. This is relatively small for a meme token, with Dogecoin haven’t a potentially infinite supply, for example. The Fartwheel Fartcoin pumps → Everyone calls it absurd → Fartcoin pumps more. Fartcoin dumps → Everyone calls it absurd → Fartcoin pumps again. A never-ending cycle of attention. It dominates mindshare, no matter the price. — (@degentral) December 30, 2024 As such, the next few weeks and months could see its price absolutely rocket, with the coin looking like it’s in price discovery mode. It could rise as high as $2 in the next few weeks, and $3 by Q2. Alternative Meme Tokens for Big Gains The risk with Fartcoin, of course, is that its status as a pure meme token could mean that it plummets after whales and other traders lose interest in it. Because of this risk, some traders may already prefer to look for the next big thing, with presales one way of identifying up-and-coming tokens before they break. And one promising presale coin at the moment is Meme Index (MEMEX) , which has already raised more than $1.4 million in its recently launched offering. As its name suggests, Meme Index offers investors the chance to invest in any of four decentralized meme token indexes. These indexes will track different kinds of meme coins with different risk profiles, with the Titan index tracking established tokens such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe. There are also MidCap, Moonshot and Frenzy indexes, each tracking increasingly volatile kinds of tokens. What’s game-changing about these indexes is that they provide investors with the chance to spread their risk across multiple coins, something which in the longer term may help them make bigger profits. Given that meme tokens have been one of the biggest stories of 2024, Meme Index could attract thousands of investors looking to get involved in the space without taking on too much risk. As its native token, MEMEX will be open to staking and it will also confer governance rights, with holders able to vote on new indexes. Investors can join Meme Index’s presale can do so by going to its official website and linking their crypto wallets. MEMEX is currently selling at $0.0148639, although this price will rise in two days. It will continue to rise for the duration of its sale, while its early promise and its fundamentals suggest that it could rally much higher once it lists on exchanges.

This appearance follows his extradition from Montenegro, where he had been detained since March 2023 for traveling on a fake passport. The charges are linked to the $40 billion collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna cryptocurrencies, which disrupted global cryptocurrency markets in 2022. Terraform Labs Founder Do Kwon Pleads Not Guilty Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, conspiracy, and a new count of money laundering conspiracy. The charges allege that Kwon misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD, a stablecoin designed to maintain a $1 value. Prosecutors claim Kwon falsely stated that an algorithm, the “Terra Protocol,” stabilized the coin in May 2021, while he secretly arranged for a trading firm to purchase large quantities of TerraUSD to artificially sustain its price. “Much of this growth followed Kwon’s brazen deceptions about Terraform and its technology,” stated the updated indictment. The prosecutor’s office alleges that these claims attracted both retail and institutional investors, pushing the value of Terraform products, including the Luna token, to $50 billion by early 2022. Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, 33, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger on Thursday. He denied all wrongdoing and maintained his stance that Terraform Labs had been truthful about its operations.

In the first days of the year, Solana users can already access SonicSVM, which will start trading on January 7. Solana is one of the chains closely watched for top airdrops in all of 2025. As early as January, several events are already close to token distribution or trading. Following the Magic Eden and PENGU airdrops, Solana is preparing for more high-profile projects. Solana is prepared for several Season 2 airdrops as well, including Sanctum, DeBridge, Drift, Grass, as well as Kamino Season 3. The new year hype helped Solana return to $208.48, after a recent dip to the $185 level. Solana ended the year with peak activity and fees generated, showing its ecosystem is ready for new startups and tokens. Solana airdrops often offer easier tasks, and may be the preferred mode of earnings, after a year of complicated and expensive Ethereum-based airdrops. In the past 12 months, Solana also posted peak activity in multiple sectors, potentially making more wallet users eligible for rewards as they interacted with DEXs and other protocols. In the first week of January, the Sonic SVM will release its SONIC tokens, already prepared to launch trading from January 7. Sonic is a Solana Virtual Machine project, targeting the builders of games and apps. The SONIC airdrop arrives within a short time span, after being announced on December 31. SONIC is now in the process of being prepared for trading, with OKX and KuCoin listings. The project will offer a new toolset to launch more AI agents on Solana. Recently, Sonic partnered with Injective for cross-chain composable AI agents. Injective is launching a brand new cross-chain AI Agent Hub with @SonicSVM in 2025. Seamlessly launch and access AI agents that are composable across @solana and Injective for the first time. pic.twitter.com/ISDUr57iRm — Injective 🥷 (@injective) January 2, 2025 Sonic plans to build the first rollup scalable chain on Solana, compatible with the Solana Virtual Machine. While this solution is more common on Ethereum, the recent rise in AI agent tokens has raised the bar for transaction speed and reliability. Solana, while scalable, may require extra steps to avoid failed transactions. As AI agents prepare for more on-chain actions, Sonic is trying to build the additional infrastructure before an even larger inflow of projects. SONIC tokens will launch with 15% of their supply, slowly expanding with unlocks over a six-year period. The project is still relatively new for the Solana ecosystem, but may gain exposure as the first scalable chain linked to Solana. In addition to Sonic, EclipseFND offers a similar type of project, though this time simulating Solana’s ecosystem on the Ethereum blockchain. Solana offers ongoing and new airdrops Kamino Finance, one of the leading DeFi protocols on Solana, has opened Season 3 for its airdrop activities. Kamino has five open quests , and has already been tested in two previous seasons. Other confirmed airdrops include Open Loop Network, which only requires a browser extension download. KRAIN AI offers points for creating an account and adding friends. Node Wars awards points for gaming, while DracoFi requires staking to award a potential airdrop. The other long-awaited airdrop is the second season of Jupuary, which will award 700M JUP by the end of the month. The airdrop will balance between stakers, old holders, and new swap users. The final conditions of the airdrop are still discussed, as swap users demand more tiers to be eligible. Otherwise, Jupuary requires relatively high trading volumes to be eligible for even a small token allocation. Jupiter swap users often have wallets with $1,000 to $20,000 in trading volumes, and demand that the airdrop allocation does not neglect this user tier. Several of the high-profile airdrops have been farmed for months since 2024. The most awaited event is still unconfirmed – the native token of Pump.fun. However, it will remain one of the big expectations for 2025, as meme traders keep up their activity. Other long-awaited airdrops on Solana include Meteora and Monad. SoLayer, Sanctum, TheVault and other small DeFi protocols are also closely watched for signs of an airdrop. Kaito AI is seen as a relatively minor airdrop, but it may have the biggest social media footprint. Kaito is issuing ‘yap points’ for social media engagement. The airdrop is virtually free and is accessible to all social media users, who connect to other influencers and engage with Kaito.

The frog-themed meme coin’s price trajectory throughout the year and its close call to surpassing Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have attracted numerous bullish forecasts for the token. As a new crypto year emerges, Pepe is poised to grow significantly especially when the meme coin craze for 2025 commences. This is set to raise the market cap of PEPE to $50 billion. On the other hand, investors are even more crazy about Remittix (RTX) , its unique PayFi network and ecosystem designed to challenge top DeFi coins serves as a strong catalyst to outperform PEPE. PEPE Price Gradually Recovers As It Market Cap And Trading Volume Surges Although the price of PEPE still reflects nearly 5% decline in the past month due to its previous sharp decline below $0.000020, the meme coin is still showcasing a very bullish trajectory. For starters, Pepe coin price has jumped by 10% in the past week, with its market cap recently spiking by 9% to $8.48 billion. This makes its $50 billion market cap forecast highly plausible by 2025. Pepe’s trading volume also rose significantly just recently by 165.17%, showing the staggering volume of interest is still attracting despite the sluggish state of the crypto market. Pepe also just came down from an all-time high of $0.00002825 twenty-two days ago, however, it currently holds a week-to-date price range of $0.00001992 and $0.00001722 . As the price of PEPE currently consolidates, Rose Premium Signals have highlighted that the token’s chart shows a rounding bottom formation. This means that the Pepe coin could potentially experience a bullish reversal soon. The analytic page sighted a peak target of $0.00003340 for PEPE in the nearest figure. Positivity is also brewing for the Pepe coin as Elon Musk just recently advocated for the meme coin by changing his X profile picture to a PEPE meme. Remittix’s Strong and Fully Functional Payment Network Shows Its Bullish Potential To Top DeFi Coins By 2027, the cross-border payments sector is expected to go through massive expansion that will possibly drive its valuation above $250 trillion. As a fully functional PayFi network, Remittix(RTX) is poised to contribute heavily to this growth trend by capitalizing on the rise of online business, and the enhancement of global financial services. What will particularly make Remittix a huge player in this field is how it leverages blockchain technology to bridge TradFi (fiat currency) and DeFi (cryptocurrencies) together. Other benefits that would arise from Remittix’s blockchain utilization are low-cost transfers, transparency, tight security, and immutability of transactions. This automatically makes the platform an ideal solution for both businesses and individuals seeking efficient payment methods. In addition to its cost-effective and fast crypto-to-fiat transfers, Remittix offers an innovative Pay API tool designed to reshape how people and businesses interact with the global economy. This spectacular Pay API model allows businesses of all sizes to conveniently integrate cryptocurrency payments into their operations. They can then settle the cryptocurrency payments (more than 30 varieties) into up to 50 fiat currency, without any possibility of transaction reversal, to prevent chargebacks. All of these distinctive features have served as catalyst for its successful presale rally, with the RTX token currently priced at $0.0167, soon to increase to $0.0172. Its presale growth can also be seen in its accumulated revenue of over $900,000 with potential to hit a million in January. Can Remittix Attract More Gains Than Pepe Coin in 2025? Although PEPE has strong community backing and solid growth potential, Remittix’s innovative ecosystem gives it an edge especially because Pepe has no practical use case. Remittix’s focus on bridging DeFi and TradFi with low-cost, secure transactions makes it a top contender for massive gains in 2025.
