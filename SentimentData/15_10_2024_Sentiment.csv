According to an analyst on the TradingView platform, the current Shiba Inu price action is pointing towards a full breakout of a bull flag formation. If this interesting projection were to materialize as anticipated, it would put the meme-inspired cryptocurrency on a steady path to a return towards its current all-time high. Shiba Inu Price Waiting To Break Above Bull Flag Taking to the TradingView platform, the analyst (without_worries) revealed an interesting take after an analysis of the Shiba Inu price action since the beginning of the year. The analyst highlighted a significant correction by examining the 5-day candlestick price chart, noting that Shiba Inu has retraced approximately 75% from its yearly high of $0.00003595. This correction has been marked by a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, giving rise to the creation of a bull flag pattern. Related Reading: Expert Dissects $60 Forecast For XRP Price, Institutional Investors Are The Key The analyst pointed out several reasons why going long on Shiba Inu now presents a favorable opportunity. The most critical factor is the breakout above the bull flag pattern, which often signals the continuation of an upward trend following a period of consolidation. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also provided a bullish signal. For the first time since April, the RSI has broken above a descending trendline and is now trending upward meaningfully. The RSI currently stands at 54.7 on the 5-day chart, relaying the inflow trend among investors. Although there remains the possibility of SHIB retesting the bull flag pattern, the analyst emphasized that if SHIB experiences a second impulsive move, it could trigger a repeat rally similar to the one seen during its last major breakout. During that previous rally, SHIB surged by about 400% to reach a peak of $0.00003595. If history were to repeat itself under similar conditions, Shiba Inu could see its price break above its current 2024 peak and reach a target between $0.00006204 and $0.000074. Bullish Predictions For SHIB The Shiba Inu price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by intense volatility. From October 7 to October 10, the SHIB price tended downward to reach a low of $0.00001613. Since that point up until the time of writing, SHIB has gained about 11.84%, although it has been rejected multiple times at $0.00001809. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate 40 Million XRP In 48 Hours – Where’s The Price Headed? At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001809. Another analyst, Javon Marks, is echoing the return to SHIB’s all-time high. According to Marks’ analysis, based on an earlier breakout of a falling wedge pattern, SHIB is now free for a run up to $0.000081.

However, considering the weakness across the board, TON, the native currency, has not been spared the hammering. Although losses might be contained, the coin is down nearly 36% from 2024 highs, finding strong support at around $4.5. TON buyers are confident prices will recover, breaking above $6 in the coming sessions. However, its performance will be shaped by market sentiment and how Bitcoin reacts to local support and resistance lines. TON Sharpe Ratio Rising While there are external factors to consider, one analyst notes that the Toncoin Sharpe Ratio is rising and is now in the “low-risk zone.” Based on the analyst’s assessment, TON offers a favorable risk-reward balance for holders and investors. Related Reading: WIF Bulls Charge Toward $2.89 As Key Resistance Test Looms Analysts use the Sharpe Ratio to gauge the risk-adjusted rate of return. The return is higher when it rises, even after factoring in existing risks. How prices perform depends on, among others, prevailing sentiment and adoption. As of mid-October, 77% of all TON traders expect prices to edge higher, looking at a CoinMarketCap poll. The analyst added that the improvement is noticeably better than last year when the Sharpe Ratio was in a “high-risk” zone. It remains to be seen whether prices will recover in the coming sessions. Toncoin Holders Exceed 90 Million: Will A Bitcoin Rally Spark Demand? Over the past few trading months, TON has grown in prominence, cementing its position in the top 10. The rapid valuation follows the success of some of its protocols, including the tap-to-earn game, Hamster Kombat. At the same time, meme coin interest is taking up shape in Toncoin, looking at trading volume associated with Dogs. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? According to on-chain data, the growth of Toncoin has seen its user base expand. As of early October, there were nearly 90 million TON holders, a 24X rise over the past year. With Toncoin dapps finding adoption, the more users choose to engage, buying TON, pushing prices even higher. If Bitcoin rises, breaking above $66,000 and $70,000 in the coming sessions, the probability of TON rising in tandem will be higher. As mentioned earlier, a decisive breakout above $6 could anchor the next leg up to June 2024 highs.

Crypto analyst Ali Mаrtinеz weighed in on the coin’s technical landscape, saying Dogecoin’s price could rise to 200% in the upcoming weeks if the current pattern of indicators continues. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? Dogecoin’s Price On The Rise Martinez observed that Dogecoin was able to break out from a multi-year downward trend, noting that this usually led to an upsurge in the meme coin’s price. He noted that historically, the coin’s price rose by 200% after breakouts. History often repeats itself, and #Dogecoin might be doing just that. A familiar pattern: breakout from a multi-year descending triangle, 200% surge, 60% retracement—then a bull run. After a recent 65% pullback, $DOGE could be gearing up for the next big rally! pic.twitter.com/c93A4Fec7V — Ali (@ali_charts) October 6, 2024 He predicted that Dogecoin could potentially breach the $0.2236 mark, а level not seen since Dеcеmbеr 2021. In late September, the token experienced a breakout, leading to a 25% price surge. However, Dogecoin failed to sustain the price rally, falling off once again to $0.11. Other analysts shared the same forecast saying that if the coin successfully got ahead of the $0.1120 level, it would likely breach the $0.1315 mark easily this month. Howеvеr, analysts urged traders to be cautious with the potential price rally of Dogecoin, noting that а 60% rеtrаcеmеnt usually preceded in previous brеаkouts bеforе it gained momentum for an upwаrd trend. A Key Driver Of Growth An increase in Dogecoin’s active addresses is a primary reason why analysts are banking on a possible huge price rally for the cryptocurrency. Mаrtinеz revealed that аctivе DOGE аddrеssеs recorded its highest level in the last eight months, surging to 133,880. Active #Dogecoin addresses recently surged to 133,880—the highest level in 8 months! pic.twitter.com/DojEsDscXk — Ali (@ali_charts) October 12, 2024 This rise of active addresses indicates that people are regaining their interest in the coin, noting a recent spike of nеw usеrs. It also implies that the additional traders are helping push for the token’s growth. For example, about 110,000 investors flocked to Dogecoin, putting the token ahead of its cryptocurrency rivals Shibа Inu and Pеpе. The growth in trading volume showed that the coin is regaining its appeal to traders seeking for a quick profit.

The amassing demonstrated traders’ growing confidеncе in the token. In past instances, huge buying usually resulted in significant pricе adjustments, serving as indicators of upcoming mаrkеt trеnds.

BTC is now consolidating and might struggle to surpass the $66,400 resistance. Bitcoin is up over 5% and now faces hurdles near the $66,400 zone. The price is trading above $64,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $65,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could rally further if there is a close above the $66,400 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Surges Over 5% Bitcoin price formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $62,500 resistance. BTC cleared the $63,500 resistance to move into a positive zone. The price even rallied above the $65,000 and $65,500 resistance levels. Finally, the price stalled near the last key resistance at $66,400. A high was formed at $66,398 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $66,000 level. The price is now approaching the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $62,139 swing low to the $66,398 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $65,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $65,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $66,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $66,400 level. A clear move above the $66,400 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $66,850. A close above the $66,850 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $67,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $68,000 resistance level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $66,400 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $65,400 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $64,250 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $62,139 swing low to the $66,398 high. The next support is now near the $63,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $62,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $65,400, followed by $64,250.

This sudden positivity in price performance has prompted debates on whether retail investors and newcomers have returned to the market. Although there has so far been speculation about increased retail participation, a detailed analysis reveals a more nuanced picture. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Braces For Volatility Ahead Of Chinese Stimulus Speculations, Options Expiry A Closer Look At Retail Participation According to a CryptoQuant analyst, BinhDang, in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the trends among smaller retail groups show growth and stagnation in different areas, reflecting a complicated dynamic in the current market cycle. In the post titled “1 Year Change – From Plankton to Fish Addresses,” BinhDang broke down Bitcoin wallet activity into several categories of retail investors, including plankton (addresses holding more than 0 but less than or equal to 0.1 BTC), shrimp (holding more than 0.1 but less than 1 BTC), and fish (holding between 10 and 100 BTC). These smaller groups were analyzed because they better represent retail investors than larger wallet categories like whales or humpbacks, which tend to be dominated by institutional players or exchanges. One of the key observations made by BinhDang is that the growth in retail addresses is uneven, particularly among the smallest investors. The plankton addresses, representing individuals holding tiny amounts of Bitcoin, have shown almost negligible growth from 2023 to the present day. This starkly contrasts previous cycles, where significant price increases were accompanied by a sharp rise in the number of retail investors holding small amounts of Bitcoin. The analyst explained that this slower growth could reflect broader economic conditions, including the global decline in monetary flows over the past few years, which may have discouraged new entrants from investing in Bitcoin. Potential For Future FOMO In Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle The uneven growth in retail addresses points to a cautious return of retail investors to the Bitcoin market. However, there are still positive signs that the current cycle has room to expand. BinhDang highlighted the trend of retail investors, particularly those in the “fish” category (holding between 10 and 100 BTC), who have continued accumulating Bitcoin, suggesting that while smaller investors may be hesitant, more seasoned participants are preparing for the next phase of the bull cycle. The data indicates that while retail participation is not as strong as in previous cycles, there remains the potential for a final wave of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) that could drive Bitcoin to new heights. The analyst particularly wrote in the post: So, the data suggests that future FOMO waves are still possible in this cycle. Based on these observations, I conclude there is still a basis to look forward to a final wave in this cycle.

There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5400 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

A base was formed and the price started a fresh increase above $0.5400 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price climbed above the $0.5450 and $0.550 resistance levels.

The next major hurdle might be $0.6120, where the bears might emerge. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5440 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.5400 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5252 swing low to the $0.5550 high.

Samara Targets 1,000 Bitcoin Milestone Publicly-listed asset management firm Samara announced it had mandated investment bank Pareto Securities as a sole manager to schedule a series of fixed-income investor meetings to potentially issue up to a €30 million or $32.8 million Nordic bond. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off In Multiple Ways As Stock Surges 317% Notably, the proceeds from the bond issuance will be utilized toward expanding Samara’s existing investment portfolio by acquiring additional limited partnership stakes in alternative investment funds. Additionally, the funds raised will help Samara boost its Bitcoin holdings. The firm confirmed it uses BTC as its “primary treasury reserve asset,” and currently holds “around 421 BTC,” according to CEO Patrick Lowry. Commenting on the development, Lowry said: The proceeds will allow Samara to further expand and solidify its already robust balance sheet as we diversify into new emerging technologies through new fund investments. With Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset, we also enhance our liquidity position with bond proceeds. He added that Samara has been holding BTC “for years” and aims to increase its reserves while investing in disruptive technology. Lowry also mentioned that, while it may be challenging, it would “be a dream to stack as much as Michael Saylor,” CEO of MicroStrategy. According to data from CoinGecko, MicroStrategy leads the global list of publicly traded companies purchasing BTC for their corporate treasury. As of October 14, MicroStrategy holds more than 252,000 BTC or approximately 1.2% of the total circulating supply. Saylor has also been quite vocal about sharing ambitious Bitcoin price targets. In September 2024, the MicroStrategy CEO predicted that BTC could soar to as high as $13 million by 2045. BTC Remains The Preferred Digital Asset Ahead Of ETH, SOL Despite the rapid advancements in smart contract ecosystems like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), Bitcoin remains the dominant choice for companies as part of their treasury management strategy. Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance in institutional adoption. For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has further cemented BTC as a reliable digital asset with regulatory clarity. Although Ethereum ETFs have also received regulatory approval, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has not seen the same level of institutional adoption in corporate balance sheets.

Market Anticipates Limited Fed Rate Cuts According to the firm’s analysis, one significant factor influencing market sentiment is the surprisingly positive Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for September, which has altered expectations regarding future interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). Currently, the market anticipates that the Fed will implement a total of only 45 basis points (bps) in rate cuts for the remainder of the year. Moreover, the options market suggests that there may be just one additional rate cut in 2024, likely a 25 bps reduction, followed by a pause in early 2025. Related Reading: Solana Extends Rally By 4%, But This Factor Could Lead To A Top This outlook aligns with prior analyses by Blofin, which indicate that the Fed’s capacity for further cuts has diminished, indicating a shift from aggressive liquidity injections to a more measured approach. However, the recent CPI surprise has also intensified market uncertainty, as reflected in the MOVE index, which tracks volatility in Treasury yields. This index surged to its highest level since June 2024, signaling heightened apprehension among investors. Concurrently, volatility indices for other assets have also increased, highlighting a broader trend of rising uncertainty. Despite these challenges, both the US Dollar Index (DXY) and US equities have demonstrated resilience, maintaining strength even amid shifting economic conditions. Yet, a notable decline in equity risk premiums suggests a growing complacency among investors or a diminished reward for taking on equity risk. This reduced premium could expose the market to greater vulnerabilities in the event of unforeseen shocks. Optimism Grows In Crypto Options Market In the crypto space, recent price movements have been notable, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experiencing significant surges. Analysis from GEX points out that there are currently no clear resistance levels in the market, suggesting that price movements might continue without substantial barriers. However, the exchange noted that this lack of structural support also underscores the market’s “inherent fragility.” They contend that if investor sentiment were to shift, the current price levels could be difficult to maintain. Additionally, the options market has seen a shift in skewness toward a more optimistic position, though it remains within a neutral range. This change indicates a growing confidence among crypto investors, albeit without overwhelming bullish sentiment. Notably, tail risk pricing has been on the rise since the end of September. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts ‘Giga Pump’ For XRP Price, Here’s The Target Overall, this trend reflects investors’ concerns about potential “extreme negative events,” underscoring that, despite the recent rally seen in the crypto market, uncertainties surrounding future Fed rate cuts and broader macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh heavily on sentiment. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $65,970, up more than 5% in the 24-hour time frame.
