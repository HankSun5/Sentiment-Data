According to an analyst on the TradingView platform, the current Shiba Inu price action is pointing towards a full breakout of a bull flag formation. If this interesting projection were to materialize as anticipated, it would put the meme-inspired cryptocurrency on a steady path to a return towards its current all-time high. Shiba Inu Price Waiting To Break Above Bull Flag Taking to the TradingView platform, the analyst (without_worries) revealed an interesting take after an analysis of the Shiba Inu price action since the beginning of the year. The analyst highlighted a significant correction by examining the 5-day candlestick price chart, noting that Shiba Inu has retraced approximately 75% from its yearly high of $0.00003595. This correction has been marked by a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, giving rise to the creation of a bull flag pattern. Related Reading: Expert Dissects $60 Forecast For XRP Price, Institutional Investors Are The Key The analyst pointed out several reasons why going long on Shiba Inu now presents a favorable opportunity. The most critical factor is the breakout above the bull flag pattern, which often signals the continuation of an upward trend following a period of consolidation. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also provided a bullish signal. For the first time since April, the RSI has broken above a descending trendline and is now trending upward meaningfully. The RSI currently stands at 54.7 on the 5-day chart, relaying the inflow trend among investors. Although there remains the possibility of SHIB retesting the bull flag pattern, the analyst emphasized that if SHIB experiences a second impulsive move, it could trigger a repeat rally similar to the one seen during its last major breakout. During that previous rally, SHIB surged by about 400% to reach a peak of $0.00003595. If history were to repeat itself under similar conditions, Shiba Inu could see its price break above its current 2024 peak and reach a target between $0.00006204 and $0.000074. Bullish Predictions For SHIB The Shiba Inu price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by intense volatility. From October 7 to October 10, the SHIB price tended downward to reach a low of $0.00001613. Since that point up until the time of writing, SHIB has gained about 11.84%, although it has been rejected multiple times at $0.00001809. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate 40 Million XRP In 48 Hours – Where’s The Price Headed? At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001809. Another analyst, Javon Marks, is echoing the return to SHIB’s all-time high. According to Marks’ analysis, based on an earlier breakout of a falling wedge pattern, SHIB is now free for a run up to $0.000081.

However, considering the weakness across the board, TON, the native currency, has not been spared the hammering. Although losses might be contained, the coin is down nearly 36% from 2024 highs, finding strong support at around $4.5. TON buyers are confident prices will recover, breaking above $6 in the coming sessions. However, its performance will be shaped by market sentiment and how Bitcoin reacts to local support and resistance lines. TON Sharpe Ratio Rising While there are external factors to consider, one analyst notes that the Toncoin Sharpe Ratio is rising and is now in the “low-risk zone.” Based on the analyst’s assessment, TON offers a favorable risk-reward balance for holders and investors. Related Reading: WIF Bulls Charge Toward $2.89 As Key Resistance Test Looms Analysts use the Sharpe Ratio to gauge the risk-adjusted rate of return. The return is higher when it rises, even after factoring in existing risks. How prices perform depends on, among others, prevailing sentiment and adoption. As of mid-October, 77% of all TON traders expect prices to edge higher, looking at a CoinMarketCap poll. The analyst added that the improvement is noticeably better than last year when the Sharpe Ratio was in a “high-risk” zone. It remains to be seen whether prices will recover in the coming sessions. Toncoin Holders Exceed 90 Million: Will A Bitcoin Rally Spark Demand? Over the past few trading months, TON has grown in prominence, cementing its position in the top 10. The rapid valuation follows the success of some of its protocols, including the tap-to-earn game, Hamster Kombat. At the same time, meme coin interest is taking up shape in Toncoin, looking at trading volume associated with Dogs. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? According to on-chain data, the growth of Toncoin has seen its user base expand. As of early October, there were nearly 90 million TON holders, a 24X rise over the past year. With Toncoin dapps finding adoption, the more users choose to engage, buying TON, pushing prices even higher. If Bitcoin rises, breaking above $66,000 and $70,000 in the coming sessions, the probability of TON rising in tandem will be higher. As mentioned earlier, a decisive breakout above $6 could anchor the next leg up to June 2024 highs.

Crypto analyst Ali Mаrtinеz weighed in on the coin’s technical landscape, saying Dogecoin’s price could rise to 200% in the upcoming weeks if the current pattern of indicators continues. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? Dogecoin’s Price On The Rise Martinez observed that Dogecoin was able to break out from a multi-year downward trend, noting that this usually led to an upsurge in the meme coin’s price. He noted that historically, the coin’s price rose by 200% after breakouts. History often repeats itself, and #Dogecoin might be doing just that. A familiar pattern: breakout from a multi-year descending triangle, 200% surge, 60% retracement—then a bull run. After a recent 65% pullback, $DOGE could be gearing up for the next big rally! pic.twitter.com/c93A4Fec7V — Ali (@ali_charts) October 6, 2024 He predicted that Dogecoin could potentially breach the $0.2236 mark, а level not seen since Dеcеmbеr 2021. In late September, the token experienced a breakout, leading to a 25% price surge. However, Dogecoin failed to sustain the price rally, falling off once again to $0.11. Other analysts shared the same forecast saying that if the coin successfully got ahead of the $0.1120 level, it would likely breach the $0.1315 mark easily this month. Howеvеr, analysts urged traders to be cautious with the potential price rally of Dogecoin, noting that а 60% rеtrаcеmеnt usually preceded in previous brеаkouts bеforе it gained momentum for an upwаrd trend. A Key Driver Of Growth An increase in Dogecoin’s active addresses is a primary reason why analysts are banking on a possible huge price rally for the cryptocurrency. Mаrtinеz revealed that аctivе DOGE аddrеssеs recorded its highest level in the last eight months, surging to 133,880. Active #Dogecoin addresses recently surged to 133,880—the highest level in 8 months! pic.twitter.com/DojEsDscXk — Ali (@ali_charts) October 12, 2024 This rise of active addresses indicates that people are regaining their interest in the coin, noting a recent spike of nеw usеrs. It also implies that the additional traders are helping push for the token’s growth. For example, about 110,000 investors flocked to Dogecoin, putting the token ahead of its cryptocurrency rivals Shibа Inu and Pеpе. The growth in trading volume showed that the coin is regaining its appeal to traders seeking for a quick profit.

The amassing demonstrated traders’ growing confidеncе in the token. In past instances, huge buying usually resulted in significant pricе adjustments, serving as indicators of upcoming mаrkеt trеnds.

BTC is now consolidating and might struggle to surpass the $66,400 resistance. Bitcoin is up over 5% and now faces hurdles near the $66,400 zone. The price is trading above $64,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $65,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could rally further if there is a close above the $66,400 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Surges Over 5% Bitcoin price formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $62,500 resistance. BTC cleared the $63,500 resistance to move into a positive zone. The price even rallied above the $65,000 and $65,500 resistance levels. Finally, the price stalled near the last key resistance at $66,400. A high was formed at $66,398 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $66,000 level. The price is now approaching the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $62,139 swing low to the $66,398 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $65,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $65,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $66,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $66,400 level. A clear move above the $66,400 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $66,850. A close above the $66,850 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $67,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $68,000 resistance level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $66,400 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $65,400 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $64,250 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $62,139 swing low to the $66,398 high. The next support is now near the $63,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $62,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $65,400, followed by $64,250.

This sudden positivity in price performance has prompted debates on whether retail investors and newcomers have returned to the market. Although there has so far been speculation about increased retail participation, a detailed analysis reveals a more nuanced picture. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Braces For Volatility Ahead Of Chinese Stimulus Speculations, Options Expiry A Closer Look At Retail Participation According to a CryptoQuant analyst, BinhDang, in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the trends among smaller retail groups show growth and stagnation in different areas, reflecting a complicated dynamic in the current market cycle. In the post titled “1 Year Change – From Plankton to Fish Addresses,” BinhDang broke down Bitcoin wallet activity into several categories of retail investors, including plankton (addresses holding more than 0 but less than or equal to 0.1 BTC), shrimp (holding more than 0.1 but less than 1 BTC), and fish (holding between 10 and 100 BTC). These smaller groups were analyzed because they better represent retail investors than larger wallet categories like whales or humpbacks, which tend to be dominated by institutional players or exchanges. One of the key observations made by BinhDang is that the growth in retail addresses is uneven, particularly among the smallest investors. The plankton addresses, representing individuals holding tiny amounts of Bitcoin, have shown almost negligible growth from 2023 to the present day. This starkly contrasts previous cycles, where significant price increases were accompanied by a sharp rise in the number of retail investors holding small amounts of Bitcoin. The analyst explained that this slower growth could reflect broader economic conditions, including the global decline in monetary flows over the past few years, which may have discouraged new entrants from investing in Bitcoin. Potential For Future FOMO In Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle The uneven growth in retail addresses points to a cautious return of retail investors to the Bitcoin market. However, there are still positive signs that the current cycle has room to expand. BinhDang highlighted the trend of retail investors, particularly those in the “fish” category (holding between 10 and 100 BTC), who have continued accumulating Bitcoin, suggesting that while smaller investors may be hesitant, more seasoned participants are preparing for the next phase of the bull cycle. The data indicates that while retail participation is not as strong as in previous cycles, there remains the potential for a final wave of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) that could drive Bitcoin to new heights. The analyst particularly wrote in the post: So, the data suggests that future FOMO waves are still possible in this cycle. Based on these observations, I conclude there is still a basis to look forward to a final wave in this cycle.

There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5400 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

A base was formed and the price started a fresh increase above $0.5400 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price climbed above the $0.5450 and $0.550 resistance levels.

The next major hurdle might be $0.6120, where the bears might emerge. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5440 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.5400 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5252 swing low to the $0.5550 high.

Samara Targets 1,000 Bitcoin Milestone Publicly-listed asset management firm Samara announced it had mandated investment bank Pareto Securities as a sole manager to schedule a series of fixed-income investor meetings to potentially issue up to a €30 million or $32.8 million Nordic bond. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off In Multiple Ways As Stock Surges 317% Notably, the proceeds from the bond issuance will be utilized toward expanding Samara’s existing investment portfolio by acquiring additional limited partnership stakes in alternative investment funds. Additionally, the funds raised will help Samara boost its Bitcoin holdings. The firm confirmed it uses BTC as its “primary treasury reserve asset,” and currently holds “around 421 BTC,” according to CEO Patrick Lowry. Commenting on the development, Lowry said: The proceeds will allow Samara to further expand and solidify its already robust balance sheet as we diversify into new emerging technologies through new fund investments. With Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset, we also enhance our liquidity position with bond proceeds. He added that Samara has been holding BTC “for years” and aims to increase its reserves while investing in disruptive technology. Lowry also mentioned that, while it may be challenging, it would “be a dream to stack as much as Michael Saylor,” CEO of MicroStrategy. According to data from CoinGecko, MicroStrategy leads the global list of publicly traded companies purchasing BTC for their corporate treasury. As of October 14, MicroStrategy holds more than 252,000 BTC or approximately 1.2% of the total circulating supply. Saylor has also been quite vocal about sharing ambitious Bitcoin price targets. In September 2024, the MicroStrategy CEO predicted that BTC could soar to as high as $13 million by 2045. BTC Remains The Preferred Digital Asset Ahead Of ETH, SOL Despite the rapid advancements in smart contract ecosystems like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), Bitcoin remains the dominant choice for companies as part of their treasury management strategy. Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance in institutional adoption. For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has further cemented BTC as a reliable digital asset with regulatory clarity. Although Ethereum ETFs have also received regulatory approval, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has not seen the same level of institutional adoption in corporate balance sheets.

Market Anticipates Limited Fed Rate Cuts According to the firm’s analysis, one significant factor influencing market sentiment is the surprisingly positive Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for September, which has altered expectations regarding future interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). Currently, the market anticipates that the Fed will implement a total of only 45 basis points (bps) in rate cuts for the remainder of the year. Moreover, the options market suggests that there may be just one additional rate cut in 2024, likely a 25 bps reduction, followed by a pause in early 2025. Related Reading: Solana Extends Rally By 4%, But This Factor Could Lead To A Top This outlook aligns with prior analyses by Blofin, which indicate that the Fed’s capacity for further cuts has diminished, indicating a shift from aggressive liquidity injections to a more measured approach. However, the recent CPI surprise has also intensified market uncertainty, as reflected in the MOVE index, which tracks volatility in Treasury yields. This index surged to its highest level since June 2024, signaling heightened apprehension among investors. Concurrently, volatility indices for other assets have also increased, highlighting a broader trend of rising uncertainty. Despite these challenges, both the US Dollar Index (DXY) and US equities have demonstrated resilience, maintaining strength even amid shifting economic conditions. Yet, a notable decline in equity risk premiums suggests a growing complacency among investors or a diminished reward for taking on equity risk. This reduced premium could expose the market to greater vulnerabilities in the event of unforeseen shocks. Optimism Grows In Crypto Options Market In the crypto space, recent price movements have been notable, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experiencing significant surges. Analysis from GEX points out that there are currently no clear resistance levels in the market, suggesting that price movements might continue without substantial barriers. However, the exchange noted that this lack of structural support also underscores the market’s “inherent fragility.” They contend that if investor sentiment were to shift, the current price levels could be difficult to maintain. Additionally, the options market has seen a shift in skewness toward a more optimistic position, though it remains within a neutral range. This change indicates a growing confidence among crypto investors, albeit without overwhelming bullish sentiment. Notably, tail risk pricing has been on the rise since the end of September. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts ‘Giga Pump’ For XRP Price, Here’s The Target Overall, this trend reflects investors’ concerns about potential “extreme negative events,” underscoring that, despite the recent rally seen in the crypto market, uncertainties surrounding future Fed rate cuts and broader macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh heavily on sentiment. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $65,970, up more than 5% in the 24-hour time frame.

Analysts Set Next Targets As BTC Retests Key Levels",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoins-road-to-70000-analysts-set-next-targets-as-btc-retests-key-levels/,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, started the third week of October with a 6% daily surge. BTC’s performance has fueled bullish sentiment among crypto investors and market watchers, who suggest it might be ready to move to $70,000. Related Reading: Why Isn’t XRP Price Moving? Crypto Pundit Claims The Answer Bitcoin Reclaims Key Support Levels Bitcoin began the week reclaiming key resistance levels after a 6% surge from Sunday’s price. This performance saw BTC move from the $62,000 support zone to retest the $66,000 support area on Monday morning. Following the recent performance, Bitcoin’s October returns so far have turned green with a 3.17% monthly return, according to Coinglass data. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted Bitcoin’s recent movements, noting that BTC has been able to reclaim a 2-month downtrend as support. Per the analyst, the flagship cryptocurrency has retested a downtrend line dating back to late July since October started. BTC successfully retested and bounced from the trendline for two consecutive weeks, turning the range into support. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin has performed several successful retests, including a “volatile retest” of the 21-week Bull Market Exponential Moving Average (EMA). “Notice how the bottom of the green boxed area is confluent with the July Downtrend retest and the retest of the 21-week EMA is confluent with the top of the green box,” the analyst added. Similarly, Ali Martinez highlighted that BTC is currently making another attempt to reclaim the 200-day Moving Average after four consecutive rejections in the past two months. BTC Challenges August Highs Rekt Capital noted that BTC has solidified the $58,000-$61,000 range as a support area throughout the year: “It has done so at a Higher Low compared to last month’s downside wicking lows as well as August’s downside wicking lows.” Moreover, the analyst stated that Bitcoin challenged August highs, at around $64,200, after the recent retests of the key levels. He suggested that BTC’s recent movements are a “clear sign” that August’s level is “weakening as resistance.” Rekt Capital pointed out BTC is retesting the multi-month weekly downtrend channel top, which is also weakening as resistance. The flagship cryptocurrency successfully tested the channel’s range lows as support this month. The range lows have been 7-month confluent support with the previous all-time high (ATH) area. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that BTC must have a weekly close above the downtrend channel’s top to break out of this pattern. A weekly close above August highs, followed by a successful retest of this level, would “pose a significant buy-side pressure on the Downtrending Channel Top,” which could be accelerated if BTC’s daily close sits above $64,200. Related Reading: WIF Bulls Charge Toward $2.89 As Key Resistance Test Looms Moreover, a daily close above $65,000 and a successful reclaim of the range as a support zone could send BTC’s price toward the $70,000 resistance zone. The analyst noted that whenever Bitcoin closed the day above this level, the cryptocurrency moved within the $65,000-$71,350 range in the following days. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $65,812, a 4% and 10.3% surge in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

This article explains how IREN's no-HODL is holding back profitability, destroying shareholder equity, and potentially rendering its thousand expansion efforts irrelevant. IREN's cost basis with the newer fleets and HPC can rival CLSK, but its profitability profile remains inferior because CLSK can sell Bitcoin at potentially higher prices in the future. Overall, IREN's no-HODL policy is a dealbreaker for us as it is detrimental to its profitability prospects and valuation. Introduction There's a saying: A single mistake can undo a thousand good deeds We think that this saying reflects our thesis for Iris Energy ( IREN ) quite accurately. IREN was an underdog just two years ago. It grew its capacity from 0.8 EH/s to 21 EH/s (September update) while maintaining operation cost efficiency around the sector average (Fig 1). Fig 1. All-in Cost Basis of Major Bitcoin Miners. It includes power cost, depreciation SG&A, financial costs, and other costs not related to impairment. One-off expenses/income such as BITF's 2024Q2 tax recovery are pro-rated to previous periods. (Author) On the growth side of the equation, IREN remains as the fastest-growing Bitcoin mining company in the sector now and into the near future. IREN is still keeping its momentum with expansion to 30 EH/s fully funded and a visible pathway to 50 EH/s via purchasing options . As a result, as of 2024Q2 (not the monthly update), IREN gained 233% more network share (relative Bitcoin network) compared to 2022Q4 figures, while Bitfarms ( BITF ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) lost a quarter of their market share (Fig 2, Fig 3). Table 1 also shows that IREN is expected to outgrow competitors in the near future. Table 1. Expansion Guidance of Major Bitcoin Mining Companies Company BITF CLSK IREN MARA RIOT Latest Capacity 11.30 27.6 21 36.9 28.2 Guided Capacity 21.00 50.00 40.00 50.00 41.00 Guided Growth (%) 86% 81% 90% 36% 45% Guidance Timeline 2024Q4 2025Q4 2025H1 2024Q4 2025Q4 This rate of capacity growth is important to gain network share because the Bitcoin reward (production) is based on one's capacity relative to the sum of capacity of all miners. Fig 2. Normalized Change (%) of Relative Network Share of Major Bitcoin Miners. The Relative Network Hash Rate was used instead of the Bitcoin Total Network Hash Rate for comps in order to better present the growth between the miners under consideration. All revenue-related computations still uses the Total Bitcoin Network Hash Rate. (Author) Fig 3. Relative Network Share of Major Bitcoin Miners (Author) On the cost side of the equation, although the all-in cost basis per Bitcoin throughout the sector has increased after the halving event in April 2024, IREN still maintains its sector average cost efficiency, not as good as CleanSpark, but better than the rest, namely Riot Platforms ((RIOT)), Marathon Holdings ( MARA ), and Bitfarms ((BITF)). Overall, IREN looks promising and has gained positive attention among investors. However, we identified a fundamental problem we perceive as a non-negotiable dealbreaker for investing in IREN. The good news is this problem could be easily reversible by the board. Hence, we remain hopeful. The Mistake That Undoes A Thousand Efforts IREN's business model revolves around liquidating all Bitcoins mined and shareholder dilution to fund operations and expansions. Many analysts and investors will attribute the advantage of such a policy to being debt-free. This pursuit of a debt-free policy could be a side effect of a past shadow , where it lost 3.6 EH/s worth of operation due to a loan default. Whether this is true is not relevant. What's relevant is that the adverse consequences of this policy outweigh the benefit of being debt-free. Irreversible Realized Losses The first adverse consequence of a no-HODL policy is the irreversible losses from Bitcoin mining. IREN reported a net loss of $24.2mil in 2024Q2 or a $29,500 loss per Bitcoin mined (divided by 821 Bitcoins mined during the period). Although all major Bitcoin mining companies made losses in 2024Q2, IREN made different types of losses. IREN's losses differ from those of other Bitcoin mining companies because its losses are fully realized and irreversible. We highlighted this problem in our buy thesis for MARA , where we looked into whether an unprofitable Bitcoin mining company can justify a price-to-book value ratio ('PBR') greater than 1. We highly recommend you go through our rationale for full context. In short, we explained that PBR>1 indicates an underlying expectation for profitability. Yet, PBR>1 is okay for unprofitable Bitcoin miners because they can HODL the Bitcoins produced and sell them when the price appreciates above the cost incurred for their production. As long as the Bitcoins are not sold for cash, the profits and losses are not realized and has the opportunity to turn a profit. It is like an active trade position in Bitcoin. For example, if IREN HODLs Bitcoin, IREN can wait until the Bitcoin price appreciates above $92,500 (its all-in cost basis per Bitcoin in 2024Q2) before selling the 801 Bitcoins mined in 2024Q2. This essentially reverses the reported losses in 2024Q2 into gains on digital assets. Unfortunately, IREN's no-HODL policy inhibits it from doing so. Depending on our Bitcoin outlook, this policy may pose a significant problem. If you expect Bitcoin to trade above its cost basis (like in the past), which is $92,500, IREN's no-HODL policy shouldn't concern you. However, based on our expectations (peaking at $100,000 before an 85% drop during the bear market ), IREN's all-in cost basis of $92,500 per Bitcoin is unfeasible. This unprofitability can lead to a bigger problem: IREN's aggressive 50 EH/s expansion may become irrelevant, essentially undoing its thousand-effort. The Undoing of its Thousand Efforts We stressed that it is not about having the largest absolute mining capacity ('EH/s'); it is the growth rate that counts. In this aspect, IREN is putting tremendous effort into what counts, which saw it increase network share by 233% compared to the major Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin production. However, these growth efforts could be irrelevant if Bitcoin cannot be produced profitably because producing more Bitcoins at a loss will only worsen profitability. Some might argue that IREN's expansion will include newer mining fleets with better efficiency. Still, our findings indicate that the improved efficiency is insufficient for IREN to turn profitable with a no-HODL policy. IREN expects its mining fleet efficiency to improve by 40% from the current 25 J/TH to 15 J/TH with the new mining fleets. This will reduce its cost of revenue (electricity) down from $25.7mil (2024Q2) to $15.4mil, which will reduce total cost from $75.9mil (or $92,500 per Bitcoin) to $65.6mil (or $80,000 per Bitcoin). IREN remains unprofitable even if the full cost savings from the newer mining fleets are captured. Hence, IREN's effort to expand may yield no fruit (profit) because of the no-HODL policy. Then what about the HPC business segment? Can it help solve the irreversible loss problem? Contributions of HPC Our findings show that IREN's HPC can be a cost-saving measure. Since IREN is hosting its HPC operations and Bitcoin mining operations under the same roof, we don't expect SG&A costs to scale as much as HPC capacity. So, the two cost drivers would be electricity and depreciation. Electricity is a non-issue because the hardware margin is 98%. For depreciation, assuming a 5-year useful life on the $76mil ( $ 10mil + $22mil on H100 + $44mil on H200) GPU investments, the annual depreciation cost per quarter would be $15.2mil. So after depreciation, expected annual profits will drop from $34mil to $19mil (or $4.75mil per quarter). Based on 2024Q2 Bitcoin production, this translates to $5,800 cost savings per Bitcoin ($4.75mil divide by 821 Bitcoin). Assuming the expected $80,000 cost basis per Bitcoin, IREN's HPC segment can further push cost down to $74,200 per Bitcoin. It remains to be seen whether this is enough to make IREN the most efficient in the sector because CLSK, the reigning champion of mining efficiency, will also update its mining fleets with newer models. Nevertheless, IREN's HPC segment is expected to help it achieve similar cost basis as CLSK, which is the best in the sector (Fig 1). However, their profitability profile differs drastically because CLSK has the opportunity to sell Bitcoin at potentially higher prices in the future thanks to its HODL policy. Therefore, we can see that IREN's no-HODL policy is lowering profitability, potentially to a point of rendering its expansion efforts irrelevant. Unrecoverable Shareholder Equity Another problem with IREN's no-HODL policy is about shareholder dilution. Our previous thesis mentioned that any form of margin of safety (based on book value) is expected to be temporal due to the lack of un-depreciable assets (Bitcoin). On the flip side, IREN's book value also does not have room for appreciation due to the lack of appreciable assets (Bitcoin). For context, all these major Bitcoin miners increase outstanding shares almost proportionally (aside from CLSK) over the past 3 years. But only MARA and RIOT managed to recover their shareholder equity (Fig 4). Note that during the Bitcoin bear market (Fig 4), every major Bitcoin miners lost shareholder equity during the Bitcoin bear market. What MARA and RIOT had in common was their large Bitcoin reserves. This is also a contributing factor for our bullish thesis for MARA . Fig 4. Adjusted Book Value Per Share of Major Bitcoin Miners (Author) Fig 5. Proportion (%) of Bitcoin over Total Asset (Author) (Author) Fig 6. Normalized Change (%) Outstanding Shares of Major Bitcoin Miners (Author) Unrecoverable book value is also highly detrimental to valuation. By referring to Fig 7, we observe an ongoing sector-wide mean reversion on PBR where IREN is now trading at the same PBR as the likes of MARA, which has high proportion of Bitcoin on Balance Sheet. This is where the same water that hardens the egg, softens the potato. This mean reversion offers fundamental upside for MARA but significant downside risk for IREN. We explained that PBR>1 implies expectations for an appreciable book value or a high profitability prospect, both of which IREN does not currently possess, again, due to its no-HODL policy. Fig 7. Sector Mean Reversion on PBR (Author) Can HPC help with valuation? Unlikely as per IREN's own guidance. IREN only expects a 2.5x earnings multiple on the GPUs. IREN stated that it'll take 2 years to recoup the CAPEX on GPUs while the GPUs only have an expected 5-year useful life. The 2.5x earnings multiple on a $19mil profit only contributes $47.5mil of market cap or 3% of IREN's current market cap. Also, many people might argue HPC is a profit-guarantee business. Who would charge a rate lower than the cost? Well, we only have to look as far as RIOT for making significant losses QoQ in its hosting segment. Hence, the HPC segment is not without its risks and does not contribute to IREN's valuation. Verdict IREN is performing exceptionally well on what matters: growing capacity fast while keeping cost basis low. What we think is lacking is a decision to abolish its no-HODL policy. We think that IREN, with a HODL policy, can become one of the most exciting and attractive investments in Bitcoin mining. In this article, we showed how IREN's no-HODL is holding back profitability, destroying shareholder equity, and potentially rendering its 'thousand efforts' (to expand) irrelevant. It is also why IREN's no-HODL is a dealbreaker for us. Therefore, investors of IREN should pay close attention to this particular catalyst, the day IREN HODLs Bitcoin. Meanwhile, IREN could still pump more than other miners on the back of exciting headline numbers (capacity, HPC, etc), but we find little that can support a buy thesis when things go south under current circumstances. Again, we think that all it takes is for IREN to turnaround is a decision from the board. Until then, IREN will only live in our watchlist. For now, we're only looking to tilt our portfolio into MARA and CLSK when we receive our 2 confirmations for a potential bull run by 17th October.",IREN,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-15 09:55:53

The hard-landing thesis is supported by positive real rates, declining savings rates, and traditional recession indicators like yield curve inversion. Gold and Bitcoin are recommended for their potential to perform well in both soft and hard landing scenarios, despite Bitcoin's volatility. Bitcoin offers unique convexity potential, acting as both a store of value and a tech asset, making it an all-weather play. Periodically, I write about macro. Early on in my investment career, I discovered the wonders of being a stock investor with a well-defined macro view. The main problem is the ability to sustain a well-calibrated macro view. Only periodically have I been capable of holding a high-conviction macro thesis that I feel confident enough to use to scale my position size. Nevertheless, more important than having the right thesis is holding the right asset. It all boils down to having the right portfolio. The investment world now seems divided between two fiercely competing theses: soft-landing and hard-landing. The hard landing thesis seems to have lost some luster since 2023. Yahoo Finance It has been like this for a long time; it has been so recurrent that it doesn't feel like déjà vu anymore, it just feels like another “Friends” episode. At times, investors have been confronted with this fork in the road, and having counted myself among the hard-landing crowd a few times, I can hear myself being a bit of a broken record throwing out reasons for a recession. However, also knowing that I have been wrong a couple of times in the past and that my portfolio performance suffered, I have to ask myself if there isn't an all-weather asset that can help me avoid the losses of being wrong. In other words, can I pick the wrong thesis and still make money? I think we can pick the asset that fits, but to get there we need to revisit historical patterns. Hard-landing thesis For now, let's take a step back and go through the current possibilities. The hard-landing thesis is perhaps the best documented. A bit like the pursuit of the holy grail, it has attracted the sharpest and most adventurous minds to the fold. Therefore, the case is very well-supported with data points that make a compelling argument. One of the most important aspects to consider is that we are now in positive real rates territory. Positive real rates have been a rare beast in the last 25 years, and almost every time they have been with us for a prolonged period, it has ended in recession. FRED One way I tend to look at this is by adding the savings rate. When real interest rates become positive, available income will drop, and it will likely be compensated by savings consumption. If the tightening cycle is not too destructive, the economy might bear it well. The 1990s is a good example of a decade when real rates trended higher in the first half, with the savings rate dropping steadily. By 1995, real rates started trending lower until 1997, when they resumed, with a new inflection point at the end of 1998. The savings rate kept dropping and bottomed in 2000, just before the recession. FRED A similar analysis can be done for the period ending with the 2008 recession, while the following period, until 2023, was mostly characterized by negative real rates and stable savings rates. The helicopter money of 2020/21 blurs the analysis for the current period. Nevertheless, we are in a tightening period in terms of real rates since 2022, when the rate tightening cycle started. Savings rates are now lower than in 2019, and they seem to be trending lower in 2024. If we factor in the unemployment and apply the Sahm rule, we get the alert that we might be close to a recession or even already be in one. FRED We can look at other popular recession indicators like the inversion of the yield curve, which is uninverting like it does right before a recession. FRED The case is very clear in favor of a recession, with several traditional recession detection metrics flashing red or orange, but, as always, not every single metric is aligned with this view. Soft-landing thesis For me to be completely convinced that the recession is inevitable, I would need to see the insides of the stock market reflecting this. I would need to see cyclicals underperforming defensives. Seeking Alpha Looking at the performance of the various sectors of the S&P 500, we can see that the worst performers in the last month were defensives like Healthcare ( XLV ) and Consumer Staples (XLP). During the last year, the best performers were Technology ( XLK ) and Financials (XLF). While the worst performers were Healthcare and Energy (XLE). This does not suggest a recession. In the past, for instance, the Consumer Discretionary ( XLY ) peaked way ahead of the recession. Seeking Alpha The fact that we presently lack these cues may have two distinct meanings: Either the recession was cancelled, or the equity market is deeply wrong. One decade ago, it was common to hear that the bond market was the smart money, however, fast forward to the present and with all the bond buying from central banks, we cannot be sure that the bond price action carries the same signal . Investment action I think the most likely thesis is that the hard landing is coming. Nevertheless, we have laid out several data points that indicate weakness in both the soft and hard landing scenarios. For instance, although Consumer Discretionary is still strong, it has not surpassed its 2021 peak, and it has underperformed Healthcare since pre-Covid. Seeking Alpha This makes me believe that in both scenarios, the Fed will be dovish. In a hard landing, it will use the same playbook as 2008. However, in a soft landing, the Fed is also likely to try to support the labor market and consumers. Therefore, the end game seems like more liquidity in either case. The best asset to own going into a recession will be Gold (GLD). The liquidity injected into the system will be reflected in gold prices rapidly. But understand that in these moments, markets will also test the soft landing thesis. You will likely see the most cherished names in equity land trying to rally. Below, I also included Louis Vuitton (LVMUY). As you can see, it went up even faster than gold. Later on, the moments of acute collateral shortages brought everything back, even gold gave some of the gains back. Nevertheless, gold still outperformed bonds like the iShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond ETF ( IEI ) in 2008. Seeking Alpha What assets will perform well in the soft landing? Equities are likely to perform well in the soft landing. The Fed will ease somewhat more in order to reach a neutral rate, and that should be good for consumers and equity prices. In that scenario, we should see the S&P 500 resume its grinding higher, and Discretionary Staples should also break to new highs. Therefore, gold investors basically risk a soft-landing scenario where gold still performs well, but the most cherished names in equity land outperform it. Is there any way to get some convexity? I think so, with Bitcoin (BTC-USD). It's very hard to provide a short, detailed description of what Bitcoin is. It is many things to many folks. But I dare cite Paul Tudor Jones' letter on Bitcoin from 2020. There, PDT argued that Bitcoin is a store of value and benchmarked it against other available assets. Paul Tudor Jones & Lorenzo Giorgianni Letter, 2020 Although it comes last, for PDT, the surprising factor was that it ranked at close to 70% of gold's score, while it has a fraction of gold's market capitalization. In his assessment, he included four main dimensions: Purchasing power – the ability to retain value; Trustworthiness – universal trust as a store of value; Liquidity – the ability to convert to common currencies; and Portability – the ability to move the asset geographically. I believe that if the assessment were to be conducted now, the score would be much higher. The ETFs have added additional bandwidth that now allows institutions to onboard very fast. They are also contributing to reinforcing the whole infrastructure by pressuring the SEC to make regulatory decisions, bringing big players in, e.g., JPMorgan (JPM), and allowing companies like Coinbase ( COIN ) to add more offerings. Looking at Bitcoin's behavior during the initial Covid months, we can see that it started to move up as it became evident that some intervention would be necessary. In my view, the market was operating on a soft landing thesis. However, when we got to March and lockdowns became a reality (hard landing), credit markets freaked out, there were collateral shortages, and people liquidated in panic. Almost every asset suffered, but Bitcoin suffered much more. However, as the stimulus was unleashed in size, Bitcoin came back to surpass every other asset. Seeking Alpha Risks The previous chart encapsulates the main advantages and risks of using Bitcoin in the present scenario. It might outperform in both soft landing and hard landing but will likely do so with huge volatility. In weeks of collateral shortages, it will likely be the asset of choice to be liquidated to meet margin calls, just like what happened in 2020. Imagine holding Bitcoin in February 2020; could you ride it out? It is a tough question. Additionally, there will be periods when it might underperform equities. In the previous chart, we see that in July 2020, as investors were loading up on risk assets, Bitcoin was underperforming Apple massively. Could investors ride it out without the fear of missing out? I really doubt it. The main issue for Bitcoin investors will be to stick to the plan when dealing with long weeks of violent moves. Another risk is how to implement this strategy. I am bullish on the spot product, but buying spot and storing it is not for everyone, and it is beyond the scope of this piece to explain how to do it. There are solutions like buying it on the exchanges and keeping it there (not really Bitcoin, more like an IOU). Or buying the ETF and dealing with tracking error and ETF-related risks (e.g., custody, fraud). There is also the risk of Bitcoin simply failing technically, or failing to become universally seen as a store of value. Finally, my scenarios do not contemplate a sudden need to tighten monetary conditions. If such a scenario materializes, I believe Bitcoin will underperform massively, as it did in 2022. This is the major weak spot in my investment rationale. Deep Dive on Bitcoin Let's now move to a more granular analysis of Bitcoin that can shed more light on Bitcoin itself and help us see where it stands right now on more granular metrics. Right now, the corrections from local peaks are compatible with previous bull markets, when Bitcoin had violent pullbacks in notable previous uptrends. Therefore, the current fractal has similarities with the previous bull runs. Glassnode A more fundamental way to look at these supply and demand dynamics is to consider the average cost of active investors. We can look at the active investor price, which now stands at $52.5k . The spot price has been trading significantly above that level. That is a sign that the potential supply is comfortably in the money and may take its time before rushing to sell. Ignoring all the noise from market commentators, we can see that the CPI has been trending lower. Bitcoin investors are very liquidity-sensitive and will try to front-run interest rate cuts and easing financial conditions. With Bitcoin now printing a series of higher highs and higher lows since March, we might be witnessing the change in sentiment that sets in motion a breakout. Tradingview Finally, there is Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score, a metric used to measure Bitcoin's value by comparing its market value to its realized value—the realized value being the value at the last time each bitcoin was moved on-chain. Like traditional valuation metrics, this gives us insight into whether the market is overvalued or not. A high MVRV suggests that investors deep in the money might eventually balance the price by increasing supply, creating a price top. A low MVRV implies exactly the opposite. Currently, the MVRV Z-score shows we are far from the high levels that mark tops, and this, together with the previous data, is compatible with a constructive scenario. Where might this lead us? Coinglass At this point, I think the value potential for Bitcoin can be best summarized by VanEck's CEO, who suggested that it could reach half of gold's market capitalization, which would translate to a price target of $350,000 . This might seem ambitious, but we're not even considering the possibility of adoption by Central Banks. Conclusion Bitcoin has the potential to perform well in both soft and hard landing scenarios, and it will have movements of violent reversals that might drive investors mad. There is one reason for that: Bitcoin has features that make it similar to gold but also has features that make it akin to a tech stock. Therefore, markets will at times use it as a store of value similar to gold; other times, this will be supercharged by the fact that it is a technology being adopted at a fast pace. Conversely, sometimes the opposite will happen: investors will recognize the risk of Bitcoin being a failed technological attempt to emulate gold, and they will dump it to stabilize portfolios. We have covered it all. I think Bitcoin, at this juncture, has enough convexity potential to make it an all-weather play – one of those that seldom appears. However, that does not mean you won't get wet if it rains.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-15 11:42:03

Many investors are becoming frustrated as they see the altcoin stagnating after a bit of an increase recently. Despite the weak performance, technical analysts are starting to see possible signals of a major change despite the negative vibe; if XRP effectively crosses an important Fibonacci retracing level, they project a strong recovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Revival: Active Addresses Skyrocket To Highest Level In 8 Months Market analyst “Random Crypto Pal” thinks XRP is about to break out in an “explosive” manner. On social media, he shares his observation and emphasized the significance of the 0.236 Fibonacci level, which XRP has not yet hit but is approaching. Should this level give way, he expects a price explosion similar to the one it observed in 2017. Once #XRP breaks above 0.236 fib the 2017 #XRP EXPLOSION is coming 👀🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥 Only PURE FACTS 😎😎😎 Like ❤️ repost ♻️ FOLLOW 🙏🙏 pic.twitter.com/AOz255KQ0y — Random Crypto Pal (@RandomCryptoPal) October 13, 2024 The Trajectory Of XRP Towards $0.80 The Fibonacci level of 0.236 analysts have on their radar would see a price that is slightly above $0.80. XRP is currently trading at $0.548, so an approximate gain of 45% would be needed to be achieved in order to bring about a price for that. When it reaches this threshold of $0.80, the huge returns may appear rather quickly for the coin. In 2017, XRP broke above the resistance of 0.236 Fibonacci and continued on a long rising trajectory that topped at an all-time high in January of 2018. The historic parallel gives analysts hope that history may repeat, but unless XRP is able to break this resistance level it is not really possible to predict whether or when the rally might occur, nor the magnitude of the price increase. Ripple’s Legal Dispute A primary obstacle that may mitigate this confidence is XRP’s protracted legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The ambiguity over this litigation persists in affecting investor sentiment. The SEC has classified the majority of altcoins as investment contracts; nonetheless, XRP has endured the most intense scrutiny, rendering it one of the most legally complicated digital currencies available. The decision of the court that XRP is not a security constituted a major victory for Ripple Labs, but it has almost been challenged by an appeal from the SEC. The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC gives uncertainty over how long the cryptocurrency would face this uncertainty.

XRP could, therefore, present the avenue of survival through institutional investment despite the judicial ambiguity. Bitwise and Canary Capital appear to believe in the coin by pushing for a US-based XRP ETF. This tool would definitely make XRP’s position better and may attract more investment. Furthermore, advancements on the XRP Ledger are fostering optimistic feeling among the community. The potential for XRP to surpass $0.80 and initiate a new surge is yet to be determined. Nonetheless, due to the influence of technical, legal, and institutional considerations, investors are closely monitoring forthcoming developments.

This rally has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with many traders now anticipating higher highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. According to a crypto analyst, this breakout has seen the stochastic indicator print a signal to a rally that could send Bitcoin to the $500,000 price target. Stochastic Breakout To Send BTC Price Above $500,000 Taking to social media platform X, a crypto analyst known as Tarder Tardigrade highlighted an interesting price breakout with the Stochastic Indicator. The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis to measure the closing price of an asset relative to its price range over a specified period. Like the RSI, it can help to identify overbought or oversold conditions. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Flashes Historical Bull Flag, Here’s What Happened Last Time In Trader Tardigrade’s analysis, which was accompanied by a detailed BTCUSD monthly candlestick chart, he pointed out that the stochastic indicator has been steadily moving downward and remained confined within a falling wedge pattern for most of 2024. However, the recent rally in Bitcoin’s price, which was first observed in September and has now resumed in October, triggered a notable breakout from this falling wedge The analyst emphasized that this stochastic breakout coincided with the formation of a local bottom in Bitcoin’s price, around the critical $60,000 level. He further noted that this breakout is not just significant in isolation but represents the starting point for what he predicts to be a parabolic rally. According to Trader Tardigrade, this breakout sets the stage for Bitcoin to potentially surge toward the $500,000 price target. When To Expect A $500,000 Bitcoin? This interesting projection of the Bitcoin price is supported by a similar pattern following a previous breakout of the stochastic indicator, which also aligned with a local bottom in late 2016. After that breakout, Bitcoin saw an extraordinary price surge over the subsequent months, culminating in a peak of $19,600 in December 2017. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts ‘Giga Pump’ For XRP Price, Here’s The Target Going by this previous price performance, a similar breakout would see Bitcoin continue to surge throughout the rest of 2024 and the entirety of 2025. Notably, the analyst highlighted a peak of the parabolic rally at $520,000 sometime in 2026. $Bitcoin Stochastic BREAKOUT 🔥$BTC has the same pattern as the previous cycle. The breakout point indicates the local bottom at the root of MASSIVE Parabolic RALLY. Send $BTC to $500k 🚀 pic.twitter.com/LoJwlg2Fko — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) October 14, 2024 At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $65,750 and has increased by 2.4% in the past 24 hours. A parabolic rally to $520,000 would translate to a 690% increase from the current price. In another analysis of the daily candlestick timeframe chart, Trader Tardigrade highlighted that there are no reasons to be bearish on Bitcoin at the moment. The price is demonstrating strong momentum, having flipped a key descending resistance trendline into support, and is now breaking out of another falling wedge above the descending trendline.
