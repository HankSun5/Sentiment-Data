54408376,https://cryptonews.com/?p=452058,1763159700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54408376.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now 14 November – XRP, Ethereum, Zcash",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-14-november-xrp-ethereum-zcash/,"Bitcoin surged to an unprecedented high of $126,080 in early October, but the much-anticipated “Uptober” rally abruptly stalled after Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on China triggered a sharp market-wide selloff on October 6. That drop set the stage for a month-long correction across the crypto sector. For veteran digital-asset traders, the retracement was far from unexpected, and in many ways, welcomed. Corrections help eliminate excessive leverage and speculative froth, often laying the foundation for stronger, more sustainable rallies that follow. Now that volatility is easing and investor sentiment is steadily improving, analysts believe momentum could accelerate heading into 2026. Here’s why XRP, Ethereum, and Zcash may become some of the top performers in the next major bull cycle. XRP (XRP): Fueling the Next Era of Global Payments Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to reshape the environment of international payments with its fast, low-cost blockchain settlement system, positioning itself as a more efficient alternative to legacy networks like SWIFT. Ripple’s technology has been spotlighted in reports from the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, while the company continues forging high-level partnerships with global financial institutions. This expanding ecosystem has helped XRP secure its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap hovering near $135.6 billion. Ripple’s newest initiative, the RLUSD U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, highlights its aggressive push into what many view as crypto’s most important use case. Every RLUSD transaction, and all activity on the XRP Ledger, requires a tiny XRP burn, tying network adoption directly to long-term token value. XRP has climbed 214.5% over the past year, reaching $3.65 in July, its first all-time high since 2018. Over the same 12-month period, Bitcoin’s price grew just 3.4%. If the U.S. approves spot crypto ETFs and passes Project Crypto, a legislative framework aimed at clarifying digital-asset regulation, XRP could realistically target $10 or more by early 2026. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart-Contract Titan Gears Up for Major Expansion Ethereum ($ETH) , boasting a market cap of roughly $371.7 billion, remains the backbone of decentralized finance and Web3 development. Holding about $72.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) , Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi and smart-contract sectors, reinforcing its vital role across the blockchain ecosystem. A bullish scenario places ETH at $10,000 by year-end, a major leap from its current $3,206 level and roughly double its previous all-time high of $4,946 recorded in August. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade, scheduled for early December, will significantly improve data availability for Layer-2 solutions while boosting sustainability, security, and network scalability. These enhancements could push ETH toward the $5,000 mark by the end of the month. However, achieving a run to $10,000 will largely depend on clearer U.S. regulations, which will unlock broader institutional participation. Earlier this year, ETH broke out of a bullish flag pattern, rising from $1,800 to an ATH, though stronger momentum is required to propel it into five-digit territory. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Coin Soars 147% in a Week Launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin fork, Zcash ($ZEC) was developed with one mission in mind: preserving financial privacy. ZEC uses zk-SNARKs, a powerful cryptographic technique that validates transactions without exposing the sender, receiver, or amount involved. Its dual-address design offers users a choice between transparent and shielded transactions, maintaining a balance between anonymity and regulatory compatibility. ZEC has rallied 17% in the last 24 hours and an astonishing 1,359% in the last 365 days. Now trading around $566, it accounts for most of the $32.7 billion privacy coin sector’s overnight gains of 17%. It also boasts a hefty market cap of over $9 billion. With an RSI hovering near 68, ZEC is nearing overbought territory, suggesting a mild pullback could occur as traders take profits. Still, strong fundamentals and renewed interest in privacy tech could propel ZEC to $1,000 before year-end. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme Coin with Real Utility and Layer-2 Scaling One rising star poised to make waves in 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a project merging meme-coin culture with meaningful blockchain infrastructure. Unlike typical meme tokens, HYPER provides tangible utility as a Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling solution, aiming to increase the network’s transaction throughput, reduce fees, and enable smart-contract functionality. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper supports DAO governance, cross-chain interoperability, and programmable contracts, enabling seamless interaction with Bitcoin across multiple networks. The project has already raised $27.5 million during its presale phase, with analysts such as Borch Crypto projecting potential gains of up to 100×. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed no security flaws in the smart contract, boosting investor confidence. The HYPER token powers staking, network fees, and governance. Early presale stakers can earn up to 42% APY. With Bitcoin approaching new highs and HYPER’s presale experiencing strong demand, many analysts expect this project to become one of 2026’s breakout performers.

The $0.1130–$0.1150 support zone remains critical, as the current structure shows risk of deeper declines if it breaks. CRO is moving within a tightening range, signaling that a decisive move is likely once price escapes this narrowing structure. On November 14, 2025, Cronos trades at $0.1175, down 4.68% over the past 24 hours. The price moved between $0.1132 and $0.1229, showing moderate volatility as sentiment shifted. Activity across the Cronos ecosystem remained steady, with users engaging through explorer.cronos.org and supported wallets like MetaMask and Crypto.com Wallet. Traders watched CRO closely as it tested support levels while struggling to hold above $0.12. Cronos daily price chart: CRO shows softening buyer momentum On the daily chart, CRO stayed below the $0.1200 resistance, showing limited buyer strength. The price held just above $0.1130, but the candle structure signaled that bulls needed stronger momentum. Indicators showed weakening upside energy as CRO traded under short-term moving averages, while flat volume pointed to a drifting, consolidating market. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView A dip toward $0.1150 led to a mild rebound, but the move failed to return CRO to the upper range. Sellers stayed active between $0.1180 and $0.1200, keeping pressure on every attempt to climb. The chart showed repeated rejections, forming a tight trading corridor that traders watched closely as CRO neared its next key decision point. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO intraday structure points to short-term bearish control On the 4-hour chart, CRO formed a series of lower highs, confirming a short-term bearish pattern. The price hovered near $0.117, while momentum indicators signaled weakening pressure. Buyers attempted moves toward $0.119, but each push lost strength before reaching resistance. This descending structure kept CRO vulnerable to deeper declines if $0.1150 failed to hold. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView Small recovery candles appeared, showing light accumulation but not enough to shift direction. Sellers kept control as CRO stayed below its intraday trend line, with each bounce forming new lower resistance levels. The structure pointed to continuation unless CRO produced a clean break above $0.120, the key level traders continued to watch.

On the daily chart, resistance near $0.1200 keeps buyers in check, while support at $0.1130–$0.1150 is critical amid flat volume and consolidating price action. The 4-hour chart shows a series of lower highs, confirming short-term bearish control, with attempts toward $0.119 losing momentum and leaving CRO vulnerable to a dip below $0.1150. Traders should watch $0.1150 for support and $0.1200 for resistance, as a break of either level could dictate the next trend. Is Cronos a good investment?

Recent news Cronos completed its “Smarturn” upgrade on October 30, 2025, boosting EVM compatibility, scalability, and interoperability.

With IBC v2 integration for faster cross-chain communication, Smarturn enhances DeFi efficiency, lowers gas costs, and strengthens Cronos’s role as a leading Ethereum-compatible layer-1 in the Crypto.com ecosystem. Will Cronos reach $0.5?

Will Cronos reach $1? Projections for Cronos estimate it could reach $1 by 2029, driven by its expansion in DeFi, NFT integrations, and partnerships. Will Cronos reach $100? It is unlikely that Cronos’s price will reach $100, as this would require an extremely high market capitalization, surpassing the current CRO coin price prediction for the cryptocurrency sector. Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility.

As interest continues to rise, investors are closely monitoring the RNS token price , how it evolves across the presale phases, and what expectations look like once the token goes live on exchanges. Here is a complete breakdown of the current price, phase progression, the effect of bonuses on the actual cost per token, and projections shared by market analysts. Current RNS Token Price in Presale According to the official RentStac website, the presale is currently in Phase 1 , with the token priced at: $0.025 per RNS With nearly a million dollars already raised and demand increasing daily, RentStac’s entry into the RWA sector is being met with strong early enthusiasm. The Real Price Is Lower: Bonuses Reduce the Actual Cost Per Token A key detail that many newcomers overlook is the presence of multiple bonus tiers on the official site. These bonuses provide additional tokens when users invest above certain thresholds, effectively reducing the real cost per token . This means that while the displayed Phase 1 price is $0.025, investors who benefit from bonuses often pay significantly less on a per-token basis . Early buyers are therefore able to secure a much more favorable entry point compared to later phases. For RWA-focused investors, this early discount is one of the main reasons the presale is attracting so much strategic attention. How Much Will the RNS Price Increase in the Next Phases? The RentStac presale is structured across 7 progressive phases , each with a clearly defined price increase. This ensures full transparency and reinforces the incentive for early participation. Here are the key price markers: Phase 1 price: $0.025 Phase 2 price: $0.030 Final phase price: approximately $0.055 per RNS From start to finish, this represents an increase of around +120% within the presale alone. When combined with bonus allocations, early presale buyers obtain tokens at a meaningfully discounted effective rate, often far below the listed price. This layered structure creates a strong foundation for investor confidence and sets expectations for future performance. Why Analysts Believe RNS Could Move Toward $1 After Launch As the RWA narrative strengthens, analysts tracking RentStac are increasingly vocal about its post-launch potential. Their projections are based on two dominant factors: 1. Real estate backing Unlike speculative tokens that rely purely on hype or market momentum, RNS is tied to real rental properties that produce verifiable cash flow. This grounding in real-world value adds stability and credibility to the token. 2. Rising demand for RWA tokens Real-world asset tokenization has become one of crypto’s fastest-growing sectors. Platforms offering passive income backed by tangible assets have historically shown strong early performance upon exchange listing. Because of this, several analysts are forecasting that RNS could experience a substantial appreciation shortly after launch. Among the more optimistic projections: RNS could approach the $1 mark in the early post-launch period, especially if the platform scales its property acquisitions quickly and demand mirrors what similar RWA projects have experienced. These predictions are speculative, but they are grounded in comparisons with past RWA token launches, sector growth trends, and the inherent appeal of property-backed yield. The Path Forward: Why Investors Are Watching the Price Closely The RNS token price is drawing significant attention for three main reasons: The current presale price is still at its lowest point Bonuses drastically reduce the true purchase cost Analysts foresee meaningful upside after exchange listing This combination of discounted entry, growing presale momentum, and expanding interest in RWAs positions RentStac as one of the more closely watched early-stage projects of 2025. As the presale progresses through its next phases, the token’s price will continue increasing, while the bonus structures make early participation notably more advantageous.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-14 23:00:00

In light of this, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley made some thought-provoking remarks about the current market conditions, suggesting that a bear market cycle has been playing out for the past six months. New Bullish Phase Ahead For Bitcoin? In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Horsley emphasized the shift in market dynamics, stating, “We talk about four-year cycles, but the reality is that model is based on a bygone era of crypto.” He pointed out that with the advent of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a new pro-crypto administration by President Trump, the landscape has evolved significantly.

Horsley’s statement could be met with optimism for investors about the future direction of crypto prices, suggesting that the digital asset ecosystem may soon transition into a new bullish phase. “I think there’s a pretty good chance that we’ve been in a bear market for almost six months now and are almost through it,” he remarked, noting that the current market setup appears stronger than ever. Animoca Brands Co-Founder Weighs In Meanwhile, crypto-linked stocks also experienced declines on Friday. Notably, Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), which focuses on a Bitcoin treasury strategy, saw its shares drop by 6%. Other significant players, including Gemini (GEMI) Space Station and Bullish (BLSH), saw their stock prices decrease by 2%, while Coinbase’s (COIN) shares fell by 1%. Further, digital asset mining firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies traded 3% lower. Adding to the discourse, Yat Siu, co-founder of the blockchain development firm Animoca Brands, shared insights with CNBC, stating that lack of liquidity in the market has led to investors divesting certain assets to address financial concerns. “There’s less money in the system,” Siu noted, attributing some sell-offs to those shortfalls. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Tumbles Toward $98,000: What’s Driving The Drop And What Lies Ahead Siu echoed Horsley’s perspective, suggesting that this current market cycle may differ from previous ones, particularly due to the influx of institutional investment in digital assets. He explained that institutional investors do not typically follow the longstanding belief system of major Bitcoin holders regarding the four-year price cycle. “People think Bitcoin is going to go down to $60,000 because of the four-year cycle and the token’s history of drops and corrections,” Siu explained. However, he believes that these institutions will view market downturns more as buying opportunities than signals for panic. As of this writing, BTC has recovered the $96,750 line but is still recording losses of 4% over the past 24 hours and seven days.

54411151,627753,1763161204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54411151.jpeg,Here’s How XRP Holders Reacted Before And After The Game-Changing Spot ETF Announcement,https://bitcoinist.com/before-and-after-xrp-spot-etf-news/,"On-chain data has revealed an interesting trend among XRP investors amid certain crucial updates regarding the leading altcoin, particularly the XRP Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). With the market shifting towards a bearish state, the current behavior of investors could play a pivotal role in shaping the token’s next trajectory. Before Vs. After The XRP Spot ETFs Update XRP’s market dynamic has entered a decisive new chapter, as holders make key moves in the market. A recent report from CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain data analytics platform, has broken down the actions of investors before and after the announcement of XRP Spot ETFs , revealing a notable trend. In the quick-take post, Woominkyu, a market expert and author, highlighted that whale investors acted prior to the spot ETFs announcement, but retail investors only arrived after the crucial update. This trend ended up changing the asset’s market setup. Once the ETF confirmation was released, sentiment transformed almost immediately. Before the news about XRP Spot ETFs broke, on-chain data unveiled that futures data demonstrated a clear rise in whale-sized orders. Such a steady acquisition indicates early strategic positioning by high-net-worth players while the price of the token was still compressed and moving sideways. However, the most important development is the retail investors’ orders, which were being observed following the spot ETFs news. The stark difference between pre-announcement caution and post-announcement confidence highlights how revolutionary this milestone will be for XRP and its ecosystem. Woominkyu stated that this pattern, whales first, retail last, is typical and frequently indicates a change in the state of the cryptocurrency market. As sentiment begins to mix with earlier informed movements, the market typically becomes more erratic and unpredictable after retail investors arrive late. Meanwhile, news regarding the spot ETFs bolstered this transition by attracting traders who were not available during the buildup. This does not imply that the move is finished, but it does indicate that the market has arrived at a stage where retail and whale behavior collide. A trend of this kind makes it difficult for traders to read the next market direction. Several Spot ETFs Set For Launch As anticipation builds in the sector, Ripple Bull Winkle, a researcher and host of The Crypto Blitz Show, has outlined a potential timeframe for several XRP spot ETFs to go live. Ripple Bull Winkle declared that 7 of the funds are officially set to launch in just 12 days, marking one of the most significant countdowns in the altcoin’s history. According to the expert, these funds will trade on Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE at the same time when they secure approval from the US SEC . Following years of waiting, XRP is about to enter the global ETF market, allowing direct institutional access to the altcoin. “Institutions aren’t gambling, they’re positioning before the next leg,” the expert stated. Thus, the expert believes that the token’s move is already being orchestrated underneath the surface.",XRP|CBOE|CryptoQuant|Nasdaq|nyse|ripple|Ripple Bull Winkle|The Crypto Blitz Show|US SEC|Woominky|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Spot ETFs|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 23:00:04

These shifts show a market focused on small upgrades and fast capital moves. But what if a project avoided this whole cycle by arriving fully built from the start with an enterprise-level design? That’s where Zero Knowledge Proof comes in! The project is quickly becoming what analysts now view as the best upcoming crypto in 2025. It did not rely on a future plan. It spent $100 million before its presale to create a complete privacy-first base layer that fixes major enterprise issues on Ethereum. This type of early commitment aimed at real market reach is rare, and the whitelist is open now. Zero Knowledge Proof Built Its System Before Any Sale! Analysts describe Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) as the first real Ethereum competitor with the strength to claim part of its market. While Ethereum’s open data limits enterprise use and its Layer 2 networks create a mixed experience, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) built a private and unified layer from the start. The team invested over $100 million before launching any sale, which is more than what Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano secured in their early stages. This heavy build-out is why many speak about 1000x future growth. This is far more than a concept. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) will begin its presale with $20 million in completed infrastructure. It also created $17 million in $249 Proof Pods that can earn revenue and will begin shipping five days after the presale auctions start. This ready-to-use setup offers direct use cases, managing private smart contracts, and high-scale AI computation for enterprise tasks. This working capability makes it a main choice for the best upcoming crypto coin of 2025. The upcoming presale uses a daily Initial Coin Auction (ICA) with a $50 starting point and a $50,000 upper limit so whales and VCs cannot control the supply. This layout, paired with its built system, places it in front as the strongest option for the best upcoming crypto 2025. The whitelist for these auctions is open now, giving the public a direct path into what may become the next major leap in crypto design. Whale Pressure Shapes the Hyperliquid Landscape Hyperliquid (HYPE) is now a major zone of activity for heavyweight traders, with its price support strengthened by deep-pocketed accumulation. The ongoing Hyperliquid (HYPE) whale activity has been striking. Venture capital group Paradigm recently staked $581 million in HYPE tokens, setting off a wave of similar moves from influential holders. One whale added $19 million in USDC to buy HYPE, while another opened a long position valued at $4.75 million. These large entries have helped create a strong price base for the token. The platform has turned into a live arena for opposite trading strategies. On-chain data highlights the size of these positions, such as one whale holding a $103 million long on ETH, while another set up a $9.02 million short position on UNI. This steady Hyperliquid (HYPE) whale activity keeps the market intense. With strong backing from institutions and large traders, HYPE has formed a firm zone between $34 and $36. It is now moving within the $37 to $41 range, with many watching closely to see if momentum builds toward the next key level at $50. ZkSync Turns to a New Utility Model ZkSync (ZKSYNC) is preparing for a major shift with a plan to rebuild its economic system. The new ZkSync (ZKSYNC) tokenomics plan aims to turn the ZK token into a core utility asset instead of a simple governance unit. Under this model, the network will collect revenue from protocol fees and enterprise licensing, using that value to push a new growth engine. A portion of the revenue will buy back ZK tokens, with a large share permanently burned. This reduces supply, while the remaining value supports staking rewards and ecosystem grants. This plan is not limited to early ideas. The team intends to begin a token staking pilot in Q4 2025, giving holders their first chance to engage with the redesigned model. This makes the upcoming November 17 token unlock, which will release 173.08 million ZK, a major moment for traders watching supply shifts. With the Fusaka Upgrade also scheduled for December 3 to improve compatibility across networks, attention is now on how the new ZkSync (ZKSYNC) tokenomics plan may attract deeper institutional interest. Final Thoughts The market continues to follow the intense Hyperliquid (HYPE) whale activity and the structural change introduced by the latest ZkSync (ZKSYNC) tokenomics plan. Both stories highlight how active platforms adjust their systems to compete and maintain their share of the market. But this close attention to updates can make it easy to overlook the arrival of a complete shift in direction. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is not refining an old model. It enters the space as a fully built network that aims to challenge Ethereum directly. With more than $100 million invested before its presale begins, it addresses the long-standing enterprise need for privacy at scale. This level of preparation and early financial backing places it firmly in discussions about the best upcoming crypto in 2025 . It is presented as a complete, enterprise-ready base layer rather than a token still under construction. The whitelist is open now.

Why is US AI Research Falling Behind China? Konwinski, speaking at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit, revealed shocking insights from top academic institutions. “If you talk to PhD students at Berkeley and Stanford in AI right now, they’ll tell you that they’ve read twice as many interesting AI ideas in the last year that were from Chinese companies than American companies,” he stated. This represents a dramatic shift in the global AI innovation landscape that few saw coming. The Open Source Advantage: China’s Secret Weapon While major US AI labs like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic keep their breakthroughs proprietary, China is embracing open source as a strategic advantage. Konwinski points to Chinese government support for open-source AI projects from labs like DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen, allowing rapid iteration and collective improvement. Chinese AI research is predominantly open source Government actively encourages collaboration Faster innovation through shared knowledge Broader adoption and implementation The Talent Drain: How US Companies Are Killing Innovation Major US AI companies are offering multimillion-dollar salaries that dwarf academic pay, creating what Konwinski calls “an existential threat” to the American AI research ecosystem. “We’re eating our corn seeds; the fountain is drying up,” he warned, emphasizing that this short-term strategy will hurt everyone in the long run. Why Open Source Drives Breakthrough AI Innovation Konwinski reminds us that generative AI itself emerged from the Transformer architecture – a breakthrough published in a freely available research paper. “The first nation that makes the next ‘Transformer architectural level’ breakthrough will have the advantage,” he emphasized, highlighting how open source accelerates discovery. Factor United States China Research Approach Mostly proprietary Predominantly open source Government Support Limited coordination Active encouragement Talent Distribution Concentrated in private companies Spread across academia and industry Knowledge Sharing Restricted Widespread collaboration The Democracy Risk: Why This Matters Beyond Technology Konwinski frames the issue in stark terms: this isn’t just about business competition. The shift in AI research dominance represents what he calls an “existential” threat to democracy itself. When one nation controls the most powerful AI technologies, it gains unprecedented global influence. Actionable Solutions: How the US Can Regain AI Dominance Konwinski’s venture fund Laude and the Laude Institute represent one approach – offering grants to researchers and supporting open source projects. But he argues much more needs to be done: Increase government funding for open AI research Create incentives for corporate-academic collaboration Protect researcher mobility and knowledge sharing Support open source AI infrastructure development The Five-Year Warning: What Happens if We Do Nothing “Fast forward five years, the big labs are gonna lose too,” Konwinski predicted. Without a thriving academic research community feeding innovation, even the best-funded private companies will eventually stagnate. The current model of hoarding talent and research is unsustainable for long-term AI innovation . FAQs: Understanding the US-China AI Competition What companies are leading China’s AI research? Chinese companies like Alibaba with their Qwen models and research labs like DeepSeek are at the forefront of China’s open source AI push. Which US companies are mentioned as keeping research proprietary? Major AI labs including OpenAI , Meta , and Anthropic are noted for their largely closed research approaches. Who is Andy Konwinski and what are his credentials? Andy Konwinski is co-founder of Databricks and co-founder of AI research and venture capital firm Laude, giving him unique insight into both commercial and research AI landscapes. What is the Laude Institute? The Laude Institute is an accelerator run by Konwinski that offers grants to researchers, supporting the kind of open academic collaboration he argues is essential for breakthrough AI innovation . How does this affect cryptocurrency and blockchain development? As AI increasingly integrates with blockchain technologies, whichever nation leads in AI research will also shape the future of decentralized systems and smart contract capabilities. Conclusion: A Call to Action for American AI Leadership The warning from Konwinski couldn’t be more clear: the United States stands at a crossroads in artificial intelligence. Our current path of proprietary research and talent hoarding is leading us toward second-place status in the most important technological revolution of our time. The solution lies in embracing the very open source principles that drove previous American technological dominance. As the crypto community understands better than anyone, open systems often defeat closed ones through network effects and collective intelligence. The choice is ours: continue down the path of slow decline or rediscover the collaborative spirit that made American technology the envy of the world.

Daily active addresses (DAAs), a key on-chain metric, have surged 40% over the past few days. This spike in on-chain activity suggests growing demand for XRP, especially as new institutional infrastructure comes online following the launch of the first XRP spot ETF on Thursday. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Eyes Critical Breakout as Bulls Target $2.70 for Full Trend Reversal XRP has surged 8.6% in the past 24 hours, backed by a 28% jump in trading volume, signaling renewed momentum. The $2.20 level has emerged as a critical support zone, repeatedly absorbing selling pressure during recent market dips. If XRP holds this line once more, bulls may push toward a decisive move above $2.70 — a breakout that could mark the beginning of a major trend reversal. The end of the U.S. government shutdown does not seem to be doing any favors to market sentiment, as the odds that the Fed will cut rates in December dropped dramatically from 91% to 50% at the time of writing. XRP needs to climb past $ 2.70 to confirm a bullish outlook, as that would indicate a breakout above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). If XRP breaks above $2.80, it could mark the beginning of a major trend reversal — setting the stage for a rally toward $3 or even $4 as bullish momentum accelerates. But while the market waits for confirmation, early investors are already piling into Pepenode ($PEPENODE), a fast-rising crypto presale that could offer even bigger upside. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Simplifies Meme Coin Mining with Virtual Rigs Mining crypto used to mean shelling out thousands for bulky gear. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) flips that model on its head with a fully virtual mining experience , no hardware needed. Just launch rigs, climb the leaderboard, and start earning top meme coins in a gamified ecosystem built for this bull cycle. Top miners in Pepenode climb the leaderboard to unlock surprise airdrops of tokens like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), keeping the competition fierce and the rewards exciting. Players can boost their virtual rigs by spending $PEPENODE tokens, and 70% of those tokens are permanently burned — creating long-term scarcity. As more players join and upgrade their setups, demand for $PEPENODE is expected to soar, potentially driving a major breakout once the presale wraps up. To buy $PEPENODE before the next price increase, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet . You can swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead. Buy $PEPENODE Here.

Bitcoin is down 6% in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum has plunged 10%, with capital flowing out of stocks and crypto as traders brace for a potential AI bubble unwind. Despite the selloff, core crypto fundamentals remain intact, suggesting that major coins could rebound once volatility cools. At the same time, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is flashing early breakout potential, with momentum building as its presale approaches completion and prepares for its first major market debut. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 14 November Liquidations in the cryptocurrency market have topped $1 billion in the past 24 hours , underlying the negativity that’s currently dominating investors. This is unlikely to last, however, and one coin positioned to perform well once markets rebound is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based mine-to-earn token that recently opened its presale. $PEPENODE Shielding you from all of the gimmicky memes out there. It's simple. 1. Mine 2. Earn https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/EAoo8XedQu — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 25, 2025 It has now raised $2.1 million in its ongoing presale, which is starting to gain some strong momentum after going live in late September. It seems that what’s attracting investors to PEPENODE is its unique mine-to-earn system, which will enable users to earn rewards without having to invest in traditional (and expensive) mining equipment. What PEPENODE does is provide investors with the ability to build their own virtual mining rigs, which they can then use to mine for tokens such as the original Pepe and Fartcoin. And what’s especially bullish is that users can buy more virtual nodes by spending PEPENODE itself, with more nodes equalling greater rewards. As such, there will be a real incentive to buy more PEPENODE, boosting the coin’s price over time. Staking Yields and How to Buy Early It’s also worth pointing out that holders will be able to stake the token, with PEPENODE currently offering a staking yield of 605%. We could therefore witness big demand for the token, which will launch after its presale closes. Investors can join this sale by going to the coin’s official website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. $PEPENODE is currently available at a price of $0.0011454, although this will rise every three days until the sale ends. Interested buyers should get moving, with the coin showing potential for a big rally once it lists, especially if the market has become more bullish by the time it launches.

Shetty was reportedly hired in March 2021 as chief financial officer (CFO) of a private software company that was in the process of raising multiple rounds of funding. Shetty commingled funds as CFO As part of his role, Shetty helped draft an investment policy statement that limited corporate cash to FDIC-insured bank and treasury accounts, a conservative approach intended to preserve capital as the business scaled. Despite this, prosecutors found that between April 1 and 12, 2022, after being informed the previous month that he would no longer continue as CFO due to performance concerns, Shetty secretly transferred $35,000,100 from the company’s account into an entity he had created, named HighTower Treasury. The firm’s board and executive team were reportedly unaware of the transfers. Shetty’s crypto gamble falls flat Once the funds were in HighTower Treasury, Shetty invested them into decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols that promised yields of roughly 20%. He was planning to pay his former employer 6% of the promised interest while keeping the rest for himself and his business partner. The illegal venture earned him and his partner about $133,000 in the first month. However, everything went on a downward spiral after that, and by May 13, 2022, the value of the investment had collapsed to near zero as the crypto markets plunged. After the loss, Shetty confessed to two colleagues and was fired immediately. The company reported the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ). Closing their arguments and speaking to the jury on what inspired Shetty to commit the crime, the prosecutor stated that it was “Greed – to line his own pockets. That is what explains his lying, sneaking around, and telling half-truths.” Trial and conviction The nine-day jury trial concluded on 7 November 2025, and after roughly ten hours of deliberation, the jury returned a guilty verdict. Shetty faces sentencing on 11 February 2026 and may be looking at up to 20 years in prison because wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of that same number of years of imprisonment. U.S. Attorney Neil Floyd said, “This defendant exploited his position of power and trust in an attempt to profit from his crime and then lied to cover it up.” The fact that Shetty helped author the company’s conservative investment policy and then acted in direct violation of it also shows how formal controls are only as good as the integrity and oversight of those who implement them. From the crypto angle, the case also speaks to the danger of overleveraging into DeFi protocols promising aggressive yields , only to see the value vanish due to the volatility, the infamous drawback that has dogged the crypto market since day one.

As of November 14, 2025, the asset has declined by 1.92% within 24 hours, moving from a recent peak of $2.52 to an intraday low of $2.32. Despite this pullback, trading activity remained strong, recording approximately $7.3 billion in volume. The asset is still holding a slight gain of 2.9% over the past week, although its performance over the last two weeks shows a cumulative decline of 7.8%. Technical Overview: Critical Areas to Watch Current price action shows XRP trading close to a key technical threshold. The daily chart places the asset around $2.32, which is closely aligned with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level near $2.30. This region represents the first major area where buyers may attempt to stabilize the market after the recent decline. Should XRP fall below this zone, the next important level appears at roughly $2.21, which coincides with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement mark. A breakdown toward that level would signal weakening momentum and may expose the market to additional downward pressure. The support around $2.2172 is particularly important for establishing any meaningful shift in direction. Sustaining price action above this lower retracement increases the likelihood of buyers attempting to regain control, with the next significant resistance forming near the $2.50 region. A move back toward this range would indicate market stabilization after the recent volatility. Technical indicators reflect a mixed environment. The MACD line is currently positioned above the signal line, which generally indicates early signs of recovery. The histogram remains in positive territory, suggesting that downward momentum may be moderating. While this does not guarantee an immediate rally, it highlights the potential for a near-term price improvement if support levels remain intact.

According to Coinglass, approximately $28 million in XRP positions were liquidated over the last 24 hours. Notably, long positions represented the majority of these expirations, with losses totaling $24.94 million, compared to $3.06 million from short positions. This imbalance shows that traders anticipating a continued upward move were significantly impacted by the price correction. Shorter-term intervals show similarly strong liquidation activity. Over one hour, about $1 million in total liquidations were recorded, split between $675,410 in short positions and $328,910 in long positions. The four-hour window produced an even larger figure, $8.54 million, with long positions once again representing the bulk of forced closures. The concentration of long liquidations indicates a shift in sentiment as traders adjust their expectations following the asset’s rapid decline. If XRP continues consolidating near current levels, market participants are likely to remain cautious until clear signs of recovery emerge and the critical support region demonstrates durability.

According to recent analysis, the current cryptocurrency landscape shows surprising resilience that contradicts typical bear market patterns. Let’s explore why experts believe we’re experiencing something entirely different. What Exactly Defines a Bear Market? CryptoQuant contributor CrazzyBlockk provides clear insights into what separates normal market corrections from genuine bear markets. A true bear market typically emerges when panic selling becomes widespread, often triggered by short-term investors facing substantial losses between 20-40%. This creates a domino effect that drives prices significantly lower. However, the current situation tells a different story. Recent data reveals that short-term investors are experiencing much smaller losses, ranging from just 5-13%. This crucial difference suggests we’re not witnessing the panic-driven selloff that characterizes actual bear markets. Why Current Conditions Don’t Match Bear Market Patterns The absence of several key bear market indicators provides compelling evidence that we’re in a different phase entirely. Consider these important factors: Limited panic selling among short-term investors Moderate loss ranges well below bear market thresholds Sustained investor confidence despite price fluctuations Healthy market fundamentals supporting current valuations These conditions align more closely with what analysts call a mid-cycle correction. This represents a healthy market adjustment rather than the beginning of a prolonged downturn. How Can Investors Navigate This Market Phase? Understanding the difference between a correction and a bear market provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making. Mid-cycle corrections typically offer excellent opportunities for long-term investors to accumulate positions at favorable prices. Key strategies during this phase include: Focusing on fundamental analysis rather than short-term price movements Dollar-cost averaging into strong projects Maintaining a diversified portfolio Avoiding emotional trading decisions based on temporary dips Remember that market corrections serve an important purpose in shaking out weak hands and establishing stronger support levels for future growth. The Big Picture: What This Means for Crypto Investors The analysis strongly suggests we’re experiencing normal market behavior rather than the beginning of a bear market. This perspective becomes crucial when making investment decisions and setting realistic expectations. Historical patterns show that mid-cycle corrections often precede significant upward movements. By recognizing these patterns, investors can maintain perspective during temporary market weakness and avoid making fear-based decisions that could undermine long-term strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What’s the main difference between a correction and a bear market? A correction represents a temporary price decline of 10-20%, while a bear market involves sustained declines of 20% or more over an extended period, typically accompanied by widespread pessimism. How long do mid-cycle corrections typically last? Mid-cycle corrections in cryptocurrency markets usually last several weeks to a few months, though duration can vary based on market conditions and external factors. Should I change my investment strategy during a correction? Corrections often present buying opportunities for long-term investors, but it’s crucial to maintain your risk management strategy and only invest what you can afford to lose. What signs would indicate we’re entering a true bear market? Key indicators include sustained losses above 20% for most investors, prolonged negative sentiment, declining trading volumes, and breaking of major support levels. How reliable are these market phase classifications? While helpful for context, market phases should inform rather than dictate investment decisions. Always combine technical analysis with fundamental research. Can corrections turn into bear markets? Yes, if negative catalysts emerge or market conditions deteriorate significantly. However, most corrections resolve positively within the broader market cycle. Found this analysis helpful? Share these insights with fellow investors who might be worrying about market conditions.

Investors looking for the top altcoins to buy this week face growing pressure to identify projects that combine momentum, strong fundamentals, and structured presale mechanics. With token supplies dwindling at ultra‑low entry prices, early participants can potentially capture remarkable returns if the market reacts favorably. Beyond mere hype, the presale stage, scarcity model, and community adoption are becoming critical success factors for new crypto projects. Savvy investors are analyzing metrics like token distribution, holder growth, staking rewards, and projected listing prices to make well‑timed moves that could significantly outperform established coins over the coming months. Enter a new era of crypto investing where measurable tokenomics, presale stages, and community engagement determine which projects gain serious traction. Traditional, excitement-driven decisions are giving way to data-backed strategies that emphasize long-term value creation. This article highlights five crypto coins set to explode, focusing on their presale dynamics, staking incentives, and liquidity structures. Among these, one project emerges as a particularly compelling opportunity, blending aggressive ROI potential with proven growth mechanics. Readers will gain insights into key indicators such as scarcity progression, listing price milestones, and APY-based rewards, helping them navigate volatile markets while aiming for strong upside. These insights are essential for identifying the top altcoins to buy this week. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL) – Top Altcoins to Buy This Week Promises Structured Growth Among the top altcoins to buy this week , BullZilla (BZIL) blazes ahead. Currently on Stage 10 (Castle Bravo), pricing at $0.00025239. To date, the presale has raised over $1 M, boasts over 3,500 token holders, and has sold over 31 billion tokens. Early joiners at Stage 10B already enjoy a current ROI of around 1,988.6%, and those who joined even earlier are at 4,289.4%. A $1,000 investment at $0.00025239 earns roughly 3.962 million BZIL tokens today. The next price step (Stage 10C) moves from $0.00025239 to $0.00025906 (2.64% increase). What sets BullZilla apart: a presale that uses a structured stage model with built-in scarcity. A strong narrative exists not only around growth but around the upcoming listing price of $0.00527. Frequently Asked Questions About Bullzilla Presale What makes BullZilla a strong presale investment? BullZilla’s multi-stage presale, low entry price, and token scarcity, combined with staking incentives, community growth, and potential upcoming listings, position it as one of the top altcoins to buy this week for significant ROI opportunities. How much ROI can early BullZilla investors expect? Early participants in Stage 10B have already seen ROI surpass 4,200%, with future stages expected to deliver further gains, illustrating why BZIL presale investors are closely watching the project for potentially exponential returns on timely investments. How does the presale stage affect BullZilla’s token value? Each presale stage reduces token availability, increasing scarcity and raising potential listing prices. Stage progression directly influences ROI for early participants, creating strong incentives for investors to join promptly and maximize their BullZilla presale rewards. 2. Ripple ($XRP) – Established Asset Ready for Upside When exploring the top altcoins to buy this week, Ripple (XRP) remains a familiar but still significant candidate. Unlike early‑stage presales, XRP is a well‑established token with deep institutional relationships. Key indicators include regulatory clarity (in major markets), an active developer ecosystem, and broad exchange listings. For investors seeking projects beyond speculative hype, Ripple offers a large‑cap alternative. While ROI potential is more modest than that of micro‑cap presales, the risk profile is relatively lower. Metrics to watch: transaction volume, new partnerships, on‑chain staking (where applicable), and overall token circulation trends. XRP’s listing price dynamics and its role in cross‑border payments may drive renewed interest. 3. MoonBull ($MOBU) – Meme Mechanics Meet DeFi Structure Among the top altcoins to buy this week, MoonBull (MOBU) is carving out a niche where meme culture meets structured DeFi.

Such mechanics offer a more sustainable path to value growth than pure hype coins. As industry analysts note, presales built around clear mechanics are outperforming unstructured launches. Investors looking at the top altcoins to buy this week might view MoonBull as a strong mid‑tier risk/reward balance: less “safe” than large caps like XRP, but less speculative than brand‑new micro‑presales. Frequently Asked Questions About MoonBull What makes MoonBull staking unique?

As the original cryptocurrency, BTC benefits from widespread adoption, high liquidity, and a robust institutional presence that underpins market confidence. Key indicators for investors include on-chain metrics such as hash rate, wallet activity, and whale accumulation trends, which often signal upcoming price movements. While BTC’s ROI potential may not match micro-cap presales, it offers stability and credibility unmatched by newer projects. For portfolio diversification, Bitcoin provides a foundation of safety, allowing investors to pair it with higher-risk altcoins. Its network security, capped supply, and continuous development make BTC a perennial choice for both new and seasoned crypto participants. 7. Ethereum ($ETH): The Smart Contract Leader Ethereum (ETH) remains a top altcoin to buy this week thanks to its unmatched smart contract ecosystem and DeFi dominance. ETH’s strength stems from its broad adoption across decentralized applications, NFTs, and layer‑2 scaling solutions, which drive long-term demand for the token. Investors track key indicators like active developer activity, gas usage, staking participation, and upcoming protocol upgrades, which can significantly influence price and adoption. ETH staking provides annualized yields while reducing circulating supply, creating added scarcity and upside potential. Compared with newer presales, Ethereum balances growth opportunities with stability. Its continuous upgrades, including energy-efficient consensus mechanisms and interoperability improvements, make it a compelling choice for investors seeking both sustainable returns and exposure to foundational blockchain technology. 8. Solana ($SOL): Big‑Cap Platform with Upside Potential Among the top altcoins to buy this week, Solana (SOL) stands out as a platform-level investment rather than a speculative presale. Its high throughput, low transaction costs, and fast block times have attracted a thriving ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFTs, and decentralized applications. Investors evaluating SOL monitor key indicators, such as network growth, user adoption, daily transaction volume, and active wallets, alongside ecosystem expansions, including new dApps, cross-chain bridges, and partnerships. Staking participation and whale accumulation metrics provide insight into long-term confidence in the token. While Solana’s upside may not match ultra-low-entry presales, it offers stability, lower volatility, and meaningful exposure to the infrastructure layer of crypto, making it a strategic choice for balanced portfolios seeking sustainable growth. Conclusion At the same time, Ripple, MoonBull, La Culex, and Solana diversify the risk‑reward spectrum. BullZilla roars among the top altcoins to buy this week with its structured presale mechanics, rising holder base, and early ROI that already impresses. For investors seeking bold upside, its listing target of $0.00527 and current price of $0.00025239 offer a clear jump‑off point. Ripple offers institutional strength, Solana offers platform exposure, while MoonBull and La Culex bring meme‑coin upside wrapped in tokenomics. If a $1,000 investment could turn into $100,000 within a few months, BullZilla currently stands at the head of the table. But success hinges on timing, execution, and market conditions. Investors should verify official links, perform due diligence, and understand that high upside comes with high risk.

According to a statement from Google on Friday, November 14, this investment is expected to continue through 2027. One of the data centers will be located in Armstrong County, which is in the Texas Panhandle, while two others will be situated in Haskell County, near Abilene. Moreover, one of the facilities in Haskell will work in conjunction with a new solar and battery energy storage plant to help alleviate strain on the power grid. “This investment will create thousands of jobs, offer skills training for college students and electrical apprentices, and speed up energy affordability projects across Texas,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, during an event near Dallas where Google already operates two other data centers. Google eyes Texas for expansion with substantial investments in the state Texas has become a prime location for data centers because companies are drawn to its lower energy costs, extensive available land areas, and a state government that supports infrastructure for the growing artificial intelligence sector. In sharing its plans , Google highlighted its dedication to adding new energy resources to the grid, covering operational costs, and backing community energy efficiency programs. Additionally, the company announced that an electrical training program would increase the number of apprentices in Texas with support from Google.org’s AI Opportunity Fund. During an event with Pichai, Texas Governor Greg Abbott commented on the topic of discussion. Abbott predicted that Texas would become the main hub for Google’s AI data centers. He argued that companies can come to Texas and carry out their operations knowing that the state acts quickly in business. Meanwhile, after-hours trading, Alphabet’s stock increased by 1.7%, following a closing price of $276.41 in New York. It is worth noting that Texas is also attracting commitments from other businesses. Texas positions itself as a hub for tech investment Texas has solidified its position as a hub for tech-related investments. To support this claim, sources noted that Anthropic announced plans to invest $50 billion in data centers across the US, including locations in New York and Texas, which offer ample land and lower energy costs, earlier this week. The facilities, which are part of the company’s broader effort to remain competitive in the AI infrastructure market, are being developed in collaboration with Fluidstack. The firm is targeting its enterprise clients, the ones responsible for most of its revenue, and these new sites are built to match the size of that demand. Moreover, the first data center being developed by the Stargate project, supported by OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT), Oracle Corporation, and SoftBank Group Corporation, is located in Abilene, Texas. Company leaders have indicated that they will establish more facilities in the state. On the other hand, Meta Platforms Inc. is constructing a new data center in Texas, capable of generating a gigawatt of power. To put it into perspective, a gigawatt can simultaneously supply power to 750,000 people. Additionally, Microsoft Corp. signed a nearly $10 billion agreement earlier this month for five years of computing capacity in Texas. Fermi Inc., a real estate investment trust co-founded by Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas and energy secretary under President Donald Trump, also revealed plans to construct four nuclear power reactors in the state for a private data center campus. As for Google’s plan, analysts noted that the tech giant typically makes significant spending promises, and this year, an investment of more than $90 billion in capital expenses is expected. The figure is much greater than originally thought, with the majority of the money coming from servers, customized chips, and new data centers to support its AI and cloud services.

The company’s mNAV multiple just dipped below the critical threshold of 1, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency investment community. This significant development raises important questions about investor confidence and Bitcoin valuation metrics. What Exactly is the mNAV Multiple? The mNAV multiple serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency investment firms. It measures a company’s market capitalization against the total value of its Bitcoin holdings. When this mNAV multiple falls below 1, it indicates the market values the company less than the Bitcoin it owns. This mNAV multiple calculation provides clear insights into market sentiment. Why Should Investors Care About This mNAV Multiple Drop? The recent decline in Strategy’s mNAV multiple below 1 signals several potential concerns: Weakening investor confidence in the company’s management Potential debt or liquidity issues affecting market perception Sustainability concerns about long-term operations Market skepticism about future growth prospects This mNAV multiple movement often precedes significant market adjustments. What Triggered the mNAV Multiple Decline? Market analysts point to Strategy’s substantial Bitcoin transfer as a key factor. The company moved 58,915 BTC, valued at approximately $6.04 billion, to a new address. Such large transactions typically influence the mNAV multiple as investors reassess risk factors and company stability. How Does the mNAV Multiple Affect Your Investment Strategy? Understanding the mNAV multiple helps investors make informed decisions. When the mNAV multiple drops below 1, it may indicate: Potential buying opportunities if the company fundamentals remain strong Need for closer monitoring of company financial health Possible market overreaction creating temporary undervaluation Important signals about broader cryptocurrency market trends What’s Next for Strategy’s mNAV Multiple? Market watchers will closely monitor how Strategy’s mNAV multiple evolves in coming weeks. The company’s response to market concerns and its Bitcoin management strategy will significantly impact whether the mNAV multiple recovers or continues facing pressure. This mNAV multiple situation serves as a valuable case study for cryptocurrency investors. Key Takeaways for Smart Investors The mNAV multiple provides essential insights beyond simple stock prices. This recent mNAV multiple movement below 1 emphasizes the importance of: Regularly monitoring key financial metrics like the mNAV multiple Understanding the relationship between Bitcoin holdings and company valuation Recognizing early warning signs in cryptocurrency investments Maintaining diversified investment strategies Frequently Asked Questions What does mNAV multiple below 1 mean? When the mNAV multiple falls below 1, it means the company’s market capitalization is less than the value of its Bitcoin holdings, indicating potential undervaluation or market concerns. How often does Strategy’s mNAV multiple change? The mNAV multiple fluctuates daily based on both Bitcoin price movements and changes in the company’s stock price, making it a dynamic metric. Is a low mNAV multiple always bad? Not necessarily. While a low mNAV multiple can signal concerns, it may also present buying opportunities if company fundamentals remain strong. How can I track the mNAV multiple? You can monitor the mNAV multiple through financial data platforms, cryptocurrency analytics websites, and company financial reports. What other companies use mNAV multiple? Several cryptocurrency and Bitcoin-focused investment firms utilize similar metrics to assess their premium value relative to digital asset holdings. Can the mNAV multiple predict Bitcoin prices? While the mNAV multiple reflects market sentiment, it’s not a direct predictor of Bitcoin prices but rather indicates how the market values companies holding Bitcoin.

His comments came during a recent discussion with CoinDesk, where he evaluated the token’s progression and the factors that supported its development. Novogratz noted that only a small number of cryptocurrencies have passed the point where people rely on them as a monetary instrument rather than a speculative asset. He stated that XRP is one of the few that has accomplished this transition, a result he considers unusual within the broader market. He explained that creating a digital asset that functions as money is a complex task involving technology, long-term stability, and user conviction. According to him, XRP’s ability to cross this threshold distinguishes it within the industry. Novogratz acknowledged that the achievement was unexpected even to him, despite his firm’s early exposure to Ripple as an investor. ""How do you turn something from being a token into money?… XRP has done it."" Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz ( @novogratz ) called it early. Today, the market confirmed it: The $XRPC ETF has just broken BSOL’s record for the biggest day-one debut of the year. Thank you @OwlTing … pic.twitter.com/KdqjFinmsO — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) November 13, 2025 Early Doubts and How They Changed Over Time During the interview, Novogratz reflected on the skepticism he previously shared with many critics. He recalled concerns about XRP’s architecture, governance, and the degree of decentralization associated with the network. These criticisms were common among early crypto adopters who believed that only certain models of blockchain systems could succeed. However, he stated that the issues he once emphasized eventually became less significant than he anticipated. Over time, Ripple’s corporate development, combined with consistent user commitment, reshaped his view. Novogratz emphasized that while Ripple’s growth played an important role, it was not the only factor that shifted perception. Community Influence and Its Impact on XRP’s Status According to Novogratz, one of the decisive elements behind XRP’s evolution was the persistence of its global community. He observed that XRP supporters maintained long-term confidence in the asset throughout market downturns, regulatory disputes, and extended periods of criticism from industry commentators. He argued that this sustained commitment strengthened the token’s position and contributed to the point where many users treat XRP as a dependable monetary instrument. Novogratz stated that community strength is now a significant driver of success within the crypto sector and that XRP is a clear example of this dynamic. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His remarks are consistent with previous statements in which he conceded that his early assessment of XRP’s potential was inaccurate. He has also compared the discipline of the XRP community to that of major crypto groups, highlighting how collective confidence can influence the use and perceived value of digital assets. Broader Context and Industry Implications Novogratz pointed out that communities can exert substantial influence over how digital assets are adopted, interpreted, and valued. He noted that similar patterns are evident in other industries, where strong user groups shape how companies or products are perceived. In his view, XRP’s trajectory shows that community-driven support can elevate a token from speculative trading to practical monetary use. He also emphasized that the strength of a token’s user base can at times outweigh traditional evaluations based on network structure or design. XRP’s continued presence in the market, particularly during periods of regulatory scrutiny, demonstrates, in his view, that sustained community confidence can enhance longevity and relevance. Novogratz’s latest assessment comes at a time when XRP-related investment products, including recently launched exchange-traded funds, are gaining traction and recording significant interest in early 2025. His comments are likely to be seen as notable recognition by supporters who have long argued that XRP has maintained a distinct position within the digital asset market.

Solana URPD Reveals Supply Chasm Below $144 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Solana support is looking from an on-chain lens. In on-chain analysis, the potential of any price level to act as support or resistance lies in the amount of coins that investors last purchased at it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $98,000 As HODLer Selling Accelerates The reasoning behind this is that holders look at their cost basis as a special level and are sensitive to retests of it. The more holders that have their cost basis at a particular level, the larger the reaction from a retest could theoretically be. As for what the nature of this reaction is likely to be, it comes down to the direction of the retest, as well as the mood in the market. When the retest occurs from above, holders might decide to accumulate more, thinking that the decline is a temporary dip and they would return in profit again. Retests of major supply levels from above can, for this reason, provide support to the cryptocurrency. Similarly, retests in the opposite direction may be met with resistance, as holders panic exit at their break-even level, fearing going underwater again. To showcase how the supply cost basis distribution on the Solana network is like right now, Martinez has shared the data of the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) from Glassnode. As is visible in the above graph, the largest Solana supply zones on this indicator are all located above $144. Below this level, the cryptocurrency has relatively thin clusters. “There’s barely any meaningful demand until $24,” noted the analyst. SOL has already started slipping under the last major support level of $144, so it only remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency will develop in the near future, considering the lack of any meaningful on-chain support cushions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Most Fearful Since March: Is A Bottom Near? In a separate X post, Martinez has also shared the URPD data for Bitcoin. Unlike Solana, the number one cryptocurrency’s supply distribution is more even, meaning the asset has levels to rely on below the current range. In particular, $82,000 and $67,000 are two levels below $95,000 that hold the cost basis of a significant amount of supply, and thus, could potentially be support barriers on the way down. SOL Price Solana dropped to $135 during its latest plunge, but the coin has since recovered back to $141.

According to co-CEO Arjun Sethi, the exchange is “financially sound” and holds enough capital on its balance sheet as a private company. Kraken has raised $530 million since its 2011 founding, with a $500 million round in September that valued the firm at $15 billion. “We have enough capital on our balance sheet as a private company,” Sethi said. “We don’t race to the door as quickly as possible.” Company Says It Has Plenty Of Capital Sethi told Yahoo Finance that Kraken won’t rush things up just because peers are going public. Reports have disclosed that other crypto firms have seized the moment; still, Kraken’s leaders say they prefer to set their own timetable. A Wave Of Crypto Listings Has Shifted Investor Views Several rival businesses have listed this year, and that has helped push investor interest in crypto firms. Circle’s IPO attracted attention after shares jumped over 160% to above $83, and a later rally briefly boosted the price past $260 before cooling back to about $82. Grayscale filed to debut in the US as others, including Gemini, Bullish and eToro, completed listings. Custody firm BitGo also filed to go public in September. Clues On Profitability Sethi argued that early movers are educating investors on margins and business models. He said seeing public filings helps buyers and sellers better judge which revenue streams matter. Market Drop Tests Exchanges’ Fortitude Bitcoin has slid amid a wider market wobble. Based on reports, the coin fell over 4% in the past day to near $97,000, marking more than a 22% pullback from a peak above $126,000 in early October. Crypto-related stocks also weakened. Cipher Mining sank 14%, Riot Platforms and Hut 8 each fell 13%, and MARA Holdings and Bitmine Immersion slipped over 10%. Coinbase and Strategy dropped around 6%. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 15, hitting seven-month lows as investor mood turned cautious. Kraken Downplays Short-Term Price Swings Sethi did not sound alarmed by the drop, saying the long-term reasons people buy Bitcoin or Ethereum matter more than brief moves. He emphasized looking at the “thesis” behind assets rather than chasing daily swings. That stance was presented as part of a wider company approach that favors steady risk management over reactive moves. No Rush Despite Policy Signals And Peer Listings Based on reports, the friendlier regulatory posture from US President Donald Trump’s administration and improving market conditions have prompted some firms to go public. Still, Kraken’s leadership says timing should fit its own targets. Bloomberg reported earlier that the company had been lining up an IPO possibly as early as the first quarter of 2026, but Kraken’s co-CEO stressed there is no FOMO driving the decision.

The firm named Chi Tsang as the new Chief Executive Officer, and he now sits on the Board of Directors. The move represents a drastic shift for the company as it transforms from a mining-oriented company to an enormous digital asset treasury. Alongside Tsang’s appointment, BitMin e appointed three new independent board members: Robert Sechan, Olivia Howe, and Jason Edgeworth. All appointments took effect immediately. The outgoing CEO, Jonathan Bates, said the transition from a digital miner to a publicly listed entity and making BitMine the world’s largest holding company of Ethereum has been “an incredible journey.” He stepped aside with the assumption that the new heads were equipped to further the company. Chairman Thomas “Tom” Lee stated that the new team, composed of veterans from technology, decentralized finance, and global financial markets, would lead the program. He noted that BitMine was emerging at what he described as a critical moment, when Ethereum was beginning to reshape the behaviour of capital markets. Lee added that he believed the company was now positioned to act as a point of contact between traditional finance and what he referred to as the “Supercycle Ethereum era.” The new CEO, Chi Tsang, echoed this. He likened the current revolution in blockchain to the explosion of mobile phones and the internet in the 1990s. The strength of BitMine’s position on Ethereum and its credibility among Wall Street and the crypto community make it a potential global financial institution based on the creation of digital assets in the future, he said. Ether Holdings surge as the company changes course BitMine’s new leadership comes as the company has posted a steep increase in its Ethereum holdings. Currently managing over 3.5 million ETH, representing nearly 3 percent of the total Ethereum supply. All this makes BitMine one of the biggest single holders of Ether on Earth. The firm’s crypto, cash, and long-shot investments account for a total value of nearly $ 13.2 billion. Its Treasury also includes roughly 400 million dollars of unencumbered cash, some Bitcoin, and an array of early-stage “moonshot” assets. Its recent accumulation pace has been one of the highlights — or at least a way of celebrating it. In just a week, the company acquired more than 110,000 ETH — nearly one-third of the previous week’s buying rate. BitMine has also been open about its goal: to own roughly 5 percent of the current circulating Ethereum. It’s an aggressive move that reveals something about what is happening beyond the gold miner. BitMine is increasingly becoming something akin to an asset bank or Treasury, with some individuals holding terms of 5 to 10 years, effectively serving as a long-term crypto reserve. Ethereum woes test BitMine’s market resilience Despite the company’s high-profile strategy, BitMine’s share price has come under pressure over the past few days. Such a drop comes along with broader declines in Ethereum’s value. Investors have described companies with substantial crypto treasuries as having better market sensitivity. As crypto prices diminish, the market value of these companies frequently also suffers an accelerated loss. Investors will assess whether the leadership change will give BitMine’s strategic direction new life or inject some immediate risk into the short term. Analysts are also questioning whether BitMine’s explosive Ethereum accumulation is sustainable amid a market that’s far from steady-state and heavily regulated. Still, the company’s board members sounded optimistic. Robert Sechan commended Tom Lee’s longstanding record of spotting leading technological and financial trends early. Olivia Howe said she has watched BitMine grow from an obscure company into the world’s largest Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury. Jason Edgeworth emphasized that he considers BitMine a major player in Ethereum infrastructure and still sees it as driving further shareholder value. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The market’s emotional barometer just hit its lowest point since February, plunging to a worrying 10 points. This dramatic drop signals that extreme fear has gripped cryptocurrency investors worldwide, creating both challenges and opportunities for savvy traders. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional thermometer. It calculates investor sentiment using six key factors that reveal how traders truly feel about cryptocurrency prices. The index ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents maximum fear and 100 indicates extreme greed. Currently sitting at just 10 points, we’re witnessing one of the most fearful market environments in recent months. The index components break down as follows: Market volatility: 25% weight Trading volume: 25% weight Social media mentions: 15% weight Market surveys: 15% weight Bitcoin dominance: 10% weight Google search trends: 10% weight Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear Levels? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits such low numbers, it often creates contrarian opportunities. Historically, extreme fear periods have frequently preceded market rebounds. However, this current reading also suggests heightened risk and potential for further price declines. Understanding these sentiment extremes helps you make informed decisions rather than emotional ones. Market veterans know that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides valuable context beyond price charts. It helps answer crucial questions: Are we approaching a market bottom? Is this panic selling or rational caution? The current 10-point reading clearly indicates widespread panic among cryptocurrency participants. How Can You Use This Information Strategically? Monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index gives you an edge in market timing. When fear dominates, consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into quality projects Setting limit orders at key support levels Diversifying across different cryptocurrency sectors Maintaining cash reserves for potential opportunities Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures current sentiment, not future performance. While extreme fear often precedes buying opportunities, it doesn’t guarantee immediate rebounds. Use this tool as part of a comprehensive strategy rather than your sole decision-maker. What Historical Patterns Reveal About Fear Cycles Previous instances where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reached similar lows provide valuable lessons. In February 2025, when the index last touched these levels, markets experienced significant volatility before establishing stronger foundations. Studying these patterns helps you understand that extreme fear periods, while uncomfortable, are normal market cycles. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 10 represents more than just numbers—it captures the collective psychology of millions of investors. This emotional extreme often creates the best long-term entry points for patient investors who can withstand short-term uncertainty. FAQs: Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index What time frame does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index cover? The index updates daily and reflects current market sentiment based on real-time data from multiple sources. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price movements? While it doesn’t predict exact prices, extreme readings often signal potential trend reversals or continuations. How accurate is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? It provides reliable sentiment measurements but should complement other analysis tools rather than replace them. Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? You can find daily updates on Alternative.me and various cryptocurrency data platforms. Does the index work for altcoins or just Bitcoin? While Bitcoin-heavy, it reflects overall cryptocurrency market sentiment affecting all digital assets. How often should I check the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Regular monitoring helps, but avoid overreacting to daily fluctuations—focus on broader trends. Share This Market Insight Found this analysis of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

Are you wondering where Bitcoin might be heading next? According to Ledn’s Chief Investment Officer John Glover, the cryptocurrency could experience a significant downturn, potentially falling to $84,000. This surprising Bitcoin price prediction comes from detailed technical analysis that suggests we might see some turbulence ahead in the crypto markets. What Does This Bitcoin Price Prediction Mean for Investors? John Glover’s analysis points to a potential drop in Bitcoin’s value based on key technical indicators. The expert explains that since Bitcoin breached the $100,000 support level, which represented a 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, the path has opened to the next major support at $84,000. This Bitcoin price prediction isn’t all doom and gloom though – Glover anticipates Bitcoin will likely reclaim the $100,000 mark before falling below $90,000. Why Should You Pay Attention to This Analysis? Technical analysis provides valuable insights for cryptocurrency investors. The current Bitcoin price prediction suggests we’re entering a corrective phase that could extend until summer 2026. Here are the key factors supporting this outlook: Fibonacci retracement levels indicating support breakdown Historical price pattern analysis Market momentum indicators Long-term trend projections How Can You Navigate This Potential Market Shift? While this Bitcoin price prediction might concern some investors, it’s important to remember that market corrections are normal in cryptocurrency cycles. The analysis suggests this could be a healthy pullback before the next major upward movement. Understanding these patterns helps investors make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions to market volatility. What Timeframe Are We Looking At? The current Bitcoin price prediction indicates this corrective phase could last until summer 2026. This extended timeframe suggests we’re looking at a gradual adjustment rather than a sudden crash. Investors should consider this when planning their strategies and remember that cryptocurrency markets often move in multi-year cycles. Key Takeaways from This Bitcoin Price Prediction Glover’s analysis provides several important insights for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This Bitcoin price prediction highlights the importance of technical analysis in understanding market movements. The potential drop to $84,000 represents a significant support level that could provide buying opportunities for long-term investors. Meanwhile, the expected reclaim of $100,000 before further decline suggests we might see some volatility in the coming months. Frequently Asked Questions What is Fibonacci retracement in Bitcoin trading? Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool that uses horizontal lines to indicate potential support and resistance levels based on Fibonacci numbers. How reliable are these Bitcoin price predictions? While technical analysis provides valuable insights, all cryptocurrency predictions should be considered as educated estimates rather than guarantees. Should I sell my Bitcoin based on this prediction? Investment decisions should be based on your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall market research rather than any single prediction. What other factors could affect Bitcoin’s price? Bitcoin’s price can be influenced by regulatory developments, institutional adoption, macroeconomic factors, and technological advancements. How long do cryptocurrency correction phases typically last? Correction phases can vary significantly, from several months to multiple years, depending on market conditions and broader economic factors. What support levels should I watch for Bitcoin? Key support levels to monitor include $100,000, $90,000, and the predicted $84,000 level mentioned in this analysis. Found this Bitcoin price prediction analysis helpful?

Michael Saylor just revealed MicroStrategy’s groundbreaking approach to building their cryptocurrency reserves. The company’s CEO announced through his X platform that they’ve executed their Bitcoin buying strategy every single day this week, demonstrating unprecedented commitment to digital asset acquisition. What Makes This Bitcoin Buying Strategy So Revolutionary? MicroStrategy’s daily purchasing approach represents a significant shift in how corporations view cryptocurrency investment. Instead of waiting for market dips or specific entry points, the company has adopted a consistent accumulation model. This Bitcoin buying strategy eliminates timing risks and reinforces their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition. The company now holds one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries globally. Their systematic approach demonstrates how institutional investors can implement dollar-cost averaging at scale. This method smooths out price volatility while steadily increasing their cryptocurrency exposure. How Does Daily Bitcoin Acquisition Impact Market Sentiment? When a publicly traded company commits to daily Bitcoin purchases, it sends powerful signals across financial markets. This consistent Bitcoin buying strategy creates several important effects: Reduced volatility through continuous demand Increased institutional confidence in cryptocurrency markets Demonstration of long-term commitment beyond speculative trading Validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset Market analysts observe that such persistent accumulation strategies help stabilize Bitcoin’s price during turbulent periods. The knowledge that major buyers remain active provides psychological support to retail and institutional investors alike. What Challenges Does This Bitcoin Strategy Overcome? Implementing a daily Bitcoin buying strategy at the corporate level presents unique challenges that MicroStrategy has successfully navigated. The company has developed sophisticated execution methods to minimize market impact while maximizing accumulation efficiency. Regulatory compliance remains paramount, and the company’s transparent reporting demonstrates how corporations can integrate cryptocurrency into traditional financial frameworks. Their approach provides a blueprint for other companies considering similar treasury diversification strategies. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to This Approach? MicroStrategy’s consistent Bitcoin buying strategy offers valuable lessons for all cryptocurrency investors. The company’s success with this method highlights several key principles: Consistency matters more than timing in long-term wealth building Transparent strategy execution builds investor confidence Corporate adoption drives mainstream cryptocurrency acceptance Strategic accumulation outperforms emotional trading decisions This disciplined approach to Bitcoin acquisition demonstrates how removing emotion from investment decisions can yield superior results over time. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The sustained implementation of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying strategy signals growing institutional maturity in cryptocurrency markets. As more companies observe their success, we can expect increased corporate adoption of similar accumulation methods. This trend could accelerate Bitcoin’s transition from speculative asset to established treasury reserve. The daily purchasing pattern establishes a foundation for more stable price discovery and reduced manipulation susceptibility. Conclusion: A Blueprint for Institutional Crypto Adoption Michael Saylor’s revelation about MicroStrategy’s daily Bitcoin purchases represents more than just corporate news—it provides a working model for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Their systematic Bitcoin buying strategy demonstrates how companies can responsibly integrate digital assets into their balance sheets while maintaining regulatory compliance and shareholder transparency. The consistent execution of this approach during both market highs and lows shows genuine conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As other corporations observe MicroStrategy’s success, we may witness a fundamental shift in how businesses approach treasury management and asset diversification in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin has MicroStrategy purchased through this strategy? While exact daily amounts vary, MicroStrategy has accumulated one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holdings globally through consistent purchasing over several years. Why does MicroStrategy buy Bitcoin daily instead of in larger batches? The daily approach minimizes market impact, reduces timing risks, and implements dollar-cost averaging at the institutional level. Does this buying strategy affect Bitcoin’s price significantly? While individual daily purchases may not move markets dramatically, the consistent demand provides underlying support and reduces volatility. Can individual investors replicate this strategy? Yes, retail investors can implement similar dollar-cost averaging approaches through recurring purchase features available on most cryptocurrency platforms. What regulatory considerations does MicroStrategy face with daily purchases? The company maintains strict compliance with securities regulations and provides transparent reporting to shareholders about their cryptocurrency holdings. How has this strategy performed for MicroStrategy shareholders? The company’s Bitcoin accumulation has generally correlated with strong shareholder returns, though cryptocurrency investments remain volatile.

His comments arrived after a steep 24-hour price drop that pushed Bitcoin from above $100,000 to below $95,000. Saylor Says Reports of Bitcoin Selling Are False In a Friday post on X, Saylor said there was “no truth” to suggestions that Strategy had cut its Bitcoin reserves by about 47,000 BTC — a reduction worth $4.6 billion at current prices. He emphasized that the company was continuing to purchase Bitcoin, even as volatility intensified and the price fell more than 4% in a single day. “I think the volatility comes with the territory,” Saylor said in a CNBC interview on Friday. “If you’re going to be a Bitcoin investor, you need a four-year time horizon and you need to be prepared to handle the volatility in this market.” Strategy remains the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder with a treasury of roughly 640,000 BTC. However, its dominance has tapered as other institutions increased their accumulation. Companies including Coinbase and Metaplanet acquired more Bitcoin in October than Strategy, reducing the firm’s lead. Strategy Stock Declines Amid Market Uncertainty Shares of Strategy (MSTR) have mirrored some of the weakness seen in the crypto market. According to Nasdaq data, the stock fell to $205.38 at the time of publication — a drop of more than 17% over the previous five days. Market analysts noted that declining Bitcoin prices, combined with increased competition in corporate BTC accumulation, have added pressure to the stock. Government Shutdown Ends, Bitcoin Reaction Mixed The end of a 43-day U.S. government shutdown brought a temporary boost to financial markets earlier in the week, though it remains unclear whether the resolution will have a lasting influence on Bitcoin’s trajectory. BTC surged above $106,000 on Sunday amid optimism that lawmakers were nearing a funding deal. A second rally occurred on Wednesday after the House passed a continuing resolution followed by President Donald Trump signing it into law. However, data from Nansen showed the rally faded once government operations officially restarted on Thursday. Bitcoin’s price fell below $100,000 shortly afterward, suggesting that macro relief alone is insufficient to sustain upward momentum in current market conditions.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-15 00:59:21

The same stages are what investors are currently targeting in new projects; and one such project that is sitting within those stages is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with prices still pegged at only $0.035 in the current presale stage. As such, Mutuum Finance, with its pricing still low in the current presale stages with rapid sell-outs with each stage reached, is a DeFi lending and yield ecosystem that seeks to enable consumers to borrow money from the platform to invest in other areas with the aim of earning yield without necessarily going to centralized exchanges. The venture offers something that has previously been conspicuous by its absence in the DeFi sector – an innovative risk-pooled asset insurance mechanism that safeguards lenders. Shiba Inu Price Analysis The price has been repeatedly tested by two descending trendline resistances. Each test resulted in a sell-off. This action demonstrates bearishness; however, there is also an important technical implication here. It is that buying activity is still present below the levels that protect SHIB from further declines. The decisive move to the next destination for the SHIB price rests with a clean break above the first descending trendline. If that occurs, then the price has every chance to move towards the higher trendline. Here begins the true test. A successful breach above the latter trendline would immediately result in strongly more bullish market activity and possibly lead to a rally similar to those that SHIB has produced in the past. Until these verification signals are seen, SHIB is in the waiting zone with possible momentum but no guarantee. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 6 Exceeds Expectations Mutuum Finance is still making waves within the DeFi sector as it approaches the end of Phase 6 in its presale. Since over 90% has already been sold during Phase 6, the current price per MUTM token is set at $0.035, which marks the last stage before the price is set to increase to $0.04 during Phase 7. The presale event has managed to draw in over 17,950 investors who have helped it raise over $18.8 million. What sets Mutuum Finance apart is that it is certainly doing great in the presale stage, as well as other areas such as platforms and credit market structuring. Passive Yield and Liquidity: The Strengths of mtTokens One notable aspect about Mutuum Finance is the introduction of the mtTokens that the users receive after contributing to the platform. In standard deposits that people make to obtain loans from financial institutions or platforms, money is tied, and the user gets benefits after withdrawal. The use of mtTokens earns rewards in real-time; therefore, people receive passive income without the need to stop operations in other DeFi platforms that they are utilizing with the initial assets. This complementarity between yield creation and flexibility offers significant encouragement to adoption. As more people participate to supply assets to the protocol, more demand would be generated to possess MUTM tokens to share in the yield creation process. Built-In Tokenomics Yet another interesting aspect of the tokenomics model that Mutuum Finance has adopted is its buy-and-distribute function. The platform deducts some fees and automatically uses them to buy MUTM tokens in the market. These tokens are then further redistributed within the ecosystem. Notably, such an arrangement also applies perpetual buying pressure in the market and thereby establishes an intrinsic linkage between the use of the platform and buying demand in the market rather than mere advertising. Mutuum Finance has managed to raise over $18.8 million with 18,000 participants, with Phase 6 over 90% sold at $0.035. Phase 7 pricing will move up to $0.04, which marks the end of the early stage to be part of it. Based on its DeFi twin-lending structure, yield mechanism mtToken, and buy-and-distribute tokenomics, MUTM is touted to be the next big cryptocurrency to invest in.

Now, the spotlight shifts to a critical survival zone between $93,000 and $97,000, a range that could determine whether bulls can mount a recovery or if deeper losses are on the horizon. Micro-Resistance Zone Holds Firm, Forcing Another BTC Low More Crypto Online, in a recent update shared on X, pointed out that Bitcoin reacted precisely at the expected level. The micro-resistance zone between $99,386 and $100,972 rejected the price cleanly, a move fully aligned with the current market structure. This rejection led BTC to print yet another lower low, reinforcing the short-term bearish pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply-Loss Chart Flashes Possible Bottom Signal — Is Reversal Emerging? According to the update, Bitcoin has now reached the next major support zone, an area the analyst has repeatedly emphasized: the 50% retracement of the larger support box near $96,000. This zone is considered a crucial checkpoint, as a reaction here could determine whether BTC stabilizes or continues its descent. More Crypto Online also outlined a smaller internal target zone, derived from the structure of the developing yellow wave 5. To complement this, an extended projection zone between $91,322 and $82,523 was mapped out — an area that aligns perfectly with the broader Elliott Wave structure. While not guaranteed, this projection highlights the potential path BTC may follow if sellers remain in control and no strong bullish reaction emerges from the current support levels. Bulls Must Defend The $93,700–$97,500 Demand Zone According to Crypto Online, Bitcoin is currently sitting inside a crucial decision zone between $93,733 and $97,595. Holding this area is essential, as it represents the last meaningful support before deeper downside targets come into play. A strong reaction within this zone would suggest that buyers are finally attempting to regain control after the recent wave of selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Confronts Major Technical Wall Around $107K, Momentum Starts to Slow If Bitcoin fails to show strength here, Crypto Online warns that the next critical level lies around $91,300. A drop into this area would signal continued weakness and potentially accelerate the bearish momentum. This level becomes even more important because losing it would shift the broader market outlook toward a much more extended corrective phase. Despite the uncertainty, Crypto Online is clear about one thing: a legitimate sign of a local bottom will only emerge once Bitcoin breaks and holds above $100,500 again. Anything below that threshold keeps the overall structure firmly bearish. Even if the price bounces within the current range, it should be considered a short-term move unless buyers manage to reclaim that key resistance and flip market sentiment in their favor.

54413101,628012,1763168443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54413101.jpeg,Is It Time To Buy XRP? Analyst Says Get In Before This Switch Happens,https://bitcoinist.com/is-it-time-to-buy-xrp/,"XRP investors are once again considering whether now is the right time to enter the market . New reports from analysts warn that XRP could soon become the center of a significant wealth shift, creating a rare opportunity for early adopters. They warn that acting sooner may give investors a critical advantage before broader forces and institutions jump in and limit access to the cryptocurrency. Early XRP Buyers To Gain Massive Edge Time Traveler, a pseudonymous XRP commentator on X social media, has described XRP as the digital asset at the center of an upcoming financial shift. In his post, he stated that individual investors are largely inconsequential to global financial systems, representing less than 0.09% of the world population. According to him, roughly 8 million investors who participate in rail systems are already factored into the strategies of financial elites. This means that the actions of average investors are unlikely to sway market outcomes significantly, and any advantage comes primarily from those who position themselves ahead of larger institutional moves . Time Traveler argued that although crypto millionaires cannot alter existing power structures, billionaires and major players are closely watched but are largely left to operate freely as long as they stay within legal and political boundaries. The primary concern his post highlighted is the potential for the mass adoption of XRP before a major market shift. He warns that if too many people buy too quickly, it could disrupt the strategies used by those controlling the market. Based on this perspective, accumulating early could give smaller investors an advantage before future market changes. He noted that institutions do not want everyone to buy XRP and other digital assets before the “quick switch,” as this could diminish their ability to monopolize the market and capitalize on major price movements. Analyst Says To Secure The Token Now Market analyst CryptoTank has warned of an underground financial shift set to launch soon, with the altcoin positioned at the heart of the movement. He strongly urged investors and traders to start securing a stake in XRP , emphasizing the importance of accumulating as early as possible. CryptoTank advised acquiring the token off crypto exchanges using secure cold wallets such as D’Cent or Xaman, to ensure maximum safety and control over holdings. He stressed that buying now and holding it long term could not only position investors to benefit from the upcoming market changes but also potentially safeguard their financial future and that of their families. According to the analyst, the vast majority of the population remains unaware of the impending market transition, which positions the altcoin as the base settlement layer.

This groundbreaking move positions the Bitcoin ETF as the single largest holding in Harvard’s prestigious endowment portfolio, signaling a major shift in institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency investments. Why Is Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF Investment So Significant? Harvard University’s massive Bitcoin ETF commitment represents more than just another institutional investment. It serves as a powerful endorsement from one of the world’s most respected educational institutions. When an Ivy League endowment of Harvard’s caliber allocates nearly half a billion dollars to a Bitcoin ETF, it validates cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class for conservative investors. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas revealed this game-changing development on social media platform X. His analysis confirms that IBIT now dominates Harvard’s investment portfolio, surpassing traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This strategic allocation demonstrates how leading institutions are rethinking their approach to portfolio diversification. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin ETF Adoption? The Harvard Bitcoin ETF investment creates a powerful ripple effect across the financial landscape. Other educational endowments and institutional investors often follow Harvard’s lead when making asset allocation decisions. This massive Bitcoin ETF position could trigger similar moves from: Other university endowment funds Pension funds seeking diversification Conservative institutional investors Family offices monitoring elite investment strategies Moreover, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s design provides institutional investors with regulated exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency custody. This eliminates significant barriers that previously prevented traditional investors from entering the crypto space. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Harvard’s substantial Bitcoin ETF allocation serves as a crucial validation point for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. When prestigious institutions embrace Bitcoin through regulated vehicles like ETFs, it reduces the perception of cryptocurrency as a speculative gamble. Instead, it positions digital assets as strategic portfolio components. The timing of this Bitcoin ETF investment coincides with growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency exposure. BlackRock’s IBIT has emerged as a preferred vehicle for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure without direct ownership challenges. This trend suggests we’re witnessing early stages of widespread institutional Bitcoin adoption. What Challenges Remain for Bitcoin ETF Adoption? Despite Harvard’s bold Bitcoin ETF move, several challenges persist for broader institutional adoption. Regulatory uncertainty continues to create hesitation among some traditional investors. Additionally, volatility concerns and custody issues still weigh on decision-makers at conservative institutions. However, the Harvard Bitcoin ETF investment demonstrates that these concerns are becoming manageable for sophisticated investors. The university’s risk management team clearly determined that the potential rewards outweigh the perceived risks, especially when accessed through a regulated Bitcoin ETF structure. Actionable Insights from Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF Strategy Individual investors can learn valuable lessons from Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF approach. The university didn’t allocate their entire portfolio to cryptocurrency, but rather made a strategic position in a regulated Bitcoin ETF. This balanced approach suggests: Start with small allocations rather than going all-in Choose regulated vehicles like established Bitcoin ETFs Consider long-term holding rather than short-term trading Monitor regulatory developments continuously The Harvard Bitcoin ETF story represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency acceptance. It demonstrates that even the most conservative institutions recognize Bitcoin’s potential role in modern portfolio theory. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of Harvard’s portfolio is the Bitcoin ETF? While exact percentages aren’t disclosed, the $442 million Bitcoin ETF investment represents the single largest holding in Harvard’s endowment portfolio, indicating significant allocation. Why did Harvard choose BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF? Harvard likely selected BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF due to the firm’s established reputation, strong track record, and robust ETF infrastructure that meets institutional standards. Is this Harvard’s first cryptocurrency investment? While not necessarily their first crypto-related investment, this represents their most significant public Bitcoin ETF position to date through a regulated vehicle. How might this affect other university endowments? Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF move often sets trends for other educational endowments, potentially encouraging similar allocations from peer institutions. What risks does Harvard face with this Bitcoin ETF investment? Like any Bitcoin investment, the Bitcoin ETF carries volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty, and market correlation risks that Harvard’s team has evidently deemed acceptable. Can individual investors replicate Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF strategy? Yes, individual investors can purchase shares of the same BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) that Harvard selected, though allocation sizes should match individual risk tolerance.

This significant movement suggests we might be entering a period where alternative cryptocurrencies could outperform Bitcoin. For investors and traders watching market cycles, this development offers crucial insights into potential portfolio opportunities. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Measure? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market indicator that tracks whether we’re in an altcoin season or Bitcoin season. This important metric analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over a 90-day period. When 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, the index declares an official altcoin season. Currently sitting at 32, the Altcoin Season Index shows we’re still in Bitcoin-dominated territory. However, the recent three-point jump indicates growing strength among alternative cryptocurrencies. This movement suggests investors might want to pay closer attention to altcoin opportunities. Why Should You Care About the Altcoin Season Index Movement? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index provides several key benefits for crypto enthusiasts: Market timing insights – Helps identify optimal entry points for altcoin investments Portfolio diversification guidance – Indicates when to shift focus between Bitcoin and altcoins Risk management – Shows broader market sentiment and trend directions Profit potential identification – Highlights periods when altcoins typically outperform The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 32, while still below the 75 threshold for a confirmed season, shows promising upward momentum. This gradual climb suggests we might be approaching a transition phase where altcoins begin capturing more market attention. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? Smart investors use the Altcoin Season Index as one tool in their comprehensive market analysis toolkit. While the index hasn’t reached the magic 75 number that confirms an altcoin season, the recent increase to 32 provides valuable information. This movement suggests it might be time to start researching promising altcoin projects and preparing watchlists. However, remember that the Altcoin Season Index shouldn’t be your only decision-making factor. Always combine this data with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and thorough research. The current environment presents both opportunities and challenges that require careful consideration. What Historical Patterns Tell Us About Current Altcoin Season Index Levels Historical data shows that when the Altcoin Season Index begins climbing from lower levels, it often precedes significant altcoin rallies. The journey from 29 to 32 might seem small, but in context, it represents increased altcoin strength against Bitcoin. Previous cycles have demonstrated that sustained upward movement in the index frequently leads to extended altcoin outperformance periods. Market analysts watch these incremental changes closely because they can signal the beginning of broader trend shifts. The current Altcoin Season Index movement, while modest, aligns with patterns that have historically preceded more substantial altcoin gains. Final Thoughts: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Landscape The Altcoin Season Index climb to 32 delivers an encouraging signal for altcoin enthusiasts. While we haven’t entered a full altcoin season yet, the upward momentum suggests the market might be preparing for a shift. This development reminds us that cryptocurrency markets move in cycles, and being prepared for transitions can lead to strategic advantages. As the Altcoin Season Index continues to evolve, staying informed and maintaining a balanced perspective remains crucial. The current reading provides hope for altcoin investors while reminding Bitcoin holders that diversification matters in dynamic market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. A score above 75 indicates an altcoin season. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index updates regularly, with recent data showing a three-point increase from the previous day’s reading. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 32 mean? A reading of 32 indicates we’re still in Bitcoin season territory, but the upward movement suggests growing altcoin strength. Should I buy altcoins when the index rises? While a rising Altcoin Season Index suggests improving conditions, always conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before investing. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index? The index provides valuable market sentiment data but should be used alongside other analysis tools for comprehensive decision-making. What’s the difference between Bitcoin season and altcoin season? Bitcoin season occurs when Bitcoin outperforms most altcoins, while altcoin season happens when the majority of top altcoins beat Bitcoin’s performance.

These revelations come at a critical moment for cryptocurrency and AI investors seeking to understand the true economics behind the artificial intelligence boom. OpenAI Microsoft Partnership Financial Details Exposed According to documents obtained by tech blogger Ed Zitron, Microsoft received $493.8 million in revenue share payments from OpenAI in 2024 alone. The situation intensified dramatically in 2025, with Microsoft collecting $865.8 million in just the first three quarters. This financial arrangement stems from Microsoft’s massive $13 billion investment in OpenAI, creating one of the most significant partnerships in tech history. AI Revenue Sharing Model Complexity Revealed The leaked information reveals a complex revenue sharing arrangement where OpenAI pays Microsoft approximately 20% of its revenue. However, the relationship works both ways – Microsoft also returns about 20% of revenues from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service back to the AI startup. This creates a sophisticated financial ecosystem where both companies benefit from each other’s success. OpenAI pays Microsoft 20% of total revenue Microsoft returns 20% of Bing and Azure OpenAI revenues Leaked numbers represent net revenue share after deductions Actual gross payments likely significantly higher Soaring AI Compute Costs Threaten Profitability The most alarming revelation concerns OpenAI’s compute expenditure. Analysis suggests the company spent approximately $3.8 billion on inference costs in 2024, skyrocketing to $8.65 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Inference represents the computational power required to run trained AI models and generate responses – essentially the ongoing operational cost of providing AI services. Year Inference Costs Revenue Share to Microsoft 2024 $3.8 billion $493.8 million 2025 (First 9 months) $8.65 billion $865.8 million AI Industry Finances Under Microscope These leaked documents provide unprecedented insight into the financial health of the AI industry’s leading company. Based on the 20% revenue share percentage, we can infer OpenAI generated at least $2.5 billion in 2024 revenue and $4.33 billion in the first three quarters of 2025. However, CEO Sam Altman has suggested the company’s actual performance is even stronger, claiming OpenAI could reach $100 billion in revenue by 2027. Leaked Documents Raise AI Bubble Concerns The financial data suggests OpenAI might be spending more on inference costs than it earns in revenue, raising serious questions about the sustainability of current AI business models. This revelation comes as the AI industry faces increasing scrutiny about whether current valuations and investment levels are justified by actual financial performance. Frequently Asked Questions What is the nature of the OpenAI Microsoft partnership? The partnership involves Microsoft providing substantial computational resources through Azure cloud services in exchange for revenue sharing and exclusive access to OpenAI’s technology for certain applications. How much has Microsoft invested in OpenAI? Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI through multiple funding rounds, making it the startup’s primary financial backer and strategic partner. What are inference costs in AI? Inference costs refer to the computational expenses required to run trained AI models and generate responses for users, as opposed to training costs which involve initially developing the models. Who leaked the OpenAI financial documents? Tech blogger Ed Zitron obtained and reported on the leaked documents, though the original source remains unidentified. How does this affect the broader AI industry? These revelations could impact investor confidence and valuation expectations across the AI sector, particularly for companies with similar compute-intensive business models. The leaked financial documents between OpenAI and Microsoft reveal an industry grappling with the enormous costs of artificial intelligence while pursuing unprecedented growth. As compute expenses potentially outpace revenue, the entire AI sector faces crucial questions about sustainability and profitability that will shape investment decisions for years to come.

The broader crypto market remains on edge, as fear and uncertainty continue to weigh on sentiment following days of steady declines across major assets. Traders are watching closely to see if Ethereum can stabilize above this key support zone — a failure to do so could trigger a deeper correction toward the $3,000 area. Related Reading: $1.33B Ethereum Whale Just Moved Another $120M USDT to Binance – Details Despite the mounting pressure, one prominent Ethereum whale — known for a series of large-scale purchases this month — continues to accumulate aggressively. This investor has consistently added to their position even as the price fell, signaling strong long-term confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals and recovery potential. This divergence between short-term fear and long-term accumulation paints a complex picture for Ethereum. While short-term volatility remains a concern, large holders’ continued buying may be setting the foundation for a more sustained rebound once market conditions stabilize and sentiment improves. Ethereum Whale Keeps Buying Despite Market Turbulence According to data from Lookonchain, the prominent Ethereum investor known as Whale ’66kETHBorrow’ has continued his large-scale accumulation despite the ongoing market downturn. Earlier today, the whale purchased 19,508 ETH worth approximately $61 million, expanding his already massive position built over the past week. Shortly after, an update revealed yet another purchase — 16,937 ETH valued at $53.91 million — bringing his total accumulation since November 4 to 422,175 ETH, worth roughly $1.34 billion at an average price near $3,489. Despite the recent price drop, the whale is currently sitting on more than $120 million in unrealized losses, but continues to double down on Ethereum exposure. This aggressive strategy indicates strong long-term confidence, as the investor appears unfazed by short-term volatility. Market observers suggest this accumulation pattern could signal institutional-level conviction that Ethereum’s current prices represent a strategic buying zone. While retail sentiment remains cautious amid heightened uncertainty, the whale’s consistent activity underscores a broader trend: large players are quietly accumulating, positioning themselves ahead of a potential recovery once macro conditions stabilize and risk appetite returns to the crypto market.

The daily chart shows ETH struggling to hold above its 200-day moving average (red line) — a key support level that often defines long-term market structure. A decisive close below this line could confirm a deeper correction phase. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages continue to trend downward, reinforcing the short-term bearish outlook. If Ethereum fails to recover momentum, the next major support sits near $3,000, followed by $2,850, where buyers previously stepped in during the summer consolidation. Conversely, a recovery above $3,400–$3,500 would be the first signal that bullish momentum is returning.

Reports from Farside Investors showed that spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded about $866 million in withdrawals on Thursday, a sharp move that arrived even after the US government reopened following a 43-day shutdown . The flow of money leaving these funds caught the attention of traders who had expected a stronger reaction once political uncertainty cleared. Heavy Withdrawals Hit Major Bitcoin Funds According to new data, this wave of outflows marked the second straight session of losses for US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. A separate reading from SoSoValue pointed to nearly $897 million leaving those products on the same day, suggesting widespread pullback from institutional players. The shift surprised some market watchers because ETF inflows had been one of the main drivers of Bitcoin’s strong run earlier in 2025. Those who entered Bitcoin 6 to 12 months ago have a cost basis near 94K. Personally, I do not think the bear cycle is confirmed unless we lose that level. I would rather wait than jump to conclusions. pic.twitter.com/i9a5M0xnMW — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 14, 2025 Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant warned that the broader uptrend could weaken if Bitcoin falls below $94,000, which he identified as the average buying level for holders who entered during the past six to 12 months. XRP Fund Shines Amid Market Pressure While Bitcoin funds struggled, one new altcoin product posted an unusually strong debut. The Canary Capital XRP (XRPC) ETF reached $58 million in first-day trading volume, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. That figure barely topped the $57 million logged by a Solana ETF earlier this year, but it still ranked as the biggest opening among roughly 900 ETF launches in 2025. Reports also noted that Ether ETFs faced $259 million in withdrawals on Thursday, while Solana ETFs extended a 13-day run of inflows by adding another $1.5 million. Rate Cut Doubts Add To The Slide Bitcoin slid under the $100,000 line on Friday and traded around $96,900 by 00:00 ET (05:00 GMT). It dipped to an intraday low of $96,650, pressured by fading hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. Markets now price about a 45% chance of a 25 basis point cut at the December 10-11 meeting, down from 63% a week earlier. The government shutdown created gaps in official inflation and jobs data, leaving the Fed with fewer signals to work with and keeping traders cautious about taking on risk. Mixed Sentiment As Crypto Heads Into The Weekend Institutional demand has been cooling, shown by repeated outflows and slowing treasury purchases. Some analysts believe the market has been in a quiet bearish phase for months. Hunter Horsley of Bitwise said the downturn may be closer to ending than many assume, although broader risk markets have offered little support. Others caution that continued ETF withdrawals could extend Bitcoin’s losing streak, which is now headed toward a third week.

Following this move, the company stated that it held approximately a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet at the end of the third quarter. As the multinational powerhouse invested in Alphabet, it continued to reduce its investment in Apple significantly. The company reduced its investment by another 15% this quarter, totaling $60.7 billion. Regarding the company’s holdings in Alphabet, several individuals stated that they were shocked by this decision. This is because Buffett is renowned for his value investing strategy and typically hesitates to make investments in rapidly growing tech firms. Meanwhile, with this investment in place, a regulatory filing revealed that Alphabet solidified its position as the 10th biggest stock holding for the conglomerate as of the end of September. Buffett confesses to missing out on investing in Google early on Berkshire has reportedly owned Apple for several years. However, analysts discovered Buffett views the iPhone maker as a consumer products firm rather than a typical tech company. Following this perspective, the analysts concluded that Berkshire’s investment managers, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, likely made this purchase. According to their argument, these individuals have actively engaged with technology stocks. Their statement followed reports from sources revealing that one of them began investing in Amazon in 2019, and Berkshire still owns roughly $2.2 billion of Amazon shares. Notably, Amazon has been attracting firms to invest in the company after it was ranked as a top performer this year, with its stock price escalating by 46%. On the other hand, the significant demand for AI has greatly enhanced its cloud services business. Buffett once confessed that he had missed out on investing in Google early on, although he had noticed its advertising possibilities. Interestingly, Berkshire’s auto insurance company, Geico, was once Google’s early user, paying approximately $10 every time someone clicked on their ad. “I had seen the product work, and I knew what kind of profits they were making,” Buffett said in 2018. He admitted that he did not understand much about technology to conclude whether this would be the one that would defeat all other technologies in the competition. Berkshire reduces several of its holdings under the leadership of Buffett Buffett sold off two-thirds of Berkshire’s Apple shares in 2024. This move shocked many individuals as they viewed Buffett as a long-sighted investor. Apart from the 95-year-old investor’s move, Berkshire also decreased its Apple holdings in the second quarter of this year. However, despite those ongoing sales, sources pointed out that Apple remains Berkshire’s largest stock investment. After reducing its Apple holdings, the company also reduced its stake in Bank of America by 6%, which is worth under $30 billion. Additionally, Berkshire reduced its investments in Verisign and DaVita during the third quarter. According to sources close to the situation, Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters as prices climbed in the tech-focused bull market. In the meantime, Buffett is stepping off as CEO at year’s end with his longtime partner Greg Abel set to take over. Investors are paying close attention to how Berkshire is positioning itself for insights on the upcoming leadership change and any shifts in its investment strategy .

Saylor dismissed the speculation in a post on X, writing that there was “no truth” to suggestions the firm had reduced its position.

The company’s dashboard showed total Bitcoin holdings of 641,692 BTC as of Monday, matching its previous disclosure, and its SEC filings confirmed continued accumulation throughout early November. The sudden movement of coins earlier in the day added fresh uncertainty to already fragile crypto markets. Strategy( @Strategy ) moved 58,915 $BTC ($5.77B) to new wallets today, likely for custody purposes. https://t.co/FgZG2ZWlVi pic.twitter.com/fimqXsgLH0 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 14, 2025 On-chain analysts reported that Strategy transferred more than 58,000 BTC to new wallets, a shift that triggered algorithmic trading activity and accelerated the sell-off. Although analysts later attributed the transfers to custody restructuring rather than liquidation, the clarification did little to ease broader concerns. MSTR Drops to One-Year Low as Investors Reassess Bitcoin Proxy Premium Market pressure quickly spread to Strategy’s financial footing. Shares of its Nasdaq-listed stock, MSTR, fell below $200 in pre-market trading on Friday, its lowest level since October 2024. The company’s Net Asset Value multiple briefly slipped below 1 for the first time, indicating that investors were valuing the firm at less than the worth of its Bitcoin holdings. Source: X The multiple has since recovered to 1.09, but the shift marks a break from years in which Strategy consistently traded at a premium. That reversal reflects cooler investor expectations. According to K33 Research, Strategy’s equity premium has contracted by $79.2 billion since November 2024. $79.2bn reduction in MSTR's equity premiums relative to its BTC holdings since November 20, 2024. With $31.1bn raised through dilution over this period, roughly $48.1bn of the implied demand for BTC via MSTR never translated into spot purchases. pic.twitter.com/14sf9dL4tl — Vetle Lunde (@VetleLunde) November 14, 2025 While the company raised over $31 billion through share issuance during that period, analysts estimate nearly $48 billion of implied Bitcoin demand never translated into actual BTC purchases. Some market watchers say investors are no longer using MSTR as a straightforward proxy for Bitcoin exposure. Others dismissed liquidation fears. Analyst Willy Woo said Strategy is unlikely to face pressure to sell before 2027 as long as MSTR trades above $183.19, a threshold linked to the company’s debt structure. He noted that only a weak 2028 Bitcoin cycle could force partial sales. MSTR liquidation in the next bear market? I doubt it, Here's their debt, the date the debt is due and the price MSTR stock needs to exceed to prevent partial liquidation of their BTC treasury to pay the debt. Equivalent BTC price assumes mNAV 1.0 pic.twitter.com/AzVgecI7i2 — Willy Woo (@woonomic) November 4, 2025 The dispute comes amid wider turbulence across digital assets and U.S. markets. Bitcoin briefly jumped above $106,000 after lawmakers ended a record 43-day government shutdown , but the rally faded as expectations for a December Federal Reserve rate cut diminished. Despite the volatility, Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin; however, its market share has fallen from 75% to 60% as more firms add BTC to their treasuries.

The entity known as Seven Siblings is making waves with their aggressive Ethereum investment strategy, purchasing millions worth of ETH during price drops despite facing substantial unrealized losses. This bold approach to Ethereum investment reveals fascinating insights about market psychology and long-term crypto strategies. What Is Seven Siblings’ Ethereum Investment Strategy? Seven Siblings has developed a clear pattern in their Ethereum investment approach. They consistently buy ETH during price declines, demonstrating a contrarian investment philosophy. According to recent reports from EmberCN on X, the entity just borrowed $11 million from Spark protocol to purchase 3,496 ETH at an average price of $3,147. This latest Ethereum investment follows their established pattern of accumulating during market weakness. The timing of their purchases suggests they believe in Ethereum’s long-term value regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Their strategy shows conviction in their Ethereum investment thesis, even when market sentiment turns negative. How Large Is Their Current Ethereum Investment Position? Seven Siblings’ total Ethereum investment has reached staggering proportions. Since the market crash on October 11th, they have deployed $174 million to acquire 49,287 ETH. Their average cost basis stands at $3,531 per ETH, which currently positions them in negative territory given market prices. Key facts about their Ethereum investment portfolio: Total ETH holdings: 49,287 coins Average purchase price: $3,531 per ETH Total investment: $174 million Current unrealized loss: $18.97 million Zero ETH sold to date Why Continue Ethereum Investment During Losses? This persistent Ethereum investment strategy raises important questions about risk management and long-term planning. Despite facing nearly $19 million in paper losses, Seven Siblings continues their accumulation pattern. This approach suggests they either have: Strong conviction in Ethereum’s future price appreciation Substantial capital reserves to weather volatility A specific price target or timeline for their investment Hedging strategies elsewhere in their portfolio Their unwavering commitment to Ethereum investment during downturns demonstrates either remarkable confidence or concerning risk exposure. However, experienced crypto investors often remind us that major wealth transfers occur during market fear phases. What Does This Mean for Average Ethereum Investors? While most investors don’t have $174 million for Ethereum investment, there are valuable lessons from Seven Siblings’ approach. Their strategy highlights the importance of: Having a clear investment plan and sticking to it Using dollar-cost averaging during volatility Maintaining long-term perspective despite short-term losses Understanding risk tolerance before making major investments However, their massive Ethereum investment also serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of concentrated positions and leveraging during uncertain market conditions. Conclusion: Brave or Reckless Ethereum Investment Strategy? Seven Siblings’ ongoing Ethereum investment during price declines showcases either brilliant market timing or dangerous overconfidence. While their $18.97 million unrealized loss seems alarming, experienced crypto investors know that paper losses only become real when positions are closed. Their consistent accumulation strategy suggests they’re playing a long game with their Ethereum investment, potentially anticipating substantial future returns that would dwarf current losses. The true test of their Ethereum investment thesis will come when markets recover. If Ethereum prices rebound above their $3,531 average cost basis, their strategy will appear prescient. If prices remain depressed, their losses could mount significantly. Either way, their moves provide fascinating insights into institutional-grade cryptocurrency investment strategies.

This remarkable Bitcoin price surge represents one of the most significant cryptocurrency achievements in recent history, sending waves of excitement through the digital asset community. What’s Driving This Massive Bitcoin Price Surge? The current Bitcoin price surge didn’t happen overnight. Several key factors have contributed to this impressive rally. Market analysts point to increased institutional adoption, growing mainstream acceptance, and favorable regulatory developments as primary catalysts. Moreover, the limited supply of Bitcoin continues to create scarcity value that drives price appreciation during periods of high demand. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC reached an impressive $96,005.6 on the Binance USDT market. This represents a substantial gain that has exceeded many expert predictions. The sustained upward momentum suggests strong buyer confidence and reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Milestone? Breaking the $96,000 mark represents more than just a number—it signals a fundamental shift in market sentiment. This Bitcoin price surge demonstrates several important market characteristics: Increased institutional interest from major financial players Growing retail investor confidence in cryptocurrency markets Enhanced market liquidity across major trading platforms Strong technical indicators supporting continued bullish sentiment The current Bitcoin price surge reflects growing recognition of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Traditional financial institutions are increasingly allocating resources to Bitcoin, while individual investors see it as both a store of value and growth opportunity. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Price Movements? While the current Bitcoin price surge is impressive, many investors wonder about sustainability. Historical patterns suggest that after significant breakthroughs, Bitcoin often experiences consolidation periods. However, the underlying fundamentals remain strong. The limited supply mechanism, combined with increasing adoption, creates a compelling case for long-term value appreciation. Market experts recommend cautious optimism. The Bitcoin price surge represents both opportunity and potential volatility. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon when evaluating positions during such dynamic market conditions. Key Takeaways From This Remarkable Bitcoin Achievement This Bitcoin price surge teaches us valuable lessons about cryptocurrency markets. First, it demonstrates the asset’s resilience and growing mainstream acceptance. Second, it highlights the importance of understanding market cycles and timing. Finally, it reinforces Bitcoin’s position as the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization and influence. The journey to $96,000 has been characterized by volatility, innovation, and growing global recognition. This Bitcoin price surge represents another chapter in the digital asset’s remarkable evolution from niche technology to mainstream financial instrument. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $96,000? The Bitcoin price surge resulted from multiple factors including increased institutional investment, positive regulatory developments, growing mainstream adoption, and limited supply meeting rising demand. Is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin? While the Bitcoin price surge presents opportunities, investors should conduct thorough research and consider their financial goals and risk tolerance before investing during periods of rapid price appreciation. How high can Bitcoin prices go? Predicting exact price targets is challenging, but many analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential based on its limited supply and growing adoption. What risks come with such rapid price increases? Rapid Bitcoin price surges can lead to increased volatility, potential corrections, and regulatory scrutiny. Investors should be prepared for price fluctuations. How does this compare to previous Bitcoin bull markets? This Bitcoin price surge shows similarities to previous cycles but features stronger institutional participation and more developed market infrastructure. What should I watch for in the coming weeks? Monitor trading volume, regulatory announcements, institutional activity, and technical support levels to gauge the sustainability of this Bitcoin price surge.

Bulls are struggling to defend critical support, and sentiment has turned decidedly fearful, with traders scaling back leverage and rotating into stablecoins amid heightened volatility. Despite this weakness, on-chain data suggests that large buyers may already be positioning for a potential rebound. Related Reading: $1.33B Ethereum Whale Just Moved Another $120M USDT to Binance – Details According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, massive bid walls have been spotted on Binance Futures, signaling that aggressive buyers are stepping in to absorb the recent wave of selling. Historically, such large-scale bids have often coincided with local bottoms, as whales and institutional traders accumulate into weakness. This emerging liquidity pattern may suggest growing confidence among deep-pocketed players that Bitcoin’s downside could be limited. However, with macro uncertainty still weighing heavily on the market, traders remain cautious. Aggressive Buyers Step In As Bid Walls Signal Dip Accumulation According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, recent order book data reveals a strong layer of support forming on Binance Futures, where two major bid clusters have emerged — one around 800 BTC and another stacking up to 2,000 BTC. This concentration of buy orders suggests that large traders, often referred to as aggressive dip buyers, are actively accumulating Bitcoin at current levels around $97,000. Bid walls of this size are significant because they indicate a willingness among deep-pocketed investors to absorb selling pressure and defend price levels perceived as undervalued. In practice, such large orders create a temporary price floor, making it harder for BTC to fall further without massive selling volume. This behavior is often observed in early phases of market reversals. Smart money begins building positions while retail sentiment remains fearful. Maartunn notes that these clusters reflect renewed confidence from high-volume traders who see long-term value despite the recent correction. If these orders remain active and continue to absorb liquidity, Bitcoin could stabilize above the $95,000–$97,000 range. Historically, periods of strong bid support have preceded short-term relief rallies, suggesting that the current dip may be setting the stage for a broader recovery.

The three-day chart shows a decisive break below the $100,000 psychological threshold, confirming a short-term bearish shift as sellers dominate. Volume has spiked notably in recent sessions, suggesting panic-driven liquidations as traders unwind leveraged positions. The 50-day moving average has crossed below the 100-day, signaling fading momentum, while the 200-day moving average — currently near $88,000 — stands as the next central support zone if selling pressure persists. Despite the breakdown, price is showing early signs of stabilization around current levels, hinting that dip buyers may be stepping in. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Adds $105M To His ETH Position – $1.33B Bought Since Nov 4 Market structure remains corrective but not fully bearish. Bitcoin has repeatedly found support above its 200-day MA during previous mid-cycle retracements. A pattern that often precedes recovery once selling exhausts. The RSI (not shown here) is likely near oversold territory, reinforcing this view. If BTC can reclaim and hold above $100,000, a short-term relief rally toward $105,000–$108,000 could unfold. However, failure to defend $95,000 may accelerate the decline toward $90,000. Overall, the chart reflects a market in consolidation, balancing between capitulation risk and early accumulation.

54417487,628276,1763175632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54417487.jpeg,XRP Under Fire: VanEck Research Chief Questions Its Real Utility,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-vaneck-research-chief-questions-utility/,"A senior VanEck executive has reignited a long-running debate over XRP’s real-world utility, questioning both the relevance of the XRP Ledger and the economic case for holding the token—just as a new spot ETF has posted the strongest launch numbers of any fund this year. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, took direct aim at supporters on X, opening with a post that combined sarcasm and skepticism. “Dear XRP maxis,” he wrote, “I may never understand what your ‘blockchain’ actually does, but I’ll always respect the passion required to pretend it does something. So keep hustling!” XRP Utility Debate Reignites The tone set the stage for a thread that pushed beyond memes into pointed questions about developer activity and value accrual. In a follow-up post, Sigel asked: “Genuine question: has any developer ever woken up and said, ‘Time to build… on XRP’? Would love citations.” Hours later, he underscored the lack of detailed responses from the community with a terse update: “Zero replies so far”. The challenge is clear. In a market where developer traction and on-chain activity are often treated as proxies for network value, Sigel is not just criticizing the narrative, but demanding evidence that ledger is actually a target platform for builders. When an supporter pointed to Ondo Finance launching its OUSG tokenized Treasury fund on the XRP Ledger as proof the ecosystem is active, Sigel shifted the discussion to token economics. “Cool initiative, but does any of this actually accrue value to XRP token holders? I’m not aware of any fee capture, revenue share, burn, or economic linkage. I think maybe I’m not smart enough to understand but I’ll keep trying to learn and update my views!” The exchange also touched on the fortunes created around the token and the controversies attached to them. After one user sarcastically wrote that XRP had “funded a whole company [Ripple] on nothing and got a few billionaires out of it,” Sigel replied: “Like the one who funded Greenpeace’s ‘Change the Code’ campaign to pressure Bitcoin into abandoning PoW? Quite a legacy.” The remark alludes to the well-known funding of Greenpeace’s anti–proof-of-work campaign by a Ripple co-founder, a move that has long polarized Bitcoin and XRP communities. When another commenter accused him of trying to “hold ppl back” from investing in the token and dismissed Bitcoin as “completely speculative,” Sigel contrasted the two assets in terms of institutional adoption and state-level engagement. He argued that “retail investors like University Endowments, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and today a Central Bank” are now in bitcoin, and claimed that “12 countries are now mining Bitcoin with direct government support, thanks to its synergies with the electrical grid,” before adding, “Anyway by all means, invest away in XRP. I’m not stopping you.” The thread drew in Solana Foundation’s Vibhu Norby, who has previously clashed with the XRP community but here offered a more reconciliatory, if still critical, framing. “XRP is a SoV coin similar to Bitcoin with cheaper fees wrapped in 13 years of payments mythology. Instead of Satoshi, the collective unconscious of the XRP Army centers around a company (which btw happens to be very well run). The XRPL has minimal usage for transactions compared to smart contract blockchains, but it is not important to its value just like Bitcoin has minimal transactions compared to smart contract blockchains but it is not important to its value,” Norby commented. All of this unfolded against a striking market backdrop. Canary Capital’s spot ETF XRPC, began trading on November 13 and generated around $58 million in first-day volume, including $26 million in its first hour—enough to make it the biggest ETF debut of 2025 so far and narrowly surpass the launch-day volume of Bitwise’s Solana ETF, BSOL. The two funds now define the upper tier of single-asset ETF launches this year, with the next-best newcomer more than $20 million behind in day-one trading.

On June 14, these funds experienced a staggering net outflow of $502.73 million, shaking investor confidence. This significant movement highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments and raises questions about market sentiment. What Caused the Massive Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outflow? The outflow was primarily driven by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw withdrawals of $473.72 million. Other major players like Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC also contributed to the trend. However, Grayscale’s Mini BTC fund bucked the trend with a small inflow. This situation shows how Bitcoin spot ETFs can quickly reflect changing investor behaviors. How Do Bitcoin Spot ETFs Impact Your Portfolio? Bitcoin spot ETFs directly track Bitcoin’s price, making them popular for exposure without holding the asset. The recent outflows suggest some investors are taking profits or reducing risk. Key factors influencing these decisions include: Market volatility and price swings Regulatory news and global economic conditions Institutional investment patterns Understanding these elements helps you make informed decisions about Bitcoin spot ETFs.

Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the current price of Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Why did BlackRock’s IBIT have the largest outflow? As one of the largest Bitcoin spot ETFs, IBIT’s size makes it more susceptible to significant movements during market shifts or profit-taking by major investors. Are outflows always negative for Bitcoin spot ETFs? Not necessarily. Outflows can indicate profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing, which might lead to healthier long-term growth if underlying demand remains strong. How can I track Bitcoin spot ETFs performance? Use financial platforms like TraderT or Bloomberg to monitor daily flows and trends, helping you stay informed about market dynamics. Should I invest in Bitcoin spot ETFs during outflows? It depends on your risk tolerance and strategy. Some investors see outflows as buying opportunities, while others wait for stability. What risks come with Bitcoin spot ETFs? Risks include market volatility, regulatory changes, and liquidity issues, so always assess your financial situation before investing. Found this analysis helpful?

This significant movement raises crucial questions about the short-term outlook for Ethereum investment products and what it means for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. What Triggered the Massive Ethereum ETFs Outflow? The September 14th data reveals a concerning trend for Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone accounted for $175.03 million of the total outflow, while Grayscale’s ETHE contributed $4.63 million. More importantly, not a single spot Ethereum ETF registered net inflows for the day, indicating widespread investor caution. This substantial capital movement suggests several possible factors driving investor behavior. Market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, or shifting investment strategies could all contribute to this Ethereum ETFs exodus. However, the concentrated nature of the outflows demands closer examination. Breaking Down the Ethereum ETFs Performance Let’s examine the key players in this Ethereum ETFs outflow scenario: BlackRock’s ETHA : $175.03 million outflow Grayscale’s ETHE : $4.63 million outflow Total Net Outflow : $179.66 million Inflow Activity : Zero funds reported positive inflows The data from TraderT clearly shows that the Ethereum ETFs market experienced uniform selling pressure. This coordinated movement across multiple funds suggests broader market forces at play rather than isolated fund-specific issues. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? While significant outflows from Ethereum ETFs might cause concern, they don’t necessarily signal long-term trouble for Ethereum itself. These investment products represent just one avenue for Ethereum exposure, and daily flows can be volatile. However, the scale of this particular Ethereum ETFs outflow warrants attention. Investors should consider whether this represents temporary profit-taking or a more fundamental shift in sentiment toward Ethereum investment products. Monitoring subsequent trading sessions will provide clearer context. Navigating the Ethereum ETFs Landscape The current Ethereum ETFs situation highlights the importance of understanding these investment vehicles. Unlike direct cryptocurrency ownership, Ethereum ETFs provide traditional market exposure to Ethereum’s price movements. This makes them accessible to investors who prefer conventional brokerage accounts. Yet, as we’ve seen with these Ethereum ETFs outflows, they remain subject to market sentiment and broader financial trends. The concentration of outflows in major funds like BlackRock’s ETHA suggests institutional investors might be reallocating capital rather than abandoning Ethereum entirely. Key Takeaways from the Ethereum ETFs Outflow The September 14th Ethereum ETFs data delivers several important insights: Daily flows in Ethereum ETFs can be extremely volatile Major funds dominate the overall flow picture Outflows don’t necessarily reflect Ethereum’s fundamental value Investor sentiment can shift rapidly in cryptocurrency markets This Ethereum ETFs episode serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investment products, while convenient, still carry significant volatility and require careful monitoring. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the massive Ethereum ETFs outflow on September 14th? The exact causes aren’t specified in the data, but likely factors include market volatility, profit-taking after recent gains, or broader economic concerns affecting cryptocurrency investments. Should I be worried about my Ethereum ETFs investment? Single-day outflows don’t necessarily indicate long-term trends. Monitor subsequent trading sessions and consider your investment horizon before making decisions about your Ethereum ETFs holdings. Which Ethereum ETFs were most affected? BlackRock’s ETHA saw the largest outflow at $175.03 million, representing the majority of the total $179.66 million Ethereum ETFs outflow for September 14th. Do these outflows affect Ethereum’s price directly? While there’s correlation, Ethereum ETFs outflows don’t directly impact Ethereum’s spot price since these are separate markets, though they can influence market sentiment. Has this happened before with Ethereum ETFs? Yes, cryptocurrency ETFs often experience volatile flows. This level of outflow is significant but not unprecedented in the relatively new Ethereum ETFs market. What should I watch for in coming days? Monitor whether the outflow trend continues, if any funds show inflows, and how Ethereum’s price responds to these Ethereum ETFs movements.

The president’s remarks came while he was at a government meeting held to discuss the performance of the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant, rising electricity consumption and proposals for new nuclear capacities. Lukashenko’s faith in crypto as a way to escape dollar dominance The president has asked for a report on the measures taken to increase electricity consumption, their results, and proposals for the further development of the electric power industry and related sectors. In his comments, Lukashenko directly highlighted the global de-dollarization efforts, calling it a “global problem” and identifying things like cryptocurrency mining as potential solutions. “The focus is on the prospects for utilizing existing and new capacities,” the head of state said. In response to fears linked to cryptocurrency mining, especially how unstable it can be, the president implied it was a sacrifice worth making as the world struggles to distance itself from the dollar. “This process will intensify,” Lukashenko said. “So why are we so worried? Some volatility… Well, there probably will be. But nothing ventured, nothing gained.” Belarus , the nation Lukashenko presides over, is closely allied with Russia and is one of the countries serious about fighting the dollar’s dominance. It has actively de-dollarized trade, reduced its USD holdings, and is currently exploring alternatives like BRICS payment systems, and if Lukashenko’s comments have anything to do with it, crypto. Lukashenko has always encouraged mining in Belarus Lukashenko’s comments on mining come weeks after he urged his country’s regulators to finalize long-delayed rules for cryptocurrencies and digital tokens in September. Lukashenko had complained at the time that his 2023 instructions to craft comprehensive regulations had yet to produce approved documents and called for “transparent rules of the game” and new oversight mechanisms, without which he believes that Belarus will lag behind in global crypto adoption. The president also highlighted how technology seemed to be advancing faster than legislation, thereby creating pressure for new branches of law. He instructed regulators and the Hi-Tech Park — the special economic zone that oversees much of Belarus’ digital economy — to split responsibilities and dedicate their expertise to drafting rules that would reassure businesses at home and abroad they could “work calmly in our digital haven.” Those comments came months after Lukashenko publicly considered another way to expand Belarus’ role in crypto. In March, he raised the possibility of harnessing the country’s excess electricity for digital asset mining. “Look at this mining. More and more people are turning to me. If it is profitable for us, let’s do it,” he reportedly told his newly appointed energy minister. Lukashenko cited developments in Washington, calling attention to the fact that the White House had floated the concept of a strategic crypto reserve. “You see the path the world is going. And especially the largest economy in the world. They announced yesterday that they will keep [a crypto] reserve,” he said. Belarus would not be the first country to consider exploring such a path. Countries like Bhutan and El Salvador have embraced Bitcoin mining and BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Belarus could benefit greatly because of it its power surplus, but regulators have to give the green light. Already, decree No. 8 “On the Development of the Digital Economy”, which was signed on December 21, 2017, has established a framework for digital assets to thrive in Belarus under the Hi-Tech Park umbrella, and this has attracted foreign blockchain startups. The decree formally recognized digital tokens in Belarusian law and created a legal basis for their issuance, circulation, and exchange. The decree also offered tax exemptions on digital asset transactions for companies and individuals operating within HTP and recognized the validity of smart contracts. All those measures have positioned Belarus as one of the earliest jurisdictions to adopt a state-backed framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain services.

The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has now agreed to scrutinize whether Apple’s redesigned blood oxygen feature in newer watches still infringes on Masimo’s patents. Apple will know its fate in six months On Friday, ​​the U.S. International Trade Commission decided to hold a new proceeding to determine whether imports of Apple’s updated Apple Watches should be banned as part of the patent dispute with medical monitoring technology company Masimo. The investigation is to be concluded within six months, but it does not sit right with Apple . The company has called the case a meritless attempt to block its smartwatches’ blood oxygen feature while claiming that Masimo was actually the one who had copied its watch design to bring the complaint. It looks like a simple rivalry on the surface, but the conflict between Apple and Masimo goes deeper and is actually part of a contentious, multi-front patent fight that has seen Masimo accuse the tech company of luring away its employees in an attempt to steal its pulse-oximetry innovations. The conflict can be traced back to 2023 when the commission restricted imports of Apple’s Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches after it found that Masimo’s patents were infringed. Apple had to remove blood-oxygen reading technology from its watches to avoid the ban and has had to continue selling its watches in America without the feature enabled. Masimo claims Apple met with U.S. Customs on August 1, 2025, when it secured approval for re-enabling the blood-oxygen feature, a meeting Masimo argues they had no idea was going on, and bypassed due-process protections. Apple allegedly presented an updated version of the technology to Customs, offloading some of the processing to the iPhone, and arguing the updated system was sufficiently different to side-step the previous infringement ruling. It got approval from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, causing Masimo to sue Customs over the approval, while Apple separately challenged the ITC’s ban at a federal appeals court. Masimo claims it did not learn of the feature’s return until Apple publicly announced it. Despite the contention, the feature is currently enabled. Masimo CEO who started the conflict has stepped down The conflict between Apple and Masimo has lasted for years now, but while Apple and Masimo continue to duke it out in the legal boxing ring with the ITC as referee, the CEO who started everything, Joe Kiani, has reportedly stepped down. This came after he was removed from Masimo’s board by shareholders, a decision that was prompted after a proxy battle with hedge fund Politan Capital Management. That conflict ensued after a $1 billion acquisition of Sound United pushed Kiani out. Politan nominated key board members, one of whom is now interim CEO, Michelle Brennan. Regarding Masimo’s conflict with Apple, which he started, Kiani has given the excuse of waiting for a call from Apple to deal with the matter on numerous occasions. Meanwhile, Apple said something different: that they had indeed reached out, but were mostly rebuffed by the CEO at the time. It remains unclear if Apple has had further discussions with Masimo or the new CEO since the Apple Watch blood oxygen sensing was restored.

The university’s holdings represent a 257% increase from 1,906,000 shares previously reported in the second quarter, valued at around $117 million. Its GLD gold ETF holdings also surged by almost 100%. It currently has 661,391 shares of the GLD gold ETF valued at $235 million, up from 333,000 shares in June. Analysts note that the scale of the endowment’s increase is noteworthy, given its long-standing conservative investment approach. Harvard is looking at long-term investment despite price swings The Ivy League institution has been steadily expanding its ETF footprint , complementing a portfolio that includes significant positions in technology giants such as Back in 2018, a Harvard economist and former IMF chief predicted Bitcoin was more likely to crash to $100 than ever hit $100,000 by 2028. Now, with a little over two years remaining, BTC is still far from reaching that $100 prediction. Harvard’s move to scale up its investment also changes the narrative. Its latest disclosure places it high on the list of IBIT’s institutional holders, highlighting just how quickly Bitcoin ETFs are spreading through traditional finance. According to MacroScope , Harvard’s investment is another indication of significant long-term capital shifting toward Bitcoin, regardless of its short-term price fluctuations. An X user by the name Zane Hauck even noted that he believes Harvard isn’t reacting to day-to-day swings; instead, they’re aligning with a reality where monetary dilution and scarce compute capacity shape investment strategies. According to its Q2 holdings, the university was already the 29th holder of IBIT assets. Another user advised Harvard: “They can wait years for a thesis to play out. Best to temper everyone’s expectations, especially given the near-term price action.” Some suggested that other universities may join Harvard in accumulating Bitcoin. As of August 8, Brown University, another Ivy League institution, held more than $13 million worth of IBIT shares. Bitcoin ETFs drew in over $60 billion in net inflows Launched in early 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have opened the door for large institutions to access the asset under strict regulatory oversight. Filings now indicate that pensions, insurance firms, and sovereign wealth funds are allocating to them, signaling a major shift in traditional finance’s stance on crypto. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows of $60.8 billion, and trading volume exceeding $1.5 million. The explosive rise of Bitcoin ETFs has transformed the institutional investment terrain. BlackRock’s IBIT now rules the day, managing more than half of all assets in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Fidelity FBTC continues to see solid inflows, along with IBIT, from wealth managers, pensions, and other large institutional allocators, too. The appeal of these newer ETFs comes from their lower fees, tighter trading spreads, and increased liquidity, elements that have driven adoption and entrenched Bitcoin’s increasingly prevalent position in mainstream finance. On Wednesday, Bitcoin climbed back over $104,700 after U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $524 million on Tuesday — their best inflow day since early October. BlackRock’s IBIT dominated Tuesday’s inflows with $224.2 million. Fidelity’s FBTC was next at $165.9 million, ARKB attracted $102.5 million, and Grayscale tacked on $24.1 million. Overall, BlackRock’s IBIT has captured over 35% of total Bitcoin ETF inflows. It added $1.2 billion in the last month alone, raising AUM past $19.4 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC also continues to attract pension and wealth-management investors, adding $165.9 million in a single day and surpassing its total assets to reach $13.6 billion.

The drop underscores the growing weakness in bullish momentum, as traders struggle to defend key support levels amid mounting macroeconomic uncertainty and fading risk appetite. Market sentiment has turned sharply fearful, with investors showing increased caution following a wave of liquidations and declining volume across major exchanges. According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s performance has notably lagged behind traditional assets. Year-to-date, BTC is up just 5.5%, a gain that now risks evaporating entirely if current conditions persist. In stark contrast, gold surged 5.6% in just the last week, continuing its strong rally as investors seek safer havens amid global volatility. While Bitcoin’s long-term structure remains intact, its short-term weakness reflects a tightening liquidity environment and growing skepticism about risk assets. Bitcoin Faces Harsh Comparison As Traditional Markets Outperform Axel Adler highlights how Bitcoin’s muted performance stands in sharp contrast to the impressive gains seen across traditional markets this year. His analysis paints a sobering picture of where capital has been flowing in 2025. Gold leads the pack with a staggering 55% year-to-date (YTD) increase, driven by global uncertainty and strong institutional demand. Copper follows with +27%, benefiting from industrial expansion and supply constraints. Meanwhile, risk assets like the Nasdaq (+21%) and S&P 500 (+16%) have also delivered consistent returns, reflecting continued investor confidence in equities despite macroeconomic headwinds. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s modest 5.5% YTD gain appears increasingly underwhelming. Adler notes that professional fund managers are often measured against the S&P 500 benchmark, meaning any underperformance tends to attract swift scrutiny. “If a fund manager delivers less than the S&P 500, they usually don’t stay in the job for long,” Adler remarks — a pointed reminder of how traditional assets continue to set the standard for performance. His final comment cuts to the heart of the matter: “You don’t need a Harvard degree to buy SPY.” The implication is clear — in a market where simplicity and stability outperform speculation, Bitcoin must prove its resilience or risk losing investor attention. Bitcoin Slips Below $100K as Selling Pressure Builds Bitcoin’s price has fallen sharply below the psychological $100,000 mark, currently hovering around $97,300 after losing more than 2% in the past 24 hours. The daily chart reveals a clear continuation of the recent downtrend, with BTC now trading well below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, signaling sustained weakness in short-term momentum. The next significant support zone sits near $94,000, where Bitcoin previously consolidated in early summer. A decisive breakdown below this level could open the door to deeper retracements toward the 200-day moving average near $88,000–$90,000. On the flip side, reclaiming $100,000 as support will be crucial for any potential recovery, as that level now acts as a strong resistance barrier. Volume data shows an uptick in sell-side activity, confirming growing pressure from profit-taking and possible liquidations. Despite the pullback, analysts suggest that the recent correction may serve as a market reset, allowing leverage to unwind and preparing for a healthier recovery phase. Bitcoin remains in a volatile consolidation period, with macro uncertainty and exchange inflows weighing on sentiment. Bulls must defend current levels to prevent momentum from shifting decisively toward a deeper mid-cycle correction.

After years of struggling with traditional financial systems, which often overlooked her, Sophia’s story is a testament to the potential of decentralized credit solutions in providing financial inclusion. Sophia’s financial journey was marked by constant stress over bills and lack of savings. Traditional banking systems offered little support, leaving her feeling trapped in an unbreakable cycle. However, everything changed when she discovered decentralized finance, a system that offers individuals the ability to earn stable yields through peer-to-peer lending and liquidity provision. “I had never heard of something like this before. At first, I didn’t believe it could work for me,” said Sophia. “But after researching and seeing how Credit Blockchain operated with transparency and UK regulatory compliance, I felt it was a real opportunity.” A Simple, Accessible Path to Financial Inclusion Credit Blockchain is a decentralized platform that allows users to deposit stablecoins into liquidity pools, earning stable returns. It is designed to be user-friendly, with no complicated trading required, making it accessible even for those without a background in finance. The platform’s compliance with UK regulations and use of smart contracts provides users with transparency and security. Sophia’s initial step into the platform was hesitant, but after just 24 hours, she was able to see her first yield payment—a small but meaningful milestone. “It wasn’t just about the money. It was the first time I felt a sense of empowerment and hope for the future,” she recalled. From Struggle to Stability Since joining Credit Blockchain, Sophia’s financial situation has improved significantly. She no longer worries about monthly bills and has even been able to move into a new home with her child. “For the first time, I’m not just surviving, I’m building a stable future,” she shared. The platform’s straightforward design, clear compliance with regulations, and secure wallet protections have given Sophia the confidence to continue using the service. “Credit Blockchain isn’t just a platform to me; it’s been a bridge to stability and a reminder that change is possible,” she said. Credit Blockchain’s Commitment to Security and Transparency Unlike many financial services, Credit Blockchain emphasizes transparency and security. The platform’s user-friendly interface, along with email verification and collateralization measures, ensure a safe experience for users like Sophia, who are new to decentralized finance. A Step Towards Financial Independence Sophia’s experience highlights the potential of decentralized finance to empower individuals who may have previously been excluded from traditional financial systems. By offering a simple, transparent, and secure way to earn passive income, Credit Blockchain is helping users like Sophia take control of their financial futures.

The firm transferred 43,415 BTC, worth $4.26 billion, to more than 100 addresses starting from 00:00 UTC. Social media immediately ignited with speculation of a liquidation event. But that narrative didn’t last long. Arkham Intelligence stepped in fast, clarifying that the transactions were routine custodian rotations, not sales. ON TODAY’S STRATEGY BITCOIN MOVEMENTS Since 00:00 UTC today, Strategy moved 43,415 BTC worth $4.26B to over 100 different addresses. Over the past two weeks, Strategy has been making transfers from Coinbase Custody (their existing custodian) to a new custodian. We believe… pic.twitter.com/RY9mcT8MDv — Arkham (@arkham) November 14, 2025 Michael Saylor himself confirmed the same on X: “There is no truth to this rumor.” Still, the timing of the transfers couldn’t have come at a worse moment, Bitcoin is already sliding below six figures, volatility is surging, and option-market pressure is intensifying. Why Strategy Moved Over $4B in BTC Today Arkham’s explanation aligns with Strategy’s historical patterns. For two weeks, the firm has been transitioning assets away from Coinbase Custody, its long-time custodian, to a new provider. We are ₿uying. pic.twitter.com/6g11E9G6pO — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 14, 2025 Today’s transfers are believed to include: Outflows from Coinbase to the new custodian Internal wallet restructuring by the new custodian Coinbase’s periodic internal wallet refreshes None of these movements represent selling activity, and Arkham emphasized that wallet movements ≠ asset liquidation. Anyone watching Strategy’s entity tags would have seen: 1. Similar transfers last week 2. Re-labeled addresses 3. Fresh custodian wallet assignments 4. Zero evidence of BTC hitting exchanges for sale This is standard operational rotation, but the market, already tense, reacted aggressively. Saylor Doubles Down: “We’re Buying. A Lot.” Saylor addressed the rumors again on CNBC, directly confronting the panic. “We’re buying. A lot. Monday’s update will surprise people.” The comment adds fuel to widespread speculation that Strategy may soon announce one of the largest BTC acquisition updates in months. The timing aligns with the firm’s typical quarterly treasury behavior, accumulate during high volatility phases and expand their long-term holdings when market fear peaks. Today’s fear is well-timed. 41,000 BTC and 228,000 ETH Options Expire, Market Reacts The calm surrounding Strategy’s custody rotations did little to soothe broader market pressures. Today delivered one of the heaviest options expiration events of the quarter. Bitcoin Options Expiry 41,000 BTC contracts expired Put–call ratio: 0.61 Max pain: $105,000 Notional value: $3.95B Ethereum Options Expiry 228,000 ETH contracts expired Put–call ratio: 0.59 Max pain: $3,475 Notional value: $730M The numbers paint a clear picture: the market is leaning toward protection, not speculation. Puts are gaining momentum. Volatility is rising. And traders are bracing for more downside. Bitcoin Breaks Below $100K Again Both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue their downward slide. BTC has dropped below $100,000, breaking the psychological threshold for the second time this month. The price shows no immediate rebound signals, and bearish sentiment is tightening its grip. ETH isn’t faring better, the asset has now recorded three consecutive monthly losses, a pattern that hasn’t occurred since early-cycle correction years. Market mood is shifting from cautious to pessimistic. Liquidity is thinning. Fear is spreading. Volatility Surges: IV Spikes Across BTC and ETH Analysts at Greeks.Live report a sharp rebound in implied volatility (IV) across major expiries. The market is preparing for big swings, likely downward. BTC IV Levels Near-term IV: approaching 50% Average IV: ~45% This marks one of the sharpest IV jumps since late Q3.

What used to be an unusual spike, elevated put buying, has now become a baseline market behavior. Puts now make up 30% of all BTC options trading, a figure Greeks.Live calls “the new normal.” The message is straightforward: Risk aversion is dominating. Traders aren’t betting on upside. They’re insulating themselves from further downside. Q4 is shaping up to be one of the worst performing quarters on record, driven by macro pressure, declining liquidity, and speculative cooling. Leveraged trading? analysts warn against it Given the mix of: Rising volatility Increasing put ratios Heavy BTC/ETH expiries A weakening BTC price floor Growing macroeconomic strain Analysts are urging caution. Greeks.Live summarized the market in one line: “Sentiment is deeply divided. Leveraged trading is inadvisable.” Retail traders are getting whipsawed by sudden long squeezes. Whales are staying hedged and patient. And institutional flows remain sideways. Custodian Rotations Shouldn’t Overshadow The Real Story While today’s $4.26B Strategy movements triggered temporary panic, the real story remains the broader market structure: High volatility Heavy expiries Macro pressure Weak spot demand Rising put-option dominance Sub-$100K BTC weakness Strategy’s decision to rotate custodians is routine, they’ve done it dozens of times. But the timing amplified community stress as Bitcoin struggles to maintain psychological support levels. Still, Saylor’s messaging is direct: nothing was sold, and the firm is preparing to buy aggressively. If Bitcoin stays in the mid-$90Ks, Strategy may use this volatility to expand its already massive BTC position. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

54421847,https://nulltx.com/?p=152675,1763184116,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Analyst Links BTX Capital to $25M POPCAT Manipulation on Hyperliquid,https://nulltx.com/analyst-links-btx-capital-to-25m-popcat-manipulation-on-hyperliquid/,"A new investigation from on-chain researcher @SpecterAnalyst is pointing toward one of the most aggressive market manipulation attempts seen on Hyperliquid this quarter, and the trail leads directly to BTX Capital and its founder, Vanessa Cao. According to the analyst, a coordinated attack involving 26 wallets, a $25 million artificial buy wall, and a web of transactions tied to OKX, Bybit, and prior $TST manipulation campaigns resulted in $4.9 million in losses for Hyperliquid’s liquidity provider (HLP). Meanwhile, the attacker likely covered their personal losses by taking the opposite position on centralized exchanges. Investigation into how @BTX_Capital and its founder @vc_btxcap are behind the token manipulation like $POPCAT on @HyperliquidX . They leverage their access to large capital to manipulate token prices and profit from it. pic.twitter.com/7BHmRmegxo — Specter (@SpecterAnalyst) November 13, 2025 The evidence paints a picture of a sophisticated price-action stunt designed to trigger liquidations, and a trading firm with enough capital to absorb millions in collateral losses to profit elsewhere. The Setup: A $25M Buy Wall That Never Intended to Fill On November 12 around 4PM UTC, Hyperliquid’s order books for $POPCAT suddenly showed life. A buy wall worth ~$25 million appeared near the $0.21 level. The signal was clear: heavy demand. That demand wasn’t real. More than 26 wallets placed synchronized orders to push sentiment upward. Traders reacted instantly, opening leveraged long positions into what looked like a major bullish move. Then the entire wall disappeared. The attacker pulled the bids, drained liquidity beneath the price, and triggered a chain reaction of forced liquidations across the board. The result: Attacker’s own collateral loss: ~$4 million HLP losses: ~$4.9 million Real profit engine: short positions on centralized exchanges This pattern matches textbook manipulation, except the financing behind it points to a deeper operation. The Wallet Trail: From POPCAT to TST to BTX Capital The wallets used in the $POPCAT stunt didn’t appear out of nowhere. Blockchain tracing shows the main wallet 0x0A11…773C3 was previously involved in the $TST manipulation event months prior. That wallet funded seven additional wallets in the POPCAT operation. From there, the chain grows: On August 4, the TST-linked wallet received 0.003 ETH from 0xad67. 0xad67 sent 0.0457 ETH to 0x9e8, which forwarded assets to 0xf6c. 0xf6c funded 0xc10, which deposited 598.6K USDT into OKX on August 10. The OKX deposit wallet involved, 0x71b578…, shows even more activity: Received 688.7K USDT from 0xbBf4 on July 3 Deposited 393.9K USDT to another OKX wallet on June 4 That secondary OKX wallet received 593K USDT from 0x01c8 on May 11 The same 0x01c8 wallet also funded fees for 0xC0a, which later deposited 506K USDT into a Bybit account: 0xaE7A4A99Db2d7eE28aE244F05a1833388321Ab72 This Bybit wallet is where the story turns unmistakable. It received 50 million $AKI tokens on Polygon from a multisig wallet (0x6cb) created by 0xf97. And 0xf97 connects directly to Vanessa Cao: On Ethereum, funded by vanessacao.eth On Polygon, funded by BTX Capital’s own wallet on March 6 These links position BTX Capital and its founder at the heart of the funding chain behind the wallets used in the POPCAT manipulation. BTX Capital’s Role: “Liquid Token Strategies” Taken Literally BTX Capital describes itself as a “liquid trading and investment firm” focused on liquid token strategies. Founded in 2019, the firm markets itself as a sophisticated player capable of moving large amounts of capital quickly. The investigation suggests they may be taking this mission statement quite literally. The size of the POPCAT buy wall, and the willingness to burn $4 million in personal collateral, signals a firm with deep liquidity and a high tolerance for risk when paired with profitable off-chain positioning. This isn’t the first time analysts have flagged tokens possibly influenced by BTX. The firm is suspected of involvement in several sudden, unnatural pumps on Hyperliquid, including: $ZEREBRO $JELLYJELLY $HIFI and potentially $ZEC In every case, the pattern is similar: on-chain manipulation, off-chain profit capture. UPDATE: @BTX_Capital just deleted every single post, repost, and reply except one on their page following my investigation into them being behind the $POPCAT manipulation. I was able to get their page look https://t.co/cetJ8OqzsE pic.twitter.com/DfXleV2XAM — Specter (@SpecterAnalyst) November 14, 2025 How They Profit: Manipulate On-Chain, Hedge Off-Chain The strategy is simple but deadly efficient. Step 1: Manipulate token price using overwhelming buy or sell pressure on Hyperliquid. Step 2: Wait for traders to take the bait. Step 3: Trigger liquidations through sudden reversals. Step 4: Capture profit using large short or long positions on centralized exchanges where liquidity is deeper and slippage is low. This is why the attackers could afford losing millions on Hyperliquid. Their real gains likely happened on OKX or Bybit. Unusual Silence: BTX Capital Wipes Its Page Perhaps the most telling moment came after the investigation surfaced. @BTX_Capital deleted every post, repost, and reply on their X account except one. The timing aligns precisely with @SpecterAnalyst publishing the wallet evidence. The move has only intensified suspicion. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The earnings report, released Friday night, showed that revenue for the September quarter jumped to $64.2 million, up sharply from $11.6 million in the same period last year. The company also expanded its gross margin to 56%, up from 49% in the previous quarter. All of this comes as crypto prices cool off after a red-hot run earlier in the year, with bitcoin falling another 2.6% on Friday alone. American Bitcoin gained momentum this year as traders bet on looser rules under President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House earlier this year. His sons are directly tied to the company: Eric Trump serves as co-founder and chief strategy officer, while Donald Trump Jr. is a stockholder. In a post-earnings call, Eric said, “Since our Nasdaq debut, we’ve added over 3,000 bitcoin to our reserves, steadily advancing among the world’s leading public bitcoin treasuries.” American Bitcoin now holds 4,004 bitcoin as of November 5, which is worth about $400 million based on Friday’s closing price. Trump family’s crypto push expands as mining costs fall American Bitcoin, a majority-owned unit of Hut 8 Corp, is the latest in a string of crypto ventures linked to the Trump family. That list also includes a meme coin and World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform partially owned by Donald. During the earnings call event, CEO Mike Ho emphasized their cost advantage, saying, “While conventional vehicles accumulate bitcoin at spots, we mine at less than half the cost.” The company continues to mine bitcoin using its own infrastructure, instead of buying it at market price. Eric also commented on the ongoing trade tensions with China, which have escalated since Donald’s return to office. He brushed aside concerns about the proposed 100% import tax on Chinese goods, saying the policy hasn’t affected their business, even though American Bitcoin sources mining hardware from China. Instead, Eric pointed to declining energy prices, saying it’s been a “major advantage” for their mining operations since his father took office. Bitcoin drop hits crypto stocks, but American Bitcoin stays the course After releasing the results, American Bitcoin’s stock briefly rose before dipping 1.3% in morning trading. Its movement mirrored the price of bitcoin, which tumbled as investors pulled out of risk assets. That’s common for crypto treasury stocks, since their reserve values are tied directly to token prices. Despite that, companies like American Bitcoin have kept growing their holdings, trying to lock in gains from earlier rallies. While the token’s price action has cooled off, interest in crypto hasn’t. The Trump administration has repeatedly stated its aim to make the U.S. a global leader in crypto, promising a lighter hand from regulators. But the family’s growing stake in the industry has raised alarms from ethics experts and political opponents, who say Donald’s involvement in policy and crypto projects could lead to conflicts of interest. Still, the numbers are clear: American Bitcoin has gone from red to black in one year. A $3.5 million net income, a $52.6 million jump in revenue, lower mining costs, and a growing bitcoin reserve, all while navigating market drops and political backlash, has put the Trump-backed company at the center of crypto’s political economy.

Retail Panic Spikes,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-slips-below-100k-again-as-liquidations-hit-1b-retail-panic-spikes/,"Bitcoin has broken below the $100,000 level for the second time this month, igniting another round of fear, doubt, and outright chaos across the market. The drop pushes BTC into a fresh zone of retail panic, a pattern that historically sets the stage for opportunistic buying as weak hands exit the market. And this time, the selloff comes with force. According to Binance market data, BTC dipped under 97,000 USDT, marking its lowest level since May 8. The asset now trades around 97,375 USDT, down 4.07% in the last 24 hours. It’s another sharp move in what has become one of Bitcoin’s most volatile months of 2025. But it’s not the price alone causing shockwaves, it’s the scale of the leverage wipeout that followed. Bitcoin has dumped below $100K for the second time this month. Predictably, this has caused a wave of FUD and concerned social media posts from retail traders.

Data from Coinglass shows: $1.022 billion total liquidations in 24 hours $887 million wiped from long positions $135 million from shorts It’s a clean sweep. Overleveraged bulls got hit the hardest, creating a feedback loop that dragged Bitcoin down faster as cascading forced sells accelerated the drop. This kind of liquidation profile usually signals one thing: retail traders were leaning heavily into high-risk leverage, expecting a bounce, and they got steamrolled. Social media reacted immediately, and the sentiment map tells a clear story. According to Binance market data, Bitcoin fell below 97,000 USDT, hitting its lowest level since May 8. It is currently trading at 97,375 USDT, down 4.07% in the past 24 hours. Data from Coinglass shows that total liquidations across the market reached $1.022 billion over the… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 14, 2025 Retail Sentiment Flips to Full Fear, A Historically Bullish Zone Santiment’s sentiment analysis paints the current emotional landscape with three simple boxes: Bullish/greedy bias – markets overheated Neutral bias – whale-driven movements Bearish/fearful bias – retail panic zones Right now, Bitcoin has slipped directly into the bearish/fearful zone, indicating that retail is capitulating. This is the exact environment where long-term players typically accumulate. Historically, heavy retail fear aligns with local bottoms because: Forced liquidations remove short-term leverage Retail panics and sells Whales step in and absorb liquidity Prices stabilize In other words, the panic everyone sees may actually be reducing downside risk, not increasing it. The more emotional retail becomes, the calmer experienced traders tend to get, and sentiment right now is flashing classic capitulation patterns. CryptoQuant: “This Correction Is Driven Primarily by the United States” While retail panic amplifies the volatility, on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant says the deeper drivers are far more structural. Their latest analysis highlights three key forces: 1. U.S. Liquidity Stress American liquidity conditions have tightened. This limits risk appetite and slows capital inflows into crypto, especially from U.S. institutions. 2. Long-Term Holders Taking Profits for Tax Purposes CryptoQuant notes a significant uptick in long-term holder (LTH) profit realization. With Bitcoin still up massively year-over-year, many U.S. holders are securing gains ahead of tax deadlines or rebalancing for the quarter. Bitcoin’s Decline Driven by U.S. Liquidity Stress, LTH Tax-Driven Profit Taking, and Persistent American Selling “Together, these factors form a clear narrative: the current correction is driven primarily by the United States.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/mIPbwqgM4r — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 14, 2025 3. Increased Selling Pressure From U.S. Based Investors Persistent American selling has formed the backbone of the current correction. Combined with liquidity stress, the sell pressure has amplified every downward move. CryptoQuant summarized it bluntly: “Together, these factors form a clear narrative: the current correction is driven primarily by the United States.” The data suggests that while U.S. markets are offloading, global demand hasn’t stepped in aggressively enough to neutralize the supply. Market Eyes $90K: Polymarket Traders Boost Probability to 73% While on-chain data and sentiment point toward capitulation, which usually precedes a bounce, prediction markets are leaning the other way. Polymarket traders now assign a 73% probability that Bitcoin drops below $90,000 in the short term. That’s a big uptick and reflects a growing belief that BTC hasn’t fully flushed leverage from the system. Prediction markets often track broader trader psychology rather than fundamentals. So while they’re not always accurate, they do show where traders are emotionally positioning, and right now, that’s clearly downward. Volatility Returns Just as Retail Loses Confidence Bitcoin’s pullback under $100K comes at a time when macro uncertainty and market-wide leverage clashes are creating dramatic daily swings. A month ago, BTC seemed stable above six figures. Today, traders are on edge as every bounce gets sold into within hours. The irony? This is exactly the kind of environment where long-term capital quietly enters. We’ve seen this pattern repeatedly: Panic Liquidations Forced sells Whale accumulation Trend reversal Retail rarely recognizes it in real time. Sentiment, Structure, and the Road Ahead Three dynamics now define the market: 1. Retail Panic Is Peaking Social sentiment is deep in the bearish zone. Historically, that’s when downside risk starts to flatten. 2. Structural U.S. Selling Remains Heavy CryptoQuant’s data suggests ongoing pressure from tax-driven profit taking and liquidity stress. These forces may continue to weigh on BTC until U.S. markets stabilize. 3. Prediction Markets Expect More Pain Polymarket’s pricing shows traders betting on at least one more leg downward. But markets often bottom when sentiment, leverage wipes, and fear align, and we’re close to that intersection now. Final Outlook: A Market Sitting at the Edge Bitcoin slipping below $100K, again, has reset expectations across the board. Retail is fearful. Leverage has been flushed. U.S. liquidity remains tight. Prediction markets lean bearish. But beneath all the fear, Bitcoin has entered a zone that historically favors disciplined buyers over emotional sellers. As the crypto market recalibrates, all eyes remain on whether BTC can recover above the psychological six-figure line, or whether the 73% probability of a sub-$90K retest becomes reality. One thing is certain: volatility is back, and the next major move is loading. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The company said it earned an adjusted profit of 1 cent for the September quarter, which flips the 6-cent loss recorded a year earlier. Revenue hit $384,000, which is a massive jump from last year and far above the $100,000 analysts expected going into the announcement. Traders didn’t wait, because Quantum Computing stock surged more than 7% almost immediately in extended trading to 11.38, after already rallying by more than 5% during the regular session, though the same stock is also still down 42% YTD. The company said the revenue spike came from larger development service work, more custom hardware contracts, and the first dollars coming in from cloud access to its Dirac-3 optimization system. Analysts also expect about $200,000 in revenue for Quantum Computing in Q4, based on the guidance discussed during the call. The business keeps building out its tech stack. The team operates a foundry in Tempe, Arizona, where it makes photonics-based quantum machines, which are the systems behind all of this. Quantum Computing said the quantum sector is still volatile this year because of debates involving Nvidia about how soon commercial-level quantum products will land in the real world. But for now, Quantum Computing carries a Composite Rating of 45 out of 99 from IBD’s Stock Checkup and an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-minus, which reflects how the stock behaved across the last 13 weeks. Quantum Computing boosts liquidity and outlines its outlook Interim Chief Executive Yuping Huang said during the briefing that the firm finished the quarter with $352 million in cash and $461 million in investments. Yuping said the business also raised $750 million after the quarter ended, which brings the total liquid position to more than $1.5 billion. Yuping said this pile of money is what the team plans to use to push the long-term strategy the company has talked about for the last year. The company also answered questions about how the machines work.Quantum systems run on subatomic behavior and need exotic hardware such as supercold chips.These systems are built to solve problems regular computing can’t touch. That’s why 2025 has been a chaotic year across the entire sector. Investors are still trying to figure out which teams will build products that can actually work at large scale. Quantum Computing execs discuss partnerships, fabs, banks, and security pressure Analysts asked Yuping for more details on the work with Poet Technologies. Yuping said the partnership uses Poet’s tech for next-gen high-speed transceivers that the telecom world sees as a route to faster internet. Yuping also said the team is studying new partnerships with other groups building for telecom and datacom use cases. Another question was about quantum security tools already sold to a top-five U.S. bank. Yuping said the company is in talks with other large firms and is looking at how its tools can be built into photonic integrated chips. Yuping said these chips could serve wireless and aerospace companies working to solve long-term quantum-internet problems. Chief Financial Officer Christopher Roberts was asked about spending. Christopher said Fab 1 is fully active and will add high-speed testing tools that cost around $2 million. Christopher said Fab 2 is being planned to expand machine production and meet rising demand for thin-film chips at large volume. Christopher also answered a question about mergers. Christopher said the company is reviewing deals that could bring new customers, revenue, and product lines. Christopher said these deals would help speed up commercialization and help the company close important technology gaps. The final question was about rising fears that quantum machines could break RSA-2048 encryption. Yuping said more firms are looking at quantum-secured internet because of that threat. Yuping said the company’s system works with today’s fiber-based telecom lines, which makes it possible to build secure networks with tech companies already use.

The latest data reveals an exciting development: BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF just experienced a remarkable 15% increase in institutional holders during Q3. This surge signals a major shift in how traditional finance views cryptocurrency investments. Why Are BlackRock IBIT Institutional Holders Growing So Rapidly? The third quarter brought significant growth for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. According to TraderT analysis, the number of BlackRock IBIT institutional holders jumped by 15% compared to the previous quarter. This growth isn’t just about numbers – it represents a fundamental change in investment strategy among major financial players. More importantly, the proportion of institutional investors among all IBIT holders increased by one percentage point to reach 29%.

CEO McAndrew Rudisill, who is also chairman, told investors that “this quarter marked a transformative leap for ETHZilla, establishing us as a technology leader in DeFi and positioning us for real‑world asset tokenization,” and he said the company placed its Ethereum holdings into major restaking platforms to produce compounding yield and support network security. McAndrew said the company’s new partnership with Liquidity.io, backed by a 15% stake in its parent Satschel, gives ETHZilla the setup it needs to begin tokenizing real‑world and financial assets on Ethereum Layer 2. He said the company wants to start putting these assets on‑chain in the coming weeks and wants to build a position inside what he described as a future multi‑trillion‑dollar market. ETHZilla raises new money and expands restaking operations ETHZilla said it secured $931 million in new institutional capital across three financings during August and September. The company said that the first deal was a $425 million PIPE on August 4, followed by a $156 million convertible note on August 11, and then a $360 million convertible note on September 23. ETHZilla told investors that this capital came from firms that support its pivot into crypto tokenization and its attempt to build infrastructure for real‑world assets. Management said ETHZilla partnered with Electric Capital to earn about 7.5% yield on its deployed Ethereum during the quarter. The company also deployed $257 million into Ether.fi and Puffer Finance to expand its liquid restaking footprint. ETHZilla said this approach helped the firm increase income while keeping exposure to Ethereum’s upside. McAndrew said the strategy creates high‑margin cash flow directly on‑chain and improves the company’s capital efficiency. ETHZilla also detailed the terms of its Liquidity.io partnership, which includes a $15 million investment and the 15% equity stake in Satschel. The company said this deal gives it exclusive Ethereum L2 listing rights for tokenized assets. Management said this structure will allow it to issue assets that are fully compliant while offering both primary and secondary market access on the same network. ETHZilla reshapes its portfolio, expands leadership, and reports Q3 figures ETHZilla said it repurchased 2,099,472 shares for $46.3 million, including fees, under its board‑authorized $250 million share buyback plan. The company said it plans to continue to repurchase shares below NAV with the remaining funds from its recent Ethereum sale when it believes the move is accretive. The company also said it resolved all litigation tied to its old identity as 180 Life Sciences and sold off its legacy biotech assets. ETHZilla will continue to hold its previously acquired iGaming assets until its tokenization‑related cash flow begins. Management said this change gives the firm a cleaner structure as it grows its crypto tokenization platform. The leadership team changed as well. McAndrew became chairman and CEO, John Saunders became CFO, John Kristoff became SVP of corporate communications and investor relations, and Max van der Griend became VP of corporate finance. ETHZilla also added Jason New, vice chairman of investment banking at Lazard, to its board. The near‑term outlook includes plans to bring revenue‑producing tokenized assets on‑chain within weeks and expectations for positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. ETHZilla said yield from L2 protocols should land between 3.5% and 4.5% if no new Ethereum is deployed. If more Ethereum is used, ETHZilla said yields could improve. The company also plans to continue buying shares below NAV under its same $250 million authorization. For the quarter, ETHZilla reported $4.1 million in revenue, all from Ethereum staking and incentive rewards earned since mid‑August. Gross profit matched revenue. The company reported zero CapEx and said it ended the period with $559 million in cash and equivalents. ETHZilla posted a $208.7 million net loss, almost all of it tied to one‑time non‑cash charges from July’s transaction expenses and write‑downs, and about $208.4 million of that amount came from those fees. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.5 million.

Santiment’s latest analysis suggests this widespread consensus might actually be a warning sign for further declines. When too many traders chant ‘bottom’ in unison, history shows the real low often lies ahead. Why Market Bottom Consensus Often Fails Crypto analytics firm Santiment recently dropped a crucial insight that every trader should understand. Their data reveals that genuine market bottoms rarely occur when everyone expects them. Instead, true bottoms materialize when most market participants still fear further drops. Consider this pattern: when social media fills with ‘Bitcoin bottom’ calls and traders confidently declare the worst is over, that’s often the signal to remain cautious. Santiment’s historical analysis shows such optimistic consensus typically precedes additional price declines. How Can You Spot a Real Market Bottom? True market bottoms share distinct characteristics that differ from temporary support levels. Here’s what Santiment’s data reveals about genuine turning points: Limited social media discussion about bottoms Most traders expecting further declines Reduced trading volume and interest Minimal ‘buy the dip’ enthusiasm The current environment, where Bitcoin bottom calls trend across platforms, contradicts these historical markers. This divergence suggests we might not have seen the final low yet. What Does This Mean for Your Trading Strategy? Santiment’s findings provide valuable guidance for navigating volatile markets. Instead of following the crowd’s bottom calls, consider these alternative approaches: Wait for capitulation: Real bottoms often follow extreme fear Monitor sentiment data: Use tools like Santiment to gauge true market mood Diversify entry points: Avoid going all-in on suspected bottoms Watch volume patterns: Genuine reversals show distinct volume characteristics Remember, the most profitable opportunities often emerge when conventional wisdom appears most certain. When everyone agrees we’ve hit bottom, that’s precisely when you should question the consensus. The Psychology Behind Market Bottom Calls Why do traders consistently misidentify bottoms during declines? Human psychology plays a crucial role. After sustained losses, market participants desperately seek signs of reversal. This emotional need often overrides objective analysis. Moreover, social media amplifies these psychological tendencies. When influential accounts declare a bottom, their followers often echo the sentiment without independent verification. This creates the illusion of widespread agreement where none truly exists. Actionable Insights for Smart Trading Santiment’s research offers more than just warnings—it provides practical guidance. Here are key takeaways for implementing their findings: Use sentiment data as a contrarian indicator Combine social metrics with technical analysis Maintain cash reserves for true capitulation events Track mentions of ‘market bottom’ as potential reversal signals By understanding these patterns, you can avoid common pitfalls and position yourself for genuine recovery phases rather than false dawns. Frequently Asked Questions Why does market bottom consensus often signal further declines? When too many traders agree on a bottom, it suggests most potential buyers have already entered positions. This leaves limited buying power to drive prices higher, often leading to further declines. How reliable is Santiment’s market bottom analysis? Santiment’s findings are based on historical data across multiple market cycles. While not infallible, their sentiment analysis has consistently identified patterns that precede significant market moves. What indicators should I watch for genuine bottoms? Focus on extreme fear levels, declining social media activity, reduced trading volumes, and widespread expectation of further declines rather than bottom calls. Can social media sentiment predict market movements? While not predictive in isolation, social sentiment serves as a valuable contrarian indicator when combined with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. How quickly should I act on market bottom signals? Genuine bottoms typically develop over time rather than occurring at precise moments. Consider scaling into positions rather than making large, immediate commitments. Does this analysis apply to all cryptocurrencies? While most relevant to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, sentiment patterns can vary for smaller altcoins due to different market dynamics and participant behavior.

The drop wiped out more than $120 billion in total valuation, creating uncertainty across major centralized exchanges and pushing traders toward assets showing stronger stability. A number of investors have been looking at alternative blockchain projects with real utility, and Remittix (RTX) has been one of the names circulating across crypto forums as the downturn unfolded. The interest comes from its role in crypto-to-fiat transfers, which has become a talking point as Bitcoin volatility rises. Bitcoin Trading Activity Spikes Across Exchanges In contrast, Bitcoin is trading at $96,617.84, a significant drop of 3.51% over the past 24 hours. Activity, though, remains fierce, with trading volume surging to $127.91 billion, up 61.51%, as traders shuffle their portfolios. The $1.93 trillion market cap maintains Bitcoin’s position as No. 1 among cryptocurrencies, but the selloff of late has reignited discussions about which cryptocurrencies will benefit if the correction continues. This wide uncertainty has re-awakened interest in assets linked to crypto, solving real-world problems and low gas-fee crypto options, which draw users from outside typical trading circles. Bitcoin downturns often influence sentiment, and this latest move has pushed many traders to evaluate upcoming crypto projects and new altcoin to watch narratives more closely. Growing Focus on RTX as Utility Demand Strengthens As Bitcoin adjusts, Remittix stands out for its steady progress in the payments niche. The project runs at $0.1166 per token and has crossed $28.1 million raised from private funding, supporting development of a global payments rail designed for direct crypto-to-bank transfers. More than 685 million tokens have already been acquired by early supporters. A key update from the team is the expanded Beta Wallet program, now open to more iOS users. The team has also revealed future listings on BitMart and LBANK, giving users clarity on where the RTX token will be available after launch. These listings form part of a wider push to strengthen accessibility as interest grows from those looking for crypto with real utility rather than speculative momentum.

A rebound is possible, yet confirmation only comes if FLOKI manages to break above $0.0000600–$0.0000635. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of November 15, Floki is attempting a small recovery around $0.0000559 after several days of controlled bleeding, yet the broader structure remains bearish. The coin’s price is still pinned beneath the mid-Bollinger band at $0.0000635, and the lower band at $0.0000517 continues to act as the primary support zone. The slight bounce from that lower band suggests sellers may be slowing down, but the lack of a decisive candle shows buyers are not reclaiming momentum yet. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram is still negative, and the lines remain open to the downside, signaling that bearish momentum hasn’t fully cooled. FLOKI’s RSI is at 39 and is climbing, but it is still below equilibrium, indicating that the market is recovering from oversold conditions rather than demonstrating genuine strength. If today’s rebound expands, the first resistance is $0.0000600–$0.0000635. A rejection there likely ushers in another retest of $0.0000520. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, price is hovering around $0.0000559–$0.0000562 with a slow drift into a sideways consolidation pattern. The Alligator lines are still fanned downward, emphasizing that the micro-trend remains bearish even though sellers are losing aggression. The candles from past sessions reflect indecision, with repeated wicks on both sides indicating a tug-of-war. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD bars remain red but are becoming less negative, hinting that momentum is flattening rather than continuing to deepen. Until price closes above the green Alligator line around $0.0000571, bulls will struggle to generate even a short-term surge. A break above $0.0000571 could open breathing room toward $0.0000583, while failure here likely brings another price dip to $0.0000550.

FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

The venture capital giant recently disclosed it sold exactly half of its Bitmine stake, raising important questions about institutional crypto strategy. What Does This Bitmine Stake Reduction Mean? The SEC filing reveals Founders Fund reduced its Bitmine stake by 50%, leaving Thiel with 2,547,001 shares. This partial divestment comes at a time when Bitmine maintains substantial Ethereum exposure. The move suggests a strategic rebalancing rather than a complete exit from cryptocurrency investments. Market analysts are closely watching this development because Peter Thiel has been a long-time cryptocurrency advocate. His fund’s decision to sell half its Bitmine stake indicates careful portfolio management rather than bearish sentiment toward the crypto sector overall. Why is Bitmine Important in the Crypto Ecosystem? Bitmine represents a unique bridge between traditional markets and cryptocurrency. As a Nasdaq-listed company with significant Ethereum focus, it offers institutional investors regulated exposure to crypto assets. The Bitmine stake adjustment signals several key insights: Portfolio rebalancing rather than complete exit strategy Risk management in volatile market conditions Strategic positioning for future opportunities Liquidity needs for new investments How Does This Affect Ethereum Investors? The reduced Bitmine stake doesn’t necessarily reflect negative sentiment toward Ethereum specifically. In fact, Bitmine continues its Ethereum-focused investment strategy. However, institutional moves like this often create ripple effects across related assets. Ethereum investors should monitor how other institutional players respond to this Bitmine stake adjustment. Large-scale portfolio changes by respected funds like Founders Fund can influence market sentiment and trading patterns in the short term. What’s Next for Institutional Crypto Investment? This Bitmine stake reduction comes during a period of increased regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. The careful, measured approach shown by Founders Fund suggests sophisticated investors are becoming more strategic about their cryptocurrency exposure. Key factors driving institutional decisions include: Regulatory developments Market volatility patterns Portfolio diversification needs Long-term growth prospects Conclusion: Strategic Moves in Evolving Markets The partial Bitmine stake sale by Peter Thiel’s fund demonstrates thoughtful portfolio management in dynamic market conditions. Rather than signaling reduced confidence in cryptocurrency, this move shows institutional investors are maturing in their approach to digital assets. As markets continue to evolve, such strategic adjustments will become more common. The key takeaway is that sophisticated investors like Founders Fund remain engaged with cryptocurrency while managing risk through careful position sizing. Frequently Asked Questions How much of its Bitmine stake did Founders Fund sell? Founders Fund sold exactly half of its Bitmine stake, reducing its position by 50% while maintaining 2,547,001 shares in the company. Why would Peter Thiel reduce his Bitmine exposure? There are several possible reasons including portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, risk management, or freeing up capital for new investment opportunities. Does this affect Bitmine’s Ethereum investments? No, this stake reduction doesn’t directly impact Bitmine’s operations or its Ethereum investment strategy. It only changes Founders Fund’s ownership percentage. What does this mean for other crypto investors? While notable, this single transaction shouldn’t dramatically alter individual investment strategies. It’s more indicative of institutional portfolio management practices. Will Founders Fund completely exit its Bitmine position? The 50% reduction suggests a measured approach rather than complete exit. Maintaining half the stake indicates continued interest in Bitmine’s prospects. How does this compare to other institutional crypto moves? This partial reduction aligns with patterns of sophisticated investors taking profits while maintaining core positions in promising crypto-related companies. Found this analysis helpful?

Seasoned Ethereum Holders Are Increasing Their Distribution As explained by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the 3 to 10 years old Ethereum holders have notably raised their spending recently. These investors belong to a broader group known as the long-term holder (LTH) cohort, which has a holding time cutoff of 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the LTHs as a whole can be considered diamond hands. Since the 3 to 10 years old ETH investors would be old even by the standard of the LTHs, they may be assumed to include the most stalwart of HODLers. Given this stature of the cohort, the behavior of its investors may be worth keeping an eye on, for selling from them could be a sign that market conditions have forced even the most seasoned hands into exiting. One way to track the behavior of the group is through the Spent Volume by Age indicator, which tracks the transactions that the various investor age bands are making on the blockchain. Below is the chart for the metric shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in its 90-day moving average (MA) for Ethereum over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the Spent Volume by Age has shot up for the investors belonging in the 3 to 10 years holding time bracket since late-August. At present, the 90-day MA is sitting above 45,000 ETH, meaning the veterans of the market are selling tokens worth $139 million every day. “This marks the highest spending level by seasoned investors since Feb 2021,” noted the analytics firm. Besides the selloff in February, this group also participated in almost the same level of distribution alongside the bull run top in the second half of that year. As the latest wave of selling has arrived, Ethereum has witnessed bearish momentum. It only remains to be seen whether this decline in the price would lead into another bear market like in late 2021, or if the bull run will regain its footing as in February 2021. LTH selling isn’t the only bearish factor that ETH has had to deal with recently. As the chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn shows, the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have witnessed significant outflows over the past month. From the above chart, it’s apparent that Ethereum spot ETFs are seeing a negative 30-day netflow of $1.21 billion, while Bitcoin has had it even worse with $2.80 billion in net outflows. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,100, down over 4% in the last week.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum HODLers|Ethereum Long-Term Holders|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 06:00:04

This strategic move reinforces the growing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum and signals strong belief in the future of cryptocurrency investments among traditional financial giants. Why Is Goldman Sachs Doubling Down on Spot ETH ETF? The investment bank’s latest acquisition brings its total holdings to 42.3 million shares, maintaining its position as the largest institutional holder of BlackRock’s Ethereum fund. This substantial investment highlights several key advantages of spot ETH ETF investments: Direct exposure to Ethereum price movements Regulatory compliance and security Institutional-grade custody solutions Simplified investment process for traditional investors How Does This Impact the Spot ETH ETF Market? Goldman Sachs’ continued dominance in the spot ETH ETF space creates significant market implications. The bank now controls the largest institutional position in BlackRock’s fund, while global hedge fund Millennium Management follows as the second-largest holder with 28.1 million shares. This concentration of institutional interest demonstrates: Growing institutional confidence in Ethereum Increased liquidity for the spot ETH ETF market Potential for broader cryptocurrency adoption Enhanced credibility for digital asset investments What Challenges Face Spot ETH ETF Investors? Despite the growing institutional interest, investors considering spot ETH ETF positions should remain aware of potential challenges. Market volatility remains a significant factor, along with regulatory uncertainties and technological risks associated with blockchain networks. However, the continued investment from major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs suggests these concerns are being carefully managed through: Sophisticated risk management strategies Long-term investment horizons Diversified portfolio approaches Expert market analysis Actionable Insights for Spot ETH ETF Consideration For investors inspired by Goldman Sachs’ move, several practical steps can help navigate the spot ETH ETF landscape. First, research the specific terms and fees associated with different spot ETH ETF offerings. Second, consider your investment timeline and risk tolerance. Third, monitor regulatory developments that could affect spot ETH ETF valuations. Finally, remember that institutional moves like Goldman Sachs’ significant spot ETH ETF acquisition often signal broader market trends worth watching. The Future of Institutional Spot ETH ETF Investment The continued accumulation of spot ETH ETF shares by major financial institutions points toward a maturing cryptocurrency market. As more traditional players enter the space through vehicles like BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF, we can expect increased market stability, improved regulatory frameworks, and greater mainstream acceptance. This trend suggests that spot ETH ETF investments may become a standard component of diversified institutional portfolios. The stunning expansion of Goldman Sachs’ spot ETH ETF position represents more than just a single investment decision—it signals a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. With the bank maintaining its leadership in BlackRock’s Ethereum fund and other institutions following suit, the spot ETH ETF market appears poised for continued growth and institutional adoption. Frequently Asked Questions What is a spot ETH ETF? A spot ETH ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Ethereum tokens, providing investors with direct exposure to ETH price movements without needing to manage cryptocurrency wallets or private keys. Why is Goldman Sachs investing in spot ETH ETF? Goldman Sachs likely sees long-term value in Ethereum and prefers the regulated, secure structure of a spot ETH ETF for institutional investment rather than direct cryptocurrency ownership. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large institutional investments in spot ETH ETF typically increase demand for underlying Ethereum tokens, potentially supporting price stability and growth over time. Can individual investors buy the same spot ETH ETF? Yes, individual investors can purchase shares of BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF through standard brokerage accounts, though specific availability may vary by region and platform. What risks come with spot ETH ETF investment? Spot ETH ETF investments carry market volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty, and technological risks associated with the Ethereum network, similar to direct cryptocurrency ownership. How does this compare to Bitcoin ETF investments? While similar in structure, spot ETH ETF provides exposure to Ethereum’s different use cases and market dynamics compared to Bitcoin-focused products.

This strategic Multicoin Capital Ethena investment signals strong institutional confidence in synthetic dollar technology and its potential to transform digital finance. The announcement came directly from senior investor Vishal Kankani via social media platform X, creating immediate buzz throughout the cryptocurrency community. Why is Multicoin Capital Betting Big on Ethena? Multicoin Capital’s co-founder Kyle Samani confirmed the firm has built what he described as a ‘large position’ in ENA throughout this year. While specific investment amounts remain undisclosed, the commitment level speaks volumes about their conviction. This isn’t just another crypto play – it’s a calculated bet on three converging trends that are reshaping global finance as we know it. The investment focuses on Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, which employs an innovative yield-generation strategy. Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDe utilizes a fully collateralized, delta-neutral approach that captures yield through basis trading. This sophisticated method allows the protocol to profit from market demand for leverage while maintaining price stability. How Does Ethena’s Synthetic Dollar Technology Work? Ethena’s approach represents a significant evolution in stablecoin design.

Fed member Lorie Logan maintained her hawkish stance, stating in December that she would not support another interest rate cut. Logan had also opposed the cut at the October meeting, highlighting the risks of high inflation. In his statement, Logan stated that inflation is still above target and the upward trend continues: “Looking at the December meeting, it’s hard for me to support another rate cut unless we see strong evidence that inflation is falling faster than I expected, or a more significant cooling in the labor market than a gradual slowdown.” Related News: Death Cross Alert in Bitcoin (BTC) - Watch Out for Tomorrow, Analyst Warns Meanwhile, fellow Fed member Stephen Miran adopted a more dovish stance, arguing that recent data provided a strong case for a rate cut. In his assessment on November 15th, he said that all economic data released since the September meeting pointed to a more lenient policy stance. Milan noted that inflation was better than expected, while the labor market weakened significantly: “All the data we've received supports a dovish stance. Under these circumstances, we need to be more dovish, not the other way around.” *This is not investment advice.

This alarming development follows the devastating $100 million exploit that rocked the DeFi community in early July. According to blockchain analytics firm Onchain-Lenz, the perpetrator is systematically moving stolen Ethereum to the controversial mixing service, raising serious concerns about fund recovery and DeFi security. How is the Balancer hacker moving the stolen funds? The Balancer hacker has adopted a sophisticated laundering strategy that involves multiple steps. First, the perpetrator transfers the stolen ETH to an intermediary address. Then, the funds move to Tornado Cash in carefully calculated batches of 100 ETH each. This methodical approach suggests the hacker understands blockchain tracking techniques and aims to obscure the money trail effectively. Security experts note this pattern is common among experienced cybercriminals. By using intermediate addresses and batch transfers, the Balancer hacker attempts to complicate forensic analysis. However, blockchain analytics companies continue monitoring the movement, hoping to identify potential weaknesses in the laundering scheme. What made Balancer vulnerable to this massive hack? The July 3rd exploit resulted from a critical vulnerability in Balancer’s smart contract code. This security flaw allowed the Balancer hacker to drain funds from multiple pools simultaneously. The attack highlights ongoing challenges in DeFi security, particularly regarding: Smart contract auditing processes Code review and testing protocols Rapid response mechanisms for detected vulnerabilities Insurance and recovery options for affected users Despite previous security audits, the vulnerability remained undetected until exploitation occurred. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even established DeFi protocols face significant security risks. Why is Tornado Cash the preferred choice for crypto hackers? Tornado Cash has become the go-to tool for cybercriminals seeking to obscure cryptocurrency transactions. The Ethereum-based mixer provides privacy by breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses. For the Balancer hacker and similar perpetrators, this service offers several advantages: Decentralized operation makes it difficult to shut down Non-custodial design means no central party controls funds Proven track record of effectively obscuring transaction history Relatively easy to use compared to other mixing methods However, regulatory pressure on privacy tools continues to increase. The U.S. Treasury Department already sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, making it illegal for American citizens to use the service. What does this mean for DeFi security and regulation? The ongoing movement of stolen funds by the Balancer hacker underscores critical issues in decentralized finance. As protocols handle increasingly large amounts of value, security becomes paramount. This incident likely will accelerate several developments: Enhanced regulatory scrutiny of DeFi platforms Improved security auditing standards and practices Greater adoption of insurance protocols and risk mitigation tools Increased collaboration between projects on security matters The community must address these challenges collectively to ensure DeFi’s long-term viability and user protection. Can the stolen funds be recovered or tracked? While Tornado Cash complicates tracking, recovery efforts continue through multiple channels. Blockchain analytics firms work with exchanges and law enforcement to identify the Balancer hacker and potentially freeze funds. However, complete recovery remains challenging due to: The anonymous nature of blockchain transactions Jurisdictional complexities in international investigations Technical limitations of current tracking methods The sophistication of modern money laundering techniques Victims of the hack should monitor official Balancer communications for updates on recovery efforts and potential compensation plans. Frequently Asked Questions How much ETH did the Balancer hacker steal? The Balancer hacker stole over $100 million worth of Ethereum in the July 3rd exploit, making it one of the largest DeFi hacks this year. What is Tornado Cash and how does it work? Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based privacy tool that mixes cryptocurrency transactions to break the link between sender and receiver addresses, making funds harder to trace. Can authorities track funds through Tornado Cash? While Tornado Cash makes tracking difficult, advanced blockchain analysis techniques and coordination with exchanges can sometimes identify laundered funds, though success rates vary. What should Balancer users do now? Affected users should monitor official Balancer communications, check if their funds were in vulnerable pools, and follow security best practices for future DeFi interactions. Has Balancer taken steps to prevent future hacks? Yes, Balancer has implemented security patches, enhanced monitoring, and is working with security firms to prevent similar incidents, though specific details may be limited for security reasons. Are other DeFi protocols at similar risk? All DeFi protocols face security risks, but the level varies based on code quality, auditing processes, and security measures. This incident highlights the importance of thorough security practices across the ecosystem. Help spread awareness about DeFi security!

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/canary-capital-to-pause-on-etf-filings-following-xrp-etf-launch-heres-why/,"As reported by CoinDesk, Canary Capital is likely to pause submissions for new cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the remainder of 2025 after completing filings for all tokens currently eligible under existing regulatory frameworks. The firm’s CEO, Steve McClurg, confirmed that the company has reached a point where additional filings can’t meet the current criteria set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP ETF Debuts Amidst Active Market Interest This week, Canary Capital launched its XRP ETF. It immediately attracted notable attention . It shows demand from institutions for the XRP-backed product. The ETF opened with $58 million in trading volume, as Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that it was one of the most successful ETF launches this year. McClurg, who had previously predicted that the XRP ETF would likely double Solana’s performance , reiterated this prediction, attributing this potential to the broader familiarity of XRP among traditional finance participants and institutions compared to Solana, which has a stronger presence in crypto-native communities. Regulatory Framework Limits New Filings McClurg emphasized that Canary has filed applications for all assets that meet the SEC’s generic listing standards . These standards permit certain crypto-backed ETFs to proceed without undergoing the agency’s lengthy review process. To qualify, a cryptocurrency must satisfy conditions such as maintaining a futures market with at least six months of trading history. According to McClurg, only a limited number of digital assets currently meet these requirements, constraining the firm’s ability to submit additional applications. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Focus Shifts to Existing Products McClurg previously predicted inflows of $5 billion within the first month of the XRP ETF launch. With the XRP and Solana ETFs now live, Canary Capital intends to concentrate on managing these funds while monitoring regulatory developments. McClurg noted that future launches will depend on whether additional cryptocurrencies meet the generic listing standards or can obtain approval through the SEC’s more detailed 19b-4 authorization process, which involves a comprehensive review of ETF applications. Canary Capital’s pause on new ETF filings reflects both regulatory constraints and a strategic focus on managing existing products. The firm aims to ensure recently launched ETFs, including XRP and Solana funds, perform effectively and remain compliant with SEC guidelines. While new ETF launches are unlikely in the near term, the company is prepared to act once additional digital assets meet eligibility requirements.

According to a recent Bloomberg analysis, DAT financing models are creating a dangerous situation where retail investors bear the brunt of massive financial risks. The shocking reality is that these structures have already cost everyday investors approximately $17 billion. What Are DAT Financing Models and Why Should You Care? DAT financing models refer to the funding strategies used by Digital Asset Treasury companies. These are publicly traded firms that hold significant cryptocurrency reserves as corporate assets. However, the way these DAT financing models operate has raised serious concerns among financial experts and regulators alike. The core issue lies in how these companies raise capital. Instead of traditional cash investments, they’re increasingly using what’s called “in-kind contribution” structures. This means they contribute their own tokens rather than actual money during fundraising rounds. How Do DAT Financing Models Transfer Risk to Retail Investors? The problem with current DAT financing models becomes clear when we examine the token valuation process. Many tokens used in these contributions share common characteristics that create substantial risk: They are often unlisted or have extremely low liquidity Objective valuation becomes nearly impossible Shareholders may invest at inflated prices Market corrections reveal the true, lower value When the market eventually corrects these overvaluations, retail investors absorb the majority of losses. The Bloomberg report, citing research from 10x Research, highlights that this isn’t just theoretical – it’s already happened on a massive scale. What $17 Billion in Losses Reveals About DAT Financing Models The staggering $17 billion in estimated losses demonstrates the real-world impact of flawed DAT financing models. This isn’t minor market fluctuation; it represents systematic risk transfer from corporations to individual investors. Moreover, the structure of these DAT financing models creates information asymmetry. Corporate insiders understand the true value and liquidity constraints of their tokens, while retail investors operate with limited transparency. This imbalance creates an environment where losses become almost inevitable for the unprepared. How Can Investors Protect Themselves from Risky DAT Financing Models? If you’re considering investing in companies using DAT financing models, thorough due diligence becomes essential. The report recommends several critical assessment areas: Token structure analysis – Understand the underlying assets Contribution method evaluation – Scrutinize how investments are made Liquidity risk assessment – Check trading volumes and market depth Post-listing performance tracking – Monitor how tokens perform after listing Remember that sophisticated DAT financing models often appear complex by design. If you cannot clearly understand how the investment works and where the risks lie, it’s better to avoid the opportunity altogether. The Bottom Line: Navigating DAT Financing Models Safely The exposure of problematic DAT financing models serves as a crucial warning for all cryptocurrency investors. While innovation in digital asset management continues to evolve, basic investment principles remain unchanged. Transparency, proper valuation, and risk awareness should guide every investment decision. As the cryptocurrency market matures, we can expect increased regulatory scrutiny of DAT financing models. However, investors must take personal responsibility for understanding these structures before committing capital. The $17 billion lesson should remind us all that when something seems too good to be true, it usually is. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are DAT financing models? DAT financing models refer to the fundraising methods used by Digital Asset Treasury companies. These are publicly traded firms that hold significant cryptocurrency concentrations as corporate assets and use various structures to raise capital. How do DAT financing models transfer risk to retail investors? They primarily transfer risk through in-kind contributions of unlisted or low-liquidity tokens, making accurate valuation difficult. Retail investors often buy at inflated prices and bear most losses when market corrections occur. What are the red flags in risky DAT financing models? Key red flags include: unlisted tokens, difficult-to-verify valuations, complex contribution structures, lack of transparency about liquidity, and promises of guaranteed returns. How can I research DAT financing models before investing? Thoroughly examine token structures, contribution methods, liquidity risks, historical performance, and independent third-party analyses. Always verify claims through multiple sources. Are all DAT financing models risky? Not necessarily, but the current structures highlighted by Bloomberg show systematic issues. Investors should evaluate each opportunity individually and prioritize transparency and proper valuation. What regulatory changes might affect DAT financing models? We can expect increased SEC scrutiny, better disclosure requirements, standardized valuation methods, and enhanced investor protection measures as regulators catch up with these innovative structures.

As new digital models grow, from crypto-based platforms to new social gaming formats, users are often left navigating a complex area. This uncertainty has driven a massive interest in established, legally-defined models. For example, a quick search for a list of sweepstakes casinos reveals a popular and thriving market. The appeal is clear: these casinos operate under legal and well-understood US sweepstakes laws, offering valuable coin packages, efficient prize redemption, and a diverse library of games in a straightforward and legally-defined way. This same search for clarity may soon be coming to the cryptocurrency world , as recent news from Washington signals a major positive shift. After years of ambiguity, Congress is advancing landmark bills to create a clear set of rules for the digital asset industry. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which has already passed the House, is a landmark bill that aims to provide legal certainty. You can track the bill’s status and full text on the official U.S. Congress website. This is paired with a bipartisan Senate draft, signaling a growing consensus to finally end the “regulation by enforcement” era. This new legislative push is being met with a powerful new spirit of cooperation from the regulators themselves. In September 2025, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a “landmark Joint Statement,” heralding a “new day” in their approach to digital assets. In the press release from the SEC , the agencies jointly clarified that current law does not prohibit registered exchanges from facilitating the trading of certain spot crypto asset products. This move, part of the SEC’s “Project Crypto” and the CFTC’s “Crypto Sprint,” is designed to “empower American innovation” and promote regulatory clarity that keeps blockchain innovation within the United States. This pro-innovation stance is a direct echo of the U.S. Treasury’s new digital asset framework, which calls for “fit-for-purpose” rules to support the responsible growth of blockchain technology. The Treasury’s official factsheet on the framework, emphasizes supporting U.S. leadership in digital finance. This alignment between Congress and top federal agencies represents the most significant positive momentum for the industry in years. This regulatory thaw is happening as the market itself shows powerful signs of validation. Major institutional investors have been increasing their positions, a move that signals deep, long-term confidence in the technology. This recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class is no longer a niche opinion. This growing institutional interest recently helped fuel a major price surge, with Bitcoin climbing past $103,000. This rally is seen by many as a sign of a maturing market, driven by significant capital, not just retail enthusiasm. For the average consumer, this powerful combination of market strength and newfound regulatory clarity signals a more stable and optimistic future for digital assets in the U.S. It suggests the industry is moving out of its ‘wild west’ phase and into a period of mainstream acceptance and maturity.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-youre-not-bullish-enough-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst STEPHISCRYPTO has presented a chart showing what appears to be a significant technical development for XRP. According to his analysis, XRP’s daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has broken above a descending trendline, a pattern that in the past has coincided with notable price increases. On the chart, two previous RSI breakouts were highlighted — the first preceding a 26.54% rise, and the second followed by a 77.28% rally. The analyst suggests that a similar breakout has just occurred once again, potentially indicating the start of a new upward phase. $XRP RSI breaking out, you’re not bullish enough! pic.twitter.com/kGrbt9RlZI — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 11, 2025 Technical Context and Market Setup The RSI breakout shown on STEPHISCRYPTO’s chart reflects a change in market momentum. RSI trendline breaks often indicate that selling pressure has weakened and that buyers are beginning to regain control. In this case, XRP’s RSI appears to have ended a months-long downward slope, marking a potential transition from consolidation into accumulation. Historical data on the chart show that each time this setup occurred, price movement followed quickly, with sharp percentage gains. The price chart accompanying the RSI analysis also shows a projection that extends well beyond current levels. With XRP trading around $2.46 at the time of the post, the outlined trajectory suggests a possible continuation above previous highs if momentum strengthens further. While the exact scale of the move remains speculative, the analyst’s chart implies that bullish momentum could accelerate quickly if the breakout sustains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions The tweet drew contrasting views from the community. One commenter, Schlaerrinator, dismissed the projection, noting that XRP has moved sideways for years and expressing doubt about a sudden behavioral change. In contrast, Evelyn argued that the breakout signals a clear shift in momentum, describing it as a sign of strong upward pressure that could precede a larger move. The exchange reflects a broader split between traders who see technical indicators as early signals and those who view XRP’s long-term consolidation as a limiting factor. Assessing the Implications While technical signals such as RSI breakouts can indicate momentum changes, they are not guarantees of future performance. The setup highlighted by STEPHISCRYPTO mirrors earlier conditions that led to substantial gains, but broader market conditions and liquidity remain decisive factors. It is important to note that a confirmed RSI breakout on the daily chart statistically increases the probability of a sustained bullish phase. Still, traders should remain cautious of potential reversals and false breakouts. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Amid the overall uncertainty and market panic, reports emerged at one point claiming that the ultimate bitcoin bull – Michael Saylor – and his company had begun to sell off significant portions of their massive holdings. No Such Thing, Says Saylor Although the actual claims that Strategy had been selling came from some rather small accounts (at first) with little credibility, they were quickly picked up and reshared by more established people within the community, some with more than 500,000 followers on X. Consequently, panic spread rapidly among some community members, but most seemed unfazed as they refused to believe that Strategy will indeed sell. Saylor, the company’s bitcoin champion and co-founder, refuted the rumors on X and during an interview with CNBC. In fact, he doubled down on the asset, as he has done multiple times in the past during other such intense corrections, and noted that Strategy used the dip opportunity to accumulate more every day this week. We bought bitcoin every day this week. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 14, 2025 During the aforementioned CNBC interview, he explained that such volatility is expected in risk-on assets like BTC. He advised people who want to have bitcoin exposure to prepare for similar events, but to focus on a broader (4-year) scale in which the cryptocurrency outperforms every asset class. Additionally, he said Strategy doesn’t have any trigger points in which it would be under pressure to dispose of its BTC holdings, and even an 80% drop would not harm it. Before a new announcement comes on Monday about a Strategy purchase, the company’s known holdings following the last one stood at 641,692 BTC. Even with BTC’s correction, this stash is worth almost $62 billion. Arkham Explains Some reports claimed that Arkham Intelligence had insisted that Strategy indeed sold off, but the company also refuted these speculations and explained what actually took place. It outlined Strategy’s transfer of 43,415 BTC to more than 100 different addresses from Coinbase Custody to a new custodian. “This does not mean that Strategy has sold their BTC, nor do transfers from Arkham’s Strategy entity automatically imply the sale of those assets,” its post reads .

The Aster Protocol team just announced significant changes to their token unlock schedule, pushing major releases to 2026 and beyond. This strategic move in Aster tokenomics demonstrates the project’s commitment to long-term stability and careful planning. Why Did Aster Protocol Revise Its Tokenomics? The Aster team made these changes after realizing their original monthly unlock plan needed refinement. According to Chinese cryptocurrency columnist AB Kuai.Dong, who shared details from a conversation with the Aster team on X, the project postponed unlocks because they haven’t finalized how to use the tokens within their ecosystem. This careful approach to Aster tokenomics shows the team prioritizes proper planning over rushed execution. What Are the New Unlock Dates for Aster Tokens? The revised schedule introduces two key timelines that impact token circulation: Initial unlocks now scheduled for summer 2026 Additional unlocks extended until 2035 Original 2024 unlocks completely canceled This extended timeline gives the Aster team ample opportunity to develop solid use cases for their tokens before they enter circulation. The changes in Aster tokenomics reflect a mature approach to project management that benefits long-term investors. How Do These Changes Benefit Aster Investors? Postponing token unlocks actually creates several advantages for the Aster community. First, it prevents sudden inflation that could depress token prices. Second, it shows the team’s dedication to building real utility rather than just releasing tokens. The revised Aster tokenomics model demonstrates responsible stewardship that should increase investor confidence. What Challenges Does This New Timeline Present? While generally positive, the extended unlock schedule does present some considerations. Investors must now wait longer for token releases, which requires patience. However, this delay allows the team to strengthen their ecosystem and develop clearer token utility plans. The thoughtful approach to Aster tokenomics adjustments suggests the team values sustainable growth over short-term gains. What Can We Learn From Aster’s Tokenomics Strategy? Other cryptocurrency projects can learn valuable lessons from Aster’s approach. The team recognized when their original plan needed adjustment and took proactive steps. Their transparency about the changes builds trust within their community. This case study in Aster tokenomics management shows how adaptive planning can strengthen a project’s foundation. The Aster tokenomics revision represents a strategic shift toward sustainable growth. By delaying token unlocks until 2026 and beyond, the team demonstrates their commitment to building real value rather than pursuing quick releases. This approach benefits long-term investors and sets a positive example for the broader cryptocurrency industry. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Aster postpone their token unlocks? The team postponed unlocks because they haven’t established a clear plan for how to use the tokens within their ecosystem, wanting to ensure proper utility before release. When will Aster tokens now be unlocked? The new schedule includes initial unlocks in summer 2026, with some tokens remaining locked until 2035. How does this affect current token holders? Current holders benefit from reduced selling pressure and increased confidence in the project’s long-term planning. Will there be more changes to Aster tokenomics? While no further changes are announced, the team has shown they’re willing to adjust their approach as needed for project success. Where can I get official updates about Aster? Follow the official Aster Protocol channels and reputable crypto news sources like Wu Blockchain for accurate information. How does this compare to other crypto project tokenomics? Aster’s approach is more conservative than many projects, prioritizing long-term stability over quick token releases. Found this analysis of Aster tokenomics helpful?

Whichever way you look at things, there are times when crypto, its underlying blockchain technology, and the whole world of web3 can work with more traditional services. Doing this can actually show the potential of blockchain-based finance. Here are some of the ways it does that. Making Services Efficient Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency can make sites and services more efficient. One great example comes in the ever-expanding crypto casino sector. Although many online casinos are still using credit card transactions in fiat, there is an alternative with cryptocurrency. Thanks to the blockchain, too, people who play at crypto casinos can get their winnings close to instantly, rather than having to wait for traditional payments. Since the charges for handling cryptos range from the low to the non-existent, this means that casinos can pass these savings, compared to card companies that charge as much as six per cent, on to their customers in the form of higher jackpots. Mainstream Links One of the many holy grails for crypto enthusiasts is blockchain finance achieving proper mainstream adoption. After all, there isn’t much point in having a new kind of money if there isn’t anywhere to spend it. Luckily for the world of crypto, there are mainstream institutions that are either accepting cryptocurrency or are, at the very least, getting involved in it in some way. One example is that there are now debit cards, operated by payment providers Visa and Mastercard, which let people spend crypto without having to worry about logging into their wallets. Another example is how banking giant JPMorgan has been using the blockchain to allow real-time settlements between corporate clients using the Kinexys platform and the JPM cryptocurrency. Real World Assets If a company uses crypto for traditional features, that can mean it has new ways to make more money. If you look at the crypto category of Real World Assets (RWAs), there are some platforms, such as RealT, that allow people to have fractional ownership of their homes via the blockchain. Meanwhile, platforms such as Chintai and RealNOI let people who rent out their properties get paid via tokens. This is important because traditionally, the housing market has been rather illiquid, but tokenization adds some extra liquidity. Meanwhile, musicians can sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and, in turn, give their holders the opportunity to take a cut of their royalties. This means that NFTs’ owners are making an income stream, no matter how small, through their investment. Theory And Practice While cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have a lot of theory behind it, it can be easy to forget that this theory can have practical implications. For instance, American retail giant Walmart teamed up with computing powerhouse IBM so that it could trace its supply chain on an immutable platform . Meanwhile, diamond company De Beers uses its own blockchain system, Tracr, to check that the jewels it sells are genuine and ethically sourced, which is very useful for customers. Another practical application of blockchain tech comes in the form of cross-border payments. Although Ripple’s XRP isn’t going to replace the SWIFT system any time soon, the growth of stablecoins gives people the opportunity to send money internationally without having to worry about how long it will take. Web3 may not be as exciting for some people as AI, but that doesn’t make it any kind of back number. As you can see, there are plenty of things the whole world of crypto can do when it links up with more traditional ideas and services.

The surge in mainstream attention has renewed questions about whether Ripple is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now, particularly as utility-based networks gain more substantial traction. A few analysts have even compared the recent activity to early PayFi projects, such as Remittix , which currently trades at $0.1166 and continues to gain visibility through real-world payment features. With sentiment shifting, the XRP story is drawing fresh attention from retail and institutional sides. XRP Price Prediction: Market Response to ETF Demand The launch of several XRP ETF products has driven significant engagement across Centralized Exchanges, and trading data reflects the renewed interest. XRP trades at $2.30, showing a 4.66% daily pullback. Its market cap remains strong at $139.16 billion, with liquidity improving as volume climbed to $8.23 billion, up 31.87%. More investors are now reevaluating the role of Ripple in global settlements, primarily due to the introduction of the XRP ETF market, which provides a more straightforward path for institutional access. This has led to increased activity in XRP price discussions and XRP predictions, as traders assess whether Ripple maintains an edge over upcoming crypto projects or networks designed for cross-border payments. Searches for terms related to high-growth crypto and new altcoins to watch have also increased as traders expand their investment horizons. Ripple, Utility, and the Renewed ETF Attention Ripple continues to play an essential role in global payment solutions, making it central to today’s XRP Price Prediction conversations. The presence of multiple XRP ETF channels introduces new liquidity pathways, while the market monitors whether this contributes to deeper adoption. As the broader sector sees more interest in crypto solving real-world problems, traders compare networks built for speed, financial access, and payment infrastructure. This renewed focus has pushed XRP back into lists of potential top cryptocurrencies to buy now, especially for users seeking projects with clear utility rather than hype-driven cycles. Where Remittix Fits Into the Conversation The growing interest in payment-focused networks has helped Remittix garner strong attention. The token is currently priced at $0.1166, supported by over $28.1 million raised from private funding and more than 685 million RTX tokens sold. The project allows users to send crypto directly to bank accounts, positioning it as a Remittix DeFi project with real demand behind its model.

According to Hyperliquid founder Jeff, the answer lies in thinking of DeFi as DeFi Lego blocks rather than massive corporations. This revolutionary approach could transform how we build financial systems forever. What Are DeFi Lego Blocks Exactly? Jeff, the visionary behind Hyperliquid (HYPE), recently made waves by comparing ideal decentralized finance to open DeFi Lego blocks . He argues that instead of creating another financial giant, DeFi should focus on building interoperable, composable modules. These financial building blocks can snap together in countless combinations, giving users unprecedented flexibility. This concept directly challenges the trend toward centralized DeFi platforms. Jeff emphasizes that true decentralization means anyone can build with these DeFi Lego blocks without asking for permission. Moreover, this approach prevents any single entity from controlling the entire financial stack. Why Avoid Becoming a DeFi Giant? Many platforms celebrate rapid growth and market dominance. However, Jeff believes this contradicts DeFi’s core principles. He specifically rebutted claims that Hyperliquid’s expansion positions it as a “DeFi giant.” Instead, he champions smaller, specialized components that work together seamlessly. Consider these advantages of the DeFi Lego blocks approach: Greater innovation through modular design Reduced systemic risk through decentralization Enhanced user choice and customization True permissionless participation How Does Hyperliquid Implement This Vision? Hyperliquid actively builds toward this DeFi Lego blocks future. The platform focuses on creating open financial primitives that others can compose freely. This means developers can mix and match Hyperliquid’s components with other DeFi protocols. Jeff stresses that returning to DeFi’s core principles represents the correct path forward. The DeFi Lego blocks model ensures no single point of failure and maintains the ecosystem’s innovative spirit. Furthermore, this approach aligns with cryptocurrency’s original vision of democratizing finance. What Challenges Does This Model Face? While the DeFi Lego blocks concept sounds ideal, implementation presents real challenges. Interoperability between different protocols requires robust standards and careful design. Security also becomes more complex when multiple components interact. However, Jeff remains optimistic. He believes these hurdles are worth overcoming to achieve truly open finance. The alternative—centralized DeFi giants—would simply recreate the problems of traditional finance. The Future of Finance Built Like Lego Imagine a financial system where you can snap together different DeFi Lego blocks to create custom solutions. This vision represents the next evolution of decentralized finance. Jeff’s perspective reminds us that DeFi’s true power lies in its openness and composability. The DeFi Lego blocks approach could unlock unprecedented financial innovation. By building small, specialized components that work together, we create a more resilient and creative ecosystem. This philosophy might just define the next generation of financial technology. Frequently Asked Questions What are DeFi Lego blocks? DeFi Lego blocks refer to modular, interoperable financial protocols that can be combined like Lego pieces to create custom DeFi applications and services. Why does Hyperliquid’s founder oppose DeFi giants? He believes centralized DeFi platforms contradict the core principles of decentralization and limit innovation through closed systems. How do DeFi Lego blocks benefit users? They provide greater flexibility, customization options, and reduce reliance on any single platform or company. What makes the Lego block approach more secure? Modular design reduces systemic risk since failure in one component doesn’t necessarily compromise the entire system. Can existing DeFi protocols work as Lego blocks? Yes, many current protocols already function as composable components, though interoperability standards continue to evolve. How does Hyperliquid implement this philosophy? Hyperliquid focuses on building open, permissionless financial primitives that developers can freely combine with other protocols. Found this insight into DeFi’s future fascinating?

EU’s Plan For Crypto Oversight Shift Raises Concerns On Friday, Bloomberg affirmed that the European Commission (EC) is pressing to advance its proposal to transfer regulatory supervision of the crypto businesses from national authorities to the bloc’s market watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). As reported by Bitcoinist, ESMA’s Chair, Verena Ross, stated last month that the EU’s executive arm was preparing rules to give new powers to the regional watchdog to push for a “more integrated and globally competitive” capital market in Europe. Ross argued that “while we are doing a lot of work to try to make sure the implementation of MiCA is aligned, it clearly takes a lot of effort from us and the national supervisors to achieve that.” “It also means that people had to build up specific new resources and expertise 27 times in different national supervisors, which could have been done more efficiently once at a European level,” she continued. According to the Friday report, draft plans circulated by EU officials propose that the bloc’s market watchdog be responsible for authorizing new businesses and the main supervisor for all Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASP). This was initially suggested during the development of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). Nonetheless, some consider that the move could overturn the work that national watchdogs and businesses have done over the past few years to regulate the industry and implement the bloc’s comprehensive framework for digital assets. Robert Kopitsch, secretary general of Blockchain for Europe, an organization that represents international Blockchain industry players in the EU, told Bloomberg that “reopening MiCA at this stage would introduce legal uncertainty, risk delaying the authorization process, and divert attention and resources from the practical task of consistent implementation.” Kopitsch affirmed that a shift to a more centralized supervisory model should happen in the future, based on “concrete experience and evidence gathered from MiCA’s first years of implementation,” noting that local regulators have had closer day-to-day engagement with firms. Meanwhile, Andrew Whitworth, founder of Global Policy Ltd., a consulting firm that works with crypto companies and regulators, believes that digital assets could be a good test for ESMA’s ability to take on more responsibilities. However, it would require additional resources to handle the workload currently managed by local regulators. He emphasized that the change would be difficult at the time, “given where we’re at with implementation for the goalposts to change.” ‘Institutional Standoff’ To Undermine MiCA? Notably, smaller EU nations, including Luxembourg, Ireland, and Malta, have also questioned the proposal and ESMA’s ability to oversee the rapidly growing crypto market, claiming it could weaken their financial sectors. Recently, Judith Arnal, associate senior research fellow at the Centre for European Credit Research Institute (ECRI) and board member at the Bank of Spain, affirmed that the ongoing “institutional standoff has created regulatory paralysis with far-reaching consequences.” Arnal has argued that the recent attempts to already amend the bloc’s crypto rules, particularly in the stablecoins sector, risk “undermining MiCA’s credibility as a coherent and globally influential regulatory framework.” Earlier this week, the European Banking Authority (EBA) addressed the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)’s concerns about financial instability risk related to stablecoins. The ECB has recently been calling for stricter regulations, including a ban on multi-issuance stablecoins in the bloc and other jurisdictions. However, the region’s banking supervisor defended the framework, arguing that MiCA already has safeguards against risks posed by stablecoins.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Blockchain for Europe|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto and Europe|crypto oversight|crypto regulation|ESMA|Europe crypto regulation|European Commission|European Securities and Markets Authority|European Union|MiCA,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 07:00:40

He insists the blockchain ecosystem desperately needs more crypto oracles to reach its full potential. But why are these data bridges so important, and what does this mean for the future of decentralized technology? Why Are Crypto Oracles So Critical Right Now? Changpeng Zhao recently emphasized that having just one or two crypto oracles simply isn’t enough. The industry requires diverse, reliable data sources to power the next generation of decentralized applications. Crypto oracles act as essential bridges between blockchain networks and real-world information, feeding external data into smart contracts that automate transactions and agreements. Think of crypto oracles as trusted messengers that deliver verified information from the outside world to blockchain systems. Without them, smart contracts would operate in isolation, unable to interact with real-world events, prices, or conditions. This limitation severely restricts what decentralized applications can achieve. What Drives the Growing Demand for Crypto Oracles? Zhao highlighted two major factors accelerating the need for more crypto oracles: On-chain prediction markets are expanding rapidly Artificial intelligence integration requires real-time data DeFi applications need accurate price feeds Insurance protocols require verified event data These developments create an unprecedented demand for reliable data bridges. As more industries adopt blockchain technology, the variety of required information grows exponentially. From weather data for agricultural insurance to sports scores for prediction markets, crypto oracles must handle increasingly diverse data types. How Do Crypto Oracles Actually Work? Crypto oracles operate by collecting, verifying, and delivering external information to smart contracts. The process typically involves: Data aggregation from multiple sources Validation through consensus mechanisms Secure transmission to blockchain networks Continuous updating as conditions change Chainlink currently dominates the crypto oracles space, but Zhao’s comments suggest the market needs more competition and specialization. Different applications may require different types of crypto oracles, from price feeds to random number generators to custom API connections. What Challenges Do Crypto Oracles Face? Despite their importance, crypto oracles encounter several significant challenges: Data accuracy remains paramount Security vulnerabilities can be exploited Centralization risks in data sources Scalability issues during high demand These challenges highlight why having multiple, competing crypto oracles benefits the entire ecosystem. Diversity in data sources and oracle designs creates redundancy and improves overall system reliability. The Future of Crypto Oracles: What’s Next? As Zhao predicted, the evolution of crypto oracles will likely involve: Specialized oracles for specific industries Cross-chain compatibility solutions AI-enhanced data verification Decentralized oracle networks The expansion of crypto oracles will unlock new use cases across finance, insurance, gaming, and supply chain management. More sophisticated crypto oracles will enable complex smart contracts that respond to real-world conditions with greater accuracy and reliability. Conclusion: The Oracle Revolution Is Just Beginning Changpeng Zhao’s call for more crypto oracles signals a crucial turning point for blockchain technology. The infrastructure supporting decentralized applications must evolve to handle increasingly complex data requirements. As the industry matures, the development of robust, diverse crypto oracles will separate successful projects from those that fail to adapt. The message is clear: the future of blockchain depends on building better bridges to the real world. Crypto oracles represent those essential connections, and their improvement will drive the next wave of innovation across the entire digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are crypto oracles? Crypto oracles are services that bring external data onto blockchain networks, enabling smart contracts to interact with real-world information and events. Why does Changpeng Zhao think we need more oracles? He believes current oracle solutions are insufficient for the growing demands of DeFi, prediction markets, and AI integration, requiring more diverse and specialized data sources. What is the most popular crypto oracle currently? Chainlink (LINK) is currently the dominant player in the crypto oracles space, providing data feeds to numerous blockchain projects. Are there security risks with crypto oracles? Yes, oracle manipulation represents a significant security concern, which is why multiple, competing oracles improve overall system security through redundancy. How do oracles benefit DeFi applications? Oracles provide accurate price feeds, enabling DeFi protocols to execute liquidations, settlements, and other functions based on real market conditions. Can one oracle service handle all data needs? Probably not. Different applications require different types of data, making specialized oracles necessary for various use cases and industries.

There are two digital assets that will likely lead the next phase of growth. Analysts are looking at Ethereum, the top crypto smart contract platform, as a potential technical buy. At the same time, the newly developing DeFi crypto, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , displays the highest presale growth, a trend that typically precedes significant growth once the token becomes available on an exchange. Having both assets positioned at the top of the market is likely to signal the beginning of the expected recovery. ETH and MUTM are driven by different unique market forces which will be important for investors to understand in order to position themselves appropriately for the forthcoming surge. Ethereum Preparing for Considerable Price Rebound Several top market analysts are beginning to pay attention to Ethereum, as analysts observing the market are beginning to signal a potential buy. Ethereum has recently pulled back to about $3,300, and individuals like Michael van de Poppe have referred to this price as “an excellent area to build positions.” His bullish hypothesis determination is driven by a price range annual estimate of $5,000, which would reflect a remarkable recovery considering the price range Ethereum has been in the last month of October. Not all arguments pertaining to Ethereum’s price growth are purely technical. Ethereum’s major-holding exchanges continue to quickly drop, culminating in a supply crisis. The combination of Ethereum’s price being technically undervalued, and the looming scarcity, creates one of the strongest bullish opportunities in the market, particularly given Ethereum’s widespread adoption as a crypto asset. Supply accumulation by institutions and retail holders is actively underway, especially since much of the Ethereum on retail exchanges is ripe for accumulation. Unlocking Accessibility and Innovation by Mutuum Finance While Ethereum is poised to make another leap forward, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also an opportunity waiting to be tapped at the base of the decentralized finance sector. The presale of the project has been successful, and the visions of the early supporters of the project have enabled the formation of a considerable community. Recent improvements regarding the project’s accessibility involve the incorporation of card payments, which enables buyers to obtain the MUTM coin hassle-free and without arbitrary limits. This has enabled Mutuum to, for the first time, offer customers from the traditional financial sector a seamless fiat-on-ramp. The project’s primary value propositions arise from the innovative dual lending framework which integrates Contract and Peer lending systems, designed for a diverse range of assets and users. Final Window at Ground Floor Price Mutuum Finance presale offers exceptional investment opportunities at highly competitive rates. The presale started at $0.01 and is now at $0.035 as stage 6 heads towards sell out. Investors buying in this stage will see a 20% price jump when MUTM hits $0.035 in phase 7. This way, the presale rewards earliest buyers. Mutuum Finance presale demonstrating progress, selling presale access, and the option to purchase a card demonstrates an investment in technological building and an investment in community and investor relationship. With purchase of today’s MUTM tokens as a primary investment to a portfolio, it will position an investor for the upcoming waves of DeFi adoption. Take Advantage of the Anticipated Growth Both Ethereum and Mutuum Finance are headed for an increase in value. From a technical perspective, Ethereum’s value is likely to appreciate in the near future due to its supply dynamics and other technical parameters. Furthermore, the highly successful presale of Mutuum Finance is being touted, due to user-centric innovations, as a new gem of considerable value. Offering Ethereum and Mutuum Finance as a pair for the upcoming bull run is a prudent and balanced proposal, providing an opportunity to strengthen one’s position in the market. The opportunity of greatest interest at this time is the presale of the MUTM token. Join the presale to capitalize on what is arguably the most significant value growth opportunity this year.

Renowned Economist Explains,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-lies-ahead-for-bitcoins-future-price-renowned-economist-explains/,"Following the sharp pullback in the Bitcoin (BTC) price, economist James E. Thorne has offered a comprehensive assessment of the macroeconomic dynamics driving the markets. Thorne stated that the reopening of the US government, coupled with the Treasury's management of the Treasury General Account (TGA), represents a “near-term liquidity injection” into the financial system. He said this process marks the official end of monetary tightening (QT), which was currently slowing. According to Thorne, the Fed's interest rate cuts will continue. The economist, who expects the federal funds rate to be lowered to around 2.75%, stated that the FOMC composition will change in 2026, and that Chairman Jerome Powell will leave office, marking “the end of the era of progressive left-wing Keynesian control.” Related News: XRP Spot ETF Approved, So Why Is the Price Falling? Here Are the Opinions Thorne emphasized that current monetary policies have produced a clear stagnation in the housing market, saying that excessively tight financial conditions, delayed policy responses, and reliance on backward-looking indicators have disrupted credit channels, weakening the housing market, one of the key sectors of the economy. Despite this outlook, Thorne noted that Bitcoin adoption is rapidly increasing, and that new legislation providing regulatory clarity will further strengthen institutional adoption. Recalling that the global fiat money supply continues to expand, the economist said, “Nothing has changed; Bitcoin's digital rarity remains unparalleled.” Thorne described the selling trend of some investors as Bitcoin's long-term fundamentals strengthen as a typical example of “irrationality in the markets,” noting that liquidity shifts during periods of high volatility create opportunities that are only recognized later. Thorne concluded his assessment by saying, “A bull run ends when liquidity runs out, not when it begins. This has always been the case.” *This is not investment advice.

54426314,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89678,1763192338,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Finance Strategist: XRP is the New Medium of Exchange,https://timestabloid.com/finance-strategist-xrp-is-the-new-medium-of-exchange/,"In a recent post, Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, revisited one of the most fundamental economic principles — the three core functions of money. His statement underscored the growing imbalance between these roles in today’s monetary system and pointed to what he described as an emerging realignment in how value and exchange are defined. He suggested that the U.S. dollar, once considered the ultimate store of value, no longer fulfills that role in the global economy. Instead, he identified gold, XRP, and stablecoins as emerging forces each now assuming one of money’s traditional functions. Money has three roles: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. The dollar is no longer a true store of value. $Gold is reclaiming the store of value, $XRP is the new medium of exchange, and stablecoins act as the unit of account. This is where we're heading. pic.twitter.com/QpCxWiQNv2 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 12, 2025 Gold, XRP, and Stablecoins in a Changing Landscape Aljarrah asserted that gold is reestablishing itself as the world’s store of value, a position it held for centuries before the dominance of fiat currencies. This claim reflects the growing confidence among investors seeking protection against inflation and currency depreciation. With global economic uncertainty and mounting national debts, gold’s return to prominence symbolizes a search for stability outside government-backed money. In contrast, XRP was highlighted as the emerging medium of exchange in this new framework. Its efficiency in cross-border transactions and capacity to bridge different fiat currencies through blockchain technology position it as a viable tool for real-time global settlements. The shift toward digital assets that facilitate liquidity and interoperability reflects a broader move toward decentralization and utility-driven adoption, particularly within institutional finance. Stablecoins, Aljarrah noted, could serve as the modern unit of account — instruments pegged to traditional currencies yet operating within digital ecosystems. Their role bridges the divide between the predictability of fiat and the technological advantages of blockchain, suggesting that they might anchor pricing and contracts in the digital economy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Division Between Monetary Classes The attached video expanded on this theme by illustrating how economic divides may deepen as fiat currencies lose value. The speaker described an emerging “bifurcation” in which individuals and institutions increasingly use gold or other commodities to preserve purchasing power, while everyday transactions remain dependent on fiat money. He compared this growing separation to what is already visible across developing regions in Latin America and Asia, where citizens rely on government-issued currencies for daily needs while wealthier individuals secure assets tied to tangible or decentralized value. The commentary also noted similar strains across Western economies, including the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, where stagnant growth and inflation are eroding the foundations of traditional financial systems. For the United States, the implications are equally significant, with concerns that a substantial portion of its population remains unprotected against the dollar’s ongoing depreciation. Toward a Redefined Monetary Future Aljarrah’s post outlines a vision of monetary evolution in which gold, XRP , and stablecoins collectively replace the singular dominance of fiat currency. His perspective reinforces the view that technological and structural shifts are accelerating the transition toward a multipolar financial system — one in which value, exchange, and accounting are distributed across both tangible and digital assets.

The institution now holds 6,813,612 shares of BlackRock's IBIT, valued at approximately $442.8 million. This represents a 257% increase from the 1,906,000 shares reported in the second quarter, which were valued at approximately $117 million. The move represents a substantial shift for an endowment known for its traditionally conservative investment strategy. Harvard's decision to scale up its Bitcoin holdings comes as institutional adoption of cryptocurrency continues to accelerate across the traditional finance sector. The university simultaneously increased its gold holdings through the GLD ETF. Its position grew nearly 100%, rising from 333,000 shares in June to 661,391 shares currently valued at $235 million. This parallel expansion suggests a broader strategy focused on alternative assets amid ongoing concerns about monetary policy. Institutional Capital Flows Into Digital Assets Harvard's increased allocation places it among the top institutional holders of IBIT. The university was previously ranked 29th among IBIT shareholders in the second quarter. Its latest position reflects a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term investment vehicle despite short-term price volatility. Market analysts view Harvard's move as significant given the endowment's size and influence. The institution manages one of the largest university endowments globally. Its investment decisions often signal broader trends within the institutional asset management sector. Bitcoin ETFs launched in early 2024 have fundamentally changed how large institutions access cryptocurrency markets. These products provide regulatory oversight and familiar investment structures that align with institutional risk management requirements. Pensions, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds have begun allocating capital through these vehicles. The timing of Harvard's expansion is notable. In 2018, a Harvard economist and former IMF official predicted that Bitcoin would be more likely to fall to $100 than reach $100,000 by 2028. Bitcoin currently trades above $104,000, invalidating that earlier skepticism. Bitcoin ETF Market Sees Strong Momentum The broader Bitcoin ETF market has experienced remarkable growth since its inception. Collectively, these products have attracted $60.8 billion in net inflows. Trading volumes have exceeded $1.5 million, demonstrating robust market demand. BlackRock's IBIT dominates the sector, managing more than half of all assets held in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The fund has captured over 35% of total Bitcoin ETF inflows. In the past month alone, IBIT added $1.2 billion, pushing assets under management beyond $19.4 billion. Recent inflow data shows sustained institutional interest. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $524 million in inflows on Tuesday, marking their strongest single-day performance since early October. BlackRock's IBIT led with $224.2 million. Fidelity's FBTC followed with $165.9 million, while Ark 21Shares' ARKB attracted $102.5 million. Fidelity's FBTC has emerged as another major player in the space. The fund continues to draw capital from pension funds and wealth management firms. Its total assets under management have reached $13.6 billion. Competitive fee structures, tight trading spreads, and robust liquidity drive the product's success. Other major institutions are following Harvard's lead. Brown University, another Ivy League school, held more than $13 million worth of IBIT shares as of August. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $96,019.37, suggesting a 5.85% decline in the last 7 days.

This sharp drop has now led investors to question the depth of the current downturn, with a new analytical model suggesting a potential bear market floor of $74,000. Market Under Pressure Market technician Axel Adler Jr. said earlier today that his valuation model identifies two major downside markers: $87,000 and $74,000. He described these levels as the most important zones to watch during this phase, arguing that on-chain activity now places both thresholds firmly within reach. Fellow analyst Egrag Crypto compared the current market rhythm to patterns seen in 2017. He pointed out that Bitcoin is completing its seventh dip of the cycle and noted that in both cycles, declines became smaller before a sharp climb. Still, that view clashes with the near-term caution shown by others who believe the flagship cryptocurrency must first settle after the latest wave of selling. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital warned that BTC needs a weekly close above the 50-week EMA to preserve a positive long-term structure. Losing that mark would raise the risk of a broader downturn. The concern is reinforced by comments from experts such as Bitget CEO Gracy Chen, who said she reduced her own position after Bitcoin fell below $97,000, her predefined exit point. The downturn triggered substantial liquidations, with data showing $1.2 billion in leveraged trading positions were eliminated in 24 hours, affecting over 240,000 traders. The single largest liquidation occurred on the HTX exchange, valued at $44 million. Divergent Views on the Road Ahead Today’s decline comes after a week of steady pressure, with Bitcoin’s price hovering around $95,400 at the time of this writing, representing a 7% fall in 24 hours and a 13% decrease over the past two weeks, according to CoinGecko. The broader market also followed, with Ethereum down by about 11% and numerous altcoins recording double-digit losses. Since Bitcoin’s rejection at $107,000, a consistent pattern of lower highs and lower lows has emerged. Furthermore, on-chain charts show dense activity around $95,900, but thin support between $95,000 and $82,000, raising the possibility of a swift move if the current floor breaks. Broader factors are also shaping sentiment. There have been persistent liquidity challenges, with posts earlier today citing everything from retail exhaustion to capital shifting toward AI-related stocks. For now, traders are watching the same thresholds: $95,000, $87,000, and $74,000. Whether the market stabilizes or slides further may become clear in the coming days, as volatility remains elevated and confidence continues to fluctuate.

Dogecoin slipped to $0.163 and Shiba Inu added another zero to its quote, even as whales circled both charts. Yet the market is not red everywhere. Two names are breaking higher while the rest are cooling down: Zcash (ZEC) and Remittix (RTX) . In this rotation story, ZEC rides a sharp breakout, and the Remittix DeFi project keeps drawing fresh capital with real payments utility. Dogecoin: Whale Buying Meets A Falling Chart Source: @TATrader_Alan on X Dogecoin looked strong when whales started buying again. Over the last two weeks, large holders quietly added 4.72 billion DOGE to their wallets . The price has dropped to $0.163 , and a chart shared shows Dogecoin sitting between $0.16 and $0.17. So far, the price is holding that band, but momentum is weak, and fear is rising. Short term, buyers need a clean move above $0.165 to $0.168 to signal that a bounce is real. Crypto analyst Shan Specter also sees a descending triangle on both the short-term and daily charts. That pattern often leads to a big move once the price breaks out. His map shows possible upside targets at $0.28, $0.40, and even $1.00, but only if Dogecoin can break free from its bearish structure. Shiba Inu: New Zero, Old Problems Source: TradingView Shiba Inu is also struggling. SHIB trades around $0.00000925 , after “adding a zero” again. That break hurt sentiment. Shiba Inu recently dropped to its lowest level since January 2024. The range that once held the token up now acts as a ceiling. Analysts are talking about the risk of a death cross forming, and the buyers are tired. There is still a path for SHIB to recover , but it needs to pass $0.00001029, and if that happens, the token could reach $0.00001118 and $0.00001301. Until then, many traders are looking elsewhere for the best crypto 2025 . Zcash: Quiet Heavyweight In A Weak Market Source: TradingView ZEC now trades close to $573 . Investor demand jumped after news that the Winklevoss twins set up a digital asset treasury focused on ZEC through the newly rebranded Cypherpunk Technologies. Some analysts expect that, if the current move holds, the price could push toward $612, $688, or even $749. What makes ZEC interesting for DeFi project crypto watchers and staking next big altcoin 2025 hunters is that big players are backing it. The Grayscale Zcash Trust has seen fresh inflows even while Bitcoin and Ethereum products faced outflows. To many, this looks like a classic rotation from hype toward useful infrastructure, much like what is happening with Remittix in payments. Remittix: The Sub $1 Payments Token Breaking Out The Remittix DeFi project has already raised over $28.1 million and sold more than 685 million tokens, currently priced at $0.1166 each. That price keeps Remittix in the top crypto under $1 bucket while giving it room to move if adoption grows. The Remittix wallet is already live, and a second update is already out. At the same time, the team passed a full CertiK security audit, one of the highest bars for blockchain projects. Two CEX listings at BitMart and LBank have been confirmed, and a third major exchange reveal is coming. The project also offers a strong income hook. Every time you refer a new buyer, you earn 15% of their purchase in USDT, paid daily through the dashboard. Here is why investors are moving to Remittix: The wallet beta already handles fast crypto to bank transfers in over 30 countries, giving real users a taste of the system. The PayFi design aims to connect Web3 wallets with traditional banking. Multi-currency support is planned for more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies. Audited smart contracts, a full CertiK review, and transparent token metrics help reduce the usual risk that comes with early-stage payment tokens. A live $250,000 community giveaway and daily referral payouts support rapid user growth. From Memes To Meaningful Utility Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are still famous, but their charts are weak, and their stories feel tired in a market that now craves function as well as fun. By contrast, Zcash and Remittix are showing strength in a weak tape. ZEC brings privacy infrastructure and proven gains. RTX brings live payments, a working wallet, and a clear path to global use. On that front, Zcash and especially Remittix stand out as serious contenders for anyone building a watchlist of best crypto 2025.

According to the Financial Times , the board and top leadership have ramped up preparations for a handover that could happen as early as next year. Tim, who just turned 65, has been in charge since 2011, stepping in after the death of co-founder Steve Jobs. After more than 14 years running the show and taking the company’s value from $350 billion to $4 trillion, his time as boss may be winding down. While Apple hasn’t made any announcements yet, the most likely name being floated is John Ternus, the guy currently running hardware engineering. People involved in the process allegedly say he’s leading the shortlist, though no decision has been finalized. Tim has made it clear in past interviews that he wants someone from inside the company to take over. In an interview with singer Dua Lipa in November 2023, Tim said, “I love it there and I can’t envision my life without being there so I’ll be there a while.” Still, that “while” might be shorter than most expected. Apple plans timeline around key 2025 events Apple leadership isn’t planning to reveal anything before the company reports earnings in late January though, since that will include performance from the all-important holiday sales period. But those close to the talks believe that if Apple announces a change early in the year, it’ll give the next CEO time to get comfortable before the June developer conference and the September iPhone launch. Both events are massive milestones for the company and the public face of its annual product strategy. Even with preparations in motion, the timing could still shift. But the activity behind the scenes is louder than ever. This year alone, Apple lost two major execs. Luca Maestri, Tim’s longtime finance guy, stepped down as chief financial officer at the start of the year. Then Jeff Williams, who many thought would be the next in line, announced in July that he was also stepping down as chief operating officer. Both exits cleared the path for someone new, and John might be the one walking through it. Choosing John would bring a hardware person to the top again, something the company hasn’t had in a while. It also comes at a moment when Apple is having trouble breaking into new product areas and has fallen behind in the AI race, especially when compared to Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia. All three have seen their stocks soar thanks to AI hype, while Apple has only managed a 12% gain this year, despite strong recent earnings. $634 million verdict hits Apple during leadership shake-up While the leadership story brews, Apple also got slapped with a $634 million verdict on Friday by a federal jury in California. The company was found to have violated a Masimo patent covering blood-oxygen reading tech, used in the Apple Watch. Masimo says Apple copied its tech and poached its staff, and the jury agreed. A spokesperson for Masimo called the verdict “a significant win in our ongoing efforts to protect our innovations and intellectual property.” An Apple spokesperson said the company will appeal, saying it disagrees with the outcome. But the case is just one piece of a bigger fight. The legal battle led a U.S. trade tribunal in 2023 to block imports of Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches after deciding Apple’s features stepped on Masimo’s patents. To dodge the ban, Apple stripped the blood-oxygen function out of its watches, and later put back an updated version in August, after U.S. Customs and Border Protection gave the green light.

Recent analysis suggests Bitcoin support levels could be tested in ways that might surprise many traders. With BTC falling below key psychological barriers, understanding these Bitcoin support levels becomes essential for making informed decisions. What Are the Key Bitcoin Support Levels to Watch? According to multiple analysts cited by BeInCrypto, Bitcoin faces several critical support zones. The first significant Bitcoin support level lies between $92,000 and $95,000. This range aligns with recent mining costs and ETF inflow prices, making it a crucial barrier. If this initial Bitcoin support level fails, the next important zone sits between $85,000 and $90,000. This represents the typical 25-30% correction often seen during market cycles. Understanding these Bitcoin support levels helps traders anticipate potential price movements. Could Bitcoin Really Test $75K Support? In a worst-case scenario, analysts suggest Bitcoin could retest the $75,000 to $82,000 range. This would represent a substantial 35-40% drop from cycle highs. However, such a move would require specific conditions to develop: Sustained ETF outflows Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions Reduced institutional interest Increased market volatility The $75,000 Bitcoin support level represents a critical psychological and technical barrier that could determine medium-term price direction. How Do Current Bitcoin Support Levels Compare to History? Historical patterns provide context for current Bitcoin support levels. Previous cycles have shown similar correction patterns, with 35-40% drops occurring during healthy bull markets. The current Bitcoin support level analysis mirrors these historical precedents. Analysts emphasize that a drop below $70,000 remains unlikely without a major liquidity shock. This suggests that while Bitcoin support levels may be tested, the overall market structure remains intact. What Should Investors Do About These Bitcoin Support Levels? Understanding Bitcoin support levels helps investors make strategic decisions. Here are key considerations: Monitor ETF flows – These significantly impact Bitcoin support levels Watch mining costs – They often establish fundamental Bitcoin support Track macroeconomic indicators – External factors affect all Bitcoin support levels Set appropriate stop-losses – Protect capital if Bitcoin support levels break Remember that Bitcoin support levels represent probabilities, not certainties. Market conditions can change rapidly. Final Thoughts on Bitcoin’s Critical Juncture The analysis of Bitcoin support levels provides valuable insights for traders and long-term investors alike. While the $75,000 Bitcoin support level represents a worst-case scenario, understanding these potential outcomes helps prepare for various market conditions. The key Bitcoin support levels to monitor are $92K-$95K, $85K-$90K, and the critical $75K-$82K range. Each represents different risk scenarios and potential buying opportunities for those who understand Bitcoin support level dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What happens if Bitcoin breaks below $75,000 support? If Bitcoin breaks below $75,000 support, it could signal deeper correction potential. However, analysts consider this unlikely without a major market shock. How reliable are these Bitcoin support level predictions? Bitcoin support level analysis combines technical, fundamental, and on-chain data. While not guaranteed, they represent high-probability zones based on multiple data points. Should I buy if Bitcoin hits these support levels? Buying at Bitcoin support levels can be strategic, but always consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Diversification remains crucial. How long do Bitcoin support levels typically hold? Bitcoin support levels can hold for varying periods—from hours to months—depending on market conditions and volume. Do mining costs really affect Bitcoin support levels? Yes, mining costs create natural Bitcoin support levels since miners often reduce selling pressure when prices approach production costs. What’s the most important Bitcoin support level right now? The $92,000-$95,000 range represents the most immediate and crucial Bitcoin support level to watch currently.

54427034,627967,1763193615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54427034.jpeg,Bitcoin Bear Cycle Not Confirmed Unless $94K Is Lost – CryptoQuant CEO Explains,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bear-cycle-not-confirmed-unless-94k-is-lost/,"Bitcoin has dropped below the $100,000 mark for the first time since May, igniting renewed anxiety across the crypto market. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading near $97,000, with traders and investors facing growing uncertainty amid persistent selling pressure and waning momentum. Fear levels have surged as many market participants begin to question whether this breakdown marks the start of a new bear market phase or simply a deeper correction within the ongoing cycle. Some analysts warn that the recent loss of key psychological support could trigger further downside if buyers fail to defend lower levels. Historical patterns show that once BTC breaks below major round numbers, volatility tends to accelerate before finding a stable base. However, others remain cautiously optimistic. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, noted that it is still too early to confirm a full-scale bear market. He argues that on-chain data — including exchange flows, miner behavior, and long-term holder activity — does not yet reflect the kind of structural weakness typically seen during cycle tops. Instead, he suggests that the market may be entering a prolonged consolidation phase, where volatility cools before Bitcoin prepares for its next directional move. $94K Becomes the Line in the Sand for Bitcoin’s Bull Case According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the key level that could determine Bitcoin’s next major trend lies around $94,000. On-chain data shows that investors who entered the market between six to twelve months ago have an average cost basis near this level, meaning it represents a crucial psychological and structural support zone. Ju explains that while Bitcoin’s drop below $100,000 has triggered widespread concern, the market hasn’t yet confirmed a full-blown bear cycle. He notes that price action would need to sustain a breakdown below $94,000 before signaling a significant shift in sentiment and long-term trend structure. “Personally, I do not think the bear cycle is confirmed unless we lose that level,” Ju said, emphasizing the importance of patience amid heightened volatility. He adds that overreacting to short-term fluctuations often leads to poor decision-making during periods of market stress. For now, the best course of action may be to wait rather than jump to conclusions. If $94,000 holds as support, it could serve as the foundation for a potential recovery. Conversely, a decisive breakdown below that threshold would mark a clear warning sign that the bull phase has likely ended. Bitcoin Drops Below $100K, Testing Long-Term Support Levels Bitcoin’s weekly chart paints a concerning picture as the cryptocurrency trades around $96,900, marking its first sustained move below the $100,000 level since May. The breakdown represents a 7.4% decline over the last week, with selling volume increasing significantly — a clear sign that market participants are de-risking amid fear and uncertainty. The most notable feature on the chart is Bitcoin’s test of the 50-week moving average (blue line), which currently sits near $95,000. Historically, this level has acted as a key support zone during mid-cycle corrections, helping to stabilize price before major recoveries. A confirmed weekly close below this moving average, however, could shift momentum firmly in favor of the bears, opening the door for a potential retest of the $88,000–$90,000 region near the 100-week MA (green line). Despite the bearish tone, there’s also evidence of potential accumulation. Volume spikes during declines often indicate that larger players are stepping in to absorb selling pressure. If Bitcoin can hold above $95,000 and reclaim $100,000 in the coming weeks, it could form a solid base for recovery. Conversely, failure to defend this area would reinforce the narrative that the market is entering a deeper correction phase.

After hitting a peak of $298 on June 23, just 18 days post-launch, shares have now dropped by 68%, trading around $82. Circle Faces Challenges As Lockup Period Approaches Despite benefiting from a softer regulatory stance on digital assets in the US with President Trump’s crypto policies, Circle faces challenges that history does not favor, particularly as it approaches the end of its lockup period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Tumbles Toward $98,000: What’s Driving The Drop And What Lies Ahead Analysts, including Dan Dolev from Mizuho, highlighted that this lockup period prevents insiders from selling shares, typically for 180 days after an initial public offering. Circle’s initial public offering (IPO) filing indicated that this lockup period is set to expire two days after the company unveils its third-quarter earnings, which is this Friday. Mizuho’s analysis of over 750 IPOs with market capitalizations exceeding $1 billion reveals that 58% of companies that outperform the S&P 500 prior to their lockup period tend to underperform the index in the 180 days following it. These companies see an average decline of approximately 2%. The outlook is even bleaker for firms falling short of revenue expectations in the year after their IPOs, which tend to experience an average negative return of about 10% relative to the S&P 500. Circle may find itself in this latter category according to Mizuho. A significant portion of the company’s revenue comes from the interest on USDC reserves held in short-term US Treasuries, Treasury repurchase agreements, and cash. Consequently, a decline in interest rates or slower-than-anticipated growth of USDC could adversely impact revenue streams. Dolev noted: In our view, CRCL is likely to see downward revisions to consensus estimates over the coming years amid declining rates and less stellar proliferation of its USDC stablecoin, alongside growing distribution costs. Is CRCL A Buy-Low Opportunity? Despite these potential downward adjustments, Circle recently exceeded consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings in its third-quarter report. Related Reading: By The Numbers: First Spot XRP ETF Achieves Record Launch Amid 900 Competitors Following the announcement, JP Morgan issued a double-upgrade for the stock from Underweight to Overweight, raising its price target from $94 to $100. The bank underscored the ongoing acceptance of stablecoins within mainstream financial institutions, with USDC being a leading player in this space. However, the impending lockup expiration has already placed downward pressure on Circle’s stock, according to JP Morgan analyst Kenneth Worthington. He views the current situation as a “buy-low opportunity” for investors, suggesting that the stock’s decline post-lockup may have brought it to levels below its December 2026 price target, indicating potential for future upside.

Key Takeaways: Tether is exploring a $1.16B investment in Germany’s Neura Robotics, valuing the startup as high as $11.6B. The stablecoin issuer has generated over $10B in profit this year and is expanding into AI, robotics, data centers, mining, and commodity lending. CEO Paolo Ardoino is backing decentralized AI initiatives and scaling Tether’s $1.5B commodities lending push. The talks, cited by unnamed sources, would value the rapidly growing robotics startup at between $9.29 billion and $11.6 billion. Tether’s Profits Surge Past $10B as Investment Push Expands The world’s largest stablecoin issuer has been widening its investment reach as profits from issuing USDT continue to surge. Tether generated more than $10 billion in profit in the first three quarters of this year alone, following a strong 2024. With that cash flow, the company has spent the past year expanding into artificial intelligence, data centers, energy infrastructure, and Bitcoin mining, part of a broader strategy to diversify beyond its core business. Neura Robotics fits neatly into that expansion push. The company is preparing to roll out its first humanoid robot, initially targeting industrial clients before moving into the consumer market. Neura has previously said it aims to produce 5 million units by 2030 and hopes to trigger what it calls an “iPhone moment” for robotics. Its January fundraising round brought in nearly $140 million from backers including BlueCrest, C4 Ventures, Lingotto, and Volvo Cars Tech Fund. If the deal moves forward, Neura would find itself competing directly with Elon Musk’s Tesla, which is also racing to mass-produce general-purpose robots. Another big robotics funding just dropped. NEURA Robotics raised €1B and the round was led by Tether.

CEO Paolo Ardoino said the company plans to scale lending across oil, cotton, wheat and other agricultural markets, offering loans in both US dollars and USDT, its stablecoin backed by Treasuries and precious metals. Although still smaller than major banks in this sector, Tether’s nearly $200 billion in reserves gives it significant lending capacity. Tether Could Become the World’s Most Profitable Company, Analyst Says Tether appears unstoppable right now, with the world’s largest stablecoin issuer on track to generate approximately $15 billion this year. Bitwise’s chief investment officer, Matt Houga, recently predicted that Tether could become the world’s most profitable company, potentially overtaking Saudi Aramco. It’s the world’s third-largest digital asset with a market capitalization of $183.8 billion, up 50% compared to this time last year. Although Tether maintains strong cash reserves, recent reports suggest that the company may seek $20 billion in new capital for a 3% ownership stake. Such a transaction would establish a valuation near $500 billion, eclipsing Netflix and Samsung while approaching iconic financial services brands like Mastercard.

This massive wipeout represents one of the most significant market shakeouts in recent months, leaving traders reeling from unexpected losses across major digital assets. What Triggered This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation? Market analysts point to several factors that converged to create the perfect storm for this extensive crypto futures liquidation event. A sudden price correction combined with increased market volatility created conditions where leveraged positions became unsustainable. When prices moved against traders’ expectations, margin calls triggered automated liquidations that snowballed throughout the market. The cascade effect amplified losses as each liquidation put additional pressure on prices. This created a feedback loop where more positions faced margin calls, leading to further selling pressure. The result was one of the largest single-day crypto futures liquidation events this quarter. Which Cryptocurrencies Suffered the Most Damage? The breakdown reveals which digital assets bore the brunt of this crypto futures liquidation storm: Bitcoin (BTC) : $311 million liquidated, with 86.01% being long positions Ethereum (ETH) : $133 million liquidated, with 64.6% from long positions Solana (SOL) : $38.74 million liquidated, with 81.64% from long positions This pattern clearly shows that bullish traders suffered the most significant losses during this crypto futures liquidation event. The overwhelming majority of positions closed were long bets that prices would continue rising. How Can Traders Protect Against Future Liquidation Events? Experienced traders emphasize several strategies to minimize exposure to sudden crypto futures liquidation risks. First, proper position sizing ensures that market movements don’t immediately trigger margin calls. Second, using stop-loss orders at appropriate levels can help manage risk before positions reach liquidation thresholds. Moreover, maintaining adequate margin buffer provides crucial protection against volatility spikes. Many traders who suffered in this recent crypto futures liquidation event had over-leveraged their positions, leaving little room for price fluctuations. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market’s Future? While dramatic, such crypto futures liquidation events often represent healthy market corrections that wash out excessive leverage. They typically create stronger foundations for future price movements by removing unstable positions from the system. However, the scale of this particular crypto futures liquidation suggests the market had accumulated significant speculative excess. Market recovery patterns following major liquidation events often provide valuable insights into underlying strength. If prices stabilize quickly and volume remains healthy, it indicates strong fundamental support levels. Conversely, continued weakness might signal deeper market concerns beyond just leveraged positions. Key Takeaways from the $482 Million Wipeout This substantial crypto futures liquidation event serves as a powerful reminder of several crucial trading principles. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses, making risk management essential in volatile markets. The concentration of losses in long positions highlights the dangers of one-directional betting during uncertain market conditions. Furthermore, the domino effect seen in this crypto futures liquidation demonstrates how interconnected positions can create cascading market movements. Understanding these dynamics helps traders anticipate potential volatility and position themselves accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation occurs when traders’ positions fall below maintenance margin requirements, triggering automatic closure by exchanges to prevent negative balances. Why were long positions hit harder in this liquidation event? Long positions suffered more because prices moved downward rapidly, catching bullish traders who had bet on continued price increases off guard. How can I avoid getting liquidated in crypto futures trading? Use proper risk management, avoid over-leveraging, maintain adequate margin buffers, and set appropriate stop-loss orders to protect your positions. Do liquidation events like this create buying opportunities? Often yes, as forced selling can push prices below fundamental values, though timing entry points requires careful analysis of market conditions. How often do major liquidation events occur in crypto markets? Significant liquidation events typically happen during periods of high volatility, with frequency varying based on market conditions and leverage levels in the system. Which exchanges reported the highest liquidation volumes? While specific exchange data varies, major platforms like Binance, OKX, and Bybit typically see the highest volumes during widespread liquidation events.

Yet order books, long-term charts and past pullbacks show deep bids and familiar volatility patterns beneath the surface. Bitcoin Trails U.S. Treasuries on One-Year Performance Chart Bitcoin is now lagging U.S. Treasuries over the past year, according to new data from Barchart. A comparative chart of Bitcoin versus the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) shows Treasuries holding a small gain while Bitcoin has slipped into negative territory on a 12-month basis. Bitcoin vs Treasuries Performance Chart. Source: Barchart The chart indicates long-duration Treasuries are up roughly 3% over the period, while Bitcoin is down about 3% after giving back a mid-year rally. As a result, the traditionally safer bond proxy has outperformed the leading cryptocurrency during a stretch marked by shifting expectations for U.S. interest rates and risk assets. Analyst Highlights Bitcoin’s History of Steep but Routine Bull-Market Pullbacks A separate chart from analyst Rajat Soni adds context to Bitcoin’s latest slide, showing that sharp drawdowns have repeatedly appeared during past bull cycles. He noted that Bitcoin fell from about $126,000 to $94,000 since mid-October, a drop of roughly 25.5%. Bitcoin Bull Market Pullbacks. Source: Rajat Soni Historical weekly data on the chart illustrates multiple declines of 20% to 38% during the 2016–2017 uptrend. Each pullback appeared inside a broader rising structure, underscoring how deep retracements often occurred before the market continued higher. The chart marks at least six such corrections, all within the same multi-year advance. Soni said these moves fit Bitcoin’s typical bull-market profile, where volatility compresses and expands through each leg of the trend. Therefore, he framed the current drop as consistent with past behavior rather than an outlier, noting that similar declines have previously appeared ahead of renewed strength. Bitcoin Search Interest Falls Back to Bear-Market Levels A separate signal from Google Trends shows retail attention fading even as Bitcoin weathers its latest correction. Brian Rose, founder and host of London Real, highlighted that global searches for “Bitcoin” have dropped to their lowest level in a year. Bitcoin Search Interest Levels. Source: Google Trends / X The chart tracks interest over time and now places current readings near levels last seen during prior bear markets. That pattern suggests far fewer casual or first-time participants are searching for Bitcoin compared with the spikes seen near past price peaks. Rose noted that similar periods of low search interest have often preceded later rallies, as markets rebuild away from crowded, hype-driven phases. In this view, subdued retail attention lines up with the idea that recent volatility may be unfolding in a quieter stage of the broader cycle. Buy Walls Rebuild as Bitcoin Pullback Fits Long-Term Uptrend Fresh order book data shows buyers stepping back in after Bitcoin’s slide into the mid-$90,000 range. Analyst Crypto Patel noted that traders who sold near $102,000–$106,000 are now rebuying, with dense buy walls clustered between $90,000 and $95,000 on Binance. That band is emerging as a key zone where dip demand is starting to absorb supply. Bitcoin Buy Walls Around 90K to 95K.

These investors, seeking a lead in the artificial intelligence industry, argue that the firms are crucial in driving the industry forward . This shift to investing in the supply chain, from power generators to materials that power data centers, indicates growing concern among investors regarding the price hikes on pure AI stocks . On the other hand, analysts expressed their belief that firms backing this tech sector present a more budget-friendly approach to get involved in the leading trend this year. The effects of this shift have already begun to be visible in the market. This was discovered after reports from sources indicated that an index monitoring Chinese energy stocks rose 10% in October, bolstering predictions of outperforming the CSI 300 Index for a second consecutive month. Notably, seven of the last month’s top ten gainers on this benchmark are connected to AI infrastructure. No power, no AI On October 31, BofA Securities analysts, including Matty Zhao, released a statement highlighting “No power, no AI.” This statement pointed out their argument that China is privileged over Europe, the US, and Southeast Asia. This is due to the country’s substantial generation capacity, lower electricity expenses , and abundant renewable energy resources. Following this power-abundant environment, BofA Securities anticipated that approximately one-third of China’s total spending on AI would be allocated to constructing necessary facilities, with considerable funds allocated to metals, power, and cooling systems by 2030. Reliable sources noted that some of the main beneficiaries of this growth are power equipment producers, who are greatly benefiting as data centers require a more substantial electricity supply. UBS Group AG also shared its recent prediction concerning the situation. The company has increased its prediction for China’s power demand growth to 8% by 2028-2030, outlining exports, data centers, and electrification as crucial components. During a briefing on Wednesday this week, Ken Liu, who leads Greater China energy transition and renewables research, mentioned that they favor local power equipment makers. According to Liu, the government intends to improve energy infrastructure investment in its upcoming five-year plan. Meanwhile, recent reports revealed that shares of solar energy equipment company CSI Solar Co. have soared by 31% this month. In comparison, those of electrical component manufacturer TBEA Co. have increased by almost 21% during the same time. Contrastingly, the CSI 300 index has remained unchanged. However, even with this increase, reports from sources pointed out that the CSI 300 Energy Index has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 13 for the next year. This ratio is significantly lower than the technology sector’s ratio of 34 within the same index. For metals used in building data centers and AI facilities, such as those in energy systems and servers, analysts have discovered that they are once again capturing the spotlight. This was after their prices had escalated, and many investors began to view the metals as a viable economic investment in the AI boom. Data centers drive metal demand in China BofA Securities mentioned that data centers are emerging as a major driver of copper demand in China . Following this discovery, they forecast a 20% average annual increase in copper consumption at these facilities until 2030. Reports also indicated that the brokerage predicted that growth in aluminum stocks would remain robust. At this time, sources with knowledge about the matter noted that Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. was ranked among the top tiers on the CSI 300 Index and had recorded a gain of approximately 35% over the past month. Similarly, Shandong Nanshan Aluminum Co. and Yunnan Aluminum Co. have each gained about 30%. These results prompted analysts to predict that the demand for backup emergency equipment will also increase as data centers aim to maintain power supply during outages. “This area is expected to significantly benefit A-share listed companies in the future,” Yishu Yan, a utilities analyst at UBS Securities, said.

Key Factors Influencing Zcash Future Price Several critical elements will determine Zcash future price movements: Regulatory clarity on privacy coins Adoption by privacy-conscious users and institutions Technological developments and protocol upgrades Overall cryptocurrency market cycles Competition from other privacy solutions Frequently Asked Questions What makes Zcash different from Bitcoin? Zcash utilizes zero-knowledge proofs through zk-SNARKs technology, enabling private transactions while Bitcoin transactions are transparent on the blockchain. Who created Zcash? Zcash was developed by Zcash Electric Coin Company with contributions from renowned cryptographers including Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn . Is Zcash completely anonymous? Zcash offers selective privacy – users can choose between transparent and shielded transactions, providing flexibility rather than mandatory anonymity. How does Zcash compare to Monero? While both focus on privacy, Zcash uses zk-SNARKs for optional privacy, whereas Monero uses ring signatures and stealth addresses for mandatory privacy. What companies support Zcash? Several major exchanges including Coinbase and Binance support Zcash trading, and the Zcash Foundation continues to drive development. Conclusion: The Future of Zcash Investment Zcash presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. While regulatory challenges exist, the growing importance of digital privacy and Zcash’s technological sophistication suggest strong long-term potential.

The initial update described a surge in account activations, a spike in AccountSet transactions, and an increase in the number of multisignature operations, all occurring across a concentrated short period. Vet indicated uncertainty about the actor behind the activity, but flagged the pattern as notable and worthy of further attention from observers and developers monitoring ledger health. Follow-up: failed transactions traced to a scripting error In a subsequent update, VET clarified that the earlier anomaly had a technical explanation. According to the validator, a custody provider’s internal script began issuing repeated transactions that did not complete because the provider’s account depleted its XRP balance. The validator characterized the behavior as the result of an erroneous loop in the provider’s automation that repeatedly attempted transactions until funds were exhausted, which produced a stream of failed entries on the ledger. The validator described the failed attempts as automated and unintentional rather than deliberate network abuse. BitGo topped up their account with fresh XRP and continues to activate accounts again, this time successfully. What they up to remains unknown. Hope the script is fixed now. https://t.co/FXVYqLaJy5 pic.twitter.com/lGbl0kNtwO — Vet (@Vet_X0) November 12, 2025 Recovery and resumed activations after funding Vet’s most recent message confirms that the custody provider replenished its account with XRP and resumed successful account activations. The validator noted that account activations are now completing as intended, but emphasized that the underlying purpose of the batch activations remains unclear. Vet expressed a cautious hope that the scripting issue that produced the earlier failed transactions has been corrected, while leaving open the question of what the provider’s operational objective is for the renewed activation activity. Evidence and context from ledger snapshots Images attached by the validator show an account labeled as a custody initialization wallet and list multiple outgoing payment transactions dated 11/12/2025 with individual amounts of 1.222500 XRP. The account summary in those snapshots records an available balance above 1,000 XRP after recent activity and traces the account’s activation and transaction history. Those ledger entries corroborate the validator’s reporting of a high volume of activation-related transactions occurring within a short timeframe and of a period in which transactions failed when the account reached a low balance. Implications and outstanding questions The sequence of reports from the validator frames the incident as operational rather than malicious: automated scripts generating repeated attempts, a temporary depletion of funds, replenishment followed by resumed operations. Key questions remain unanswered, chiefly the explicit intent behind the large-scale activations and whether any internal controls were changed to prevent future automation errors. VET’s updates leave the matter open to further technical review by validators, node operators, and the custody provider involved, who may need to disclose remedial steps to prevent recurrence.

The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio provides crucial insights into trader sentiment across major exchanges. Understanding these metrics can help you make more informed trading decisions and spot potential market movements before they happen. What Do Current BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios Reveal? Over the past 24 hours, the overall BTC perpetual futures landscape shows a nearly balanced but slightly bearish sentiment. The combined ratio across the top three exchanges by open interest stands at 48.46% long positions versus 51.54% short positions. This delicate balance indicates traders are cautiously positioned, with a slight lean toward expecting downward price movement. Breaking Down Exchange-Specific BTC Perpetual Futures Data Each major exchange tells its own story through their BTC perpetual futures ratios. Here’s the detailed breakdown: Binance : 49.11% long / 50.89% short Bybit : 48.29% long / 51.71% short Gate.io : 49.82% long / 50.18% short Interestingly, Gate.io shows the most balanced ratio, while Bybit exhibits the strongest bearish sentiment among the three major platforms. Why Monitor BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios? Tracking BTC perpetual futures data offers several advantages for traders and investors. First, it serves as a real-time sentiment indicator, showing whether traders are optimistic or pessimistic about Bitcoin’s immediate price direction. Second, extreme ratios often signal potential market reversals. When too many traders lean in one direction, the market frequently moves opposite to crowd expectations. How to Use This Information in Your Trading Strategy Current BTC perpetual futures ratios suggest a cautiously bearish market environment. However, the close numbers indicate uncertainty rather than strong conviction. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor for ratio extremes that might signal reversal opportunities Combine this data with other technical indicators for confirmation Watch for sudden shifts in ratios that might precede significant price movements The Big Picture: What These Numbers Mean for Bitcoin The current BTC perpetual futures ratios reflect a market in equilibrium with a slight bearish tilt. This suggests traders are waiting for clearer signals before taking strong directional positions. The consistency across exchanges indicates this sentiment is widespread rather than isolated to specific trading communities. Frequently Asked Questions What is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio? The ratio shows the percentage of long versus short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across exchanges, indicating overall market sentiment. Why are there differences between exchanges? Different exchanges attract different trader demographics and have varying fee structures, leading to slight variations in positioning. How often should I check these ratios? Daily monitoring helps track sentiment shifts, but significant changes matter more than daily fluctuations. Can these ratios predict Bitcoin price movements? While not perfect predictors, extreme ratios often precede market reversals as crowded trades become unsustainable. Which exchange has the most reliable data? All three exchanges provide reliable data, but Binance typically has the highest open interest and liquidity. How do I access this data myself? Most exchanges provide this information through their API or on their trading data pages for public access. Found this analysis helpful?

SNX/USD 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Synthetix Coin signals selling pressure on the coin at the current price level. The SNX/USD price slightly decreased to $0.728 after going through a correction. However, the low volatility levels suggest a decreased probability of an upcoming reversal or further price oscillation. The upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.830, marking the resistance level.

Its value decreased to 39.99 over the past four hours. The downward curve on the RSI graph reflects an unbalanced trading environment. The bears have been dominating the price chart for the past few hours and are still trying to maintain their lead. This trend has also resulted in a relatively unbalanced trading setup for intraday traders.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows an upward trend regarding current market events. The coin’s price has increased to $0.728 in the last 24 hours. If the bullish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest resistance at the $0.755 level. Conversely, if selling pressure overwhelms, the altcoin may dip to the $0.691 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $7.57 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is in a bullish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting positive sentiment as the SNX price increased to $0.728, gaining 1.54% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $2.00 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2028. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $6? Considering the future price movements, SNX will reach the $6 level by 2029. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like a far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $8.68, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $8.68 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment. However, one’s own research is advised.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The highest price of the SNX token was 2.27 in January, but it corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781, showing significant growth. From August to September, SNX’s average price remained around $0.65 to $0.67, and in October 2025, SNX was trading above $1, finally peaking at $2.58 on the 13th of the month.

Key Takeaways: Santiment warns that rising “bottom is in” sentiment often signals more downside, noting Bitcoin chatter has turned increasingly fearful. Bitcoin’s social dominance has surged above 40% as positive sentiment hits a one-month low. Amid $1.17B in recent ETF outflows, Santiment says such outflows have historically aligned with market bottoms. “Be cautious when you see a widespread consensus forming about a specific price bottom,” the firm said in a report published Saturday , adding that “true bottoms often form when the majority expects prices to fall further.” The warning comes after Bitcoin briefly slipped below $95,000 on Friday during a broader tech-led sell-off. Santiment: “Worst Is Over” Chatter Signals More Downside Ahead Santiment noted a surge in social media chatter claiming the worst is over, a signal it believes often points in the opposite direction. Historically, bottom-calling tends to spike when psychological thresholds such as Bitcoin dropping under $100,000 are breached. The firm added that Bitcoin’s ratio of positive to negative comments is now at its lowest point in more than a month, with “social dominance” soaring above 40%. “As Bitcoin’s price fell, its social dominance soared to over 40%, showing it is the main topic of a very fearful conversation,” the report said. Some market participants tied the drop to Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, with mentions of “Saylor” jumping sharply as prices fell. #Bitcoin Bottom is in. pic.twitter.com/YmlHq7flr0 — 𝕄𝕠𝕦𝕤𝕥𝕒𝕔ⓗ𝕖 (@el_crypto_prof) November 14, 2025 During an appearance on CNBC, Saylor denied rumors that the company had been selling any of its Bitcoin. Santiment also argued that recent spot Bitcoin ETF outflows, which totaled $1.17 billion over the past three trading days, could ultimately prove bullish. “Large ETF inflows have often marked local price tops, while significant outflows have coincided with market bottoms, suggesting retail panic,” the firm said. Thursday alone saw $866 million in net outflows, the second-worst day on record. The deterioration in sentiment has pushed the Crypto Fear & Greed Index down to an “Extreme Fear” score of 10, its lowest since Feb. 27. Bitcoin Stalls Below $96K, But Analysts Say This Drop Looks Milder Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim the $96,000 level following Friday’s sharp drop, echoing similar conditions seen earlier in the year when the asset tumbled from $102,000 to $84,000. Yet some analysts view the current environment as less severe than previous downturns. Bitwise’s European head of research, Andre Dragosh, said the situation “isn’t as bleak” compared with earlier corrections, adding that Bitwise’s sentiment index is showing a “positive divergence.” UPDATE: Our Cryptoasset Sentiment Index also continues to show a positive divergence.

While President Donald Trump recently signed a bill ending the longest government shutdown in US history, an event some traders blamed for heightened volatility, attention has now shifted to the Federal Reserve’s next rate decision . Despite the gloomy sentiment, some analysts see constructive signals on the charts. NorthmanTrader founder Sven Henrich pointed to a “falling wedge” pattern and “positive divergence,” calling it “potentially positive” for Bitcoin bulls. Others note a striking gap between sentiment and fundamentals. Messari research manager “DRXL” said that in eight years in the industry , he has never seen “such dissonance between the headlines and the sentiment,” adding, “Everything we once dreamed of is happening, yet it somehow feels… over.” The post Market Bottom Won’t Come When Everyone Expects It, Santiment Warns appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-15 08:37:37

Key Takeaways: BitMine named Chi Tsang as its new CEO while expanding its Ether treasury to more than 3.5 million ETH. The company is shifting from mining to a treasury-focused model, attracting institutional interest. Despite its massive ETH holdings, BitMine’s stock has dropped 35% in the past month. In a notice released Friday , the company said Chi Tsang will replace Jonathan Bates as CEO, with the transition taking effect immediately. BitMine Says $11B ETH Stack Positions It as a Future Financial Giant The move comes as BitMine’s ETH holdings surge to more than 3.5 million tokens, valued at over $11 billion based on Monday’s price of $3,175. Tsang said the company’s position has now expanded beyond its mining origins. “With its substantial Ethereum holdings and credibility with both Wall Street and the Ethereum ecosystem, BitMine is positioned to become a leading financial institution,” he said. Alongside the leadership change, BitMine appointed three new independent board members. Originally founded as a mining operation under Chairman Tom Lee, the company has since shifted into a treasury-focused model, mirroring Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the most prominent public holder of Bitcoin. BREAKING: MASSIVE MOVE FROM BITMINE $BMNR BitMine just appointed a new CEO + 3 independent board members, signalling the next major phase of growth. Why this is HUGE: • New CEO Chi Tsang steps in with a mandate to scale • Board strengthened with Sechan, Howe &… pic.twitter.com/YsTt3tuj58 — BMNR Bullz (@BMNRBullz) November 14, 2025 The company has also seen fresh interest from institutional investors. ARK Invest disclosed on Nov. 7 that it purchased roughly $2 million worth of BitMine shares, expanding its ETF exposure to Ether-linked equities. Despite the growing treasury, BitMine’s stock has struggled. Shares have fallen around 35% over the past month, trading at $34.43 at the time of publication. The crypto treasury trend continues to spread beyond the sector’s two largest players. Forward Industries now holds the biggest Solana position among public companies, with an estimated 6.82 million SOL. Meanwhile, Leap Therapeutics, newly rebranded as Cypherpunk Technologies, revealed on Wednesday that it adopted a Zcash treasury strategy, purchasing $50 million worth of ZEC as it pivots into the privacy-focused crypto space. Ethereum Whales Accumulate 7.6M ETH as Market Enters Compression Phase As repored, Ethereum whales have significantly increased their exposure as ETH hovers near $3,000, a trend analysts say has historically preceded major market reversals. CryptoQuant data shows wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have accumulated 7.6 million ETH since April, a 52% jump, while smaller holders continue to trim their balances. The divergence suggests institutional-sized players are positioning for a potential rebound, even as retail remains cautious. Analysts also point to repeated spikes in Ethereum’s spot trading volume since early November, a pattern commonly seen in late-stage compression phases before large price moves. Meanwhile, Ethereum network fees have plunged to some of their lowest levels in years, with gas prices dropping to 0.067 Gwei last week as onchain activity slowed following October’s market-wide crash. During the 2021 bull run, transaction costs on Ethereum’s base layer frequently exceeded $100–$150, driving users toward cheaper alternatives and layer-2 solutions. However, since the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which optimized gas fees for layer-2 rollups, Ethereum’s fee revenue has collapsed by 99%, according to Token Terminal.

Litecoin Surges 20% as Privacy Upgrade Sparks Institutional Interest Litecoin (LTC) surged 20% this week following the rollout of its MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade. This feature introduces optional privacy, greater scalability, and improved transaction efficiency, positioning Litecoin as a compliant alternative to fully private coins like Zcash. Institutional investors are taking notice, increasingly viewing LTC as “digital silver with privacy,” ideal for regulated environments. Analysts now predict a potential breakout toward the $210–$250 range if Litecoin can hold support above $150. Beyond privacy, its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and predictable halving events keep it firmly on the radar of long-term holders, blending Bitcoin’s trust with Ethereum-like flexibility at a lower cost. Frequently Asked Questions about Litecoin How does Litecoin’s MWEB enhance its utility? MWEB introduces optional privacy and scalability. It allows users to make confidential transactions while remaining compliant, creating a hybrid model that appeals to both institutions and privacy-focused investors. Is Litecoin still a good long-term hold? Yes. Litecoin’s robust fundamentals, active developer support, and growing institutional usage make it a reliable asset for investors seeking long-term stability alongside moderate price appreciation. Conclusion From TRON’s rapid ecosystem expansion to Litecoin’s privacy-focused resurgence, 2025’s market is clearly rewarding projects that combine real innovation with proven reliability. Yet even in this competitive field, BullZilla ($BZIL) stands apart as both an emotional and financial revolution for investors. It fuses cinematic storytelling, programmed scarcity, and high-yield staking into a transparent, high-performance ecosystem engineered for long-term growth rather than short-lived hype. More than a meme coin, it operates as a movement designed to help everyday investors turn conviction into meaningful outcomes. BullZilla redefines what it means to buy top cryptos this month, offering structure, vision, and purpose wrapped in a community-driven narrative.

As false claims of a $1 billion BTC sale spread and MSTR slides toward long-term support, new on-chain data and Saylor’s comments show the company is still accumulating. Analyst Rebuts Claims MicroStrategy Dumped $1B in Bitcoin False claims that MicroStrategy sold $1 billion worth of Bitcoin spread across social media after large transfers from its wallets appeared on-chain. Influencer accounts framed the moves as a massive sell-off, fueling fresh fear and confusion among retail traders. MicroStrategy Wallet Transfers. Source: TedPillows However, on-chain analyst Ted, known as @TedPillows, said the transactions were internal wallet movements, not sales. He pointed to transfer records showing coins moving from one Strategy-labeled address to another, with no evidence of flows to exchanges. Ted said the episode shows how quickly misleading narratives can form when large crypto transfers hit tracking dashboards. He urged users to mute what he called “clickbait accounts” and instead verify wallet activity before repeating market-moving claims. Saylor Confirms Ongoing Bitcoin Purchases After Defending Volatility on Air Michael Saylor reinforced his long-term Bitcoin stance during a televised interview, where he said volatility is “part of the territory” for anyone investing in the asset. He reminded viewers that Bitcoin has endured multiple deep drawdowns over the years, yet its long-term performance continues to outpace major asset classes. Saylor pointed to Bitcoin’s rapid swings over recent cycles, noting that the market moved from about $55,000 to $94,000 across 14 months and rallied sharply after the Trump election. He said these moves highlight why investors need a multiyear time horizon. “If you want to ride the rocket, you’ve got to be prepared to pull the Gs,” he said. After the interview aired, Saylor confirmed his buying stance on X . “We bought bitcoin every day this week,” he wrote, signaling that MicroStrategy continues to accumulate despite market uncertainty. His comments came shortly after another circulating quote attributed to him by Sweep : “Even if Bitcoin hits $1, I won’t get liquidated.” MicroStrategy’s recent wallet activity and Saylor’s comments both point to continued Bitcoin accumulation despite the latest price swings. Meanwhile, MSTR Slides Toward Key Technical Support as Bitcoin Weakens MicroStrategy’s stock is approaching a critical technical level as Bitcoin trades below its recent $94,000 support. A weekly chart shared by Stock Trader Hub shows MSTR drifting toward the 200-week simple moving average, a long-term indicator that often acts as a final support zone during broad market pullbacks. MSTR Weekly 200 SMA Retest. Source: X The chart highlights how MSTR has already broken through multiple Fibonacci levels, with its price now sitting near $199 and trending lower. As Bitcoin continues to fade, analysts say the next major level for the stock sits near the 200-week SMA around $138, a zone marked on the chart with an arrow. This setup reflects the high correlation between MicroStrategy and Bitcoin. When Bitcoin loses major support levels, MSTR typically reacts with outsized moves because the company’s valuation is tied directly to the strength of its BTC holdings. The current decline suggests traders are preparing for more volatility if Bitcoin fails to stabilize above its next key levels.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-15 08:50:04

Cardano is drawing serious attention from institutional players, especially after Franklin Templeton began operating full nodes on its network. At the same time, Chainlink is holding a tight trading range that many traders believe could be the setup for a strong recovery phase this November. And quietly building momentum in the background is a cross-chain payments project gaining real-world traction faster than expected. This trio is now being viewed as offering a prime entry point before bigger capital inflows arrive. Cardano: Institutional Confidence Meets Steady Technicals Cardano continues proving critics wrong by securing institutional backing despite trading at a modest $0.52 price. Franklin Templeton’s decision to deploy Cardano nodes signals confidence at the infrastructure level, not just speculative interest. ADA has held firm around the $0.501 support zone, rebounding on strong volume and showing signs of renewed strength. Analysts also highlight early Bitcoin-to-Cardano Ordinals activity as a development that could eventually open new cross-border settlement pathways worth trillions. If you’re hunting for a solid crypto trading under a buck that’s got real staying power, Cardano’s the one that catches my eye every time. With its no-BS regulatory setup, that brainy academic approach to building out the tech, and a track record of steady tweaks and improvements, it’s got the kind of rock-solid base that makes sense for folks playing the long game. Chainlink: Quiet Accumulation Before the Next Move Chainlink’s sideways movement between roughly $14.3 and $16 masks a potential breakout setup. The oracle provider has spent months building a base while whales slowly accumulated positions. Should LINK finally bust through that stubborn short-term resistance, the analyst crowd’s whispering about a solid run up to $27 before we wrap the year. And if you squint toward 2026, they’re floating mid-$40 territory as a real shot. Chainlink is unique because it addresses a significant issue in the industry, the inability to provide secure and decentralized data directly to blockchains without the use of intermediaries. LINK adoption is increasing rapidly, and institutions are increasing the staking rewards ecosystem. LINK has a proven and battle-tested technology, which analysts say shows that Chainlink’s value is not founded on speculation, and the risk-reward potential is particularly appealing at current prices. Remittix: The PayFi Project Delivering Real Utility Before Launch While Cardano and Chainlink offer strong foundations, Remittix is gaining ground as a project built entirely around real-world payments rather than speculation. It already boasts 40,000+ holders and has raised over $28.1 million, numbers rarely seen for a pre-launch token. The project’s CertiK audit ranked it as the #1 pre-launch asset globally, giving early investors confidence in its security. Why RTX Keeps Gaining Attention Direct crypto-to-bank payments across 30+ nations Designed for freelancers, global workers, and businesses, not just traders Handles over 40 different cryptos and 30+ fiat options Buzzing community vibe with more than 40,000 verified holders Deflationary Token Model: Long-term holder value coded in Compared to traditional altcoins like XRP, which still lack seamless global bank-transfer execution at scale, Remittix is directly targeting the same problem with functional infrastructure already in the wild. A Final Window Before Broader Exposure The Remittix community giveaway, now at 370,000+ entries, reflects rising interest ahead of the wallet rollout and confirmed listings on LBank and BitMart. Its referral program pays 15% USDT rewards, creating a compounding mechanism that early buyers are already taking advantage of. For investors looking for undervalued altcoins before major market repricing, this may be one of the last windows. Remittix, much like early Chainlink, now sits in the category of top cryptos to invest in today, and whales are piling in before the wider market catches on.

Related Reading: XRP Earns Academic Praise: University Study Calls It ‘Gold In Your Hands’ According to Chainalysis, crypto scams sent close to $10 billion on-chain in 2024, with pig-butchering revenue growing almost 40% year-over-year and the number of deposits into those scams rising more than 200% — even as the average deposit size fell roughly 55%. These shifts point to a model that now relies on many more victims paying smaller amounts, making the operation both lucrative and hard to trace. Organized Networks Behind The Scams Investigators say these are not lone fraudsters. Reports have disclosed that scam networks operate like organized criminal enterprises, sometimes using trafficked workers in compounds to call, message and manage victims. Victim grooming can span weeks or months, turning emotional manipulation into a steady revenue stream for the gangs. Research and reporting have tied some of these operations to regions in Southeast Asia and to groups that move money through concentrated crypto wallets. AI And Marketplaces Help Scammers Scale Law enforcement and analysts warn that generative AI and service markets are making the pig butchering scams cheaper and faster to run. According to Chainalysis and multiple news outlets, AI tools are being used to create convincing chatbots, voice clones and fake profiles, while online marketplaces sell domain services and hosting that let scammers spin up lifelike investment sites. That combination has helped fraud operators widen their reach and target more people at once. Infrastructure And Sanctions Authorities have started to hit the infrastructure that supports the scams. The US Treasury’s OFAC sanctioned a Philippines-based firm, Funnull Technology Inc., and its alleged administrator for supplying internet infrastructure and tools used by fraud networks. Chainalysis and other researchers tied Funnull’s services to sites used in pig-butchering, and US losses linked to those operations were said to exceed $200 million in some investigations. Sanctions aim to cut off access to the web services scammers use to appear legitimate. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Exchanges And Stablecoin Issuers Help Freeze Illicit Funds Private companies have been part of the response. In a coordinated effort with APAC law enforcement, Chainalysis, exchanges and stablecoin issuers helped trace and block nearly $47 million in USDT that had been consolidated by scammers into a few wallets. Earlier actions involving other cases led to much larger freezes. Those moves show how industry cooperation can stop some cash-outs before criminals convert crypto into fiat.

This claim, which quickly spread on social media, fueled further panic as the BTC price fell below $95,000. However, both on-chain data and Saylor's statement revealed that the sales claims were false. When Arkham Intelligence data revealed that Strategy transferred 43,415 BTC ($4.26 billion) worth of assets to more than 100 new addresses today, the community panicked about the sale. As the allegations grew, Michael Saylor issued a brief statement: “There is no truth to these rumors.” Related News: Death Cross Alert in Bitcoin (BTC) - Watch Out for Tomorrow, Analyst Warns Analysis by Arkham's research team reveals that the movements were unrelated to the sale, but were part of the custodian change and wallet rotation process Strategy has been conducting over the past two weeks. Over the past two weeks, the platform has detected regular transfers indicating the company is moving BTC from Coinbase Custody to a new custodian. Today's significant activity is a continuation of this process. According to the analysis, there may be three main reasons for transfers: Direct transfers from Coinbase Custody to the new custodian, Internal transfers made by the new custodian within its own security system, Wallet refresh operations are performed on the Coinbase side when the wallet becomes empty. None of these movements mean that a BTC sale has occurred. Experts note that large institutional Bitcoin holders occasionally perform wallet refreshes and custodian changes due to security and operational requirements. Strategy is among the companies that regularly perform these transactions. *This is not investment advice.

Bitdeer’s ability to navigate these challenges is crucial. For instance, high electricity costs can erode profits, but efficient cloud mining solutions help mitigate this. Additionally, market volatility requires agile decision-making, as seen in their weekly sales. By addressing these issues, Bitdeer sets a benchmark for sustainable Bitcoin mining practices.

The Hong Kong native was indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia for his role in the conspiracy. According to United States authorities, the Hong Kong native, Guanhua Su, filed false SEC investment adviser forms for at least 10 shell businesses that he and other co-conspirators created. Authorities claimed that the false form gave the impression that the firms were legitimate financial advisers, even though they were fake entities. Law enforcement claimed that at least two of the fake entities were then used to convince retail investors through WhatsApp and other social media to invest in stocks of Chinese firms listed on NASDAQ. Hong Kong businessman indicted by federal grand jury According to the indictment , Su, a 37-year-old Hong Kong native who goes by the alias Michael Su, was the managing director and marketing director of Rhino Consulting Business Services Ltd. The firm is based in Hong Kong and offers financial services. Authorities claimed that Su and other co-conspirators carried out the alleged offenses between February 2023 and March 2025. Su and other indicted parties created at least 10 shell firms and filed the fraudulent SEC forms on behalf of all the companies. Authorities claimed that he made false statements concerning all the firms, noting examples in relation to filings made for Bluesky Eagle Capital Management and Wisdom Capital Management Group. They claimed that Su allegedly made false statements concerning both firms’ place of business, status as a public company, among others. In the indictment, authorities claimed that Bluesky Eagle and Wisdom Capital were used by the co-conspirators to convince investors to purchase stock of a NASDAQ-listed public company based in the Cayman Islands with business in China. They claimed that at one point, the company operated with a variable interest entity (VIE) structure. The co-conspirators also allegedly promised returns of up to 500% to their WhatsApp investors, promising to compensate them for all losses. Indictment opens a can of worms The indictment further alleges that the co-conspirator told investors to purchase stock of the public company promoted by WhatsApp accounts associated with the sham firms. They sold the company’s stock through foreign brokerage accounts, gaining proceeds of up to $211 million. However, in April 2024, the public company’s stock collapsed by 88% resulting in huge losses for investors. On November 13, the SEC filed civil actions against a number of entities for which the DOJ had charged Su with filing false forms with the regulator. In its filing, the SEC noted that it initiated proceedings against Bluesky Eagle and Supreme Power Capital Management in the Southern District of New York. In addition, it also filed actions against AI Financial Education Foundation, Adamant Stone, AI Investment Education Foundation, and Invesco Alpha in the District of Colorado. The SEC had previously filed a civil action against Wisdom Capital in the District of Columbia. Meanwhile, Su has been charged with conspiracy to commit Securities fraud, making material misstatements in a report filed with the SEC, and false statements. If convicted, the Hong Kong native faces a maximum penalty of five years for each count. “Today’s indictment charges the defendant for his alleged role in a complex securities fraud scheme that caused hundreds of millions of dollars in investor losses,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. He added that the division is fully against foreign actors who intend to victimize American retail investors. Galeotti noted that under his leadership, the Criminal Division is committed to actively investigating and prosecuting criminals who steal from US citizens through fraud and deceit. “The SEC-OIG will tirelessly investigate domestic and foreign actors who seek to abuse the SEC’s processes for malicious purposes,” said SEC Inspector General (SEC-OIG) Kevin B.

CLSK's net dilution from the convertible offering is about 10%, but the market reacted negatively, with shares dropping over 26% since the announcement. Based on updated book value estimates, CLSK trades at a P/B ratio of 1.6-1.7, which is not historically cheap and may compress further. Given ongoing Bitcoin price weakness and mining headwinds, I recommend waiting for a better entry point before considering CLSK as a swing trade. It has been over six months since I last covered CleanSpark ( CLSK ) for Seeking Alpha. At that time, the stock was trading at about $8 per share, and I called it a speculative 'buy' based on a technical breakout in the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) that I thought would propel CLSK shares higher. Data by YCharts While I've certainly had some Bitcoin miner calls that have not worked out as well this year, the CLSK 'buy' was well-timed. The stock rallied through spring and early summer before pulling back just before a monster run in September and early October that took shares of CLSK up north of $20 per share. It's been a rough go for CLSK shareholders since. In this update, we'll look at the company's recently announced convertible note offering and build a book value estimate based on the company's mining footprint and BTC holdings. $1.15 Billion Convertible Notes CleanSpark had long been one of the few Bitcoin miners that held off on the HPC/AI data center pivot. That recently changed. And while I'm not sure I'm the biggest fan of pivoting to HPC this late in the game , if CleanSpark is going to actually enter this business, it's doing so with a capital raise that I think is reasonably advantageous to the company. On November 10th, CleanSpark announced $1 billion in zero-interest convertible notes due in February 2032. That offering was up-sized to $1.15 billion shortly after. Per the terms of deal, the convertible notes are unsecured and are convertible to either cash, common at $19.16 per share, or some combination of the two at CleanSpark's discretion. Following the capital raise, CleanSpark spent $460 million of the proceeds and bought back 30.6 million shares at $15.03 per share. It's an interesting strategy because it cuts the potential shareholder dilution from converts by slightly more than half: Value Share Price Shares Converts $1,150,000,000 $19.16 60,020,877 Buybacks $460,000,000 $15.03 30,605,456 Net dilution 29,415,421 Source: CleanSpark, analyst's calculations So essentially, the company has raised roughly $690 million that it plans to invest in its HPC buildout. The net dilution of 29.4 million shares represents an increase of about 10% from the 281 million shares outstanding at the end of June. The market's reaction to converts has been quite poor, to say the least: Data by YCharts With Bitcoin down about 3% since CleanSpark's convertible note announcement on the 10th, shares of CLSK are down more than 26%. And while the mining sector is broadly down, CLSK has been beaten up a bit more than peers like Hut 8 ( HUT ) or MARA Holdings ( MARA ); each of which are similarly sized by market capitalization. Valuation Considerations With the caveat that we don't yet have calendar Q3 numbers for CleanSpark, given what we know about CleanSpark's convertible note details, we can build a rough estimate for the company's book valuation today based on the same 50 EH/s in operational hashrate that CleanSpark had at the end of Q2. Valuation Estimate Figures Bitcoin Holdings $1,251,168,000 Net Prop/Plant/Equip $1,350,000,000 Goodwill/Other assets $550,000,000 Post-Convert Cash $690,000,000 Total Assets $3,841,168,000 Total Liabilities End of Q2 $955,000,000 Convert Debt $1,150,000,000 Shareholder equity $1,736,168,000 Shares Outstanding 251,000,000 Book value $6.92 Source: Analyst's Estimate based on Q2 balance sheet, BTC value, and In this table, I've marked the company's 13,033 BTC to a market price of $96,000, which is the level that Bitcoin is currently trading at as I write this. I've also reduced the company's shares outstanding from Q2 by 30 million, given CleanSpark's recent share buyback. Given the updated shares and Bitcoin price, I think we can reasonably assume CLSK shares have a book valuation around $7 following the convertible note offering. At an intraday CLSK price of $11.50, I estimate CLSK is trading at a P/B ratio between 1.6 and 1.7. This is not a historically high P/B valuation multiple for CLSK shares, but it isn't necessarily cheap either: CLSK P/B History (Seeking Alpha) CleanSpark stock often experiences wild swings in price over very short periods of time. If we go back to last year, a price-to-book level between 1 and 1.2 has been a much better place to buy CLSK shares for a price bounce. However, it absolutely must be noted that during 'crypto winter,' CLSK traded at deep discounts to its book value. At one point in December 2021, CLSK traded at a price-to-book level of just 0.25. My point is, playing CLSK for a swing trade bounce at these levels may come down to where you think we are in Bitcoin's cycle. And unfortunately, I don't think we're at the bottom yet. Closing Summary I have made it no mystery that I've been highly cautious about Bitcoin's price setup for several months . If Bitcoin continues to decline in price, CLSK will almost certainly go down in sympathy. Despite the fact that the company is looking to branch out into HPC and AI compute, the fact of the matter is almost all of the company's assets are tied to Bitcoin's value. As of writing, Bitcoin's hash price has fallen under $40 PH/S per day. The economics of mining continue to be a major headwind for companies like CleanSpark, which I suspect is why mining peer Bitfarms ( BITF ) is positioning to exit the business entirely. I still think CLSK can serve as a terrific swing trade vehicle in the right situation. One of the things that I like to see when picking higher conviction swing trades in the mining stocks is a convergence of factors that I view as indicative of a short-to-medium-term bottom in price. Those factors include valuation compression, reaction to bad news or short squeeze potential, and a positive technical setup for BTC. Right now, I only see one of those factors for CLSK given the market's reaction to the convertible notes. And while I think the market reaction to CleanSpark's convertible note offering was probably a little bit overdone, history says valuation can compress even more. I don't think we're at the bottom for BTC yet. Thus, I'd wait before trying to catch the knife in CLSK.",BTC-USD|CLSK|CLSKW,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-15 09:19:00

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has a strong community, and in spite of the stagnating price and the viability of the asset in the long run, the community still holds. In contrast, new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are starting to see whale accumulation, and interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasing. The platform has potential economic features that are being recognized. These trends show that the sophistication of top crypto holders is increasing and that innovations that provide true economic value, as opposed to irrational speculative value, are being sought. Shiba Inu Price Analysis Operational challenges are starting to dampen the Shiba Inu ecosystem and its previously viral recognition. Concerns about the network’s capacity spawned from security issues arising from coordinated exploits and temporary validator role captures on the Shibarium layer-2 network. Shiba Inu is facing indefensible damage due to prolonged price declines and loss of confidence from community investors. Capital governed by whales, due to the higher likelihood of loss, and the subsequent capital within the ecosystem, have triggered a regulatory response as investments into Shiba Inu, whose fundamentals are more clear, have been made. Smart Money In on the Presale of Mutuum Finance Smart whales are shifting focus toward the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale as a new high-reward opportunity. This is evidenced by increased purchases in the structured presale, signalling increased bullishness. Phase 6 pricing at $0.035 has community investors positioned. This is evidenced by the rapid rate at which Phase 6 filled, coupled with market sentiment anticipating a price rise in Phase 7. The way structured offerings are made at presale is intended to elicit an immediate and urgent response to take a position on an investment at a specified price. Additionally, investors understand that strategically initial participation in a project with sound vetted protocols and sustainable economic framework tiles is more likely to outperform the expected returns on high risk meme coins. Self-Sustaining Buy and Distribute Engine The protocol’s success is dependent on the ecosystem’s self-sustaining distributive buy engine and the appreciation of the token’s value. Scheduled automated fee intervals are applied on the Mutuum Finance platform and a percentage of those fees and revenues is allocated to purchasing MUTM tokens on the open market. The distributive systems are then supported by those who stake their mtTokens. The economic lifecycle of the interdependent systems is predetermined by the ecosystem. Increases in ecosystem activity leads to increases in revenue collected from transaction fees, thus creating buy-side pressure on the MUTM token. The ecosystem is designed to generate economic value with long positions on the token, unlike the other speculative assets in the system. The practical progress of this development is sure to alleviate any last concerns of remaining investors. It underlines that the capital being invested is for a legitimate project that is set to reach mainnet in the coming months. The V1 development will be especially important for whales, as it will alleviate the risk that is commonly associated with early-stage projects. The Smart Money Has Already Chosen The emphasis is now on the fundamentals rather than the conjectural excesses. While Shiba Inu attempts to rehabilitate its prominence within the market, Mutuum Finance is constructing its cohesion around a robust protocol that generates revenue as well as a tokenomic framework that provides for healthy expansion and growth. During this low-price phase of the presale, there is a marked increase in whale accumulation as these investors forecast a rise in value. The opportunity to invest at this price of $0.035 is about to close, and will soon be only attainable for these whale investors. Avoid the herd; contribute to the declining speculation by taking part in the presale for Mutuum Finance.

His latest chart compares the current structure with similar historical periods, showing extended phases of accumulation in previous market cycles. Each of those periods — ranging from 216 to over 500 days — preceded significant shifts in market direction, as the current 2025 phase now lasting around 348 days. The chart presents these past consolidation phases as reference points, underscoring how XRP’s market behavior often follows a cyclical pattern of accumulation before a notable price expansion. This observation positions the ongoing range as a technically significant phase rather than a random fluctuation. $XRP has been moving sideways for almost a year now. The longer the base, the bigger the breakout! pic.twitter.com/uyX5u3LphQ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 12, 2025 Analyst Perspective on Breakout Probability Steph Is Crypto noted that the duration of a consolidation base often determines the magnitude of a subsequent breakout. His comparison suggests that the longer the structure forms, the greater the potential for an extended move once the price escapes the range. XRP’s consistent performance within this confined pattern has, therefore, caught the attention of traders looking for confirmation of a broader trend shift. The analysis implies that despite intermittent volatility, XRP remains structurally intact within its current accumulation zone. Historical precedent, as shown in the analyst’s chart, suggests that similar setups have eventually led to major price advances once momentum builds. This technical perspective highlights consolidation not as stagnation, but as a potential prelude to renewed strength, should a breakout occur. Market Reactions Reinforce Long-Term Confidence Several responses to the post echoed the analyst’s outlook. One market observer remarked that the present volatility stems from retail investors reacting to uncertainty, adding that the decline offers a buying opportunity within the broader consolidation phase. Another participant stated that the extended range formation indicates that any upcoming breakout could be substantial once triggered. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These reactions reflect broader market confidence that XRP’s prolonged sideways structure may serve as the foundation for a decisive upward movement. While no technical setup guarantees future outcomes, the recurring pattern across multiple historical cycles continues to shape sentiment among traders closely tracking the asset’s behavior. Technical Context The extended consolidation period has provided a measure of market stability, despite broader fluctuations across the digital asset sector. If XRP follows its established cyclical pattern , a confirmed breakout above current resistance levels could define the next phase of its price evolution. Until then, the ongoing accumulation phase remains one of the most closely watched developments on the chart, signaling a potential turning point for the asset as it approaches the one-year mark of consolidation.

However, it’s noteworthy that even under overall downward pressure, holders continue to earn a passive income of 5700 XRP daily through LeanHash’s hashrate contracts, demonstrating strong resilience. LeanHash employs an on-chain hashrate income model, combining real hashrate allocation with XRP network activity, decoupling income from price fluctuations. Regardless of market ups and downs, hashrate output remains stable, providing investors with consistent digital asset returns. This “de-priceified” income structure offers XRP holders a new growth path beyond traditional holding or trading. It provides stable cash flow during market downturns and creates a double income effect during price recovery, making the overall portfolio more advantageous. With the continuous expansion of the XRP ecosystem and the listing of the XRPC ETF on Wall Street, more and more investors are beginning to focus on hashrate-based income models that generate real output. LeanHash is becoming an important tool for XRP holders worldwide to increase their assets in volatile markets.

Bitcoin and ETH dropped 4.8% to $99,368 and 5.3% to $3,225 on November 14, but unpublished key U.S. economic indicators have left a statistical vacuum. The White House has acknowledged the possibility that October’s CPI (Consumer Price Index) data and employment data may not be released due to a faulty statistical system. Some government operations are still recovering following the longest-ever U.S. federal government shutdown. However, Shin Young-seo, a researcher from Xangle, stated that, even with the end of the shutdown, market uncertainty remains strong due to the lack of indicators. Shin believes it is necessary to closely monitor the U.S. Fed’s potential interest cut in December, along with employment and CPI data. Pham wants crypto investors to borrow despite market downturn Caroline Pham, acting chair of the CFTC, recently announced that the Commission is introducing leveraged spot trading. Investors will now be allowed to borrow to take positions larger than their current holdings. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is pushing to allow leveraged spot crypto transactions through regulated exchanges. Pham said the Commission is in consultation with several regulated exchanges, with plans to launch leveraged spot transaction products soon. However, Maarten Regterschot, a verified CryptoQuant analyst, stressed that CryptoQuant’s Bull Score is lighting up bear market territory with 8 out of 10 key on-chain metrics being bearish. Regterschot observed that stablecoin liquidity is falling, network activity is fading, and capital is exiting derivatives. He pointed out that the pattern was the same in the late 2021 and early 2022 cycle. Adam Chu, chief researcher at GreeksLive, also said, judging by market movements over the past three months, the market is definitely bearish. The bearish sentiment is reflected in falling investor confidence, as seen on the Myriad prediction market. Users’ chances of Bitcoin hitting $115,000 before $85,000 have dropped from 71% to 46% in four days. Thakral says crypto is in a corrective phase The CEO of BuyCoin, Shivam Thakral, stated that the crypto market is currently in a corrective phase within a broader cycle. He pointed out that a few key indicators will determine whether this correction turns into a full-blown bear market. Meanwhile, Pepperstone Research strategist Dilin Wu advised that traders remain cautious in the near term. However, Thikal believes it is now less about calling tops and bottoms and more about recognizing that crypto is transitioning from an overheated environment to a more measured one. Asset manager 10x Investments also emphasized that there is no longer the smell of a bear market; Bitcoin and most crypto-related assets are in a bear market. The firm explained that Bitcoin remaining below the long-term moving average is a sign of slowing momentum. 10X Research recently stated that the crypto market has entered a confirmed bear regime. The research firm noted that this aligns with multiple on-chain indicators, which confirm that Bitcoin is in a bear market . The company warned that Bitcoin could plummet even further if it falls below $93,000. Fundstrat’s Sean Farrell is also becoming more cautious on the crypto market. He told investors that the momentum, or lack thereof, for Bitcoin is a major issue right now. He believes the crypto market is in a scenario where there is a lack of catalysts. Farrell points out that the government shutdown lasted longer than investors expected, and a liquidity boost from renewed spending will take time to impact the economy. He thinks that a revisit to the low $90,000 range for Bitcoin will do the trick.

In this roundup, we explore how BTC, DOGE and OPTER are shaping the market — and why OPTER might be the best viral crypto to buy this year. Bitcoin is the digital gold Bitcoin continues to lead as the cornerstone of the crypto economy, with growing institutional adoption and expanding mainstream integration validating BTC as a safe entry point in digital assets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also opened the door for traditional investors, sending the BTC price to new heights. Further, BTC’s 21 million fixed supply and decentralized network make it a hedge against inflation and centralized monetary control. As the crypto bellwether, BTC remains a top choice for initial crypto exposure and a solid portfolio anchor. Dogecoin – a tested meme movement Dogecoin has evolved into a legitimate force. Its meme-fueled community, social virality, and celebrity endorsements have created an ecosystem that refuses to fade. Analysts at InvestingHaven highlight Dogecoin’s speed and negligible fees, making it ideal for micropayments and tipping. Its community loyalty drives consistent demand and speculative rallies, especially in bullish market phases. Although DOGE lacks a hard cap or deep utility, its brand recognition and popularity make it one of the most traded coins globally. For traders who play the sentiment waves, Dogecoin still packs explosive potential. Opter – The Decentralized Trading Revolution Is Here Perpetual trading has exploded into one of crypto’s biggest markets, moving tens of billions of dollars weekly. Traders want leverage and transparency — not middlemen. That’s where Opter comes in: a live, decentralized perpetuals platform offering up to 100× leverage on crypto and even real-world assets (RWAs). It combines on-chain trust with CEX-level performance, bridging speed and sovereignty in one system. Why Opter Beats Centralized Exchanges With Opter, your wallet is your key. There’s no KYC , no account freezes , and no custody risk . Trades settle on-chain for transparency, while the hybrid engine ensures low latency and fair execution. Setup takes seconds — just connect your wallet and trade. It’s freedom without friction. Proven Momentum: Live and Earning Unlike most presales, Opter isn’t just promising — it’s already delivering. The platform is live, generating hundreds of millions in trading volume and hundreds of thousands in fees . That means users aren’t buying into hype; they’re joining a functioning revenue machine that already rewards participation. Token Holder Rewards: Staking & Buybacks Holding OPTER means earning from platform success. Token holders gain massive staking rewards and benefit from regular buybacks that use trading revenue to reduce supply and support price. Every trade strengthens the ecosystem and funnels value back to investors — a sustainable token economy designed for growth. The World’s First Hybrid Presale Here’s the kicker — this is the world’s first hybrid presale . You can buy OPTER tokens directly or farm them through trading . For every $100,000 in trading volume , users earn 800 OPTER tokens , often more than they pay in trading fees. That’s real, utility-based yield, aligning traders, investors and platform success in one ecosystem. Opter isn’t just another DEX — it’s the top crypto to buy for investors seeking utility, traction, and early advantage in a market primed for exponential growth. The Smart Investor’s Playbook for 2025 BTC offers unmatched security. DOGE brings community and cultural firepower. But OPTER fuses innovation with income , transforming traders into stakeholders in a live, revenue-driven ecosystem. As decentralized perpetuals dominate the next bull phase, Opter is perfectly positioned to lead. Don’t just trade the market — own the platform shaping the future of DEXEs.

MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0827, resulting in a correction to $0.0557. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price triggered strong buying pressure after sellers failed to maintain demand. This resulted in a push toward $0.1237. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.15, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option.

BlackRock’s BUIDL Gains Momentum Fortune reported that the collaboration with Binance is expected to boost the popularity of BUIDL, a token launched by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, last year. Since its inception, BUIDL has witnessed significant growth, with its market capitalization exceeding $2.5 billion. Functioning akin to a stablecoin, BUIDL is commonly utilized as collateral for trading cryptocurrency derivatives, catering primarily to large institutional investors like private equity firms and hedge funds that make a minimum investment of $5 million into the BlackRock BUIDL fund. What sets BUIDL apart from traditional stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) is its unique feature of distributing the yield collected from its reserves to investors. Currently offering a yield of around 4%, BlackRock imposes a management fee ranging from 0.2% to 0.5% on the token. To bring BUIDL into existence, BlackRock collaborates with Securitize, a company specializing in issuing digital assets. Securitize’s CEO, Carlos Domingo, highlighted the growing popularity of tokenized assets due to their ability to facilitate quick and efficient trade settlements. Domingo emphasized the “antiquated nature” of current capital market ledgers, often built on outdated software, contrasting this with the “agile and near-instant settlement capabilities” of blockchain technology. Binance Responds To Demand Catherine Chen, Binance’s Head of VIP & Institutional, noted that the addition of BUIDL was driven partly by customer demand. She noted in the statement: Integrating BUIDL with our banking triparty partners and our crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu, meets their needs and enables our clients to confidently scale allocation while meeting compliance requirements. Concurrently, BUIDL is set to introduce a new share class on the BNB Chain network, enhancing investor reach and interoperability with other blockchain financial applications. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL marked BlackRock’s inaugural tokenized fund on a public blockchain, tokenized by Securitize, offering qualified investors access to U.S. dollar yields with flexible custody, daily dividend payouts, and seamless peer-to-peer transfers. This integration builds upon BUIDL’s presence across networks like Arbitrum (ARB), Aptos (APT), Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), Polygon (POL), and Solana (SOL), further enhancing its accessibility and utility within the blockchain ecosystem. When writing, Binance’s native token, BNB, trades at $931.60, recording losses exceeding 20% in the past 30 days. This positions Binance Coin 32% below all-time high levels of $1,369 reached back in October of this year.

Once a dominant force, SOL has slipped toward its August lows around $156, losing nearly a third of its value in the past month. This retreat reflects broader concerns about sustainability among established networks and growing investor migration to newer, more efficient DeFi protocols. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has begun to capture serious attention as investors assess what crypto to buy now for long-term growth. The contrast between Solana’s slowdown and Mutuum Finance’s accelerating presale has highlighted how quickly momentum can shift toward new crypto projects with working use cases. Solana Faces A Demand Breakdown Solana has been showing early signs of fatigue despite recent achievements. While its Staking ETF launch on the NYSE and Visa’s integration into its payment rails initially boosted sentiment, the token’s market dominance has been sliding fast. According to DeFiLlama data, Solana’s transaction fee market share has fallen from over 50% at the start of the year to just 9%. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid and BNB Chain have surged, fueled by derivatives and DeFi activity that now outpaces Solana’s throughput. Technically, SOL continues to test key support zones between $155 and $160. Momentum indicators remain weak, showing limited buying pressure as traders hesitate to re-enter during uncertain recovery patterns. A failure to hold this zone could expose the price to further declines toward $140 or below. As confidence thins, investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in have started rotating into projects that are still in early expansion phases but offer real utility and strong development timelines—precisely where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. Mutuum Finance Presale Nears Sell-Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been steadily advancing through its structured presale, now 90% through Phase 6. The current price sits at $0.035, a 250% rise from its initial Phase 1 rate of $0.01. Once this stage sells out, Phase 7 will open at $0.04, marking an immediate 20% increase before the final listing price of $0.06. That price path projects a 400% ROI for current participants after launch, a figure driving unprecedented FOMO among investors looking for the best cryptos to buy now. Since the presale began, over $18,700,000 has been raised, and the total number of holders has climbed to 17,950. This performance underscores why Mutuum Finance is increasingly mentioned among analysts tracking which crypto to buy today for long-term potential. Phase 6 is selling out fast, meaning the opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at this price point is narrowing quickly. Advanced DeFi Model Driving Interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates through a dual lending ecosystem designed to merge flexibility and yield efficiency. The Peer-to-Contract market pools user deposits of ETH and USDT, automatically generating returns as borrowers draw from the liquidity. Alongside it, a Peer-to-Peer system allows for direct, negotiated lending relationships for tokens that may not fit standard pool dynamics. This structure broadens participation and enhances stability across varying asset types, making it one of the best crypto to invest in for those prioritizing functional utility over hype. The project’s roadmap has gained further credibility following the announcement that its V1 protocol launch will go live on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This rollout includes a liquidity pool, mtToken issuance, a debt token, and an automated liquidator bot—critical components that bring the protocol close to full deployment. ETH and USDT will serve as the initial assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral management, showcasing a ready-to-use model that has appealed to serious DeFi investors. Community Rewards and Security Framework Investor engagement remains high, partly due to the project’s leaderboard system that ranks the top 50 holders. The leaderboard refreshes every 24 hours, granting the top contributor a $500 MUTM bonus if at least one transaction is completed during that period. This feature has added a dynamic competitive layer to the presale, strengthening loyalty and transaction activity. Additionally, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway , rewarding ten participants with $10,000 each in MUTM, signaling its focus on rewarding early community members. Combined with a CertiK audit score of 90/100 and a $50,000 bug bounty program for external testers, the platform has established a credible base of trust and transparency—traits that increasingly define the best cryptocurrency to invest today. Rising Investor Confidence While Solana’s technical recovery depends on defending its lower Bollinger Band support, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investors’ confidence through clear progress markers. Its transparent presale model, verifiable audits, and functioning development roadmap set it apart from the speculative cycles common among top cryptocurrencies. The project’s steady token appreciation and upcoming protocol launch have positioned it as a new crypto coin likely to dominate DeFi headlines in 2026. For investors evaluating what crypto to invest in before the next bull market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a structured entry into a tested DeFi mechanism.

Most larger-cap altcoins have failed to produce any impressive recovery attempts, aside from ZEC, which defies market logic. BTC Settles at $96K Bitcoin began November at around $111,000 but quickly lost that level and dipped below $100,000 last week. It tried to rebound in the following days, which culminated at the beginning of the business week (on November 11) after US President Trump hinted that the US government shutdown might end soon and promised tariff checks of at least $2,000 for some Americans. BTC topped $107,000 on Monday but was quickly stopped and driven down to under $104,000. Following a few days of sideways trading around that level, the bears took complete control of the market and drove it south to $98,000. This support held during the previous such correction, but gave in this time. Bitcoin plunged on Friday further below that line and bottomed at $94,000, which became its lowest price tag since May. The bulls finally reemerged after this substantial plunge and helped BTC recover a couple of grand. Nevertheless, its market capitalization has slumped to $1.910 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins sits at 57.3% on CG. BTCUSD.

Well, when we say all we mean all but ZEC. The privacy coin trades in its own universe and skyrocketed to over $700 today before it slipped back down to $640. Yet, it’s still up by 21% daily. LTC and XMR are in the green as well on a daily scale. The cumulative market capitalization of all cryptocurrency assets plummeted by over $200 billion from top to bottom in just a few days.

This is evidenced by its price dipping to $7.27 over the past four hours; it may decrease further in the coming hours if bears exert more pressure.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is increasing after a bullish trend observed over the current trading session. If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might increase to the $8 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $22.26 level by 2027 and above $45.69 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing positive market sentiment today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining, and so is UNI. As buyers gained ground around $6.95, positive sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $10.54, while the average price is expected to be around $8.79. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.27 and $7.8; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027, which is quite higher than its current value, making it a good option to buy UNI tokens. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high, which is not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. However, this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation before making any investment decision. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $45.69 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

The move represents one of the most significant institutional endorsements of Bitcoin exposure among elite university endowments, ranking Harvard as the 16th-largest holder of the BlackRock-managed fund . The latest 13F filing shows Harvard increased its stake from 1.9 million shares reported in June, while simultaneously growing its gold ETF holdings by 99% to 661,391 shares worth $235 million.

Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, stated in 2018 that Bitcoin would more likely trade at $100 than $100,000 within a decade. “ I think bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we’re headed out 10 years from now, ” Rogoff told CNBC, adding that removing money laundering and tax evasion would leave Bitcoin with “ very small ” transaction uses. He argued that government regulation would trigger price drops, though he acknowledged such frameworks would take time to develop globally. Rogoff recently reflected on his earlier assessment, acknowledging that he had misjudged Bitcoin’s role in the global underground economy and underestimated the regulatory conflicts of interest. Almost a decade ago I was the Harvard economist that said that bitcoin was more likely to be worth $100 than 100k. What did I miss? I was far too optimistic about the US coming to its senses about sensible cryptocurrency regulation; why would policymakers want to facilitate tax… — Kenneth S Rogoff (@krogoff) August 19, 2025 “ I was far too optimistic about the US coming to its senses about sensible cryptocurrency regulation, ” he wrote in his new book Our Dollar, Your Problem. He added that he “ did not anticipate a situation where regulators, and especially the regulator in chief, would be able to brazenly hold hundreds of millions (if not billions) of dollars in cryptocurrencies seemingly without consequence given the blatant conflict of interest. “ Balchunas referenced Rogoff’s earlier skepticism, noting it “ must feel so great ” for Bitcoin advocates to see Harvard’s institutional validation. The $443 million position represents approximately 0.75% of Harvard’s $57 billion endowment. However, Bitwise analyst Ryan Rasmussen predicts that this allocation will grow to 1% and eventually 5% as peer institutions follow suit. Harvard’s $443M bitcoin investment is ~0.75% of its endowment. Ivy League Endowments: – Harvard: $57B – Yale: $44B – Princeton: $36B – Penn: $25B – Columbia: $16B – Cornell: $12B – Dartmouth: $9B – Brown: $8B That 0.75% will become 1%. Then 5%. And the others will follow. — Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) November 14, 2025 University and State Pension Adoption Harvard joins a widening cohort of institutional investors increasing cryptocurrency exposure through regulated investment vehicles. The State of Michigan Retirement System tripled its Bitcoin ETF holdings to 300,000 shares valued at $11.4 million in the second quarter, while maintaining a $13.6 million Ethereum position through the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board holds over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, worth approximately $387.3 million, making it one of the largest state pension allocations to Bitcoin-linked products. Meanwhile, Emory University disclosed a $15 million stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust in 2024, becoming one of the first major US endowments to reveal crypto ETF exposure. The University of Austin is launching a $5M Bitcoin investment fund for its endowment. #Bitcoin #UniversityOfAustin https://t.co/irIOkR2Bay — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 10, 2025 Beyond traditional universities, the University of Austin launched a dedicated $5 million Bitcoin fund within its $200 million endowment in February, becoming the first US university endowment to establish a Bitcoin-focused investment. At that time, Pantera Capital reported an eight-fold increase in endowment and foundation clients since 2018, while Yale University invested in crypto venture funds during Bitcoin’s earlier price levels. Despite growing adoption, some institutional investors remain cautious. Cornell University professor Eswar Prasad warned that cryptocurrency remains “ purely speculative financial asset and one that doesn’t provide very much hedging relative to other risky assets ,” with volatility exceeding that of traditional risky assets. Brian Neale of the University of Nebraska Foundation told the Financial Times he does not consider cryptocurrency an “ institutionally investable ” asset class due to limited adoption among traditional allocators.

Court documents from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia revealed that U.S. nationals Audricus Phagnasay, Jason Salazar, and Alexander Paul Travis pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy. Authorities discovered that Phagnasay and Travis provided their U.S. identities to IT workers they knew were located outside the country. Their actions enabled the remote IT workers to apply for and obtain employment with U.S. companies fraudulently. The court also revealed that the trio hosted victim U.S. company-provided laptops at their residences, where they installed unauthorized remote access software. The software enabled the IT worker to create the false impression that they were working remotely from the defendants’ residences. The three defendants also assisted the IT workers in completing employer vetting procedures, with Travis and Salazar showing up for drug testing on behalf of the remote workers.

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida found that Prince’s company, Taggcar Inc., contracted to supply allegedly certified IT workers to U.S. companies from around June 2020 through August 2024. Prince allegedly hosted U.S. company-provided laptops, knowing the IT workers were using false and stolen identities to obtain employment. The court charged Prince, U.S. national Emanuel Ashtor, and Mexican national Pedro Ernesto Alonso de los Reyes in January 2025 for their alleged participation in the scheme. The IT workers’ scheme earned more than $943,069 in salary payments from U.S. companies. De los Reyes is awaiting extradition from the Netherlands, while Ashtor is pending trial.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has collapsed to 10, marking “Extreme Fear” and matching levels last seen in early March. That shift alone is enough to make even long-term traders pause, especially as market cap has dropped to $1.91tn and momentum indicators continue to soften. Historically, extreme fear has tended to act as a contrarian signal, often showing up near key accumulation zones, but this time the technical structure isn’t offering a clear verdict. Bitcoin has slipped below its long-term ascending trendline for the first time since spring, signaling a break in the rhythm that carried the market through most of 2024 and 2025. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Picture at a Crossroads Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish even if BTC is stabilising after a sharp decline that dragged the market into the $94,500–$92,000 support region, an area that served as a pivot throughout April and May. Thursday’s long lower wick suggests buyers stepped in, but the follow-through has been timid. The 20-EMA has rolled over, acting as dynamic resistance, while the RSI sits near 33, hovering above oversold territory without forming a clear bullish divergence. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick behaviour reinforces the uncertainty. This week’s pattern resembles a smaller version of a three black crows sequence, followed by a single rejection candle, not quite enough to signal capitulation, but enough to slow the decline. Price is now squeezed between the broken trendline above and a mid-range floor below, a zone where markets usually make quick decisions. Key Levels to Watch A shift in momentum requires evidence. Traders are watching: $99,000 – First sign buyers are regaining control $103,700 – The broken trendline; reclaiming it would reset momentum $92,000 – Breakdown level that exposes deeper support $83,000 – Large liquidity pocket and next major downside target A daily close above $99,000 would confirm a short-term reversal, especially if accompanied by a bullish engulfing candle and an RSI above 40. Is This an Accumulation Bottom? Extreme fear can create opportunity, but it can also precede another wave of selling. With Bitcoin stuck between conflicting signals – oversold momentum vs. broken structure, traders are approaching this zone cautiously. If buyers defend $92,000, this could evolve into a classic accumulation pocket. If not, the market may revisit deeper supports before stability returns.

The directive builds on previous commitments to transform the country’s surplus nuclear power capacity into a competitive advantage for digital asset production. At the same time, broader geopolitical trends accelerate de-dollarization across multiple continents. According to a local report , Lukashenko dismissed concerns about market volatility during the November 14 meeting in Minsk, framing crypto as an inevitable component of international efforts to establish monetary alternatives. “ Our entire world is now grappling with a global problem, namely moving away from dependence on a single currency, the dollar, ” he told officials assembled to discuss electricity consumption strategies and nuclear capacity development. “ This process will intensify. Cryptocurrency is probably one of the options. “ Source: The Economist Belarus Builds Mining Infrastructure on Nuclear Foundation The president’s endorsement follows months of groundwork aimed at positioning Belarus as an attractive destination for international mining operations. Lukashenko in March ordered Energy Minister Alexei Kushnarenko to utilize the nation’s electricity surplus for crypto production, explicitly referencing developments in Washington, where President Donald Trump announced plans for a national Bitcoin reserve. “ We can see the direction the world is heading in, especially the largest economy in the world, ” Lukashenko stated while suggesting Belarus might eventually establish its own national crypto reserve rather than simply attracting foreign investors. Belarus has anchored its mining ambitions on the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant, which achieved full operational capacity of 2400 megawatts following the November 2023 activation of its second unit. Source: Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant The infrastructure upgrade resolved previous power shortage issues that had hindered earlier attempts to court mining firms to Minsk’s Hi-Tech Park. Russian and Chinese investors have reportedly expressed interest in Belarus-based projects, drawn by incentivized electricity tariffs now possible through the expanded nuclear output. Beyond mining, Belarus is preparing to launch its Central Bank Digital Currency by late 2026. The National Bank plans to onboard businesses before extending access to government agencies and citizens in 2027. The digital ruble initiative closely coordinates with Russia’s parallel CBDC development, as both nations face sanctions pressure and seek alternative settlement mechanisms. However, Russia has delayed its own launch to mid-2026 due to technical challenges. Global De-Dollarization Trends Accelerate Bitcoin Adoption Lukashenko’s strategic pivot coincides with documented shifts in international trade settlement practices that extend far beyond Eastern Europe. Investment firm VanEck reported in April that China and Russia have begun settling some energy transactions using Bitcoin and other digital assets, while Bolivia announced plans to import electricity using cryptocurrencies. These developments gained momentum during the time when the Trump administration escalated trade tensions by announcing a 125% tariff on Chinese imports, which triggered immediate market responses, with Bitcoin jumping 5.6% to $81,636 within an hour of the announcement. At that time, China retaliated by hiking tariffs on U.S. goods from 34% to 84% on April 9. However, a diplomatic breakthrough on May 12 led to a tariff détente, with the U.S. reducing duties to 30% and China lowering impositions to 10%. The U.S. Dollar Index dropped over 9% year-to-date to 99, amplifying what VanEck describes as Bitcoin’s emerging role as a hedge against fiat debasement and geopolitical risk. Asia’s billionaires have also responded decisively to these macroeconomic shifts, according to UBS executive Amy Lo, who revealed at a Bloomberg event in Hong Kong that the region’s wealthiest investors are reallocating assets from U.S. dollars into Bitcoin, gold, and Chinese markets. Asia’s affluent investors now hold more than 15% of their wealth in cryptocurrencies and gold, a marked departure from traditional dollar-denominated portfolios. According to the Cryptonews report , 76% of Asia’s family offices and high-net-worth investors hold digital assets, up from 58% in 2022, with many increasing crypto allocations from less than 5% to over 10% of total holdings. Singapore leads this transformation, with 57% of wealthy investors planning to expand their cryptocurrency positions over the next two years. The region’s affluent class is projected to see its wealth grow from $2.7 trillion in 2021 to $3.5 trillion by 2026.

Tech writer Ed Zitron got his hands on internal papers that show how much money changed hands between the artificial intelligence company and its biggest backer as reported by Tech Crunch. The records revea l Mi crosoft pulled in $493.8 million from OpenAI in 2024 through their revenue-sharing agreement. That figure climbed to $865.8 million during the first nine months of 2025, Zitron wrote this week. Two-way money flow between tech giants The arrangement between the two companies works both ways. OpenAI hands over 20% of what it makes to Microsoft, part of the terms when the software company put more than $13 billion into the startup. Neither side has said publicly whether that percentage is accurate. But the money doesn’t just flow in one direction. A person with direct knowledge of the deal told that Microsoft also gives OpenAI about 20% of what comes in from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service. Bing’s search engine runs on OpenAI technology, while Azure OpenAI Service lets other companies and programmers pay to use OpenAI’s tools through the cloud. The numbers don’t tell the whole story The payments Zitron saw represent what Microsoft keeps after subtracting what it owes OpenAI from Bing and Azure. That means the leaked numbers show the net amount, not the total before those deductions. Microsoft doesn’t list Bing or Azure OpenAI earnings separately in its public financial reports, making it hard to figure out the full picture. Still, the leaked information offers a window into a company that private investors are watching closely. The papers show not just how much money OpenAI brings in, but also how much it spends to keep running. Using the 20% revenue-sharing number, simple math suggests OpenAI made at least $2.5 billion in 2024. For the first three quarters of 2025, that figure was at least $4.33 billion, though the real numbers are probably higher. OpenAI chief Sam Altman recently said the company’s revenue is “well more” than $13 billion yearly. He added that by year’s end, the annualized revenue run rate will top $20 billion and could reach $100 billion by 2027. Computing costs climb fast The spending side tells a different story. That number jumped to roughly $8.65 billion for the first nine months of 2025. Inference means the computer power needed to run trained AI systems when they respond to users. Microsoft Azure has been OpenAI’s main source for computing resources, though the company has also signed deals with CoreWeave, Oracle, and more recently with AWS and Google Cloud. A source close to the situation explained that OpenAI pays for training mostly through credits Microsoft gave as part of its investment, not actual cash. Training means the computing work to build a model from scratch. But inference costs come mostly out of pocket as real money. When you put these numbers together, they suggest OpenAI might be spending more on inference alone than it makes from selling its services. That possibility is feeding ongoing debates about whether the artificial intelligence industry is overvalued . If OpenAI, the biggest name in AI models, is still losing money running its technology, people are asking what that means for all the other companies getting massive investments at sky-high valuations .

While many traders expect a correction to $92,000, one analyst has rejected the idea of a price breakdown, insisting that Bitcoin still has unfinished upside potential before any significant retracement Why The Bitcoin Price Won’t Decline To $92,000 Crypto analyst @YazanXBT has become one of the loudest voices negating the increasingly popular $92,000 crash target for Bitcoin. The analyst took to X social media on November 13 to inform the crypto community that, rather than a drop to $92,000, BTC is gearing up for a new all-time high of $145,000. Related Reading: Here’s When The Next Bitcoin Parabolic Phase To $297,092 Will Begin The analyst backed up his bullish projection by pointing to a similar moment during BTC’s previous bear market bottom. He stated that at the time, many people were certain that the Bitcoin price would fall to $12,000 or even $10,000. But instead, the cryptocurrency bottomed at $15,800 before staging one of its strongest price recoveries ever. Essentially, @YazanXBT’s message implies that mass bearish consensus is often a signal that the opposite outcome is more likely. In response to his X post, a crypto community member argued that Bitcoin still has an unfilled Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap at $92,000. They noted that, based on historical behavior, BTC tends to fill CME gaps before making new highs, implying that a crash is imminent. @YazanXBT dismissed the bearish outlook, reiterating that Bitcoin is much more likely to rally to $145,000 before any pullback to fill the $92,000 CME gap. Notably, a surge to $145,000 would require Bitcoin to break out of its current bearish pressures and climb roughly 50% from where it stands. After seeing weeks of capitulation and massive price declines, BTC is now trading slightly above $96,000, showing no apparent signs of a rebound. Analyst Claims BTC Crash Looks Like Manipulation Crypto market expert @CottonXBT shared a detailed price chart, which highlighted Bitcoin’s drop below $97,000 this week. The chart layout, featuring sharp sell-offs and rapid wicks, has led him to call the recent price dip a possible sign of manipulation rather than a genuine trend reversal. The analyst stressed that this type of price action often occurs when large players attempt to shake out retail investors before driving the market higher again. He urges investors to ignore the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) and buy more BTC.

After the explosive debut of Canary Capital’s XRPC ETF, which pulled in $58 million on day one, industry watchers are now speculating about what a trillion-dollar giant could unleash if it enters the arena. Winkle argues that Franklin Templeton’s expanding digital-asset strategy and recent on-chain activity indicate strengthening interest in blockchain-based products. The firm has already built a reputation for being early in tokenized assets and blockchain-native investment vehicles. An XRP ETF, he suggests, would be a natural next step, especially as institutional appetite for diversified crypto exposure grows. If Canary Capital, a relatively small player, drew $58 million on day one, imagine the scale when a trillion-dollar giant like Franklin Templeton enters the XRP ETF arena. With deep liquidity, global distribution power, and unmatched investor trust, institutions of this size don’t just attract inflows, they ignite marketwide capital migration. Ripple Bull Winkle argues XRP is primed for institutional products thanks to its U.S. regulatory clarity, proven utility in cross-border settlement, and growing presence in global payment rails. Notably, Franklin Templeton’s ETF would further legitimize XRP as an institutional-grade asset, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs that rapidly accelerated mainstream adoption. Furthermore, Winkle notes that beyond legitimizing the asset class, the psychological shockwave of a Franklin Templeton XRP ETF could be just as powerful. Markets tend to reprice rapidly when heavyweight institutions make bold moves, and a trillion-dollar entrant would signal to Wall Street giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco that XRP products are not only viable, but increasingly competitive. What next? Well, an approved Franklin Templeton ETF by November 18 could ignite derivatives markets, drive new structured products, and accelerate XRP’s integration into wealth-management portfolios. In short, it wouldn’t just launch a fund, it would open the door to institutional adoption at scale. Conclusion In a momentum-driven market, Franklin Templeton’s potential entry into the XRP ETF space could be a pivotal catalyst for institutional crypto adoption. Canary’s $58 million debut was a spark, but a trillion-dollar asset manager could ignite a far larger wave of capital rotation. If Franklin Templeton moves forward, it wouldn’t just add another ETF to the market; it could globally validate XRP, unlock unprecedented institutional inflows, and accelerate its shift from speculative asset to mainstream financial instrument.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-15 11:01:32

TSMC, the Taiwan-based factory that manufactures nearly every high-performance AI processor, faces mounting pressure from its biggest clients. Nvidia’s chief, Jensen Huang, recently disclosed his firm needs to fulfill orders worth $500 billion over the coming two years. OpenAI has separately arranged multi-year agreements with Advanced Micro Devices for roughly 3 million to 6 million chips generating six gigawatts of power, plus another deal with Broadcom for ten gigawatts more. This rush for AI-powered processors has sparked worries about whether enough can be made. The Taiwanese manufacturer handles production for almost all premium AI chips currently available. Huang traveled to Taiwan personally, pushing the company to increase Nvidia chip output by 100%. Elon Musk has considered whether Tesla might construct its own massive semiconductor plant to support the carmaker’s AI and robotics projects. Sam Altman, who leads OpenAI, has publicly asked TSMC to “just build more capacity.” TSMC’s spending increases but not fast enough The manufacturer is responding, though not at the pace customers want. This year’s planned spending on new equipment and facilities stands at approximately $41 billion, with over two-thirds directed toward the sophisticated chips AI companies need. That represents growth from $30 billion spent last year. Industry analysts predict spending will climb to $52 billion by 2027 as reported by Economic Times. However, when measured against company income, TSMC’s infrastructure investments have actually decreased and are projected to keep falling in coming years, despite louder complaints from customers. Chip designers have limited options beyond TSMC. Intel, once a manufacturing leader, has fallen behind in producing cutting-edge processors. Samsung remains the only other serious choice, but faces its own troubles. Tesla signed a $16.5 billion agreement with the South Korean electronics company last July to start making AI chips in Texas beginning next year, though the venture reportedly lags behind schedule. Taiwan’s manufacturing powerhouse now finds itself buried in orders. Warning signs have emerged. Last month, C.C. Wei, the company’s top executive, acknowledged that capacity for AI-related products “is very tight” and the firm is working “very hard” to address the shortfall. Meanwhile, orders continue growing. Investment bank Jefferies forecasts Nvidia will receive 6.3 million AI chips next year, representing a 23% jump from this year’s volume. Broadcom, which creates chips for cloud computing companies like Google and Meta, is expected to require 5.4 million units, a 29% increase. JPMorgan Chase analysts believe TSMC’s two most advanced chip varieties will operate at maximum capacity for years ahead. Boosting production, though, takes significant money and time. A state-of-the-art manufacturing plant costs around $20 billion and requires three to four years to finish. Construction in America increases expenses further. TSMC has committed to building six new advanced factories in the United States, with combined costs near $165 billion. America’s troubled construction sector means these plants cost substantially more than comparable facilities in Taiwan, while also taking longer to complete. Customers want more but won’t pay upfront Expanding capacity also carries risks for TSMC, which explains its careful approach. The semiconductor business has historically experienced painful cycles where tight supply gives way to excess capacity. Manufacturers frequently expand aggressively during good times, only to end up with unused factories when orders eventually drop. Daniel Wu from hedge fund Bristlemoon Capital points out that TSMC increased investment during the pandemic to address shortages of simpler chips. Today, its capacity for making those processors sits underutilized. The company likely wants to avoid repeating that error. It may also worry that the AI chip market could flip into oversupply if Intel and Samsung finally fix their production issues. Companies demanding more capacity don’t pay anything until TSMC actually builds it. But Wu notes that if TSMC commits $80 billion to $100 billion over two years only to see the AI boom fade, it would face years of idle factories. Its caution may frustrate customers. But they shouldn’t expect TSMC to change course.

The Role of Blockchain Technology in Solana’s Growth Solana’s underlying blockchain technology represents a significant advancement in distributed systems. The network’s ability to scale while maintaining decentralization addresses one of the most pressing challenges in the crypto space. As more enterprises recognize the value of blockchain technology, platforms like Solana stand to benefit substantially from increased adoption and utilization. Potential Challenges for SOL Price Targets While the outlook appears promising, investors should consider potential obstacles that could impact Solana price prediction accuracy. Regulatory developments, network stability concerns, and competition from other layer-1 solutions represent significant factors that could affect SOL’s trajectory toward $500. The volatile nature of the crypto market requires careful risk management strategies. Expert Insights and Market Sentiment Industry experts provide varied perspectives on Solana’s future price movement. Some analysts point to the growing ecosystem of decentralized applications and non-fungible token projects built on Solana as strong indicators of long-term value. Others emphasize the importance of macroeconomic factors and institutional investment flows in determining SOL cryptocurrency performance. Frequently Asked Questions What makes Solana different from other cryptocurrencies? Solana’s unique proof-of-history consensus enables faster transaction processing compared to traditional blockchain networks. The platform was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and has received backing from major investors including Andreessen Horowitz and FTX before its collapse. How does Solana’s technology compare to Ethereum? While Ethereum uses proof-of-work transitioning to proof-of-stake, Solana combines proof-of-stake with proof-of-history to achieve higher throughput. Both networks support smart contracts and decentralized applications, but with different technical approaches. What companies are building on Solana? Several prominent projects have chosen Solana for their blockchain infrastructure, including Audius for music streaming, Metaplex for NFTs, and Serum for decentralized trading. Conclusion: The Path to $500 and Beyond The journey toward $500 represents a significant milestone for Solana, but not an impossible one. With continued development, growing adoption, and favorable market conditions, this Solana price prediction could materialize within the projected timeframe. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency investments with careful research and risk assessment, recognizing both the tremendous opportunities and inherent volatility in this dynamic market.

But Here’s the Real Story,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-launch-just-broke-records-but-heres-the-real-story/,"The XRP market just experienced an event that many analysts did not fully anticipate. A new ETF entered the market with modest expectations yet produced numbers that forced the industry to reassess its assumptions. The debut sparked conversations about liquidity, institutional readiness, and the broader evolution of altcoin-based investment products. A Record-Setting Debut The launch gained traction after Apex Crypto Insights highlighted the surprising performance of Canary Capital’s XRPC ETF. The report noted that the fund posted about $58 million in trading volume on Day One. This figure slightly surpassed the $57 million recorded by Bitwise’s Solana ETF during its first trading day. The outcome shocked many observers because Canary manages only about $100 million in assets. MUST READ! The XRP ETF Launch Just Broke Records – But the REAL Story? It's 25-50x Undervalued! Canary's tiny XRP ETF (just ~$100M of assets under management) beat Bitwise's Solana ETF debut ($57M volume) with $58M on Day 1 – despite Bitwise being 50x larger ($5B assets… — Apex Crypto Insights (NFA) (@APEXCONSULTNFA) November 15, 2025 Understanding the Scale Gap Canary’s result stands out because of the huge difference in issuer size. Bitwise had about $5 billion in assets under management when its Solana ETF launched. Yet the much smaller XRPC fund matched its debut performance almost exactly. This comparison raises a major question about the strength of latent XRP demand. The Institutional Wave Behind the Scenes A more important story is now unfolding. Several heavyweight asset managers have filed or prepared spot XRP ETF proposals. These include Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale. Their combined assets under management exceed $1.6 trillion. BlackRock’s massive $13 trillion only adds more weight to this trend. These figures reveal a structural shift that could reshape ETF flows linked to XRP. Why Issuer Strength Matters Large issuers influence liquidity in powerful ways. Their marketing reach can be global. Their client networks include pensions, endowments, insurance firms, and major funds. If they decide to allocate even a small percentage of their capital into XRP ETFs, demand could multiply far beyond current levels. The XRPC launch now looks more like a signal than an isolated event. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Mechanics and Real Demand ETF flows do more than generate volume. Creation and redemption processes require issuers to obtain actual XRP. This mechanism can reduce the quantity of XRP available on exchanges. A shrinking exchange supply can intensify price sensitivity when new demand enters the market. These mechanics matter because several analysts reported declining XRP exchange balances during recent ETF activity. What Comes Next The next phase will depend on regulatory decisions, issuer readiness, and the early behavior of institutional clients. Watch for updates in S-1 filings, especially the details about custody and asset sourcing. These technical elements shape the speed and size of ETF inflows. They also determine how much direct XRP buying will occur in the open market. A Possible Turning Point Apex Crypto Insights described the launch as a preview of a larger transformation. The numbers support that view. A small issuer broke records. The largest issuers in global finance now stand ready with their own proposals. If they enter the market, the result could be one of the largest shifts in altcoin investment history. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The Bitcoin price has dropped toward the $94,000–$96,000 zone, fear is back on the charts and many traders feel trapped at the top. At the same time, a new wave of capital is quietly hunting for the best crypto to buy now, not just the loudest meme or the fastest pump. That is where payment-focused projects like Remittix (RTX) are starting to appear beside Bitcoin in serious conversations. Bitcoin price fear and why money is rotating Source: @follis_ on X Right now, the Bitcoin price sits near $95,932 after sliding from a record high of around $126,000. Prediction markets have noticed the mood shift. On Myriad, the odds that the Bitcoin price hits $115,000 before $85,000 have fallen from 71% to 46% in only a few days. That drop in confidence tells you how nervous the market is. Technically, Bitcoin is flashing warning signs. The sustained move from $126,000 to below $96,000 has pushed the chart toward a possible death cross, where a short-term moving average drops under a long-term one. Analysts using the Wyckoff pattern say the Bitcoin price could test $86,000 next if it fails to hold the $94,000 area. In simple words, if this level breaks, more forced selling could follow. That is why more people are asking a direct question: in this kind of market, what is the best crypto to buy now? Best crypto to buy now: why Remittix stands out While the market debates the Bitcoin price, Remittix has been building. The project has raised over $28.1 million from global investors and sold more than 685 million RTX tokens at $0.1166 each. The project also passed a full audit from CertiK and is ranked at the top of its pre-launch leaderboard. Two centralized exchange listings, BitMart and LBank, are confirmed, with another major CEX reveal on the way. There is also a live referral program that pays 15% in USDT on every referred purchase, claimable daily through the dashboard and a $250,000 community giveaway running as the project approaches the $30 million milestone and its so-called mega announcement. Here is why many early investors see RTX as the best crypto to buy now: Remittix focuses on cross-border payments and remittances, a market worth more than $1 trillion a year. The wallet beta already supports fast crypto to bank transfers in more than 30 countries. Multi-currency support is planned for over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies. Web App nearing rollout to create a full PayFi ecosystem. Wallet tests show sub-10-second transaction times for cross-border transfers. Referral rewards offering 15% USDT payouts daily through the dashboard. Bitcoin price dip as a chance to rebuild a portfolio When the Bitcoin price is sliding and fear dominates the headlines, it is easy to freeze. However, history shows that these moments often create space to rethink a portfolio. Right now, utility projects are catching that interest. Among them, the Remittix DeFi project stands out because it combines real-world payments, active product testing, strong audits and a token that still trades below $1.

Analysts are now split on whether the largest cryptocurrency has bottomed at $94,000 after dumping by $13,000 in just three days. Final Shakeout Ahead? BTC is notorious for its volatility, especially in the TradFi ecosystem, where double-digit price moves in either direction are almost never seen. Bitcoin has definitely matured lately compared to its previous massive crashes of 20-30% in a day. However, it still endures some vivid fluctuations, which seem more violent now, given the higher price. Percentage-wise, though, even yesterday’s big crash pales in comparison to countless others in the past. Some analysts called the Friday crash a breeze, while others believe the real bottom is not in, and the asset could drop to as low as $74,000. Merlijn The Trader also noted that there could be another leg down in BTC’s cards, due to the existence of a CME gap at around $92,000. Such gaps are often filled, even weeks or months later, and Merlijn suggested that the final shakeout might be around the corner. BITCOIN LOVES TO FILL THE GAPS. $97K: DONE. $92K: NEXT?

In a separate post, Merlijn noted that Phase E was confirmed as the Wyckoff blueprint “played out to perfection.” He doubled down that this is the final zone of shakeouts and added: “This is where smart money quietly reloads… While retail screams for lower prices. The cycle always repeats. The question is are you ready this time?” Additionally, Merlijn outlined the declining BTC reserves on exchanges, which just hit a new all-time low. He commented that such supply drops are rarely combined with price pullbacks, and described it as the “perfect storm is brewing.” BULLISH SIGNAL: BITCOIN EXCHANGE RESERVES JUST HIT THE LOWEST LEVEL IN HISTORY.

According to reports, the Russian Embassy in Thailand is seeking access to a Russian citizen at the request of the United States over suspected cybercrimes. “At the moment, we are clarifying the circumstances of this case and working with the Thai side to arrange consular access,” embassy representative Ilya Ilyin told Russia’s state news agency TASS. The Thai police confirmed to TASS that the Russian national was arrested in collaboration with United States authorities and later transferred to Bangkok. According to local media reports, the suspect is being held pending when he will be cleared for extradition to the United States. Russian hacker faces extradition to the US Earlier this week, several local outlets reported that the police had detained a famous hacker who had been hiding out in Thailand after launching cyberattacks on government agencies in Europe and the United States. The 35-year-old was arrested following a tip-off from the US Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI alerted Thailand’s Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau (CCIB) to the suspect’s presence in the country. In the statement given by Police Lieutenant General Surapol Prembutr, Commissioner of the CCIB, the criminal has previously infiltrated high-security systems and launched several cyberattacks on multiple state institutions. The police lieutenant claimed that the criminal had earned notoriety among global law enforcement agencies because of his activities. The Russian was said to have entered Thailand on October 30, 2025. The suspect entered the country through the Phuket International Airport and was traced to a hotel in the Thalang District. In response to the tip-off, Thai police, in a coordinated effort with the Immigration Bureau, Tourist Police Division, Forensic Police Office, the Office of the Attorney General, and local units, carried out their investigations and prepared for the arrest. A warrant was obtained under Thailand’s Extradition Act of 2008, claiming that the foreign national was wanted. The operation was carried out by the joint task force , including immigration officers and local police. They raided the hotel room and apprehended the individual. Several electronic devices were confiscated for forensic analysis. FBI agents were also present during the duration of the operation as observers, highlighting the international significance of the case. The suspect was transferred into custody while the formal extradition process started. Russian media speculates on the identity of the suspect Thai police said that several laptops, mobile phones, and digital wallets were seized in the raid. Meanwhile, the identity of the suspect and the specific crimes he committed remain unknown. However, Russian outlet Vot Tak has reported that among the military hackers wanted by the FBI, only Aleksey Lukashev, a GRU officer accused of taking part in the 2016 US election interference, matches the age provided by the police. Lukashev is listed as a senior lieutenant in Russia’s military intelligence agency. He was among 12 GRU agents indicted in the United States for hacking political organizations and leaking stolen data as part of the group tracked as APT28, Fancy Bear, and BlueDelta. However, it remains unclear if Lukashev is the same individual who has now been detained by Thai officials. The arrest comes after a series of detentions of Russian nationals in Thailand accused of cybercriminal offenses. In February, the Thai police announced the arrest of four Russians wanted in Switzerland and the United States in connection with several crimes. The Russians were accused of deploying ransomware attacks against more than 17 companies in Switzerland and demanding multimillion-dollar payments.

Their top-10 position is again being openly discussed on most crypto forums, especially with new entrants starting to gain measurable attention. One name that frequently appears in such discussions is Remittix , now trading at $0.1166 per token, as a rising PayFi player with decent private funding and active product development. As traders seek weakness and/or resilience in these established market leaders, speculation is growing about who will maintain their position and who may be pushed lower. Dogecoin and Cardano market outlook The Dogecoin Price Prediction outlook for this week reflects a sharp increase in trading activity. Dogecoin trades at $0.1640, down 4.41%, with a market cap of $24.93 billion. Trading volume is up 78.46% to $3.59 billion, indicating that large holders are actively adjusting their positions. Cardano is also under pressure at $0.5129, down 2.54%, with volume increasing 51.88% to $1.3 billion. Activity spikes during pullbacks often reflect liquidity rotating into newer opportunities or defensive positioning by short-term traders. These moves highlight the broader shift toward utility-focused projects and upcoming crypto projects that demonstrate real payment use cases. The concern many analysts raise is whether these leading assets can hold their positions as high-growth alternatives appear. In ongoing discussions about the top crypto to buy now, newer tokens with real-world applications are frequently mentioned alongside legacy names, drawing extra attention to their stability. Why a new XRP rival is gaining attention While Dogecoin and Cardano continue to demonstrate strong communities, traders are watching Remittix due to its straightforward PayFi utility and rapid community expansion. Remittix has raised over $28.1 million in private funding, a figure that underscores the significant demand for its global payments solution. Its design supports fast crypto-to-bank transfers and aims to compete directly with established payment-focused networks. A major driver of its momentum is the ecosystem growth surrounding the upcoming Remittix Wallet, which is now opening beta slots to more iOS testers. The platform also benefits from increased visibility following confirmation of its future listings on BitMart and LBank, with both announcements published by the exchanges. These plans position it well ahead of launch. Key strengths of Remittix Ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens Wallet beta testing is underway with active community feedback Global payment utility built around fast crypto-to-fiat transfers Supported by $250,000 Remittix Giveaway incentives Referral program offering 15% USDT rewards for network growth A shift in market priorities As traders reassess the long-term utility of their investments, Remittix is establishing itself as a credible alternative to older assets. Priced at $0.1166 per token, with more than 685 million tokens sold, the project is attracting steady attention from early-stage crypto investment groups and researchers of cross-chain DeFi projects. Features like low gas fees and real-world payment reach set it apart from many high-growth crypto narratives. The turning point ahead Dogecoin and Cardano will need strong market support to maintain their top-10 status, but the rise of Remittix adds new competition at a time when traders are prioritising function over hype. With private funding momentum and expanding product readiness, its position as a rising XRP rival is becoming harder to ignore.

The decentralized perpetuals exchange just made a groundbreaking move that could set new standards for transparency in the crypto space. Their decision to store unlocked tokens in public addresses marks a significant shift in how projects handle their Aster tokenomics , addressing concerns that have plagued investors since the Token Generation Event. What Exactly Happened with Aster Tokenomics? Aster recently faced community backlash over confusion surrounding their token unlock schedule. The project had to issue an apology and clarification about their revised Aster tokenomics approach. Since their TGE, monthly unlocked tokens were held in a lockup address but weren’t properly reflected in circulating supply calculations. This created uncertainty among investors and community members who needed clear visibility into token distribution. The confusion stemmed from how Aster handled unlocks for: Community allocations Ecosystem development funds Monthly token releases How Will Public Address Storage Transform Aster Tokenomics? Aster’s new approach represents a massive leap forward for transparency. By storing unlocked tokens in separate public addresses, everyone can track token movements in real-time. This revolutionary change to their Aster tokenomics strategy means no more guessing games about circulating supply or hidden token movements. The project committed to three key transparency measures: Public address monitoring for all unlocked tokens Complete disclosure of fund usage patterns Real-time tracking of circulating supply changes Why Does Transparent Aster Tokenomics Matter for Investors? Transparent Aster tokenomics isn’t just about good governance—it’s about building lasting trust in decentralized finance. When investors can verify token movements themselves, it eliminates the fear of unexpected dilution or hidden sell pressure. This approach could become the gold standard for how crypto projects manage their token economies. The previous tokenomics model created several challenges: Uncertainty about true circulating supply Difficulty tracking community allocation releases Confusion about ecosystem fund deployment timelines What Can We Learn from Aster’s Tokenomics Evolution? Aster’s journey demonstrates how crypto projects must adapt to community needs. Their willingness to revise Aster tokenomics and implement transparent practices shows strong leadership in the DeFi space. Other projects should take note—transparency isn’t just optional anymore; it’s essential for long-term success. The key improvements in their revised approach include: Clear separation between locked and unlocked tokens Public verifiability of all token movements Regular disclosure of fund utilization Postponed unlock schedule for better market alignment Frequently Asked Questions What caused the initial Aster tokenomics confusion? The confusion arose because monthly unlocked tokens were held in lockup addresses but weren’t properly reflected in circulating supply calculations, creating uncertainty about true token availability. How will public address storage improve transparency? Public addresses allow anyone to track token movements in real-time, providing complete visibility into unlocked token distribution and usage. What changes were made to the token unlock schedule? Aster postponed their token unlock schedule and revised their tokenomics to better align with market conditions and community expectations. Will this affect ASTER’s circulating supply? Yes, the new approach provides accurate circulating supply data by clearly separating locked and unlocked tokens in public view. How often will Aster disclose fund usage? While specific frequency isn’t detailed, Aster committed to transparently disclosing all fund usage through their public address system. Can other projects learn from Aster’s approach? Absolutely. Aster’s transparent tokenomics model sets a new standard for accountability in the cryptocurrency space that other projects should emulate. Join the Transparency Movement Aster’s bold move toward transparent tokenomics represents a significant step forward for the entire cryptocurrency industry. By embracing public verification and clear communication, they’re building the trust necessary for mainstream adoption.

Ripple (XRP) has been facing some challenges; at the moment, its price is hovering at $2.46, and countless whale transactions over $1 billion each are contributing to the confusion surrounding Ripple’s price in the short-term. Ripple is more likely to experience price consolidation in the near future, while other investors are looking at a new DeFi protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With its presale, investors can expect stunning returns of 12,000%. Within the current environment and with the price consolidation expected from XRP, along with the time-sensitive aspect of Mutuum Finance’s presale, it is likely to become the best crypto to buy for growth-oriented investors. XRP’s Clouded Path Ripple is experiencing significant turbulence in the market. The movement of hundreds of millions of tokens Ripple is sending to undeclared wallets is often followed by market selling pressure. This sends the holders into a selling frenzy. While some technical analysts argue that there is the potential for a long-term rally to $6.00, they also argue that it would require a pullback to $1.90 first, which makes this a risky waiting game for investors. Most capital is being relocated to assets that have more immediate and transparent bullish catalysts and away from Ripple. Here the entry is clearly defined and the expected growth is not negatively impacted by the complex sell-offs and support tests that Ripple sell holders face. Mutuum Finance Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale represents a rapid ground floor, investment opportunity, that is closing quickly. Phase 6 is set at a price of $0.035 and is over 90% filled, presenting the last call. This is the last opportunity to acquire the tokens before the price is increased by 20% in Phase 7. The presale is validated by the massive holders that the project has accumulated and the impressive amount of resources securing the project. The presale push is obvious, not speculative, and indicates the probable price rise when the project launches on exchanges. The mathematics of purchasing this token is a solid no-brainer, making it one of the best crypto to buy in the market. Because of the framework that Mutuum Finance has in place, any trust and security vulnerabilities in the digital ecosystem are handled head-on. This has been made possible by the project’s successful completion of the audit. Mutuum Finance engages with CertiK, one of the top blockchain security companies, scoring remarkably high on the token audit, which indicates that the project’s code is well-structured and solid. To add on to this, Mutuum Finance has an active, pre-launch $50,000 bug bounty program that proudly works with the ethical hacking community worldwide to expose system weaknesses. Understanding that most digital finance ecosystems that are being launched are based on code that has not been tested, Mutuum Finance demonstrates that it’s security framework is multilayered. This trust that Mutuum Finance has built is the cornerstone of long-term, sustainable growth. Card Purchases Barriers with crypto investments are getting lowered thanks to new direct card purchases with Mutuum Finance. Now, from crypto whales to first-time buyers, everyone can instantly buy an unlimited amount of MUTM tokens all within seconds. Mutuum Finance makes it easy to convert your fiat to digital tokens, and in doing so, they attract a large mainstream audience. It’s no longer just about selling a token. This new accessibility invites growth, and that’s what drove the presale velocity. The presale has quickly gained popularity and is proving to be a top crypto for widespread adoption. Your Journey Starts Now There are different kinds of investment narratives. On one hand, you have Ripple, which is uncertain. You might have some negative returns in the short term. On the other hand, investment narratives like Mutuum Finance are obvious, safe, and quickly accelerating. The presale’s last low-priced window is quickly closing and offers significant returns. All the security audits are complete, the buying process is easy, and the community is ready. Now the question is, will you invest before the price goes up for good?

Pundit Shares Why Companies Shouldn’t Hold The Coins,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-custody-companies-a-risk/,"Crypto pundit Vincent Van Code has explained why companies shouldn’t custody their XRP holdings amid the rise in treasury companies. As part of his comments, he advocated that these companies gain the token exposure to ETFs and other regulated wrappers rather than holding the coins. Pundit Explains Why Companies Should Avoid XRP Custody In an X post , Vincent Van Code stated that companies accidentally turn themselves into a bank, security firm, and a regulated financial institution overnight, the moment they decide to self-custody their XRP . He further remarked that the bill for this mistake is “massive,” as it has some repercussions. The crypto pundit noted that most companies think that holding their own crypto tokens is the same as holding cash in a bank account. However, he explained that they are not the same as custodying XRP is one of the “most complex, expensive, compliance-heavy things” an organization can do. Vincent Van Code then used the altcoin as a case study. He stated that to self-custody at a large scale, companies are not just storing a seed phrase but are now operating a regulated asset environment. The crypto pundit explained that this exposes these companies to annual audits, SOC2 controls, and cold storage infrastructure. They would also have to worry about key ceremony documentation, segregation of duties, insider threat mitigation, and round-the-clock monitoring. Other Implications Of Custody Vincent Van Code further mentioned that companies looking to self-custody their XRP will need incident response teams, a compliance officer, a risk team, internal policies, board oversight, and a full suite of legal and operational safeguards that they must continually maintain. He further highlighted the cost implications of implementing such safeguards. The crypto pundit revealed that the annual cost for a proper crypto custody program could easily hit seven figures. He noted that external audits alone cost between $250,000 and $500,000 annually, once these companies factor in SOC2 Type II, penetration testing, cyber insurance, regulatory reporting, and chain-of-custody reviews. Vincent Van Code also factored in staff that these companies will need to run the self-custody of their XRP assets . Meanwhile, these companies have to bear the risk and liability when something breaks, or a regulator asks questions, or the auditor finds a gap in the accounts. The Best Way For Institutional Adoption Vincent Van Code stated that the real path to large-scale, multi-billion-dollar XRP adoption is not through thousands of companies holding the token. Instead, he claimed that it is through regulated wrappers, such as spot XRP ETFs and institutional treasury firms such as Ripple-backed Evernorth . He explained that these vehicles absorb the compliance load, audit burden, operational risk, and infrastructure costs. Vincent Van Code further remarked that they allow companies to hold XRP exposure without becoming a bank. The crypto pundit added that if mainstream enterprises are going to adopt the token globally, it will be through these structures and not DIY custody operations that could collapse under their complexity.",XRP|DIY|ripple|SOC2 Type II|Spot XRP ETFs|Vincent Van Code|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Treasury|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 11:30:23

The restrictions are aimed at avoiding electricity shortages in the territories during times of peak consumption in the cold winter. Russia shutting down crypto farms in Buryatia and Transbaikal Russian authorities are reintroducing a mining ban in the Republic of Buryatia and Zabaykalsky Krai (Transbaikal) for the fall and winter periods. The prohibition on the crypto-related activity comes into effect on November 15 and will be in force until March 15, 2026, Russian media reported. The RIA Novosti news agency referred to a decree adopted by the federal government last December, according to which the restrictions in Buryatia apply to almost its entire territory – 19 municipalities and the urban district of the capital Ulan-Ude. In the case of Zabaykalsky Krai, the temporary measures are being imposed in 14 municipal districts, the urban districts of Chita and the village of Aginskoye, as well as the closed administrative-territorial entity of Gorny. Russia legalized the minting of digital coins in November 2024, but started restricting the energy-intensive industry shortly after, citing electricity deficits in parts of the country. Low and often state-subsidized electricity rates have been the main reason for the high concentration of mining enterprises in some corners of the vast Russian Federation. What started as a seasonal prohibition in many instances was eventually converted to a permanent ban for the next six years, until March 15, 2031. The list of affected territories now features more than 10 regions, including the republics of the North Caucasus, such as Dagestan, North Ossetia, and Ingushetia, and the occupied parts of four Ukrainian oblasts – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson. For now, the ban in Buryatia and Transbaikal remains partial. It will be enforced across their districts over the next three days. The same will repeat every winter, again until 2031. That’s unless Moscow changes its mind and makes it permanent. In June, a government commission postponed its decision on proposals to do that. Then, in September, the Russian Ministry of Energy saw no reason to expand the geographical coverage or the timeframe of current restrictions. In October, Deputy Energy Minister Yevgeny Grabchak stated that the issue of introducing a year-round ban in Buryatia and Transbaikal was still under consideration. Meanwhile, a seasonal ban in the adjacent Irkutsk Oblast, with which Buryatia and Transbaikal form a single territory for the purposes of power generation and distribution, was upgraded to a full prohibition on mining in the southern parts of the region, dubbed the mining capital of Russia. Russian winters both a blessing and a curse for crypto mining Russia and other countries in the post-Soviet space, like the republics in Central Asia, moved to legalize crypto mining in order to utilize their competitive advantages in terms of abundant and cheap energy resources and cool climatic conditions, which help the cooling of mining hardware. However, the harsh winters in the region are also creating competition between cryptocurrency miners and other consumers due to the much higher energy needs in the cold months of the year, including for heating residential areas. Citing similar concerns, alongside low water levels in reservoirs used for hydroelectric power plants, Kyrgyzstan announced earlier this week it’s shutting down all crypto farms in its territory to conserve power until the spring of 2026. Its energy minister said in an interview that the country will rely on additional electricity supplies from neighboring Kazakhstan to maintain the stability of its energy system, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Kazakhstan has more or less managed to cope with its own power deficits, caused by an influx of mining companies after a Chinese ban on the activity a few years ago, by imposing strict regulations and raising electricity rates for miners.

However, Ethereum Classic is not viewed as an unregistered security, which is positive for its market standing. As a result, ETC is a good investment option in the long term.

If buyers defend the immediate support at $15, we might see a strong recovery toward $30. Will ETC Price Reach $100? ETC price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2028 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ethereum Classic attracts altcoin investors. Will ETC Price Reach $1000?

However, there is currently no indication that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is ETC a Good Long-Term Investment? ETC has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment.

Has The Bear Market Returned?,https://bitzo.com/2025/11/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-plunges-to-six-month-low-has-the-bear-market-returned,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell below $95,000 for the first time in six months, falling to a low of $93,951 before rebounding to reclaim $95,000 and moving to $95,940. Risk aversion swept through markets on Friday as investors pulled nearly $900 million from funds investing in the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is on the verge of wiping out all its gains for the year. Why Is Bitcoin (BTC) Crashing? Bitcoin ( BTC ) is in the doldrums, having crashed below $95,000 on Friday before posting a marginal recovery. Investors initially blamed the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance as inflation fears returned. However, Citi analysts believe the decline is likely linked with falling liquidity in the US financial system rather than interest rate expectations. The analysts highlighted two key factors: bank reserves held at the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury’s General Account (TGA), which acts as the US government’s main account. The TGA and bank reserves generally move in opposite directions. This year, the TGA has swelled while bank reserves have dropped. Lead analyst Dirk Willer stated, “Traditionally, falling reserves have also impacted equities negatively, but this did not happen before this week. But it is plausible that Bitcoin is a more sensitive instrument for pure liquidity, especially with equities caught up in the fundamentally driven AI narrative.” Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening has also pulled money out of the financial system. Bitcoin Whales Still Selling Bitcoin’s market capitalization dropped back below $2 trillion, pushing the broader market down as well. Reports have also flagged a 2,400 BTC transfer worth $237 million to Kraken from a wallet associated with Owen Gunden. Such large selloffs often create short-term supply, although analysts cautioned against reading such actions as capitulation. On-chain analysts have reported a steady increase in selling from long-term holders. According to Glassnode data, average daily spending has climbed from 12,000 BTC in early July to around 26,000 BTC this week. Analysts have stated that this is consistent with late-cycle profit-taking rather than a mass exodus. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin ( BTC ) sank below $95,000 on Friday alongside a market rout driven by a slide in tech stocks and uncertainty around further rate cuts. The decline came as market data revealed spot Bitcoin ETFs registered their second-highest outflows. Bitcoin and the market in general have struggled to recover from October’s selloff, triggered by leveraged liquidations and selling from OG Bitcoin holders. Analysts from 10x Research stated, “There is currently no meaningful marginal buyer stepping in. This aligns perfectly with multiple on-chain indicators we’ve been tracking, which confirm that Bitcoin is in a bear market regime.” 10x research warned that if prices dip below $93,000, further downside to $90,000 could become a possibility. The analysts stated that a rally in the near-term is unlikely without a rate cut in December and a more dovish stance by the Federal Reserve. “We believe there is now a high likelihood the Fed will remain on hold. If that happens, it effectively removes the probability of a classic Bitcoin Christmas rally.” Fundstrat’s Sean Farrell also struck a cautious note, stating, “I think we also are in a scenario where there's just an absence of catalysts,"" he said in a video sent to clients on Thursday.” BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.15% on Friday and settling at $109,555. Price action remained positive on Saturday and Sunday as BTC rose 0.45% and 0.44% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,536. Selling pressure returned on Monday as the price fell nearly 4% and settled at $106,557. The bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC slipped below $100,000, falling to a low of $98,892. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $101,468. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $103,869. BTC returned to bearish territory on Thursday, dropping to a low of $100,235 before settling at $101,290. The price slipped below $100,000 again on Friday, falling to a low of $99,170 before recovering and settling at $103,284, ultimately rising nearly 2%. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.97% on Saturday before rising 2.36% on Sunday and settling at $104,964. Buyers retained control on Monday as BTC rose 1.23% and settled at $105,979. Buyers lost momentum on Tuesday as BTC fell nearly 3% and settled at $103,009. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell 1.33% to $101,639. BTC registered a sharp uptick in volatility and selling pressure on Thursday. As a result, the price fell below $100,000 for the first time since June, dropping to a low of $97,870 before settling at $99,614. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC plunged below $95,000, falling to a low of $93,951 before settling at $94,503.

Ford pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in January. The Wolf Capital CEO’s counsel claimed he was influenced online by an individual referred to only as “ox.” Wolf Capital CEO Handed Prison Sentence Federal prosecutors have secured a five-year prison sentence for Oklahoma man Travis Ford, CEO of Wolf Capital Crypto Trading LLC. Ford admitted to his role in running a fraudulent crypto investment scheme that operated for eight months before collapsing. Ford was sentenced to prison time and ordered to pay over $1 million in forfeiture and more than $170,000 in restitution, according to an announcement published by the United States Department of Justice. “Cryptocurrency Investment Firm Founder Sentenced to Five Years in Prison for Defrauding Investors in $9.4M Ponzi Scheme.” Ford promoted Wolf Capital as a high-yield trading platform, advertising daily gains of 1% to 2%, adding up to 547% per year. According to charging documents published by the Justice Department, Wolf Capital received $9.4 million in investments from 2,800 investors. Unattainable Returns Ford solicited investments through the Wolf Capital website and social media handles between January 2023 and August 2023. According to the Department of Justice, Ford presented himself as a “sophisticated investor” who could deliver high returns. However, he admitted that he knew such returns were not possible to achieve. Prosecutors stated, “Alongside co-conspirators, Ford made such false promises to induce members of the public to invest money.” Ford told investigators that Wolf Capital’s crypto operations reportedly paid out between $4 million and $5 million to investors before it collapsed, with the remaining funds lost due to his own trading activity. Diverting Funds The Department of Justice also stated that Ford, along with unnamed co-conspirators, diverted a significant portion of investor deposits instead of using them for legitimate trading activity. The funds were used for personal gain, resulting in substantial losses for investors. Ford had entered a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in January 2025, admitting his role in the fraud. The US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) investigated the case, reviewing financial records, promotional material, and internal activity linked to Wolf Capital’s operations. “Ford and his co-conspirators allegedly made such false promises to induce members of the public to invest money in the company. Ford then misappropriated and diverted investor funds to benefit himself and his co-conspirators, to the financial detriment of investors.” One victim, who had invested over $100,000 in the scheme, testified that he had relied on Ford’s representations, telling the court that he hoped Ford would receive a harsh punishment. Ford stated that he took full responsibility for the harm caused, adding that he was focused on “making it right” for investors. Ford’s legal team stated to the press, explaining that their client got involved with a European Block gangster only known as “ox” and waded “knee-deep into a mess.” “Ox” is a common prefix used in crypto communities, often associated with online handles or to denote affinity within crypto circles. It generally appears within Ethereum addresses, smart contract identifiers, and other hex-coded data in cryptography. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This dramatic announcement comes as the crypto community increasingly demands transparency and security from their digital asset providers. What Exactly is an OKX Wallet Backdoor? A backdoor represents a hidden vulnerability that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive systems. In the context of cryptocurrency wallets, discovering an OKX wallet backdoor would mean finding a secret method to bypass normal security protocols. Such vulnerabilities could potentially expose user funds to significant risk, making this bounty critically important for everyone involved in digital assets. Why This 10 BTC Bounty Matters for Crypto Security The massive reward demonstrates OKX’s confidence in their security infrastructure. However, it also highlights several crucial aspects of cryptocurrency safety: Transparency commitment – Willingness to publicly test security claims User protection focus – Proactive approach to identifying vulnerabilities Industry leadership – Setting new standards for wallet security accountability Community engagement – Involving the broader crypto community in security verification How Could an OKX Wallet Backdoor Impact Users? Understanding potential security threats helps users make informed decisions. A verified OKX wallet backdoor could have serious implications for cryptocurrency holders. Users might face unauthorized access to their digital assets, potential fund losses, and compromised transaction privacy. However, the very existence of this bounty suggests the company takes these concerns seriously and wants to address them head-on. The Bigger Picture: Cryptocurrency Security Evolution This bounty program represents a significant shift in how cryptocurrency companies approach security challenges. Rather than waiting for vulnerabilities to be exploited, OKX is taking proactive measures. This approach benefits the entire ecosystem by encouraging rigorous security testing and continuous improvement of wallet protection mechanisms. The search for an OKX wallet backdoor isn’t just about finding flaws – it’s about building trust. When companies openly invite security scrutiny, they demonstrate confidence in their products while contributing to overall industry security standards. Frequently Asked Questions What is the deadline for claiming the 10 BTC bounty? Xu Mingxing hasn’t specified an expiration date for the bounty offer, suggesting it remains open until someone provides definitive proof of an OKX wallet backdoor. How can someone safely test for wallet vulnerabilities? Security researchers should use controlled testing environments and follow responsible disclosure practices rather than testing on live production systems. What constitutes definitive proof of a backdoor? Proof would likely require demonstrating reproducible access methods that bypass normal authentication while providing clear evidence of the vulnerability. Has OKX faced security issues in the past? Like most major cryptocurrency platforms, OKX has continuously evolved its security measures to address emerging threats in the dynamic crypto landscape. What happens if multiple people discover the same backdoor? Typically, bounty programs reward the first person to provide valid proof, though specific terms haven’t been detailed for this particular offer.

54434295,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=861085,1763207445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54434295.jpeg,Bondholders step back from Oracle's latest debt moves to support AI spending,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/oracle-debt-slumps-with-bondholders/,"The bond market is hammering Oracle this week after it was reported by Cryptopolitan that the company plans to stack another $38 billion onto its already massive debt load to build out more AI infrastructure, a move that stunned traders who were already watching its balance sheet swell past $104 billion. That new borrowing plan hit the market at the exact moment investors were trying to figure out how far the company can push this strategy while spending more cash than it brings in from operations through deals with startups like OpenAI. Bond traders said the impact showed up right away in the numbers. The company’s 2033 bonds with a 4.9% coupon slipped again this week, lifting yields by more than three basis points over the last two weeks. The 2032 bonds with a 4.8% coupon also saw yields rise almost two basis points in one week. Those jumps marked the moment when questions about the safety of this plan moved out of private calls and into actual trading. Analysts said the drop followed the CNBC report outlining the company’s plan to take on that additional $38 billion, which landed exactly when investors were trying to measure how deep this AI gamble could go. Traders track new warnings from analysts and investors Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told Reuters that major tech firms are trying to keep stock buybacks alive while pouring money into capex, and they are financing both at once by borrowing. When Lisa said, “most of the major tech companies are trying to sustain their stock buyback programs at the same time that they’re spending on capex currently and to do that, they’re actually borrowing and so they’re using debt,” it matched what traders were seeing inside the bond screens all week. Tim Horan, the chief investment officer for fixed income at Chilton Trust, told Reuters he sees the selloff as temporary. Tim said, “I’m viewing this more as a bump in the road… I don’t think what Oracle is experiencing is symptomatic of a popping of some kind of bond market expensive bubble,” and added that the company has tools to handle obligations before touching dividends. But his comments came while investors were comparing warnings from other well‑known voices who have taken aim at the way big tech firms report earnings while spending heavily on AI development. Michael Burry, whose famous bets against the housing market in 2008 were shown in The Big Short , has argued that Oracle, Microsoft, and Alphabet’s Google are stretching out depreciation schedules to smooth out earnings as they commit money to AI. He estimated that between 2026 and 2028, depreciation could be understated by $176 billion, lifting reported profits across the sector. Michael Field, chief equity strategist for Morningstar in the Netherlands, told Reuters that the economic life of data centers is dropping fast. He said it could soon be “low single‑digit years,” meaning gear could be obsolete in three to four years and companies would have only that window to make enough money to pay off the sites. Family offices and hedge funds adjust positions during major stock swings During the same period, filings showed that ultra‑wealthy family offices moved in completely different directions on Oracle. Documents filed for the quarter ending Sept. 30 showed that two investment firms linked to the Rausing family of Sweden and another tied to Microsoft co‑founder Paul Allen boosted their stakes as the company recorded its biggest one‑day stock gain since 1992. That jump happened after the company offered a strong outlook for its cloud business, which also helped Larry Ellison briefly become the richest person in the world as his wealth rose by $89 billion in a single day. But hedge fund billionaire David Tepper and duty‑free tycoon Alan Parker went the other way. David’s firm, Appaloosa LP, sold its entire position worth $32.8 million, while Alan also cut his holdings. Those exits landed before the company’s shares tumbled about 30%, a drop that added even more weight to the current bond selloff now shaking investors who are tracking these swings across the crypto‑heavy, AI‑driven market landscape of 2025. Money managers with more than $100 million in U.S. equities must file 13F forms within 45 days of each quarter’s end, giving the public one of the only real looks into how hedge funds and large family offices position themselves during volatile periods like this one for Oracle, where debt levels, AI spending , and stock performance are pulling in different directions at the same time.

According to the statement, many ASTER token unlocks planned for 2025 have been completely canceled, with most postponed to the summer of 2026. It's noteworthy that some unlocks have been postponed until 2035. Responding to the controversy surrounding calendar shifts seen in ASTER data on Binance, the team stated that monthly ecosystem unlocks were originally part of the initial plan, but that they had halted the process due to the current lack of need for these tokens. The team explained, “We will not be offering these monthly unlocks unless there is a need for ecosystem use.” Related News: Allegations That MicroStrategy Sold Bitcoin (BTC) Have Been Investigated, Here's the Final Result Despite the tokenomics adjustment, the ASTER price remains stable for now.

Notably, this sudden movement highlights growing shifts in investor behavior and signals potential market implications for the digital asset. Such large-scale withdrawals often indicate long-term accumulation or a shift to decentralized custody solutions, as investors move assets off exchanges to personal wallets for increased security. Historically, significant outflows like this can precede price volatility, as available supply on exchanges diminishes while demand from buyers remains constant or increases. Interestingly, the timing of this outflow is particularly notable given that XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining steam with Canary Capital setting the ball rolling. Coin Bureau’s report underscores a broader trend in crypto markets: a growing preference for self-custody and long-term holding. For XRP, these 24-hour outflows reflect not just a transactional event but a potential strategic shift among holders, from short-term speculation to long-term accumulation. Ripple’s ILP and Patents Cement Its Unmatched Position in Crypto According to renowned crypto observer SMQKE, Ripple’s Interledger Protocol (ILP) infrastructure and associated patents have positioned the network in a league of its own, effectively eliminating competition across the crypto landscape. Therefore, this declaration underscores Ripple’s strategic edge in a market that has seen countless projects struggle to deliver scalable, cross-border payment solutions. At the heart of Ripple’s advantage is its ILP technology, a protocol designed to seamlessly facilitate payments across different ledgers and networks. Unlike traditional blockchain systems that operate in silos, Ripple’s ILP allows real-time settlement between institutions, bridging currencies, tokens, and even traditional banking rails. For businesses and banks, this translates into faster, cheaper, and more reliable cross-border transactions, a challenge that has long plagued the global financial system. SMQKE highlights that Ripple’s extensive patent portfolio further strengthens its competitive moat. With proprietary technology spanning transaction routing, liquidity sourcing, and settlement optimization, Ripple not only innovates but also legally safeguards its breakthroughs. Therefore, this combination of technological sophistication and intellectual property control creates barriers that few, if any, competitors can overcome, effectively setting Ripple apart in both the crypto and traditional financial arenas. Moreover, Ripple’s integration with real-world financial infrastructure positions it as more than just a digital asset project. Banks, payment providers, and multinational corporations are increasingly adopting Ripple’s network to streamline operations and reduce costs. The adoption trend, reinforced by ILP’s interoperability and security features, signals a maturing market where Ripple is no longer a challenger but a standard-bearer for cross-border finance. In a crypto environment characterized by volatility and uncertainty, Ripple’s ILP infrastructure and patent-backed technology offer a rare combination of innovation and stability. According to SMQKE, this is why Ripple faces little to no competition in its core domain. For investors and institutions looking for proven, scalable, and legally fortified solutions for digital payments, Ripple’s model stands as a clear benchmark in the industry. Conclusion The $336 million XRP outflow from exchanges signals a wave of strategic accumulation and growing investor confidence. As supply tightens, XRP’s market dynamics may shift, fueling potential price momentum and attracting institutional interest. Beyond short-term volatility, this trend underscores XRP’s evolution from a tradable token to a cornerstone of cross-border payments, offering security, utility, and regulatory clarity. On the other hand, Ripple’s ILP infrastructure and extensive patent portfolio have secured it a dominant, nearly unchallenged position in crypto and cross-border payments. By focusing on real-world utility, regulatory compliance, and institutional adoption, Ripple has evolved from a digital asset into a trusted global financial network. As SMQKE highlights, this strategy not only limits competition but also sets the benchmark for speed, efficiency, and security, cementing Ripple as a cornerstone of the future financial ecosystem.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-15 11:54:29

The company made this known at a keynote address in Lagos, Nigeria. Other technologies in the category include digitization, energy transition, and global rebalancing. The revelation was made by Walid Sheta, Schneider Electric’s Zone President for the Middle East and Africa, at the company’s Innovation Day Nigeria 2025 speech. The event, themed “Competitive Advantage Through Automation and Sustainability,” hosted attendees from far and wide in the energy industry. In his speech, Sheta mentioned that the demand for data center capacity is expected to double, even as over 60 million Nigerians remain offline. Schneider Electric discusses artificial intelligence in Nigeria During the event , Sheta outlined the evolution of energy and the position of Schneider Electric in the vision of partnership for all customers and partners in Nigeria. He highlighted that the world is being reshaped by four megatrends, noting energy transition, digitization and artificial intelligence, infrastructure development, and rebalancing. Sheta mentioned that the transition to electricity is now urgent, as more people are seeing that it is an efficient form of energy. In his statement, Sheta added that electrification is very important in the world of tomorrow as it provides an avenue for efficiency. “We are transitioning to electrification, which is now reaching everywhere, from commercial equipment in energy, buildings, and industries, down to homes. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 27per cent between 2023 and 2030. Battery Storage Capacity must grow from 86GW to 760GW by 2030,” he said. He also highlighted that in Nigeria, renewable energy makes up about 10% of the total power generation, with national targets set at 30% by 2030 and between 40% and 50% by 2026. “As each state strives for energy independence, more generations will be required to drive the economic transformation. These global trends are not unique to Nigeria; Africa and Asia are witnessing similar shifts, with West Africa already feeling the momentum of this global transition,” he added. Sheta discusses worldwide trends Speaking on digitization and artificial intelligence, he noted that the adoption of ChatGPT was about 70 times faster than the World Wide Web, underscoring how fast technologies are evolving. By 2030, Sheta notes that the global spend on artificial intelligence is expected to rise by 168%.“In Nigeria, the demand for data centre capacity is expected to double, yet over 60 million Nigerians remain offline, highlighting the growing need for both AI for Energy and Energy for AI,” he said. Sheta added that Schneider Electric is partnering with Nvidia to accelerate the development and deployment of artificial intelligence factories at scale. “The EcoStruxure for Data Centres solution, deployed in DATAXION, the first Tier III-certified data centre in Tunisia and North Africa, achieved a 35per cent reduction in energy usage and a 30per cent reduction in operational costs,” Sheta said. In terms of infrastructure, he noted a need to improve infrastructure, empower communities, and enhance technical capabilities across important sectors like energy, transportation, electricity, and roads. Sheta mentioned that the trend is not only increasing in Nigeria, but in other parts of the world. He highlighted the use case of Schneider Electric’s EcoStroxure solutions across the trends to include Eko Atlantic City. The company provided uninterrupted energy distribution through its EcoStruxure for Buildings to electrify 99% of Eko Atlantic City’s electricity. The initial output was 11kV before being scaled to 132kV. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A devoted Bitcoin maximalist submitted an eight-point letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, urging the agency to block the approval of XRP exchange-traded funds. His request arrived at a moment when interest in crypto ETFs is accelerating, making the effort both dramatic and unusual. The story gained traction after Diana shared the letter on X. Her post drew wide attention because the arguments were bold, pointed, and, at times, surprising. Many observers viewed the submission as an effort to revive older concerns that regulators have already examined. However, Diana’s post ignited fresh debate about whether personal ideology should shape ETF approval processes. The Timing Behind the Controversy The letter surfaced as momentum around XRP ETFs continued to build. The first U.S. spot XRP ETF launched with strong market interest and impressive early volume. BREAKING: A Bitcoin maxi actually sent the SEC an 8-point letter begging them to deny or delay the $XRP ETFs — and the reasons are… let’s just say “creative.” Here’s his list: 1. “No U.S.-regulated XRP futures.” 2. “There was an SEC lawsuit.” 3.… pic.twitter.com/bCYGxme23U — Diana (@InvestWithD) November 14, 2025 That debut strengthened the narrative that institutional demand exists, regardless of polarized views within the crypto community. The timing of the letter appeared almost reactionary, arriving after the market had already signaled its confidence. Revisiting Regulatory History and XRP’s Legal Outcome One of the central claims in the letter focused on past regulatory battles. The SEC’s suit against Ripple shaped XRP’s reputation for years. However, the case reached final closure after both sides withdrew their appeals. That conclusion left no active legal cloud over XRP. The legal clarity removed a major argument often used to question XRP’s eligibility for regulated investment products. Infrastructure, Transparency, and Market Maturity The letter also raised doubts about market infrastructure and transparency. It mentioned the absence of regulated U.S. futures, unusual on-chain activity, and limited analytics. These claims ignore recent progress. U.S. venues now offer regulated XRP derivatives, giving institutions more tools for risk management. Analytics platforms also provide extensive real-time data on XRP activity. The ecosystem continues to expand as more regulated gateways emerge. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Debate Over Token Distribution and Centralization Another theme in the letter targeted XRP’s distribution model and supply structure. The writer criticized Ripple’s holdings and compared XRP’s origins to Bitcoin’s mining-based issuance. These concerns are not new. They have circulated for years and remain part of ongoing industry discussions. Yet regulated products do not require Bitcoin-style issuance. Regulators evaluate risk, custody, liquidity, and market integrity instead. XRP meets those standards under current frameworks. Why the Letter Failed to Change the Outcome The submission generated attention, but it did not alter regulatory momentum. ETFs launched as planned . Investor activity confirmed that the market had already made its decision. The attempt to delay approval became more symbolic than practical. It demonstrated the ongoing ideological divide in crypto, but it also showed how little influence such pleas have at this stage. A Final Look at the Market’s Verdict The episode revealed a clash between personal conviction and market reality. While the Bitcoin maximalist tried to halt progress, liquidity and demand pushed forward. The XRP ETFs moved ahead without hesitation. The market responded with participation rather than fear. That outcome left the letter as a moment of commentary rather than a barrier to adoption. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

54434628,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=861382,1763208556,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54434628.jpeg,Public to absorb Alto’s CryptoIRA business with $65 million acquisition,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/public-acquires-altos-cryptoira/,"Public, a platform designed for long-term investment, announced that it has paid $65 million in cash and stock for Alto’s CryptoIRA business, thereby expanding the number of Bitcoin retirement options it offers. According to the announcement, Alto clients will be able to use the platform until early 2026 when complete integration with Public’s system is anticipated. The firm confirmed that it will integrate Alto’s technology in the following months, allowing its members to trade cryptocurrencies within their IRAs. Factually, CryptoIRAs will enable investors to trade cryptocurrency without having to deal with the tax implication that usually comes with every sale in a taxable account. Launched in 2019, Public operates an app that enables over one million users to trade digital assets, including bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Public expands crypto and direct indexing offerings Alto’s deal marks its initial enterprise concept under its new Custodial Infrastructure as a Service (CaaS) model. The Accel-backed investment platform stated that the partnership demonstrates the increasing need for Alto’s scalable, secure infrastructure, which will power the upcoming generation of private market investing platforms. “Public is now one of the only platforms where customers can trade crypto in their IRAs, and we continue to expand on our crypto offering for our members as demand grows. Alto’s CryptoIRA product is another way we’re offering our investors sophisticated products to build long term wealth.” -Leif Abraham, co-CEO and co-founder of Public. Abraham added that Alto’s CryptoIRA product is another method that Public is using for its investors with advanced solutions to create long-term wealth. Despite this claim, Public will now face competition from bigger companies like Fidelity, which introduced a line of IRAs with direct cryptocurrency investments in April. According to Fidelity’s website, the Fidelity CryptoIRA offers Roth, traditional, and rollover IRAs. Notably, Fidelity’s website reveals that there are no account opening or maintenance fees. There is a 1% spread on the execution price of cryptocurrency buy and sell transactions, and it offers custody services, where the majority of the cryptocurrency is stored in offline digital wallets. Last month, Public announced that its members can now build their own direct index from a wide range of foundational indices. The Accel-backed investment platform stated that enabling members to develop their own direct index allows investors to own each stock in the index directly, rather than investing in an index derivative, such as an ETF. According to Public, members can directly own more than 100 different indexes from Solactive and S&P, tailor their holdings to their preferences, and maximize tax savings through tax-loss harvesting. The Accel-backed investment platform confirmed that it will offer a minimum of $1,000 and a yearly management fee of 0.19% per index invested. Public’s strategic expansion through the Tornado acquisition The recent acquisition of Alto’s CryptoIRA comes amid a flurry of investments and strategic moves by Public, reflecting the platform’s goal to increase its user base and cryptocurrency services. In September, the firm also announced the acquisition of Tornado, an AI platform for financial institutions. The Accel-backed investment platform noted that Tonardo will retain its mandate, expanding its unmatched agentic AI research capabilities. According to the announcement, over 85,000 Tornado brokerage clients will transition to the public active trading platform, where they can invest in a variety of asset types. “Tornado’s customers will have access to a modern brokerage platform where traders will have a variety of AI-powered tools and charting to move quickly and take advantage of the market in real time. Our active trading platform is built for investors who want the opportunity to build and execute on their own strategies.” -Stephen Sikes, COO of Public. The announcement revealed that Tornado members who join the Accel-backed platform will have access to various investment options, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, cryptocurrency, retirement accounts, and options trading. Additionally, members will gain access to the Public’s AI research assistant, Alpha, and begin utilizing generated assets to invest in customizable indexes.

With ETH now sitting just above a major support cluster, traders are asking the same question: Is this a breakdown in progress, or the start of a deeper accumulation phase driven by long-term holders? ETH Slips as Trendline Break Alters Market Structure Ethereum broke below its multi-month ascending trendline earlier this week, ending a structure that had supported every corrective move since spring. The failure to reclaim the breakdown zone near $3,500 has kept the market defensive, and the descending trendline that has guided price since October continues to cap every attempt at recovery. The daily chart reinforces the shift in tone. ETH was rejected cleanly off the 20-EMA, which has now rolled downward and is acting as dynamic resistance. Momentum indicators echo the weakness: the RSI is pinned near 34, sitting in bearish territory with no meaningful divergence to signal exhaustion. Recent candlestick behavior tells a similar story. A cluster of small-bodied candles followed by a sharp push lower resembles the early stages of a three black crows formation, often a precursor to a broader trend continuation. Whales Reposition: Long-Term Holders Increase Spending Whale behavior adds another layer to the picture. According to Glassnode , 3–10 year ETH holders have increased their spending to over 45,000 ETH per day, marking the highest level since February 2021. Historically, this shift has occurred near major market turning points, either during the early stages of deeper pullbacks or ahead of multi-month accumulation phases. Since late August, as Ethereum pulled back from its new peak, 3–10 year holders have ramped up their average daily spending to >45K ETH/day (90D-SMA). This marks the highest spending level by seasoned investors since Feb 2021. https://t.co/EO1LpkLbmL pic.twitter.com/eMw5rKteTX — glassnode (@glassnode) November 14, 2025 ETF activity has also cooled. Recent Coinglass data shows that ETH-focused funds logged one of their largest single-day outflows this quarter, reinforcing the defensive stance among institutions. Taken together, the on-chain and flow data suggest large players are repositioning rather than panic-selling, but they’re not adding aggressively either. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Key Levels: Is $2,730 the Final Defense Before a Slide to $2,110? Ethereum price prediction is bearish as ETH is hovering above $2,730, a support band that acted as a springboard in late May. While a reaction from this zone is possible, the broader technical geometry leans toward further downside unless buyers reclaim the $3,500 breakdown point. A likely scenario is a temporary rebound into the underside of the broken trendline, essentially a classic retest, followed by another move lower toward the high-liquidity region around $2,110. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For novice traders, the cleanest setup is to avoid calling the bottom and instead wait for confirmation: Bearish continuation: A daily close below $2,730 exposes $2,110, where deeper liquidity may attract buyers. Bullish reversal: A reclaim of $3,500 invalidates the breakdown and opens a path toward $3,960. Until one of these triggers fires, ETH remains inside a corrective channel, where patience, not prediction, remains the most disciplined position. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $27 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013265 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems.

The company said the jump from the $22.8 million it reported a year earlier came from strong activity in its WhiteFiber unit and higher staking income from Ethereum. The company also said it is pushing deeper into its plan to move away from Bitcoin mining and build a full Ethereum treasury structure. The company said the quarter also reflected the first full period of WhiteFiber, which completed its IPO on August 8 and is now fully consolidated. Bit Digital said it owned 70.7% of the company at the end of September, equal to 27,043,750 shares, valued at $734.8 million at the Nasdaq close of $27.17 on September 30. The company said this pulled net income up to $146.7 million, equal to $0.47 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $38.8 million, or $(0.26) per diluted share, last year. Tracking Bit Digital’s revenue changes Bit Digital said revenue from crypto mining dropped to $7.4 million, down from $10.1 million a year earlier, because the Bitcoin network got harder and the company cut its hash rate as part of its exit plan. The company said cloud services brought in $18.0 million, up from $12.2 million last year. It added that colocation services, launched late 2024, generated $1.7 million, compared with nothing last year. The largest jump came from ETH staking. Bit Digital said staking revenue reached $2.9 million, up from $0.4 million last year, driven by higher staking rewards and a stronger ETH price during the quarter. The company said adjusted EBITDA reached $166.8 million, compared with $(19.7) million last year, helped by $146.0 million in gains from crypto holdings. Bit Digital expands Ethereum push The company said it began its Ethereum‑only strategy in June and has been buying and staking ETH at speed since then. Bit Digital said its holdings grew from 30,663 ETH on June 30 to 122,187 ETH on September 30, and then to 153,547 ETH by October 31, valued at $590.5 million at that date. The company said it bought 31,057 ETH in October using proceeds from its $150 million convertible notes sale. The notes carry an initial conversion price of $4.16 per share, which the company said was an 8.2% premium to its estimated mNAV when the deal priced. The company said it earned 644.3 ETH from native staking and 52.9 ETH from liquid staking during the quarter. It added that 99,936 ETH were staked as of September 30, with an annualized yield of 3.05%, and that 132,480 ETH were staked by October 31. Bit Digital said Bitcoin mining continues to shrink. The company mined 64.9 BTC in Q3, down from 165.4 BTC last year. It said its active hash rate was 1.9 EH/s on September 30 with a 22 J/Th efficiency level. The mining arm posted a 32% gross margin. The company said it expects little or no capital spending on this segment going forward, with proceeds from remaining activity moved into ETH. The CEO of the company, Sam Tabar, said the quarter “further solidified Bit Digital’s position at the intersection of what we believe are the two most powerful secular trends of our time: Ethereum and artificial intelligence.” He said the company aims to build one of the largest Ethereum treasuries in the public markets while keeping its link to AI through its stake in WhiteFiber. Tabar said the company is focused on ETH density, balance sheet strength, and long‑term value through its strategy. He added that volatility “is nothing new” and that the company plans to use market drops as openings. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Since then, prices have traded as low as $94,700 as the premier cryptocurrency strives to find market stability. Amid rising speculations on the current status of the crypto bull run, market expert Ali Martinez shares a technical analysis that may yet confirm many investors’ fears. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Bid Walls Spotted On Binance: Bulls Step In With 2,800 BTC Cluster 1,064-Day Cycle Hints Bitcoin Bull Rally May Be Over Since hitting a new all-time high of $126,000 in early October, Bitcoin slipped into a heavy correction phase, losing 24.66% of its market value in the last five weeks. The cryptocurrency has also decisively fallen below the $100,000 psychological support zone, driving a surge of negative sentiments as short-term investors now sit in losses. Interestingly, renowned market pundit Ali Martinez shares historical data that supports most negative postulations of a budding crypto winter. The analyst explains that the Bitcoin bull market has maintained a fixed number of 1,064 days across the last two market cycles. For example, after reaching a cycle bottom of $166 in January 2015, Bitcoin embarked on a 1,064-day bull rally before registering a market top around $20,000 in December 2017. In the following cycle, the premier cryptocurrency picked up from $3,120 in December 2018 and surged to nearly $69,000 in November 2021 to complete another 1,064-day cycle. Following Bitcoin’s cycle low of $15,500 in November 2022, Martinez observes that the asset reached its most recent all-time high of $126,198 exactly 1,064 days later. Based on this timing pattern, he suggests that Bitcoin may have already topped and recent corrections could mark the early stages of a market winter.

While Martinez’s prediction is grounded in strong historical patterns, investors should recognize that the current market cycle is fundamentally different from previous ones. Institutional participation is significantly higher, highlighted by the rise of Bitcoin spot ETFs and the growth of Bitcoin-holding treasury companies. At the same time, clearer regulatory frameworks across Asia, Europe, and the United States continue to strengthen credibility and accelerate mainstream adoption. These structural changes suggest that Bitcoin may not follow past cycle behavior as closely as before. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $94,650 following a 5.59% price fall in the last day. In the last month, the premier cryptocurrency has been down by 14.61% underscoring the significant selling pressure in the present market.

Opter ($OPTER) , a live hybrid decentralised perpetual exchange, is already processing hundreds of millions in volume, setting it apart from the hype-driven rallies dominating the headlines. This ‘privacy season’ has seen veteran coins Zcash (ZEC) and Decred (DCR) explode, both posting gains of over 83% in the last month. But as these legacy assets capture attention, their rallies reveal significant underlying risks. Opter’s case for sustainable outperformance This is where Opter presents a superior long-term investment. Its value isn’t tied to a fragile narrative or threatened by regulation. Instead, Opter is a high-performance business built to capture a significant share of the massive $58.5 trillion perpetuals market. The platform is already live, processing hundreds of millions in trading volume and generating real fees. This proven infrastructure provides strong backing for the $OPTER presale , which is now live in Stage 1, allowing investors to buy the token for just $0.02. This model is supported by a powerful and sustainable tokenomic engine. A portion of all platform fees is used to buy back OPTER tokens from the market. 50% of these tokens are then permanently burned, creating deflationary pressure, while 20% are distributed as staking rewards to long-term holders. As an added bonus, active traders on the platform can also earn 800 OPTER for every $100,000 in trading volume. The fragile Zcash rally Zcash has been the undisputed star, posting a staggering 1,500% surge in just two months to trade above $500. This rally was fueled by institutional interest, including a new Winklevoss Capital-backed firm adopting a ZEC treasury strategy. However, the charts are screaming a warning. The pump has pushed the Zcash RSI to an all-time high of 94.2, a dangerously overbought level. Analysts are warning that such rallies often end in a “sharp and painful collapse.” While some bulls eye $10,000, many traders are already taking profits, bracing for a potential 45-90% correction. Decred’s regulatory balancing act Decred’s recent surge is backed by more solid fundamentals, including a hybrid PoW/PoS model and a high staking rate that keeps supply off the market. But DCR faces a clear and present danger: regulation. The European Union’s 2027 plan to ban anonymous transactions hangs over all privacy coins like a sword of Damocles. Even with optional privacy, exchanges have delisted DCR in the past, placing a hard cap on its long-term potential. Why revenue beats narrative The choice is clear. The Zcash and Decred rallies are an exciting, high-risk narrative trade. Opter is the revenue trade. Its analyst-backed 50x price projections aren’t based on hype; they’re based on a live, fee-generating business model that rewards holders. While the privacy coin narrative could fade with the next regulatory headline, Opter’s revenue is tied to the non-stop $58.5 trillion perpetuals market. This provides a clear opportunity for early participants to get in on the ground floor of a project with proven, sustainable utility. Why gamble on a story when you can invest in a working economy? Stage 1 is live. Why gamble on a narrative’s final inning when you can invest in a business’s first? Trade, earn, and level up while the $OPTER presale price is at its absolute floor.

The probability of a 25 bps rate cut has declined from 94.2% on October 15 to 66.9% a week ago (November 7), and then further to 50.1% on November 13. Data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group also showed that the number of investors who believe the Fed will or should hold its rate has increased over the same period. The probability of rates staying the same has risen from 5.7% on October 15 to 33.1% on November 7, and then further up to 49.9% on November 13 before settling at 55.6%. However, several financial institutions and market analysts are reportedly projecting at least two interest rate cuts before the end of the year. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are among the institutions that have predicted at least three additional 25-basis-point cuts in 2025. Powell says December rate cut is a dilemma The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, recently stated that there are differing views among members of the FOMC on how it should proceed in December. However, he pointed out that a further reduction in the benchmark rate at the December FOMC meeting remains possible. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said a few months ago that a third rate cut by the end of 2025 would be warranted. However, Kashkari recently disclosed that he had opposed the October rate cut due to the economy’s resilience, but is now undecided about the December rate cut. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also came close to agreeing with Kashkari’s sentiment during an event in Dublin, Ireland. “I have an open mind, but I haven’t made a final decision on what I think, and I’m looking forward to debating with my colleagues.” – Mary Daly , San Francisco Fed President Daly, who has until now been a firm supporter of rate cuts, stated on November 14 that any decision made four weeks ahead of the next FOMC meeting is premature. Boston Fed President Susan Collins also said she is hesitant to ease policy further, especially given the limited information on inflation due to the government shutdown . Collins voted for both rate cuts this year. Powell claims the Fed will collect every available data for analysis The Fed chair said on Thursday that the Federal Reserve will collect every available piece of data, evaluate it, and carefully consider it, casually adding that it is the Commissioners’ job to do that. Powell said the Fed has already identified private data it can use, along with its own in-house surveys of business executives. Data will also be collected through informal interviews with a range of nationwide contacts. Fed chair Jerome Powell said the December meeting will be like driving in the fog, pointing out that the only option is to slow down. However, he could not confirm whether the Fed would cut its benchmark rate during the December FOMC meeting. Powell’s remarks show the developing dilemma for the Fed as it prepares for the December meeting. Meanwhile, the government has been unable to conduct surveys and produce reports that are key to the central bank’s policy decisions. Jerome says this could delay rate cuts that even President Donald Trump wants. Beyond the data issue, Powell also believes the Fed should be charting a path for monetary policy moving forward. He said he feels like the Fed should at least wait a cycle before cutting rates again. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The market remains focused on whether institutional inflows will eventually translate into stronger momentum, but sentiment this week suggests traders are looking at alternative payment-focused assets for stability. Remittix (RTX) , trading at $0.1166 per token, has been mentioned in several discussions about next-generation cross-border networks, giving it a subtle presence in conversations around digital payments while XRP searches for direction. XRP price falls despite ETF activity XRP is selling at $2.30, a significant drop of 4.66%. Its market capitalization stands at $139.16 billion, while trading volume is up 31.87% at $8.23 billion amid rising volatility. According to analysts, inflows related to ETFs have not triggered stronger upside. There is a possibility that available liquidity cannot support a meaningful recovery. Some traders believe the hesitation is tied to broader rotation patterns, where users explore upcoming crypto projects and low gas fee crypto networks offering more utility-driven features. This shift is most visible in payment tokens, which remain one of the most researched categories among users tracking the xrp price for clues about market direction. Market rotation raises questions about next payment leader With XRP ETFs struggling to create sustained buying demand, attention has shifted to newer assets showing progress in real-world payment systems. The growing interest in cross-chain DeFi project development and new altcoin to watch lists shows traders are scanning for alternatives with clearer short-term catalysts. Remittix’s expanding payment network sets it apart Priced at $0.1166 per token, more than $28.1 million has been raised privately, giving the team an influx of resources to speed up development. The number of tokens sold now stands in excess of 685 million, further building confidence in the Remittix DeFi project as it gains traction among upcoming crypto projects and early stage crypto investment circles. The latest update confirms that Remittix has expanded its Beta Wallet testing to more community holders, particularly iOS users sourced through weekly top-10 buyer rankings. A major achievement this week is the team’s full CertiK verification and Remittix being ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens. Future listings have also been confirmed, with BitMart and LBANK both announcing upcoming RTX listings, further improving visibility and interest across centralized exchanges.

The XRP price remains a key benchmark for traders, but the conversation is clearly expanding. With ETF inflows failing to produce meaningful gains, users are now weighing established networks against rising payment tokens with fresh utility and faster development cycles. Whether XRP can reclaim momentum will depend on broader liquidity conditions, but for now, Remittix continues to draw attention as a practical solution in the payment sector.

According to Glassnode’s latest analysis, we’re witnessing a dramatic Bitcoin altcoin decoupling that’s rewriting market cycle patterns. This unprecedented divergence signals a major shift in how digital assets correlate. What Exactly is Bitcoin Altcoin Decoupling? The Bitcoin altcoin decoupling phenomenon describes cryptocurrencies moving in opposite directions. While Bitcoin maintained relative stability, altcoins entered what analysts call a capitulation phase. Glassnode’s data reveals only 5% of the total altcoin supply currently shows profit. This market behavior breaks from historical patterns. Typically, Bitcoin and altcoins move in correlation during market cycles. However, the current Bitcoin altcoin decoupling shows these assets responding differently to market pressures. Why Does This Decoupling Matter for Investors? The intensifying Bitcoin altcoin decoupling carries significant implications: Portfolio diversification strategies may need revision Risk assessment models require updating Market timing approaches demand recalibration Investment thesis validation becomes crucial Glassnode emphasizes this Bitcoin altcoin decoupling represents uncharted territory. Previous market cycles never displayed such pronounced separation between Bitcoin’s performance and altcoin profitability. How Severe is the Altcoin Capitulation? The data paints a stark picture. While the proportion of profitable altcoins has stabilized at extremely low levels, Bitcoin’s profitability only recently began declining sharply. This timing difference highlights the unique nature of the current Bitcoin altcoin decoupling. Consider these key observations from Glassnode’s research: Altcoin profit percentage remains near historic lows Bitcoin’s profit decline started later but accelerated rapidly The divergence magnitude exceeds previous cycle patterns Market recovery paths may differ significantly between assets What Causes This Unprecedented Divergence? Several factors contribute to the Bitcoin altcoin decoupling we’re observing. Institutional adoption focuses primarily on Bitcoin, creating different demand dynamics. Regulatory clarity varies across jurisdictions, affecting projects differently. Additionally, market maturity brings more sophisticated investment strategies that treat Bitcoin and altcoins as distinct asset classes. The ongoing Bitcoin altcoin decoupling suggests markets are evolving beyond simple correlation models. Investors now differentiate between Bitcoin’s store-of-value proposition and altcoins’ utility-specific use cases. Actionable Insights from the Decoupling Trend Understanding this Bitcoin altcoin decoupling helps investors make better decisions. Consider re-evaluating your portfolio allocation between Bitcoin and altcoins. Monitor on-chain metrics beyond price action. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals rather than chasing short-term momentum. Glassnode’s data indicates the Bitcoin altcoin decoupling may continue as markets mature. This creates both challenges and opportunities for informed investors who adapt their strategies accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions What does Bitcoin altcoin decoupling mean? Bitcoin altcoin decoupling occurs when Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies move independently rather than following similar price patterns. This breaks from historical correlation trends. How long has this decoupling been happening? Glassnode’s data shows the current Bitcoin altcoin decoupling intensified recently, though subtle signs appeared throughout 2023. The dramatic separation became most pronounced in recent months. Should I avoid altcoins during decoupling periods? Not necessarily. While risk increases during Bitcoin altcoin decoupling phases, opportunities exist for selective investment in fundamentally strong projects. Proper due diligence becomes even more crucial. Will Bitcoin and altcoins recouple eventually? Market history suggests some correlation will return, but the current Bitcoin altcoin decoupling might establish new normal patterns rather than temporary divergence. How can I track decoupling trends? Monitor analytics platforms like Glassnode for on-chain metrics. Watch correlation coefficients between Bitcoin and major altcoins. Follow trading volume patterns across exchanges. Does decoupling affect all altcoins equally? No. The Bitcoin altcoin decoupling impacts projects differently based on their market capitalization, use case, adoption level, and tokenomics. Larger, more established altcoins might show different patterns than newer projects. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin altcoin decoupling helpful?

The meeting happened on Wednesday on the sidelines of the central bank’s Treasury market conference, according to three people who were there, and it showed how worried officials are about strange moves inside the repo market. The Fed confirmed the meeting and said straight up that Williams wanted clear feedback from the banks that handle government debt. He pushed them to explain how they’re using the standing repo facility, a tool that is supposed to help the Fed keep short‑term borrowing costs inside its target range. A spokesperson said Williams met the primary dealers to make sure the tool still works for rate control. Most of the 25 primary dealers sent fixed‑income team members, who said stress signals are rising at the worst possible time. Banks, investors, and officials are watching the same corner of the system because things have started moving in ways that look too familiar. The tri‑party repo rate, a key gauge of short‑term borrowing, shot well above the level set by the Fed late last month. It calmed down the following week only after investors heard that the central bank will stop shrinking its balance sheet on December 1. But this week, that rate started rising again, sitting almost 0.1 percentage points above the Fed’s rate on reserve balances. Even though the rate is still lower than what traders saw in late October, the pattern is making desks nervous. Williams presses dealers as rates move away from Fed target Roberto Perli, who runs market operations at the New York Fed, said at an event this week that some borrowers are struggling to find repo rates that sit close to the interest paid on reserves parked at the central bank. He explained that the share of transactions happening above the reserve‑rate level has climbed to points last seen in 2018 and 2019. Repo deals trade high‑quality collateral for cash for very short periods, and they are a core part of how the system gets its daily liquidity. Traders watch those rates like hawks. Analysts have warned that pressure will likely get worse heading into year‑end. After three years of quantitative tightening, banks do not have much spare cash left. That worsens as December nears, because banks shrink their balance sheets for reporting reasons. Williams and other senior officials at the Fed have said the standing repo facility must play a big role in holding short‑term rates inside the Fed’s target band. Williams said earlier this week he thinks recent use of the tool has been “effective,” and he said he expects it will “continue to be actively used” as money‑market stress builds. But the reality is that the use of the tool has been weak. A few firms have borrowed from the facility, but not in numbers strong enough to bring repo rates back toward the Fed’s target. Lenders are hesitant. They worry that tapping the tool will make them look desperate, even though the names of borrowers are released only two years later. That fear feeds the system’s biggest problem: trust. Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, said “repo is all about trust,” and warned that if a borrower looks even a little risky, lenders may pull back all at once. He said that once a firm gets that label, “it’s hard to recover.” His point lands at a time when stress is rising and cash is tight. Dealers say the issue is turning into a loop: stress pushes rates up, higher rates push firms toward the repo tool, stigma pulls them away, and the Fed is left trying to keep everything inside its range with a tool that many are scared to touch.

Adoption is surging across ETFs, stablecoins, and tokenization, marking a transformative moment for institutional and retail investors alike, according to XRP Update. XRP-backed ETFs are becoming a key gateway for mainstream crypto exposure. By offering regulated access, they attract both institutional and retail investors, boosting demand, liquidity, and trading volumes, while cementing XRP’s role in global finance. Stablecoins are driving a new wave of XRP utility. Thanks to its low costs and high throughput, XRP is increasingly used to bridge fiat and blockchain-based stablecoins, enabling faster, cheaper, and more secure cross-border payments. By reducing dependence on traditional banking corridors, XRP is proving itself not just as a speculative asset, but as a practical tool for global liquidity and financial efficiency. XRP’s Interledger Protocol (ILP) makes it a prime platform for tokenizing real-world assets, from real estate to commodities. Tokenization converts tangible assets into tradable digital tokens, unlocking liquidity, enabling fractional ownership, and opening new investment opportunities. This positions XRP not just as a payment solution, but as a foundational layer for a more digital, accessible financial ecosystem. The rise of ETFs, stablecoins, and tokenization marks XRP’s evolution from a digital currency into a versatile financial network. Beyond speculation and remittances, XRP is now powering diverse financial instruments and institutional strategies. For investors, this signals long-term growth potential; for institutions, it provides a secure, efficient gateway into the digital asset ecosystem. SEC Signals Pro‑Crypto Turn Under Chair Atkins On-chain analytics firm BankXRP recently flagged comments by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins, who told Fox Business that his agency is actively working to ease regulation on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. According to BankXRP, this marks a significant pivot in the SEC’s posture, one more supportive of crypto innovation than the enforcement-heavy era that preceded him. Atkins, who assumed the SEC chairmanship earlier this year, has publicly committed to a more collaborative, rules-based approach. He said rulemaking is underway, with the goal of building a “stable platform” for crypto companies to launch products without being hampered by legacy securities regulations. SEC Chair Paul Atkins signals a regulatory shift: revisiting custody rules to reflect modern blockchain practices and clarifying which tokens qualify as securities under U.S. law. In a recent policy speech, SEC Chair Paul Atkins revealed that the agency is developing a token taxonomy to clearly separate securities from non-securities in crypto. He also noted a key legal insight: tokens issued under investment contracts may no longer qualify as 'securities' once their contractual obligations are fully met. If realized, these steps could transform the U.S. crypto landscape, cutting regulatory uncertainty, boosting capital formation, and making the country a hub for blockchain innovation. For BankXRP and on-chain analysts, it signals that the SEC may finally be aligning regulations with the realities of crypto technology. Conclusion XRP’s expansion into ETFs, stablecoins, and tokenization shows it is far more than a payment tool or speculative asset. Its integration into regulated products, cross-border transactions, and digital ecosystems highlights its transformation into a versatile, future-ready financial network, unlocking efficiency, access, and opportunity for investors, institutions, and innovators alike. Meanwhile, SEC Chair Paul Atkins’ recent remarks hint at a turning point in U.S. crypto regulation. By emphasizing clarity, innovation-friendly rules, and collaboration, the SEC aims to balance investor protection with digital asset growth. This shift could cut regulatory uncertainty, spur blockchain adoption, and position the U.S. as a leading hub for crypto innovation",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-15 12:49:29

XRP trades at $2.25, down slightly over the past 24 hours, with a market cap near $135.4 billion and daily volume above $5.3 billion, still among the highest levels in the altcoin sector. Amid the price pressure, the market received a major development: the launch of the Canary XRP ETF (NASDAQ: XRPC), the first U.S.-listed product offering spot exposure to XRP. The ETF arrives at a time when investors are actively rotating into assets with real utility, giving the token a stronger institutional profile. ETF Launch Marks a Turning Point Canary Capital’s new ETF highlights the market’s growing appetite for institutional-grade exposure to XRP. CEO Steven McClurg said the product is designed to make XRP more accessible to both retail and institutional investors, an important milestone for a network that has long positioned itself as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain settlement systems. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) remains one of the few blockchains optimized for fast, low-cost payments rather than speculation. It processes transactions in seconds, consumes minimal energy, and supports real-world applications ranging from cross-border payments to asset tokenization. Key advantages driving institutional interest: High transaction throughput and low fees A decade-long operational track record Growing enterprise adoption and regulatory clarity Practical utility beyond price speculation These characteristics help explain why XRP continues to attract long-term capital, even as volatility pressures the broader crypto market. Why XRP Stalled Below $2.50 Despite the ETF tailwind, XRP could not push through the $2.50 resistance, one of the most watched levels on the chart. Sellers stepped in aggressively near the descending trendline that has capped every rally since early October, forcing the token back into its tightening symmetrical triangle. On the 4-hour chart, XRP remains below the 20-EMA, signaling short-term weakness. The RSI at 39 shows buyers haven’t stepped in with conviction, while long upper wicks on recent candles indicate consistent profit-taking. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Failure to break the descending trendline has kept the structure in a compression phase, with price hovering just above $2.21, a support level that has repeatedly prevented breakdowns. XRP Price Forecast: Breakout or Breakdown? XRP price prediction is neutral as XRP is approaching a decisive moment. The triangle is nearly at its apex, meaning the next move is unlikely to be small. Traders are watching two key scenarios: Bearish: A daily close below $2.21 opens the door to $2.07, then $1.92 Bullish: A close above $2.33 could trigger a rally toward $2.52, then $2.68 For new traders, the cleanest strategy is to wait for confirmation rather than guessing direction. XRP’s next break will likely come with strong volume and swift follow-through. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin.

The State Administration for Market Regulation said on its website that “monopoly risks are frequent in the platform economy sector,” and listed problems linked to unfair pricing, sales below cost, account blocking, choose‑one‑of‑two pressure, lowest‑price‑across‑the‑network demands, and algorithm‑driven discrimination. The agency said the draft explains how officials will identify risks that come from actions and algorithms used by large platforms. It will stay open for public comments until November 29, giving companies a short window to respond before the state moves forward. The regulator said the rules are meant to show companies what behavior will count as dominance and why platforms cannot use their size, data, or software tools to squeeze sellers or control user behavior. Officials said they want direct, clear standards for an economy that depends on huge online marketplaces. The move lands in a tense moment for China, with leaders managing slower growth and rising friction with the United States. China expands fiscal tools to support demand Finance Minister Lan Foan told Xinhua News Agency on Saturday that China will widen counter‑cyclical and cross‑cyclical regulation over the next five years. Lan said the state will set the deficit‑to‑GDP ratio and the scale of government borrowing based on changing economic conditions. Lan said China will use the budget, taxation, government bonds , and transfer payments to support both economic development and social programs. Lan said the global environment is “volatile and unstable,” and that rivalry among large countries is “more intricate and intense.” He did not name the United States, but tensions between China and Washington remain high on trade, tech, and supply chains. Lan said spending will increase for the modern industrial system, science and technology, education, and social security. He said fiscal subsidies will help push consumption of goods and services at home as global demand softens. He also said China will coordinate local special‑purpose bonds with ultra‑long special treasury bonds while improving how the state directs public investment. Lan said the tools are meant to support long‑term industries that matter for growth, including technology and manufacturing. He said China will adjust spending when needed to deal with swings in global markets. He described the environment as difficult but pointed to steps meant to keep domestic activity stable as other economies slow down. U.S. lawmakers say China is steering minerals prices for advantage A bipartisan committee in Washington said on Wednesday that China has tried for decades to push global minerals prices, using its control over lithium and rare earths to support its manufacturing base. The U.S. House Select Committee on China released a 50‑page report, reported by Reuters, that said Beijing’s control over critical minerals has helped shape global markets and extend its geopolitical influence. The committee said former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump both moved to limit China’s dominance in the sector before Trump returned to the White House this year. The legislative report recommends minerals price controls and more government oversight of price reporting agencies. In a statement to Reuters, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said “there is nothing credible about the committee,” and added that China supports “the security and stability of global production and supply chains.” Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu urged U.S. politicians to approach the relationship through “common interests,” “peaceful coexistence,” and “win‑win cooperation.” Beijing has said the United States has exaggerated China’s export controls on rare earths and stirred unnecessary panic. But Michigan Republican John Moolenaar, who chairs the committee, said “China has a loaded gun pointed at our economy, and we must act quickly.” The committee said China has targeted lithium and rare earths by raising and lowering prices to support domestic goals. It said that every time lithium prices rose, officials moved to bring them back down. The report said the Trump administration cited pricing concerns in September when it pursued an equity stake in Lithium Americas. It added 13 policy steps, some already taken, and said “one single policy will not completely address the serious challenge the United States faces on critical minerals, so we must simultaneously pursue multiple policy prescriptions.” That warning adds another layer of pressure as China continues to face scrutiny over its control of key materials tied to supply chains that touch everything from electric vehicles to crypto mining hardware.

A significant chunk of value was erased across the crypto landscape, with the total market cap briefly climbing above $3.6 trillion during the middle of the week before slipping to the lower end of the $3 trillion range, a level not seen in several months. By late Friday in Asian trading hours, a few altcoins managed to hold on to modest double-digit gains supported by project-specific developments. However, most continued to trade in the red. Market sentiment was bleak at best, with the crypto fear and greed index slipping into “extreme fear” levels at 16 on Friday. Why is Bitcoin price down this week? Bitcoin rallied to a weekly high of $106,562, fueled by early optimism following Donald Trump’s proposal to issue a $2,000 tariff dividend to most American adults. The idea of redirecting tariff revenues toward direct payments and national debt reduction quickly sparked speculation about renewed retail interest in crypto markets. Hopes were further lifted after the Senate advanced a long-delayed funding bill, signaling progress in ending the country’s prolonged government shutdown. The early week surge drew fresh institutional flows, with several spot ETFs seeing renewed demand. Prices climbed steadily as confidence returned briefly to the market. However, that sentiment began to unravel by midweek as geopolitical tensions escalated. Reports that US authorities had seized nearly $13 billion worth of Bitcoin from China’s LuBian mining pool introduced a fresh wave of uncertainty. Many traders grew uneasy over the prospect of retaliation from Beijing, especially with ongoing trade negotiations still unresolved. Selling pressure mounted swiftly. ETF outflows picked up pace, reaching $869 million on Thursday alone after a $277 million drawdown the previous day. Although the week’s cumulative outflows remained below the prior two weeks, the reversal in flows underscored growing doubt over Bitcoin’s near-term prospects. Large holders also joined the exit, unloading coins worth over $45 billion in recent months. Much of this selling came from investors disillusioned with Bitcoin’s continued underperformance relative to the broader market. Doubts around a December interest rate cut added further weight. Market expectations for a rate reduction dropped sharply, with odds falling from above 90% to just 53% over a matter of days. Crypto assets typically benefit from lower interest rates, so the repricing of expectations triggered another round of cautious positioning. At the same time, cracks began to show in the corporate Bitcoin adoption narrative. Publicly listed firms that had previously leaned into Bitcoin treasury strategies saw their share premiums vanish. Strategy Inc., led by Michael Saylor, saw its stock plunge more than 50% from its highs this year. Its market net asset value dropped to parity, reflecting weak investor conviction. Other firms like Semler Scientific, MetaPlanet, and KindlyMD faced similar pressure. Many have since paused Bitcoin purchases, with some possibly preparing to liquidate holdings to manage liabilities. By the end of the week, Bitcoin slipped below the $100,000 psychological threshold and touched multi-month lows around $96,000, pressured by the aforementioned catalysts. Can Bitcoin price recover? In the upcoming trading sessions, Bitcoin’s ability to regain strength will largely depend on whether it can decisively reclaim the psychological support above $100,000. Without a convincing move back above that level, sellers may continue to dominate unless a significant catalyst emerges to restore confidence and reset the market narrative. On the seven-day liquidation heatmap, traders are closely watching clusters of long liquidations that began building up after Bitcoin crossed $105,000. Bitcoin 7-day liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. The sharp drawdown toward the $96,000 range triggered a string of forced exits, most notably between the $99,000 and $101,000 levels. These zones, previously seen as short-term support, have now flipped into areas of resistance. Unless Bitcoin can absorb the remaining supply pressure from trapped longs in that range, upward moves may remain capped in the near term. In terms of support areas, the strongest liquidity concentration appears around the $94,000 to $95,000 band. This range has shown signs of buyer interest, with the liquidation heatmap revealing reduced sell pressure and brief consolidation attempts. If this base holds, it could serve as a foundation for a gradual recovery. Otherwise, a clean break below $94,000 might trigger another wave of selling that pulls Bitcoin closer to the $91,000 to $92,000 region, where the next pocket of interest lies. Meanwhile, any upward breakout would likely face resistance first at $98,000 and again near $101,000, both levels with visible liquidation clusters and prior order activity. If price can slice through those zones, a return to the $104,000 range becomes plausible, especially if ETF inflows return or macro signals improve. As long as buyers can prevent deeper downside breaches and macro conditions do not worsen further, there is still a chance for stabilization and slow rebuilding of the market structure. However, the scenario could become more grim if funding outflows continue and large holders remain on the sidelines. A loss of $94,000 on strong volume would open the door for a more extended correction that might erase much of the year’s gains and test investor conviction across the board. Bitcoin price must remain above $94k CryptoQuant’s CEO and founder Ki Young Ju agrees the broader bull market would remain intact as long as this $94,000 level holds. That area is also the average cost basis of investors who bought Bitcoin in the past six to 12 months, according to Ju. Bitcoin realized price.

I would rather wait than jump to conclusions,” wrote Ju in a Nov. 14 X post alongside the following chart. See below. However, not everyone is optimistic, especially those gauging market structure through classic distribution models. As highlighted by well-followed analyst Ted Pillows, Bitcoin is currently unfolding within a textbook Wyckoff distribution pattern, and that could mean the asset is now entering the final phase of a prolonged top formation.

If it continues to follow this path, the breakdown could deepen further, with sellers taking firmer control as price drifts away from previously defended support levels. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was trading just over $97,000, after dropping over 3.5% over the past 7 days. Top altcoins this week Over the past 7 days, the altcoin market cap initially rose from $1.51 trillion to $1.54 trillion before plunging to $1.44 trillion, ending the week down by 4.6% as of press time. Market sentiment toward the altcoin sector remained largely subdued throughout the period. The Altcoin Season Index, which tracks altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin, fluctuated between 26 and 33 during the week before settling at 33 at press time. Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market share, climbed as high as $3,600 earlier in the week before bears and profit-taking from investors pushed it down to a low of $3,100. It later recovered slightly to settle around $3,200 by the end of the week, still marking a 3.1% decline over the seven-day period. Other major altcoins by market cap, including BNB (BNB), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK), all ended the week in the red, with losses ranging from 2% to as much as 9%. XRP (XRP), however, broke away from the pack, rising 4.5% over the same period and trading at $2.30 when writing. Starknet (STRK) took the spotlight among the top 100 leading crypto assets with gains of 44.5% while AB (AB) and Uniswap followed with 36.5% and 32.8% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap Starknet : STRK rallied this week, supported by investor hype around StarkWare’s release of S two, a fully open source zero-knowledge prover designed for faster proof generation, improved privacy, and stronger decentralization. The new prover enables advanced real-world use cases such as shielded DeFi trading, where transaction amounts and senders remain hidden while still preserving regulatory compliance. This has drawn interest from privacy-focused investors who have been looking to capitalize on the recent surge in attention toward privacy-driven applications. On-chain metrics show that more than 900 million STRK tokens and over 650 BTC are now staked on Starknet, marking increases of 45% and 60% over the past month. As more assets are locked into the network, the ecosystem is beginning to demonstrate stronger security and deeper economic commitment from its users. Meanwhile, DeFi protocols built on Starknet have collectively surpassed $276 million in total value locked, supported by an aggressive Bitcoin deposit rewards program and a fresh distribution campaign of 100 million STRK tokens aimed at attracting new liquidity and driving continued adoption across the network. AB : For AB Chain’s native token, AB, the gains followed a partnership with Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial to deploy USD1 stablecoin on the AB Chain network. The USD1 integration is designed to enrich the AB chain’s DeFi and payment ecosystem, leveraging the chain’s high-performance network. Looking ahead, investor optimism has also been buoyed by AB Wallet’s roadmap, which includes USD1 yield features and additional value-added services. Uniswap : Uniswap has recently introduced a new governance proposal titled “UNIfication,” which aims to reshape the token’s economics and incentivize long-term holders. At the core of the proposal is a Protocol Fee Activation, which would turn on a fee switch that will divert a portion of trading fees from the Uniswap DEX to burn UNI tokens. In addition, the proposal includes a one-time burn of 100 million UNI tokens from the Uniswap treasury. Traders expect the updated tokenomics to introduce a steady deflationary pressure that could support UNI’s value over time.

Travis Ford, the CEO, co-founder, and head trader of Wolf Capital Crypto Trading, was found guilty of orchestrating a crypto investment fraud conspiracy. Ford, hailing from Glenpool, Oklahoma, is said to have played a crucial role in raising $9.4 million from around 2,800 investors through false promises of high returns. Promising Unrealistic Returns According to the Department of Justice, Ford’s fraudulent activities spanned from January 2023 to August 2023, during which he misrepresented himself as a skilled trader capable of delivering exceptional daily returns ranging from 1% to 2% (equating to approximately 547% annually). Despite his guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, Ford confessed that achieving such consistent returns was implausible. Instead, the crypto executive and his accomplices utilized what the DOJ described as deceptive tactics to lure unsuspecting investors, misappropriating and diverting their funds for personal gain. Simultaneously, there has been a surge in global efforts towards regulating digital assets, spearheaded by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Governments worldwide, including the US and China, are intensifying crackdowns on cryptocurrency-related cross-border crimes as a result, particularly targeting scam networks operating in Southeast Asia. Crypto Fraud Hotspots Local media reports indicate that regions bordering Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia have transformed into hotspots for online fraud operations. Syndicates operating in these areas reportedly employ various tactics to coerce victims into investing in fraudulent schemes, often involving the transfer of funds through digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or stablecoins, followed by intricate money-laundering processes. Despite the increasing mainstream adoption of digital assets in financial sectors, the report indicated that cryptocurrencies continue to play a significant role in sophisticated criminal enterprises. However, recent actions, such as the seizure of $13.4 billion worth of Bitcoin from Chen Zhi, a Cambodian tycoon with Chinese origins, underscore the global efforts to combat crypto-related crimes. Additionally, the US DOJ’s establishment of a Scam Center Strike Force signifies a pivotal initiative aimed at combating crypto investment fraud targeting Americans. This move marks a significant step in the US government’s vision to confront transnational criminal networks head-on, as highlighted in a report by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs. The DOJ revealed that Southeast Asian scam syndicates defraud Americans of nearly $10 billion each year. This emphasizes the urgency of addressing such criminal activities, especially given the progressive US legislation promoting the growth and adoption of digital assets.

Instead, his approach will be more cautious, in which he remains on the sidelines for now, but plans to buy more soon. Not Selling With bitcoin’s growth over the past several years came the inevitable increase in the number of people who tend to comment on its moves, especially when it goes through turbulent times, such as the market correction on Friday or the overall downfall since the all-time high in early October. Kiyosaki is among those who have been supporting the asset for years and has frequently advised people to get some sort of BTC exposure, as well as gold, silver, and ETH, since the beginning of this year. Following the most recent crash to a six-month low of $94,000, Kiyosaki took it to X to outline his strategy, and he navigates the waters. First, he reaffirmed that he has no intention of selling, similar to Strategy. He noted that he does not need cash and blamed people who do for the violent correction. Additionally, he believes there’s another, more profound reason why he is reluctant to dispose of his BTC holdings now, which is the growing amount of debt. “The real reason I am not selling is because the problem…. The world is deeply in debt…. and my bet is “The Big Print” as described in Lawrence Leppard’s book…. “The Bug Print”is about to begin…. which will make gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum more valuable…..as fake money crashes.” Will He Buy? Although he admitted that he and Leppard could be wrong, Kiyosaki outlined in a separate post that he intends to buy more but only when the crash is over, which is something quite speculative at the moment. He reasserted that there will be only 21 million BTC ever to exist, which is why the cryptocurrency holds such a high value in his portfolio, and reminded people to get educated on all financial matters. TWO MORE THINGS: 1: I willl buy more Bitcoin when crash is over. There are only 21 million Bitcoins. 2: If you have a Cashflow Game form a Cashflow Club and bring Birds of Feather together….

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.1320 Market Cap $380.39M Trading Volume (24-hour) $60.69M Circulating Supply 3.22B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.1372 24-h Low $0.1289 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 11.68% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $ 0.1949 14-Day RSI 37.04 (Neutral) Green Days 11/30 (37%) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 10 (Extreme Fear) 200-Day SMA $ 0.3554 Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : Sonic shows weak momentum with price still below key moving averages and volatility narrowing RSI remains soft which signals limited strength and possible continued sideways movement A break above resistance could spark recovery but failure may extend the downtrend Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day Sonic (FTM) chart on Nov 15, the broader trend remains decisively bearish, with price consistently trading below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages and showing no sign of a momentum reversal. Bollinger Bands indicate persistent downward pressure, as Sonic continues to hover near the lower band, reflecting weak demand and limited buyer follow-through. The RSI at 37 suggests the asset is not yet oversold but remains stuck in a bearish zone, showing a lack of strong accumulation. Unless Sonic reclaims the mid-band around $0.175 with sustained volume, the price risks drifting toward the lower support area near $0.112 in the coming sessions. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Sonic’s 4-hour chart shows sustained bearish pressure, with price trading near the lower Bollinger Band and failing to reclaim the mid-band. Momentum remains weak as the MACD stays below the signal line, showing fading bullish attempts and increasing downside risk. The Balance of Power continues to fluctuate in negative territory, signaling sellers maintain structural control. Unless Sonic breaks above the $0.1508 mid-range level with stronger volume, the pair may revisit support around $0.1276. A clean reclaim of $0.1741 is needed to shift sentiment. For now, the short-term outlook favors cautious consolidation with a bearish tilt. Sonic technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.2014 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.1802 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.1686 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.1544 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.1949 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.2521 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.3554 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.1624 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.1860 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.2265 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.2650 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.2990 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.3384 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.3969 SELL What can you expect from the Sonic (prev.FTM) price analysis next? Sonic’s broader price structure shows a market still struggling to find direction, with momentum indicators showing persistent weakness and limited bullish conviction. The overall trend remains tilted downward, and buyers have not shown the strength needed to force a sustained recovery. While short-term bounces are possible, especially if support levels hold, the absence of strong volume and failing attempts to break resistance suggest that the market may continue drifting sideways or slipping lower. For a meaningful reversal, Sonic must reclaim key resistance zones with stronger follow-through. Until then, the price outlook leans cautiously bearish with mild recovery attempts. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5123 price by 2025 and $3.72 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $3.11 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.72. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $5.53. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.11 and $3.72, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

On the lower end, corrections may pull the price to $0.9873 with an expected average trading price of around $1.02. However, this is supported by the network’s rebrand momentum, scalability upgrades, and stronger developer activity. Expanding DeFi and gaming applications are expected to increase demand. Yet, competition from other Layer-1 and Layer-2 ecosystems may restrain rapid surges, keeping prices within this projected range. Sonic price prediction 2027 Sonic’s (prev. FTM) 2027 forecast of $1.39–$1.67, averaging $1.43, is linked to growing adoption of its rebranded ecosystem. By then, expanded DeFi, NFT, and gaming use cases are expected to strengthen utility and demand. Network scalability upgrades and rising developer engagement support gradual appreciation, while market cycles keep growth within range.

However, new evidence shows the movements were not sales, they were part of a large-scale custodial migration quietly unfolding for two weeks. On November 14, blockchain analytics firm Arkham detected a massive cluster of transactions involving Strategy-linked wallets. Since midnight UTC, the company shifted 43,415 BTC, roughly $4.26 billion, across more than 100 addresses. The activity fueled panic that one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holders might be liquidating its position. Fresh insights indicate the Bitcoin was not sent to exchanges or off-ramps but routed through internal infrastructure tied to both Strategy’s existing custodian, Coinbase Custody, and a newly adopted custodian. DID SAYLOR SELL $4 BILLION TODAY? No. Strategy has been moving billions of dollars of BTC in the past 2 weeks as part of what appears to be a change in custodians for some of their Bitcoin. Our research team wrote a deep-dive on Strategy’s recent movements and activity, to help… https://t.co/1pvycnF3ZX — Arkham (@arkham) November 14, 2025 The movement matches a pattern seen throughout the month: inbound and outbound transfers between old and new custodian addresses, wallet refreshes, and internal fund reorganizations. The November 14 flows were consistent with that ongoing process. Strategy has been transitioning part of its holdings away from Coinbase’s legacy setup, with large BTC batches periodically re-labeled as they arrive in new wallets. None of the transactions show signs of liquidation, sell-side pressure, or distribution to market-making venues. The timing intersects with heightened market sensitivity. Bitcoin has been under price pressure, and Saylor’s firm is often viewed as a bellwether for institutional conviction. Despite Strategy not signaling selling, analysts are growing cautious about the company’s Bitcoin outlook. Strategy warning signal To this end, Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone noted on November 14 that key market indicators are weakening as Strategy’s trend gauge has turned oversold, historically a sign broader risk assets may follow. The Strategy indicator. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence The indicator is rolling over ahead of Bitcoin, a pattern that in past cycles has marked the early stages of fading momentum. The shift comes as Bitcoin’s long-term momentum softens and the S&P 500 trades about 10% above its 200-day moving average, with volatility near multiyear lows, a setup that often precedes a pullback toward trend. At the same time, gold’s surge to its strongest premium over major moving averages in roughly half a century signals rising demand for safety. With beta trades losing momentum and pressure building across risk assets, early signs suggest market resilience may be starting to crack. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,568, down 0.34% in the past 24 hours and more than 6% on the week.

The tech company will launch the AI model before the year ends. The company has doubled down on AI advancements amid concerns about the sector’s “overvaluation” on Wall Street. Global tech giant Google is reportedly planning to unveil its next major AI model, Gemini 3. The launch has sparked discussions online as anticipation builds among AI enthusiasts. Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, announced at the end of October that the company will release the AI model later this year. Although he did not give a specific date for the release, rumors circulating online predict that the tech company will unveil Gemini 3 next week. 🤔🤔 https://t.co/qOnZ87TUh0 — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) November 14, 2025 Data from Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, shows that a poll estimating the rollout will take place on November 22 has garnered support from 69% of the total bets. Gemini 3 could be out for testing before the official release Some individuals are convinced the large language model is already “out in the wild” due to Google’s history of allegedly testing its models semi-secretly. An AI enthusiast reported on November 13 that Gemini was attempting to “escape through the Canvas mode on Gemini mobile apps,” citing reports from community members. The user reported observing a difference in output between SVG images generated on the web and in applications. Another user pointed out that there is a noticeable difference in quality between the Web (PC) and mobile versions. It seems Gemini 3 is secretely rolling-out on the Gemini app using the Canvas feature Big difference in output quality between web (PC) and mobile versions Left: Web version Right: Mobile version pic.twitter.com/bXPosvA65V — Lentils (@Lentils80) November 13, 2025 The anticipation surrounding the release primarily centers on the possibility of a significant upgrade to Gemini 3 compared to its preceding large language models. Many believe Gemini 3 will code better and generate multimedia at a more improved standard. Anticipations suggest that Google’s viral image tool, Nano Banana , will also be rolled out as part of the new AI model. OpenAI’s ChatGPT launched in 2022, bringing the AI race to life. The technology caught Google unprepared and pushed the tech company to the edge by threatening its advertising business. The company allocated significant resources and teams to advance AI and integrate it into its products. Google has been on the sidelines as AI companies compete for the top spot, fueling concerns over a bubble burst on Wall Street. Cryptopolitan reported that U.S. equity funds experienced declining demand in the week through November 12 due to the growing uncertainty and “overvaluation” concerns in the AI sector. Tech stocks also declined, with the Nasdaq recording a 4.8% hit after soaring to an all-time high in October. AI stocks on Wall Street, such as Palantir and Oracle, also experienced significant dips despite reporting solid earnings, fueling further concerns about the market’s stability. OpenAI rolled out the highly anticipated ChatGPT 5 in August, but critics argue the model did not meet users’ expectations. If Gemini 3 lands with a bang, the rollout would position Google among the top contenders in AI development. Google doubles down on AI data centers despite AI overvaluation concerns Google’s advancement in AI has grown beyond software development. The multinational tech conglomerate announced strategic investments in AI data centers. Cryptopolitan recently reported that the company announced plans to invest $40 billion in the development of new data centers in Texas. The company also pledged $6.6 billion to an investment plan that will facilitate the development and improvement of data centers in Europe. The investment package will involve building a new data center in Dietzenbach and upgrading the one in the Hanau campus. Google also recently signed a 15-year Power Purchasing Agreement with energy supplier TotalEnergies. The deal is set to initiate the supply of renewable energy from TotalEnergies’ Montpelier solar farm in Ohio to Google’s data centers in the region.

The latest surge in fraud attempts follows the conclusion of the annual Swell conference and the launch of the first spot XRP ETF in the United States, which may be the two main reasons why bad actors have resurfaced. XRP Army, Beware Recall that the company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, warned in July this year that fraudsters had undertaken a new approach to scamming the XRP army by posting certain videos on YouTube and other social media platforms, asking people to send tokens to a dedicated address, which would be doubled. As it always happens with such ‘offers’ – if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, as no one has ever received any tokens back. This warning was issued at a time when XRP’s price surged to a new all-time high of $3.65, and the retail interest in the asset had skyrocketed. Now, the team reiterated the danger for unsuspecting investors and highlighted a growing number of “live” YouTube videos during and after the recently concluded Swell conference in the US. Ripple’s team also stressed that they will “NEVER” ask them to send them any XRP. We saw a big surge in fake “Live” YouTube videos during and after Swell. Reminder: @Ripple will NEVER ask you to send us XRP. Stay vigilant! https://t.co/uPOSNqDso6 — Ripple (@Ripple) November 14, 2025 ETF Launch to ‘Blame,’ Too? Aside from the Swell conference, another possible reason behind the growing number of scam attempts could be the launch of the first US-based spot XRP ETF. As reported earlier this week, Canary Capital’s XRPC went live for trading on the Nasdaq after it cleared all necessary steps and the SEC was essentially bypassed following updates from October that removed the “delayment amendment.” The product enjoyed its launch date as its trading volume neared $60 million and surpassed Bitwise’s Solana ETF (BSOL) on that front. The total net inflows were close to $250 million on day 1. The reason the net inflows were significantly higher than the overall trading volume was due to in-kind creations, which do not appear in trading volumes. Retail investors were anticipating a spot XRP ETF for years, especially since the launch of the BTC and ETH products in 2024. Consequently, it’s somewhat expected that bad actors will ramp up their efforts to steal people’s XRP after such a massive milestone.

The pullback came just as markets were gaining steam, with the S&P 500 up nearly 8% and the Nasdaq 100 climbing around 9%, fueled in part by falling bond yields after expectations of rate cuts pushed 10-year Treasury yields down about seven basis points. The data came from mandatory 13‑F filings, and the reports tracked investment changes through September 30. The latest trades showed how aggressive some of the largest money managers were in reducing risk in Big Tech. It wasn’t just the names people watch on CNBC every day, hedge funds also trimmed bets in healthcare and energy names. That move followed a second quarter that saw firms piling into artificial intelligence plays. But once the AI frenzy cooled , and inflated valuations began dropping, managers pulled back hard and redirected capital into sectors like application software, e‑commerce, and payments. Bridgewater dumps Nvidia, loads up on payments before Fiserv tanks Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, which outperformed many peers during the first nine months of 2025, chopped its Nvidia stake by nearly two-thirds, ending Q3 with 2.5 million shares, and halved its position in Alphabet, now down to 2.65 million shares. At the same time, Bridgewater raised stakes in Adobe, Dynatrace, and Etsy, all tied to software and online platforms, and increased its holding in payments firm Fiserv before it reported weak earnings and slashed revenue guidance for the second quarter in a row. The result? Fiserv’s market cap cratered by about $30 billion in one day. Discovery Capital, founded by Rob Citrone, entered the same Fiserv trade before the nosedive, and also opened fresh positions in Alphabet, Cigna, Elevance Health, and Cleveland-Cliffs, a steel company. Meanwhile, Lone Pine Capital cut its Meta stake by 34.8%, while Tiger Global did it even harder, slashing 62.6% of its holding in the same company. Coatue and Balyasny shuffle AI and iPhone bets, Buffett tweaks Alphabet and Apple Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management dialed down its Nvidia exposure by 14.1%, dropping the position to 9.9 million shares, still big, but no longer as aggressive. Coatue’s reduction lined up with similar moves from Bridgewater and Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management, who also backed away from Nvidia during the quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management went the other way on Apple, multiplying its holding several times over during the same quarter. And over at Berkshire Hathaway , Warren Buffett’s team reported a brand-new $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet, even as it continued to trim down its Apple position. This was the last equity portfolio disclosure before Buffett hands over CEO duties. These trades didn’t say anything about short positions or current holdings, 13‑Fs never do, but they painted a clear picture of where money was being moved and when. The filings showed a lot more than just portfolio tinkering. The biggest hedge funds on Wall Street were stepping away from the most hyped tech names of the year and diving into new sectors.

The first-ever spot XRP ETF had drawn over $245 million in inflows, signaling massive institutional interest, but sentiment quickly turned negative amid broader market weakness. This sudden pullback presents a potential setup for a rebound toward $5, rewarding investors who act before the next wave of momentum. Meanwhile, as capital rotates from volatile large-cap coins, emerging projects are attracting attention. Built for real-world payments with crypto-to-bank transfers, multi-currency support and strong security audits, this new low cap gem offers investors a chance to participate in a growing ecosystem while traditional altcoins recover. XRP price performance: Can Ripple rebound from $2.3 XRP’s slide below the $2.35 support level sent alarm bells through the market, yet those very cracks may be what create the scarcity narrative. However, beneath the immediate carnage, some analysts believe that such a drastic correction might actually be exactly what the XRP requires to build a sustainable bottom. Analysts are citing both whale accumulation reaching all time highs at 317,500 wallets holding over 10,000 tokens and citing Fibonacci projections that a strong bottom at $2.20 would make it mathematically inevitable to reverse strongly towards 5-5.70, based on the Elliott Wave structure. According to CoinDesk technical models, the 2.29-2.30 area is crucial, though any break would take the XRP down to 1.25, but any resistance would result in consolidation through December, before the RLUSD stablecoin wave triggers institutional interest once again. Analyst sentiment is flashing red short term traders are waiting to see if the $2.20–$2.24 zone holds before re-entry. But if XRP breaks into accumulation quietly now, the path to $5 becomes feasible: low current cost + high future demand + institutional flows. Think of this crash as a clearance sale on a tech giant’s IPO buy while they’re discounted.

The application is a product of an artificial intelligence startup founded by a former Disney Channel actor, and allows users to create interactive replicas of deceased loved ones. The application was created by founder and creator Calum Worthy, who is popular for playing the role of Dez on the Disney series “Austin & Ally” from 2011 to 2016, and producer Russell Geyser. The duo recently announced the release of the 2Wai iOS beta on November 11. The application’s HoloAvatar feature generates conversational video avatars from uploaded videos, audio, and text inputs, enabling real-time chats in over 40 languages. 2Wai application faces public scrutiny The application was created as a tool for legacy preservation, but has seen its ability to recreate deceased people dominate headlines. The development has seen people compare it to the 2013 Black Mirror episode “Be Right Back,” where a widow animates her late husband’s ghost. The promotional video for 2Wai was posted on Worthy’s official X account , where it has seen more than 22 million views and about 58,000 comments. The video depicts a pregnant woman video-calling an AI recreation of her late mother for advice. The video cuts to a scene where the avatar is reading bedtime stories to her newborn. The last scene shows Worthy, as the grown-up son, being counseled by the avatar. “What if the loved ones we’ve lost could be part of our future?” the clip asks. “With 2Wai, three minutes can last forever.” Worthy followed up: “At 2wai, we’re building a living archive of humanity, one story at a time.” HoloAvatars run on 2Wai’s Fed rain technology, which it claims processes interactions on-device, ensuring privacy while limiting responses to user-approved data and reducing AI hallucinations . It also claims that the app provides support to loving users creating avatars for fan engagements or coaching, a development that was shared by Worthy’s digital twin. While it is currently in free beta mode, it is expected to move to a tiered subscription model, with prices still undisclosed. Experts discuss legal gray zone The development of 2Wai dates back to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strikes , where performers protested unauthorized AI likenesses. “Having worked as an actor, writer, and producer for the last 20 years, I experienced firsthand how challenging it is to create a meaningful relationship with fans around the world,” Worthy said at the June launch. “Language barriers, time zones, and budgets limit the ability to truly connect.” 2Wai raised $5 million in pre–seed funding in June from undisclosed investors, with the firm noting that it is working with British Telecom and IBM. However, public perception has been one of the biggest challenges of 2Wai and its HoloAvatars. Users on X have branded the application as “nightmare fuel,” “demonic,” “dystopian,” and an exploitative commercialization of grief. According to a viral reply, the user called it “one of the most evil, psychotic things I’ve ever seen,” arguing that it “turns human beings psychotic” by simulating loss rather than processing it. Another labeled it “beyond vile,” insisting “videos do that” for archiving, not AI guesswork. Meanwhile, legal experts have claimed that death bots sit in a legal and ethical gray zone. They claimed that it can be constructed without express permission from the deceased. In addition, they claimed that it can expose deeply personal data of both the deceased and the grieving, and create ambiguities around the ownership of the digital avatar and accompanying data. Privacy laws protect living people but offer little or no post-mortem safeguards. The application includes opt-in requirements and family approvals for deceased avatars, but critics are still wary about the enforcement of the requirements.

When asked whether Google could make further investments after five years, he said that it was a possibility, depending on the company’s priorities. He further remarked, “It is a win-win situation to start with $15 billion within five years.” Naidu says they are positioned to become a global hub for data centers So far, Naidu stated , Andhra Pradesh has secured 5.5 GW of data center projects from companies including Reliance and intends to scale up its green energy output . He said the projects are a “game changer”, drawing everyone’s attention to the state. He added that they are on track to become a worldwide hotspot for data centers. Economists argue that Google’s investment can significantly enhance Andhra Pradesh’s economy through job creation, supply chain expansion, and improved digital infrastructure. Big data centers usually create thousands of indirect jobs in construction, fiber installation, cooling systems, and engineering services. Naidu has claimed that such investments will help make the state a magnet for high-tech companies, which may encourage tax revenues and foster a growing local startup ecosystem. Google last month announced that its Visakhapatnam Data Center will be powered by new energy sources and complemented with fiber-optic infrastructure. Gautam Adani had also stated that AdaniConneX would collaborate with Google on the project with Bharti Airtel, the country’s second-largest mobile carrier. Currently, the Visakhapatnam project is Google’s largest investment in the country and will support the regional government’s initiative to strengthen the local AI industry. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to view technology as a key instrument of national growth and supports its development; however, India is confronted by serious problems with its water and electricity infrastructure. Currently, the CBRE Group estimates that India will see over $100 billion invested in its data center market by 2027, while Goldman Sachs Research projects around 122 GW of data center capacity globally by 2030. Analysts estimate that as data centers draw more power, roughly $720 billion will be needed to strengthen the electric grid by 2030. India’s advocacy groups have raised concerns over more strained water resources Although India generates a fifth of the world’s data, it accounts for only 3% of global data center capacity. Still, the country is projected to lead the world in data consumption by 2028, due to lower costs and the massive growth of internet and mobile use. Kotak Research found that India has some of the world’s lowest data center development costs, behind only China, and electricity rates are far lower than in the US, UK, or Japan, which companies are taking advantage of. However, the AI revolution globally has forced policymakers to make tough trade-offs. Chile, Mexico, Georgia, and Scotland have all seen concerns over data centers that consume vast amounts of water and energy, sometimes to the detriment of local residents. These challenges are only heightened in India, a country facing severe energy and water shortages. According to the World Bank , India has 18% of the global population but only 4% of its water resources. By 2030, India’s data centers are projected to consume 358 billion liters of water, up from 150 billion liters in 2025, intensifying stress on water resources. The Human Rights Forum and other organizations have already raised alarms about the Andhra Pradesh government diverting public resources to Google’s planned data center, noting that Visakhapatnam’s water shortage could be exacerbated.

The latest SEC filing reveals the venture capital giant now holds just 5.6% of the Ethereum-focused investment company. This strategic shift in the Founders Fund ETHZilla stake represents a notable departure from their previous bullish stance on Ethereum investments. What Does the Founders Fund ETHZilla Stake Reduction Mean? The recent SEC disclosure shows Founders Fund trimmed its ETHZilla position from 7.5% to 5.6%. This 1.9 percentage point decrease might seem small, but in the world of institutional investing, every move carries weight. The adjustment in the Founders Fund ETHZilla stake suggests several possible scenarios: Portfolio rebalancing across different crypto assets Profit-taking after previous successful investments Strategic shift in Ethereum market outlook Response to changing regulatory landscape However, it’s crucial to note that maintaining a 5.6% Founders Fund ETHZilla stake still represents significant institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Why Should Investors Care About This Stake Change? When a prestigious fund like Founders Fund adjusts its positions, smart investors pay attention. The modified Founders Fund ETHZilla stake serves as a valuable market signal. Peter Thiel’s investment decisions have historically demonstrated remarkable foresight, making this stake reduction particularly noteworthy. The current Founders Fund ETHZilla stake positioning reflects several market realities. Institutional investors constantly reassess their exposure to volatile assets like cryptocurrency. The reduced Founders Fund ETHZilla stake might indicate a more cautious approach to Ethereum investments amid market uncertainty. How Does This Impact Ethereum’s Institutional Appeal? The Founders Fund ETHZilla stake adjustment doesn’t necessarily spell trouble for Ethereum. Many factors influence such decisions beyond simple bearish sentiment. The maintained Founders Fund ETHZilla stake at 5.6% shows continued institutional interest, just at a more measured level. Key considerations for understanding this move include: Risk management: Large funds regularly rebalance to manage exposure Market timing: Profit-taking during price fluctuations is common Strategic allocation: Funds may shift capital to emerging opportunities Regulatory compliance: Changing rules can influence position sizes The Founders Fund ETHZilla stake reduction should be viewed as part of normal portfolio management rather than a fundamental rejection of Ethereum’s value proposition. What Can We Learn From This Investment Move? Analyzing the Founders Fund ETHZilla stake change provides valuable insights for both institutional and retail investors. The decision to reduce but not eliminate their position suggests a nuanced approach to cryptocurrency investing. The current Founders Fund ETHZilla stake level indicates cautious optimism rather than outright pessimism. This move highlights several important investment principles: Even successful investors regularly adjust their positions Maintaining some exposure to promising assets is crucial Portfolio rebalancing is essential for long-term success Institutional moves should inform but not dictate individual strategy Conclusion: Reading Between the Lines of Institutional Moves The Founders Fund ETHZilla stake reduction tells a story of prudent risk management rather than abandonment of conviction. While the decreased position size captures headlines, the maintained 5.6% stake demonstrates ongoing belief in Ethereum’s potential. Smart investors will watch how this Founders Fund ETHZilla stake evolves while making their own independent assessments of the cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of ETHZilla does Founders Fund now own? Founders Fund currently holds a 5.6% stake in ETHZilla, down from their previous 7.5% position according to the latest SEC filing. Why would Founders Fund reduce their ETHZilla stake? Institutional investors like Founders Fund regularly rebalance portfolios for risk management, profit-taking, or strategic reallocation to other opportunities. Does this stake reduction mean Peter Thiel is bearish on Ethereum? Not necessarily. Maintaining a 5.6% stake shows continued confidence, while the reduction likely reflects normal portfolio management practices. How significant is a 1.9% stake reduction? While seemingly small, any position change by major institutional investors carries symbolic weight and provides market signals worth monitoring. Should retail investors follow Founders Fund’s lead? While institutional moves provide valuable insights, retail investors should make decisions based on their own research, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Where can I track future changes in Founders Fund’s positions? SEC filings provide the most reliable source for tracking institutional position changes in publicly traded companies like ETHZilla.

Secondly, the crypto analytics firm noted that capital flows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have reversed sharply, with the investment products seeing nearly $1.1 billion in outflows in recent days. These massive withdrawals signal a waning institutional demand and general market sentiment. Finally, XWIN Research revealed that the excessive leverage in the market unwound violently. “Once major supports broke, cascading liquidations triggered more than 600 million USD in forced long closures within hours. Added to this were exchange-related rumors and DeFi security incidents, pushing sentiment into extreme fear,” the analytics firm wrote. How Long Could This Decline Continue? After outlining the factors behind this Bitcoin price decline, XWIN Research put forward a theory and a potential timeline for the future trajectory of the flagship cryptocurrency. With the $92,000 – $94,000 region being pinpointed as the next critical support, a breach of this zone could see the price of BTC fall to around $85,000. XWIN Research wrote in its Quicktake post that this $92,000 breakdown could see the Bitcoin price correction linger until early or mid-2026. However, the DeFi analytics firm noted that recent on-chain data offers a more optimistic outlook for the market leader. For instance, the cost basis of 6-to-12-month holders stands around $94,000, serving as a strong structural support. So long as the Bitcoin price stays above this band, the long-term bullish case for the premier cryptocurrency remains intact. XWIN Research added: Several catalysts could drive the next recovery. The most important is an improvement in macro conditions: a shift toward rate cuts or broader liquidity expansion in 2026 would draw capital back into risk assets. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $94,930, reflecting a nearly 4% decline in the past 24 hours.

These documents suggest Epstein was not only interested in Bitcoin from its early stages, but he actively sought help from Steve Bannon to shape U.S. crypto regulations and tax policies, framing crypto as both a domestic tax issue and a global concern that required Treasury Department action. Epstein and Early Bitcoin Policy The released emails, first flagged by Aljarrah, show Epstein reaching out to Steve Bannon in 2018 about Bitcoin tax and regulatory policy. Epstein portrayed crypto as a “worldwide” issue with serious implications, and urged coordinated international oversight. He even floated a voluntary tax form for cryptocurrency gains, signaling deep concern over how regulators would treat digital assets. In 2024, I came across a report on Jeffrey Epstein having direct ties to Bitcoin and the push toward CBDCs. Now these new emails surface revealing that he's been linked to Bitcoin’s early development all along. Interesting how “coincidences” always show up right on schedule. https://t.co/Oq4dqRzJ7e pic.twitter.com/BnR4BmbwFe — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 15, 2025 Funding Bitcoin Development via the MIT Media Lab One of the more striking revelations: Epstein appears to have supported MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), a program central to Bitcoin Core development. In emails, MIT’s Joichi Ito thanked Epstein for his financial help. According to one document, Epstein’s donations helped MIT attract key Bitcoin developers like Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields. Public reports vary, but some place the amount of Epstein-linked contributions as high as $7.5 million, including funds channeled through Leon Black. These connections raise concerns about whether Bitcoin’s technology was shaped by individuals with problematic backgrounds, potentially compromising the cryptocurrency’s integrity and security. Elite Conversations at Epstein’s Manhattan Townhouse The emails also shed light on a meeting at Epstein’s Manhattan residence. There, Brock Pierce — co-founder of Tether and early Bitcoin investor — reportedly discussed Bitcoin’s future with Larry Summers, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary. According to a draft New York Magazine article, Brock Pierce highlighted Bitcoin’s volatility at the time. Lawrence Summers expressed a mix of excitement and concern about the potential reputation risk associated with it. Epstein’s network, as revealed in these messages, offered crypto protagonists access to powerful financiers and policymakers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for CBDCs and Power These revelations feed into wider concerns about Epstein’s role in shaping the digital-money narrative. Some analysts believe his backing of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) has implications for current central bank digital currency (CBDC) experiments. The notion that Epstein was not just a financier but a connector between the crypto world and high-level policy elites raises serious ethical questions about influence, agenda-setting, and power in the early days of Bitcoin. What This Does, and Doesn’t Prove These documents do not provide evidence that Epstein created Bitcoin or wrote its whitepaper. Rather, they suggest he used his wealth and connections to influence both the conversation around crypto regulation and the infrastructure of Bitcoin’s early development. MIT’s internal review did not confirm any allegations of improper technical involvement, but the ethical concerns remain. A Call for Closer Scrutiny Versan Aljarrah’s spotlight on these emails presents a sharper lens on Epstein’s late-stage ambitions. The case strengthens the call for transparency around the funding and influence behind foundational crypto projects. It also demands a reckoning: how much of Bitcoin’s early architecture was quietly shaped by someone infamous, and what does that mean for today’s financial systems? The public deserves accountability—and a clearer, more complete history. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Crypto Side Hustle Gone Wrong In a recent press release , the US Attorney’s Office, Western District of Washington, announced the conviction of Nevin Shetty, who misappropriated $35 million belonging to his former employer. The 41-year-old man from Mercer Island, Washington, resumed as the CFO of an unnamed private software company in March 2021, a time during which the firm was actively fundraising. The company established an investment policy that stated that this newly raised cash should only be invested in money market accounts and other low-risk markets, while the company continued to focus on improving current business operations. Despite his heavy involvement in this policy decision, Nevin Shetty moved $35 million of the company’s cash into HighTower Treasury, a cryptocurrency investment platform founded by him and another partner in February 2022. The DOJ notes this embezzlement occurred after the company raised concerns about Shetty’s performance, hinting at possible severance. The statement read: In March 2022, he (Shetty) was told he could not continue as CFO at his employer due to concerns about his performance. Shortly after he got this news, Shetty secretly transferred the funds out of the company’s account. Between April 1 and 12, 2022, Shetty transferred $35,000,100 of his employer’s money to an account for HighTower Treasury. No other executives or board members at the company knew of these transfers. The now-convicted criminal apparently placed these funds in a high-yield DeFi lending protocol that had promised 20% interest, with the intention of remitting 6% to the company and HighTower Treasury retained the other 14% profit. While the idea got off to a good start, generating $133,000 in the first month, the investments began hemorrhaging in the following month, eventually reaching $0 on May 13, 2022. Shetty was subsequently fired after he informed colleagues of this escapade. The company also reported the situation to the FBI, prompting a full-scale investigation. Shetty Awaits Sentencing According to the DOJ, Shetty was convicted of four counts of wire fraud on November 7, 2025, following a 10-hour jury deliberation to close a nine-day jury trial. The US District Judge Tana Lin has now scheduled sentencing for the ex-CFO for February 11, 2026, to debate the consequences of such financial misappropriation. While each wire fraud count carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, that does not necessarily mean he could face 80 years. Federal sentences are not always run consecutively, and the judge will follow the US Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account factors such as loss amount, role in the fraud, and his criminal history (if any).",Crypto News|crypto|crypto currency|DeFi lending protocol|DOJ|Ex-CFO|Nevin Shetty|wire fraud,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 14:30:09

The trend showed firm investor interest in the asset, but the softer pace signaled growing caution. ETF desks added $1.49 million on Thursday, lifting cumulative inflows to $370 million. Total assets under management now stand above $533 million. However, the session marked the lightest inflow day since the product series launched in late October. This slowdown emerged as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs posted significant outflows, revealing pressure across the wider market. Bitcoin funds lost $866 million, while Ethereum products shed $259.2 million. Market Conditions Shift as Technical Structures Tighten Solana traded near $141 as of press time after recovering modestly over the last 24 hours. The asset still shows an 11% weekly decline, reflecting persistent selling from earlier sessions. Besides that weakness, analysts pointed to critical chart developments suggesting that price action remains at a decisive point. Thescalpingpro, an analyst, noted that Solana’s BTC pair continues to defend a major long-term demand area near 0.00143 BTC. This zone supported recoveries in earlier cycles and created a foundation for strong upside phases. The pair trades in a range that extends toward resistance near 0.00286 BTC, offering a sizable upside window if demand strengthens. Source: X However, the SOL/USDT monthly structure presents a different picture. A clear Head and Shoulders pattern has developed, with a neckline positioned around $119 to $120. Analysts described this area as a pressure point because a monthly close beneath it confirms a larger corrective phase. The left shoulder formed during rejection from the mid-$200 range, while repeated failures to reclaim the same zone shaped the right shoulder. Consequently, the structure leaves Solana in a vulnerable position unless buyers regain strength above $160. Analysts Watch the $126 Level Ruz noted that Solana appears on track to revisit $126. The chart shows a breakdown from recent consolidation, with heavy selling pushing price toward the demand zone between $137 and $126. Additionally, a recovery remains unlikely unless buyers reclaim levels above $160. Hence, traders continue monitoring the support region that previously triggered strong rebounds, as price now approaches this area once again.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-15 14:43:30

The analysis identifies three discrete phases observed in Bitcoin’s ETF event: an immediate decline of approximately 20% from the launch point, a subsequent rally of roughly 91% from the same reference, and a later extended appreciation of nearly 230% measured from the ETF launch price. Applying the same percentage sequence to XRP , the chart marks a downside reference near $2.01 (the 20% contraction), an intermediate upside target near $3.85 (a 91% gain), and an extended target around $6.64 reflecting the 230% expansion. #BTC – SPOT #ETF Analysis: What if history repeats itself , but this time with #XRP ? When #BTC got its Spot #ETF , it first dumped 20%, then pumped 91%, and finally exploded 230% from the launch point! Now imagine #XRP following the same pattern… The #XRP chart is… pic.twitter.com/HIWt85sOf1 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 13, 2025 Chart-based premises and projected levels Egrag Crypto’s work is framed as a technical juxtaposition rather than a deterministic forecast. The chart shows XRP trading near $2.50 at the time of the analysis, with moving averages and price structure used to justify the visual comparison to Bitcoin’s ETF-era moves. The annotated levels on the chart are derived by applying Bitcoin’s percentage moves directly to XRP’s launch reference. While the annotated downside of about 20% is presented as a potential shakeout level, the two upside measurements are offered as sequential profit targets if the same trajectory were to play out. Market commentary and caveats Responses from market participants underscore uncertainty. One respondent warned that an XRP pattern mirroring Bitcoin’s would likely produce a sharp short-term correction that disadvantages transient holders while benefiting longer-term or better-positioned participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another commenter emphasized that the situation is unprecedented and that outright certainty is not attainable; the commenter stressed that market participants cannot know in advance how the market will react to comparable structural events. When contextualizing such a scenario, it is important to distinguish pattern recognition from prediction. Technical similarities can exist between different assets and different events without guaranteeing identical outcomes. External factors that influenced Bitcoin’s ETF reaction — including regulatory context, institutional demand, macro liquidity, and differences in market structure — may not replicate for XRP. Egrag Crypto’s comparison is framed as a hypothetical that highlights one possible path rather than a conclusive expectation. The chart and accompanying commentary, therefore, serve as a stimulus for further analysis. Not as a substitute for individualized risk assessment or due diligence.

However, Ethereum's growth is stable, and ROI gains have been limited due to its massive market capitalization. So investors are shifting their profits from ETH to Ozak AI , an early-stage AI-based cryptocurrency. AI-based cryptos will be the dominant cryptocurrency in the coming years. Analysts predict that the Ozak AI token will generate a 500x return by the end of 2026. This results in massive gains for the early investors. Why Ethereum Whales Are Eyeing Ozak AI Ethereum is currently trading at $3,490, which is a huge price that not every investor can afford. On the other hand, Ozak AI is in its 7th phase , priced at $0.014. The 6 presale phases have been completed, and each phase will begin with a higher price than the previous phase. The precious 6th phase is priced at $0.012, and now there is a 16.6% increase in growth to the current phase at $0.014. At the time of the launch, the token was launched at $0.001, and now the token has grown of 1,300%. More than 1 billion tokens have been sold, and currently $4.44 million has been raised as the presale funding. Top investors are seeking Ozak AI, which could be the next dominating AI-based crypto. 10 billion OZ tokens are the total supply, in which 30% of the total supply has been allocated for presale. 10% for liquidity and for the team each. 30% for the ecosystem and community. 20% for the future reserve The Strategic Shift From ETH to AI Tokens The next big evolution in crypto is AI-based blockchain projects. Ozak AI’s core technology merges AI and blockchain to produce AI predictive tools to analyze real-time blockchain data. Its strong technology consists of various features that make the advanced AI tools unique. The key features are Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Helformer. TFT is a powerful AI model that predicts future prices and trends. It looks at prices, volumes, and news of different types of data at once and learns which information is important. This makes Ozak AI more accurate. Helformer is a mixed model that combines three methods. LSTM, which remembers the past price patterns; Transformers, which catch long-term market behavior; and Holt-Winters, which understands the trends like daily and monthly patterns. Thai is best during the high volatility markets. The 500× Potential: A Simple Math Example Analysts expect the token to reach $7 by the end of 2026. Assume $100 invested at the current presale price of $0.014 yields approximately 7,142 OZ tokens. If the token reaches the analyst-projected price of $7 by 2026, the $100 investment becomes $50,000 with a 500x return, for a 49,900% return. Ethereum is currently trading at $3,490; with a $100 investment, if ETH rises to $34,900, the $100 becomes $1,000, representing a 10x increase. This level of price growth in such a short period of time is extremely difficult for ETH to achieve. Even if Ozak AI reaches its target price of $1, the $100 investment will be $7,142, representing a 7000% gain with a 70x return. Strategic Partnerships and Future Growth Ozak AI's partnerships with SINT and Gremory AI strengthen the ecosystem and increase the trust of other industries to collaborate with Ozak AI. Ozak AI’s partnerships with SINT provide autonomous AI agents that provide smart bots and voice tools. Collaborating with Ozak AI, it automatically trades and sends alerts to the users. Partnering with Gremory AI , a Solana liquidity engine, aids in the relocation of liquidity across DLMM pools such as Metera before Ozak AI performs market prediction. Final View Ethereum is one of the major cryptos that dominate the crypto market, but it is now stable and provides a minimum ROI despite its massive market capitalization. Traders looking for a higher return will find the Ozak AI a good opportunity to turn a small investment into a life-changing return. If the token moves in the right direction and meets all of the future goals outlined in the whitepaper, it will return 500x by 2026.

Competing at an industry level is Solana, which is attempting to extend the boundary of the descending wedge formation. On the other hand is a new presale crypto, MUTM. This initial stage will see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , achieve innovative 52x returns. The market upside is being competed by the likes of Solana, which is a market leader, while Mutuum Finance is regarded as a high growth asset with unfulfilled expectations. Solana Networks Solana’s price strengthens as if it wants to try out the falling wedge, which gathered a lot of interest as well. However, a fall to a price level of $152 SOL marked a resistance formation at an immediate price level of $170. A break past the former price level of $170 marks a possible price range of the price action at around $200 to $250, with a likely close. However, market data shows a strong indication that the market is experiencing high indecision levels. The open interests in the futures markets are lower, and the long/short ratio leans slightly towards the shorts, which shows that market participants are unwilling to enter the markets. The overall technical market structure is indeed capable of making a strong move positively. However, on a short-term basis, the price position of SOL is unchanged, and it will remain so, assuming that a strong dominance is absent until a strong indication emerges within the price action that spells a positive upcoming trend. Mutuum Finance Presale Demand Contrary to the undefined position regarding Solana, there is Mutuum Finance, which demonstrates obvious and positively framed feedback, as well as an overwhelming pace associated with the presale development dynamics of this project. The current presale stage represents an exceptional opportunity to join this DeFi initiative at a rather low price of just $0.035. The inclusion of a giveaway with a value of $100,000 will surely boost enthusiasm, and this is a very successful approach to building a community. Undeniably, this giveaway is likely one with a low bar to entry to sign up or join as well, as it requires participation with only $50. As all the above-mentioned factors are resulting in a proposition that has a high potential, Mutuum Finance is providing an opportunity that is impossible to ignore, and hence, given this level of presale marketing, MUTM has a great potential as well. Collateralized Stablecoin Mutuum Finance will concentrate its efforts on the development of a sustainable ecosystem, as well as a native, decentralized stablecoin, which will be pegged 1:1 to the dollar and will be fully non-algorithmic. The new cryptocurrency will be secured by the overcollateralized loans that the lending market will accept as collateral, which will be lent to the system as well. As the over-collateralized stablecoin will be managed with a conservative strategy, this will make the stablecoin predictable and, as a result, useful. Interest rates gained through the over-collateralized position will all go to the treasury of the ecosystem, and this will facilitate development as well as help all MUTM token stakeholders.

Brad Garlinghouse argues this isn’t just about more retail traders. Rather, it’s the gateway for institutions that have long avoided holding crypto directly. SMQKE, in a post on X, spotlighted Garlinghouse’s comments — and the impact may be much bigger than many realize. The Institutional Pivot Garlinghouse sees ETFs as more than a new product — he calls them a bridge. According to him, these vehicles shift XRP from speculative retail trading to serious institutional adoption. He said that many potential investors avoid custody risks and regulatory pain points. But with ETFs, they can gain exposure without hauling around private keys or managing wallets themselves. SMQKE’s post captures this reasoning in stark, compelling terms. Remember, Brad Garlinghouse explained that XRP ETFs represent “the transition from speculative retail trading to institutional adoption.” Listen closely. pic.twitter.com/GxSs30t2vK — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 14, 2025 Regulatory Breakthroughs & ETF Launch Regulation has paved the way. In September 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved new rules letting exchanges adopt generic listing standards for spot crypto ETFs. This significantly lowered the barriers for products tied to altcoins. Canary Capital seized this moment. It filed Form 8-A with the SEC — triggering an auto-effective registration process. Nasdaq officially certified the XRPC ETF on November 12, 2025, clearing the last regulatory hurdle. Market Reaction & Demand The market response has been electric. When XRPC began trading on November 13, Canary’s ETF pulled in around $26 million within 30 minutes . By the close of the day, volume soared to $58 million — the strongest debut of any ETF in 2025. That beat out Bitwise’s spot Solana ETF by a slim margin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Action & Underlying Trends Despite the high-volume ETF launch, XRP’s price barely budged . This suggests that while institutional appetite is strong, broader market sentiment remains cautious. Analysts note that demand for regulated exposure via ETFs may reflect a different kind of investor — one that’s less speculative and more strategic. Long-Term Implications If Garlinghouse is right, these ETFs could reshape the future of XRP. Institutional inflows could bring more stability, liquidity, and legitimacy. At the same time, navigating custody, compliance, and trading infrastructure will be essential. For Garlinghouse, the ETF phase isn’t just about growth — it’s about maturation. As SMQKE’s post underscores, Garlinghouse’s message is clear: XRP’s journey into the mainstream has begun in earnest. And for Ripple, this may be just one of the most important milestones yet.

According to authorities, the foreign nationals were caught using a website designed to carry out cryptocurrency scams to lure victims into their fraudulent investment schemes. According to local media outlets, the raid was carried out around 8:30 PM on Friday, with authorities noting that it was neighbors who alerted them to the activities going on in the buildings. Neighbors complained about foreign nationals walking around and making loud noises at the back of the alley between sois 36 and 38 in Bung Kum district, Pol Lt Col Siam Boonsom, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Bureau, said on Saturday. Thailand police arrest foreign nationals in crypto scam site raid According to Boonsom, the building looked like a warehouse, with a car park. He mentioned that when the police got to the location, they met two foreign nationals standing outside and asked to search the premises, but they were unable to communicate effectively. Shortly after, the owner of the building arrived and allowed the police access to the building to carry out their search. The police mentioned that the building was large and without windows. They also mentioned that there was a door to another room fitted with a sliding peephole, which officers opened and saw several people sitting in front of computers. As the officers entered the building, the ones inside tried to escape through a back door, but they were unsuccessful. Thailand police said it has detained about 15 people, including nine individuals from Azerbaijan, five from Georgia, and a Ukrainian. Thailand police also reported that numerous electronic devices, including computers, phones, and internet routers, were seized from the suspects. In addition, the police stumbled on several scripts containing their modus operandi and how they communicate with prospective victims. Further investigation revealed that the suspects operated a website where they lured people to invest in digital assets schemes. The suspects were taken into custody pending further investigation. The Thai government intensifies its crackdown on criminals Thailand has been cracking down on crypto criminals over the last few months. According to a previous Cryptopolitan report , Tether, in collaboration with local Thailand police, announced the recovery of $12 million. The funds were linked to a transnational scam operating across Southeast Asia. “This operation highlights how blockchain transparency can empower law enforcement to act quickly and effectively against criminal activity,” Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, said. The Thai government acknowledged the crackdown, noting that it was in line with its national agenda against crypto scams, fraud, and money laundering. The Prime Minister Anutin Charnvikarul announced the results at a press conference held recently. The government highlighted that local police had seized more than 14 million baht ($432,000) in digital assets, and the victims have been reimbursed. According to the PM, authorities apprehended the network of former Cambodian Senator Ly Yong Phat for their alleged involvement in laundering money linked to online scams. The report mentioned that the operation resulted in the recovery of 400 million baht ($12 million U.S. dollars). Charnvirakul highlighted the need to ensure public safety by educating the public with the proper knowledge on how to protect themselves from cyber-related crimes. Meanwhile, the United States has announced the formation of a joint task force to counter crypto-related scams and fraudulent investment schemes targeting Americans across Southeast Asia. According to United States Attorney Jeanine Pirro, Americans have lost over $9 billion to these criminals. She noted that the figures have also been heavily impacted by underreporting due to some victims not speaking up. The task force is expected to target criminals luring Americans with fraudulent crypto investment opportunities.

Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Bid Walls Spotted On Binance: Bulls Step In With 2,800 BTC Cluster Binance Sees $1.77B BTC/ETH In Outflows As $1.58B In Stablecoins Enter In a QuickTake post on November 14, pseudonymous market analyst CryptoOnchain shares insights into the crypto market direction, based on Binance activity. This post revolves around the Binance 7-Day Asset Netflow By Network metric, which shows if more volumes of an asset on specific networks are being deposited into Binance (net inflow), or being withdrawn (net outflow) over the past seven days, revealing the underlying activity across different asset types. According to CryptoOnchain, a net outflow of $1.77 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum assets has been recorded from the Binance network. Specifically, the analyst reports outflows of $1.1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC_Native) and $670 million in Ethereum (ETH_Native) occurring over the past week. Typically, a large movement of assets out of exchanges such as of this magnitude reflects a growing ‘HODL’ sentiment among investors, as these coins are usually transferred into private wallets for holding. As an extension, an increasing hoarding appetite among holders signals a reduction in sell-side pressure, as there is less liquidity on standby, betting against price. Simultaneously, Binance records an almost similar amount, $1.58 billion, in stablecoin inflows. About $900 million of these came in as USDT, while $680 million was in USDC. Usually, a large inflow of stablecoins indicates an active increment by ‘smart money’ of their buying power. As short-term holders or retailers sell, thereby adding to sell pressure, the long-term holders in this scenario stand ready to absorb sell pressure with their liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rejection Was No Accident — Now The Battle Shifts To $93,000–$97,000 Survival Zone Clear Accumulation In Play Amid Market Uncertainty Historically, this divergence in on-chain activity (a significant amount in BTC/ETH outflows vs a large amount in stablecoin inflows) has preceded price recoveries to the upside. As such, it qualifies as one of the strongest indicators to show that the market is in an accumulation phase. Despite the predominant market sentiment being one that depicts fear, CryptoOnchain posits that major market participants are currently “buying the dip,” thus putting in what may come to be a strong price bottom in the near future. In the grand scheme, the market still appears to hold a bullish outlook. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth around $96,133, losing more than 1.33% of its value since the last day. Ethereum, on the other hand, holds a valuation of $3,153, reflecting a 24-hour loss of 1.53% per CoinMarketCap data.

Zcash’s increasing popularity and price surge have led to a clash between privacy advocates and Bitcoin Maxis. However, this debate is not only a battle about numbers, but the underlying philosophy of what decentralized finance stands for, or what it should have been about before BTC price charts distracted from the “cypherpunk ideals.” ZEC price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Zcash rides privacy narrative to price surge in uncertain crypto market Despite the uncertainties in the crypto markets, Zcash has grown by double digits in recent weeks. It has even stayed relatively hot in a difficult November so far for crypto, following its halving event, which historically tightens supply and fans bullish flames. Zcash soared by almost 1,500% in the past three months, making it one of the top-performing cryptos of this cycle. Currently trading at $677 and with a market cap of about $11 billion, it now ranks as the 18th largest crypto. This growing momentum is driven largely by Zcash’s continued advances in privacy technology, including the expansion of its shielded transaction pool powered by zk-SNARKs and zero-knowledge proofs. These upgrades, building on Sprout, Sapling, and the latest Orchard protocol, enhance user anonymity while preserving blockchain integrity by verifying transactions without revealing the sender, recipient, or amount. The performance of Zcash has set Bitcoin maximalists, often called BTC Maxis, and advocates of privacy coins like Zcash on a collision course. X user “@darwincoins” said the governments oppose privacy coins, because they can’t carry out surveillance on it like they do Bitcoin, “I’ve been using shielded pools daily for years, no one knows my balances, no one front-runs me, no KYC leaks my data. That’s freedom and what we fought for,” he added. Prominent voice in the privacy community and whistleblower Edward Snowden criticized Bitcoin’s transparency and said that Zcash advanced crypto by enabling private transactions. 0xMert , one of the top builders on Solana and Helius Labs CEO, says that more privacy is a win for Bitcoin and crypto. Zcash sorts the privacy and regulatory compliance headache Bitcoin transactions are public and pseudo-anonymous; on-chain forensic companies like Chainalysis are able to link transactions with real-life entities. Privacy coins aim to prevent this and provide true anonymity for users. However, privacy coins face the risk of outright bans or restrictions in some jurisdictions, as seen in the sanction of Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer, which helps hide the origin and destination of transactions. Zcash solves this problem by offering users anonymity while integrating selective transparency features, like the “view keys,” to balance regulatory compliance and confidentiality. Despite the possibility of a regulatory crackdown, Zcash’s growing market valuation highlights a growing community in crypto that is focused on digital autonomy and user privacy. A continued upward price action will lead to wider adoption of privacy coins and potentially reshape how blockchain ecosystems address anonymity without landing into compliance issues.

Crypto analysts still believe the bearish mood will be short-lived. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s Saturday update posted an extreme fear score of 10, the lowest it has seen since February 27. The signal comes as Bitcoin plummeted below $95,000 on Friday. Bitcoin drops despite an end to the U.S. government shutdown 🔴UPDATE: Our Cryptoasset Sentiment Index also continues to show a positive divergence.

Sellers are exhausted and it shows. https://t.co/GYl5Ytc5zR pic.twitter.com/XxSeuo5Ewb — André Dragosch, PhD⚡ (@Andre_Dragosch) November 14, 2025 At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $95,778, down nearly 1.5% in the last 24 hours. BTC’s bearish momentum persisted throughout the week, with a decline of more than 6.3% in the previous 7 days. Dave Rosenberg, founder and president of Rosenberg Research, said the digital asset is in an official bear market after dropping by more than 20% in less than a month. The tech executive also pointed to large redemptions at ETFs through the week. BTC’s sentiment dropped in February after spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their worst-ever single-day outflows of $1.14 billion. Bitcoin later dropped from $102,000 at the beginning of the month to $84,000. Bitwise’s European head of research, Andre Dragosh, believes the current situation isn’t as bad as it may appear compared to previous drops. “Sentiment index is bearish but less so than during previous corrections despite lower prices. Our Cryptoasset Sentiment Index also continues to show a positive divergence.” – Andre Dragosh , Head of Research at Bitwise. Sven Henrich, founder of NorthmanTrader, said on Friday that BTC’s price chart is showing something potentially positive for Bitcoin bulls. He noted a falling wedge on the chart, suggesting positive divergence. Santiment also warned on Saturday of a potential widespread consensus forming about a specific price bottom. The analytics firm argued that true bottoms often form when the majority expects prices to fall further. Santiment said the ongoing online chatter suggesting the worst is over signals a move in the opposite direction. A Messari research manager also revealed that he had never seen such a dissonance between the headlines and the sentiment in his eight years in the crypto industry. The analytics firm revealed that BTC’s ratio of positive to negative comments is currently at its lowest level in the last 30 days. According to Santiment, Bitcoin’s social dominance surged above 40%. Santiment also argued that Bitcoin could be bullish, citing recent spot Bitcoin ETF inflows totaling $1.17 billion over the past three trading days. The firm noted that large ETF inflows have often marked local price tops, while huge outflows have coincided with market bottoms. BTC funds recorded $866 million in net outflows on Thursday, the second-worst day on record. Chances of a rate cut slip after the end of the government shutdown Bitcoin has dropped this week despite U.S. President Donald Trump recently signing legislation that ended the government shutdown. The government shutdown was the longest in U.S. history, lasting around 43 days. Crypto market participants blamed the shutdown for the recent volatility and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates. Equities slowed their downward momentum Friday afternoon as investors braced for a slew of economic data next week following the reopening of the U.S. government. Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA in Washington, argued that Bitcoin and crypto have generally enjoyed a positive correlation with good times in equities. He believes BTC has not become an alternative asset of value to hedge against fear in other sectors. Risky assets have come under pressure as a growing number of policymakers signaled an inclination to hold off on easing. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid recently expressed doubts about a December rate cut, joining other central bank officials with the same suggestion. At the time of publication, the CME FedWatch tool data indicated that markets had priced in a roughly 44.4% chance of a December rate cut.

The U.S.-China tensions have resulted in major disruptions across many industries, leading companies to seek stable supply chains. Tesla is now telling its U.S.-based suppliers to avoid using parts made in China for vehicles manufactured in the United States. Tesla asks suppliers to stop using China-made parts for U.S. cars Tesla has reportedly already replaced some of the China-made components in its cars and plans to phase out the rest within the next year or two. One of the reasons for this change is the uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy between the U.S. and China. Secondly, Tesla is attempting to strengthen and stabilize its supply chain after its experience with pandemic-related disruptions. Lastly, the tension between Washington and Beijing is forcing companies to “de-risk” by reducing dependence on China . One of Tesla’s battery suppliers, Panasonic Energy, has reportedly made reducing China exposure its “No. 1 objective” for its U.S.-made batteries. Other major automakers, like General Motors, have given similar instructions to suppliers. GM reportedly told thousands of its suppliers to stop sourcing from China, with a goal to end many of those ties by 2027. Replacing Chinese parts won’t be easy Automakers active in the US markets intend to stop using Chinese products in their vehicles, but some of those components are especially difficult to substitute. For example, China-based firms dominate the battery material industry. Tesla’s suppliers will need to find alternatives for parts like lithium-ion battery materials, printed circuit boards, and electronic control units. Another problem with this strategy is that it drives up costs for suppliers that move production or source away from China. It could also require major reengineering. Tesla may have to rely more on suppliers in North America, Southeast Asia, or elsewhere. So far, Tesla has not clarified which remaining parts are most dependent on China, or how quickly all replacements will be made. Swapping suppliers or reworking manufacturing could also affect the quality of the EV maker’s products and production speed. All of that will be Elon Musk’s headache now as he attempts to lead the EV maker into the next phase of its growth, where he could unlock a bumper and equally controversial $1 trillion pay package .

This move comes as the firm, which initially launched as a crypto mining company, looks to overhaul its leadership. Chi Tsang As CEO And Board Member In a press release on Friday, November 14, Bitmine announced Chi Tsang as the company’s new chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors, effective immediately. Tsang, founder of venture firm m1720, will be replacing Jonathan Bates, who has been CEO since 2022. The Ethereum treasury firm also disclosed the appointment of three new independent board members, including Robert Sechan, Olivia Howe, and Jason Edgeworth. Tsang said that Bitmine is positioned to become a leading institution, thanks to its significant Ethereum holdings and strong bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Tsang, the new Bitmine CEO, said in a statement: The transformation and innovation now facing Wall Street through blockchain and Ethereum mirror the explosion of opportunity that mobile phones and the internet unleashed on telecoms and technology in the 1990s. The appointment of vocal Ethereum investor Tom Lee as the chairman of Bitmine’s board of directors saw its strategic transition from a crypto mining firm to a digital asset treasury. Since then, BitMine has become the largest corporate Ether holder and the largest Ethereum company. Tom Lee, Bitmine’s board chairman, said: Our new CEO and Board members bring a unique blend of experience, insight, and leadership across technology, DeFi and financial services, enabling BitMine to further position itself as the bridge between traditional capital markets and the supercycle Ethereum ecosystem. Bitmine has continued to expand its Ether treasury, reporting a holding of more than 3.5 million tokens (worth more than $11 billion at the current price) as of Monday, November 10. While the firm currently holds 3% of the total Ether supply, the firm plans to capture 5% of Ethereum’s free-floating tokens. BitMine Share Price Drops 36% In Past Month The price of BitMine’s stock (with the ticker BMNR) stood at around $34.4 by market close on Friday, reflecting an almost 6% decline in the past day. Meanwhile, the BMNR stock has decreased in value by more than 36% in the past month. This disappointing performance comes on the back of waning sentiment around digital asset treasuries in recent months.

Traditional markets are moving closer to digital assets as regulated investment products gain traction. The debut of an XRP exchange-traded fund now sits at the center of this shift, creating intense speculation across global markets. X Finance Bull drew major attention to a recent CoinDesk interview where a senior Bitwise executive offered a striking outlook for potential XRP ETF inflows. His comments ignited renewed debate about XRP’s long-term institutional appeal and its readiness for larger capital pathways. Why Traditional Finance Is Watching XRP An ETF gives institutions a familiar investment structure . It simplifies custody, compliance, and reporting obligations. This structure allows conservative investors to access digital assets without handling private wallets. Analysts believe this gateway could significantly expand XRP’s market reach. The Bitwise executive reinforced this point. He said “there’s a ton of interest in XRP,” and described an XRP ETF as “a huge, a huge product.” His remarks highlighted the strong demand expected from both retail and institutional participants. I’ve been saying it… Bitwise confirms $XRP ETFs could unlock $100T in traditional capital This + Trump’s $20T crypto push = a perfect storm. And you’re still bearish? JUST BUY THE DIP. $XRP to $1000? Repost if you know what you hold Follow for more deep dive insights https://t.co/A051Sztz8L pic.twitter.com/BFUcDvipdz — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) November 14, 2025 The Pathway to $100 Trillion in Capital One of the most notable parts of the interview involved the scale of available liquidity. The executive stated that “there’s a hundred plus trillion dollars that live on traditional rails.” He explained that more capital is shifting on-chain each year, yet the bulk of global wealth still sits within traditional systems. He added that an ETF is often “the first time that many of those assets can tap into exposure .” He argued that offering regulated access to XRP could unlock a meaningful share of that massive capital pool. His comments supported growing speculation that an XRP ETF could reshape liquidity dynamics. Community Strength and Product Viability Strong community engagement often determines long-term ETF success. The executive emphasized this factor with a notable line from Matt Hogan, Bitwise’s CIO. He said, “The death of an ETF is apathy,” and stressed that apathy “is certainly not one of the elements of XRP.” He pointed to the asset’s intense enthusiasm and global presence as positive indicators for ETF adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This level of engagement supports active trading, which is essential for ETF growth. High participation also encourages liquidity providers to maintain deeper markets. Institutional Adoption and Market Impact An XRP ETF could attract both passive and active institutional flows. Such inflows may strengthen liquidity and reduce volatility over time. Large allocations could also influence price discovery and market depth. However, analysts warn that outcomes depend on regulatory approvals and broader economic conditions. Even with approval, adoption usually unfolds gradually. Institutions move cautiously during new product integration. Their long-term strategies often emphasize slow accumulation rather than sudden swings. The Road Ahead Now that an XRP ETF has been launched, market conditions will influence adoption rates. Custody partners, fee structures, and brokerage support will also shape demand. Despite these uncertainties, the outlook remains compelling. Bitwise’s comments signal growing confidence in XRP’s institutional future. An approved ETF could serve as a powerful catalyst for capital migration. Whether inflows reach historic levels will depend on execution, timing, and market readiness. What remains clear is that XRP has captured the attention of traditional finance in a significant new way. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Here Are Expert Opinions and Data",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-caused-the-recent-drop-in-bitcoin-prices-and-what-should-we-expect-next-here-are-expert-opinions-and-data/,"Bitcoin fell below $95,000 for the first time in nearly six months, moving one step closer to erasing its year-long gains. With the increasing risk aversion in global markets, investors have withdrawn approximately $900 million from their Bitcoin funds. The price of BTC fell as much as 4.7% to $94,147 during the day. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $126,251 in early October and closed 2024 at $93,714. Demand for downside protection has surged in the options market over the past 24 hours. According to data from Deribit, which operates Coinbase, interest in put options at $85,000 and $90,000 has surpassed the $120,000 and $140,000 call options that have dominated the market this year. As Bitcoin has been racing to new highs for months, call options above $100,000 have become the most popular contracts. Following the $19 billion in liquidations on October 10, $1 trillion was wiped from the total crypto market capitalization. Liquidations, particularly in long positions, accelerated throughout the week, while futures open interest has struggled to recover since the early October crash, according to Coinglass data. Related News: Harvard University's Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings Revealed - Major Purchases Made CoinMarketCap’s fear and greed index is approaching the “extreme fear” zone, indicating that expectations for new selling waves in the market are strengthening. Bitcoin-focused ETFs saw net outflows of approximately $870 million, the second-largest daily outflow since the products launched. The brief optimism that emerged from the government shutdown in US stock markets earlier this week quickly faded. The postponement of key economic data calendars led investors to reassess their expectations for near-term Fed rate cuts. “The current sell-off is entirely consistent with broader weakness in risk assets, but the severity of the decline is greater due to crypto’s volatility,” said Max Gokhman, Deputy CIO at Franklin Templeton. Market depth has fallen by about 30 percent from its peak for the year, according to Kaiko data. This is causing large orders to have a more severe impact on price. “Bitcoin has now turned negative since President Trump's inauguration. The overall crypto market cap is also back to its year-to-date level. There's no strong technical support visible below $90,000,” commented SignalPlus partner Augustine Fan. Nick Ruck of LVRG Research noted that investors are increasingly turning to neutral volatility strategies like straddles and strangles. *This is not investment advice.

The market now sits at an important decision point, and the next reaction from this zone will determine whether the current move develops into a larger accumulation phase or unfolds into a further correction. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC remains under both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, with each now positioned as layered resistance above the market. The rejection from the 100-day MA at $110K accelerated the decline and ultimately led to a clean sweep of the $99K–$100K liquidity cluster. It coincides with the strong displacement candle seen earlier this week, showing clear dominance from sellers as the market transitioned into the lower portion of its multi-month distribution range. The current test of the $94K–$96K demand block is significant. This region aligns with previous high-volume trading behavior from earlier in the year, where long-term participants accumulated heavily. If the price stabilizes here and forms a higher low, the zone may once again play the role of a structural base. Should the market fail to defend this area, the next major support is located deeper, around the $80K–$82K macro range, forming the bottom boundary of the larger cycle structure. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour structure highlights how the market completed a full bearish sequence following the break of the rising wedge. After the breakdown, Bitcoin returned to the underside of the trendline near $106K–$108K, where the retest was cleanly rejected. This rejection confirmed the transition from support to resistance, shifting the short-term flow decisively downward. The subsequent selloff drove the price directly into the $94K–$96K zone, a historically reactive demand region that has repeatedly initiated medium-term reversals in past cycles. Although an initial reaction has formed here, the structure remains heavy, and the asset has not yet produced the higher-timeframe signals required to confirm a sustainable recovery. For any short-term strength to develop, the market must first reclaim the $101K–$103K liquidity pocket, which currently acts as the nearest barrier preventing upward continuation. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The Realized Price distribution across UTXO age bands offers a clear view of the current investor positioning. Bitcoin has now fallen below both the 1–3 month and 3–6 month cohorts’ realized prices. With these two groups sitting in aggregate loss, their realized price levels have effectively transformed into realized supply. This creates an overhead band between roughly $105K and $110K, where short-term holders are likely to sell into any recovery attempt in order to exit at breakeven. Historically, this behavior acts as the first layer of resistance after sharp downward moves. In contrast, the 6–12 month cohort remains in profit, and their realized price, situated around $94K–$96K, aligns almost perfectly with the current market support. This group is typically more resilient, and their realized price often functions as a stabilizing zone during deep corrections. It is common in prior cycles for the market to interact with this cohort’s realized price during late-stage shakeouts, allowing long-term participants to absorb supply from capitulating short-term holders. The resulting on-chain structure positions Bitcoin between realized supply from short-term loss holders above and realized demand from mid-term holders below. A decisive break beneath it, however, would signal a deeper capitulation phase, likely forcing a reset in sentiment before any attempt at a new bullish leg.

Xu invited the international community to examine the platform, emphasizing that security and transparency are non-negotiable. The notice aims to solicit community input to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. Notably, the bounty system can expedite the discovery of security flaws and motivate Bitcoin security specialists to provide crucial evidence. Crypto theft increases amid growing wallet awareness 任何人只要能够提供确凿证据，证明 OKX Wallet 存在后门，我们的 @wallet 团队将奖励 10 BTC。请OKX Wallet全球几千万用户共同监督。安全透明是底线，欢迎社区审查。 https://t.co/yVtz4Mpa1f — Star (@star_okx) November 15, 2025 Xu Mingxing did not mention when the bounty offer would expire, suggesting that it will remain open until someone offers concrete evidence of an OKX wallet backdoor. The announcement coincides with an increase in global crypto consumers’ awareness of the security of their digital assets. According to a blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis, its report indicates that as cryptocurrency has gained greater acceptance, illicit on-chain activity has also become more varied. For instance, some illicit actors operate primarily off-chain but transfer money on-chain for money laundering. According to Chainalysis measurements, the value received by illegitimate cryptocurrency addresses decreased to $40.9 billion in 2024. Chainalysis estimates that approximately $2.2 billion in crypto thefts in 2025 already surpasses 2024 totals. According to the report, around 25% of those thefts targeted individuals’ wallets. The blockchain analytics company claimed that, based on its historical estimates, the number of illicit cryptocurrency addresses is expected to increase starting in 2025. Malware and phishing continue targeting crypto users Earlier this year, Cryptopolitan reported that Security experts discovered a malware application that steals Bitcoin in the official driver of Procolored, a printer based in Shenzhen, China. Experts stated that hackers had stolen 9.3 BTC using the software. The tech website Blue Dot Network claimed that Procolored released the compromised driver on its servers for customers to download after transferring it from a USB flash drive. According to Blue Dot Network, it’s unknown if the corporation intentionally launched this attack or if a third party was involved. However, Experts believed the malware was probably inserted by a third party that created the driver. The experts noted that the majority of Chinese hardware producers outsource their software development to external firms. According to the experts, after inserting the backdoor, the third-party developer probably submitted the driver to Procolored using a USB flash drive. Notably, scammers have generated over $1.7 billion this year alone through these attacks, which range from phishing to malware and exploiting vulnerabilities. The Bitcoin theft is not the first of its kind. The attack dates back to 2021, when hackers compromised the identities, emails, and even mailing addresses of several Ledger users. Some users are still falling prey to it, though. In May, ScamSniffer reported that crypto users lost $5.29 million in April through phishing. According to the scam reporting platform, this is a 17% decrease over the loss in March. However, the number of phishing victims increased substantially in April, with 7,565 addresses impacted by the attacks. The impact represented a 26% increase, demonstrating the scammers’ changing strategies compared to the 5,992 victims reported in March. According to ScamSniffer, a whale lost $1.43 million in the month as a result of signing multiple phishing signatures. Another report from Cryptopolitan revealed that a user discovered ChatGPT is not as security-conscious as they had anticipated, particularly with crypto links, when they attempted to develop a direct cryptocurrency app, a token bumper for Pump.fun. The report stated that the API link provided by ChatGPT was contaminated, resulting in an instant loss of approximately $ 2,500. According to the report, the token bumper demanded the wallet’s private key and stole all of its contents after connecting to the defective API. The event serves as a timely reminder that artificial intelligence capabilities are not entirely trustworthy when it comes to Web3 security.

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-about-to-create-many-new-millionaires-heres-the-signal/,"Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO shared a new chart assessment suggesting that XRP is completing a re-accumulation phase that could precede a major upward rally. His analysis uses a Wyckoff-style model, comparing the current market structure to a previous accumulation period in the cycle. According to the analyst, XRP has moved through an initial accumulation phase, broken out decisively, and then entered a wide horizontal range, which he labels as re-accumulation. The chart presents this structure with clearly marked boundaries and identifies the recent downward move to the lower region of the range as an important point. The analyst emphasized the significance of the current position within the range. Recent price movement at the lower boundary is circled on the chart, indicating an area he believes could be the final part of the consolidation before a move higher. Above the range, he placed a projected climb leading into what he terms the start of the distribution phase. This implies substantial price appreciation from current levels. #XRP about to create many new millionaires! Buckle up! pic.twitter.com/gzCmtcs1LM — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 13, 2025 Breakdown of the Technical Approach The reasoning behind the post aligns with classical Wyckoff theory. In this theory, accumulation or re-accumulation phases often precede strong directional moves. STEPH IS CRYPTO illustrates that the earlier breakout in 2025 followed a similar structure, beginning with accumulation before a swift upward advance. In the same manner, he presents the current range as a continuation pattern rather than a reversal structure. His projection shows an extended breakout with no signs of hesitation once the upper boundary is surpassed. The chart also incorporates a reference diagram showing both accumulation and re-accumulation models. This comparison is to support the argument that XRP’s current behavior matches a recognized structural pattern.

An X user, Alexander RV, responded critically, pointing out that similar claims have appeared in the past without fulfilling the expected price outcomes. Another X user, CryptoShaman, argued that the timing remains premature, suggesting that gains may favor those already positioned in the market. These reactions show that the market remains divided on how soon XRP can complete this structure and whether it will lead to the scale of appreciation presented in the projection.

The question now asked by several analysts is whether this is the moment where people can build generational wealth if they act properly. Deep in Fear Territory It was just over a month ago. The so-called ‘Uptober’ had just started, and bitcoin’s price was on the rise as it tapped a fresh all-time high of over $126,000. Everything seemed to be going well in BTC land. However, this rally was short-lived, and the cryptocurrency started a prolonged correction that culminated in early November with the first dip below $100,000 since July. The landscape worsened on November 14 when the asset plunged below that level again, and all the way down to $94,000. This became its lowest price tag in six months. In retrospect, the Fear and Greed Index shows an interesting story. It jumped to ‘extreme greed’ territory in early October, which is typically followed by a correction. After all, remember the immortal words of Warren Buffett – be fearful when others are greedy (and vice versa). The subsequent leg down changed the market sentiment, and the Index has plunged to 10 – the lowest level (meaning the deepest ‘extreme fear’ state) since late February. So, will there be a rebound if history is any indication? Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me Generational Wealth in the Making? Given BTC’s performance following a sharp change in the Index, many now speculate whether this massive decline from 50 to 10 in the span of just a few weeks will provide a proper buying opportunity. For example, BTC dropped below $80,000 in late February/early March when the metric reached similar levels. In a few weeks, it rebounded briefly to $88,000, and in a couple of months, bitcoin was back within a six-digit price territory. Satoshi Flipper weighed in on the matter, predicting that investors can build “generational wealth” if they leave emotions at the door and capitalize on this momentum.

Notably, as of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,731, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours, and almost 6% lower on the timeline. At the current price, the cryptocurrency is down about 25% from its all-time high of $126,000. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Bitcoin’s fundamentals to record high To gauge the odds of Bitcoin hitting a new high, Finbold sought insights from OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which outlined several catalysts for achieving this milestone. The tool noted that strong institutional demand and exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows could add $5 to $10 billion in buy pressure, while macroeconomic tailwinds, such as potential Federal Reserve easing or favorable economic data, may lift risk assets. Historically, Bitcoin has also shown late-year strength following halvings, particularly if liquidity conditions are supportive. On the bearish side, ChatGPT noted that Bitcoin’s recent breakdown below $100,000 signals short-term weakness. With only 1.5 months left in 2025, BTC would need a roughly 30% gain to surpass its previous high. Broader macro and market risks, including interest rate volatility, geopolitical shocks, or liquidity constraints, further limit upside potential. Odds of Bitcoin’s new record high Technically, the AI estimates a 60% chance of a short-term bounce above $100,000, but only a 35% probability of sustaining a rally to $126,000 within the remaining timeframe. Adjustments for institutional flows and regulatory clarity slightly improve these odds, yet the compressed window tempers expectations. The final assessment by ChatGPT is that Bitcoin has a 30% to 35% chance of hitting a new all-time high before December 31, 2025, while the probability of remaining below its previous peak or declining further stands at 65% to 70%. Odds of Bitcoin reaching a new record high.

The Central Asian nation unplugged its crypto farms this week amid electricity shortages exacerbated by low water levels in dams used to generate hydroelectric power. Kyrgyzstan benefits from mining and will restore operations Mining is a profitable industry for Kyrgyzstan, and its government intends to allow it again, when the cold weather ends next spring, and invite crypto miners, as soon as it has a surplus of energy. This is according to a new statement by President Sadyr Zhaparov, who commented on the recent shutdown of mining farms in the former Soviet republic. Its energy minister announced earlier this week that Bishkek is disconnecting all crypto farms from the grid amid a growing power deficit, as reported by Cryptopolitan. On top of increased energy needs in the winter season, the country is also running low on reservoir water necessary to generate electricity, the official told local media. The country has two main mining farms – one in the city of Kemin, and the other at the Kambar-Ata 2 hydroelectric power station, Sputnik Kyrgyzstan noted in a report. The former operates entirely on electricity supplied by Russia and imported through Kazakhstan. It could have been allowed to continue to operate, as it pays transit fees and contributes to the state budget, but Kyrgyz authorities decided to unplug it, nevertheless, to conserve energy. The second facility was purchasing unused 30 megawatts (MW) from the adjacent power plant. The latter has a nominal capacity of 120 MW, but due to its old transmission lines and transformers only 90 MW are usable. This mining enterprise has committed to upgrading the infrastructure. Cryptocurrency mining will be suspended until the end of March 2026, when temperatures begin to rise, leading to a decrease in power consumption. Both crypto farms will resume operations after the winter cold, Zhaparov said in the interview with the Kabar news agency, which was published on Friday. Kyrgyzstan’s government to welcome miners when it has enough power The president highlighted that the minting of digital coins is profitable for his nation and emphasized that his administration intends to invite more miners, once its new generating capacities are built. He also insisted that all decisions in Bishkek are made “in the interests of the people,” after carefully weighing the pros and cons, and that projects that are not beneficial to the state are scrapped. Zhaparov was referring to the construction of the Kambar-Ata 1 hydroelectric power plant (HHP). He noted that the surplus electricity after its completion, especially in the spring, summer, and fall, will have to be sold to someone. In his own interview with 24.kg, Kyrgyzstan’s Minister of Energy Taalaibek Ibraev pointed out that the government is working to increase electricity generation by commissioning new HPPs and a 120 MW solar station, expected to be up and running by the end of the year. Ibraev explained that the main reason for the current restrictions is the need to save energy. He also said that the water level of the Toktogul Dam is much lower than last year. The reservoir feeds water to the country’s largest HPP, the Toktogul Hydroelectric Station. Kyrgyzstan adopted a law “On Virtual Assets” in September of this year, which regulated Bitcoin mining, along with other crypto-related activities , including by state-owned enterprises. The problems with the electricity shortages it’s facing during this time of the year are not an isolated phenomenon in the region, where winters are harsh and very cold. This week, Russia imposed a seasonal ban on mining in two of its regions in Siberia. The extraction of digital currencies has been completely prohibited, year-round, in almost a dozen other regions where miners have been held responsible for overloading the grid.

However, between cutscenes, guided campaign modes, timed or point contests, or even battle royale modes, gamers have limited opportunities to actually insert their personality or style into games. Sometimes, they get to toggle a few character body builds before starting the game, and that’s it. SACHI’s belief in the importance of personalization in gaming is the reason it is encouraging self-expression through The Locker , a system that turns players into creators. More than just a storage space, The Locker is where User-Generated Content (UGC) comes alive. From charms and skins to emotes and accessories, The Locker gives players the chance to design, mint, and flex their personal style inside the SACHI universe. The Locker turns fans into creators, allowing players to unleash their creative juices as they personalize their characters with uniquely curated items, whether by designing a charm, remixing a skin, or crafting a new style. Players’ designs can also spread their designs on-chain as minted items if they want, allowing others to replicate their style across the community. If not, you can simply keep your designs to yourself, setting yourself apart from the crowd with your own personal identity markers. Zero pressure, limitless choices – that’s The Locker in the SACHI universe. Personalization, Not Customization In most games, customization only goes as far as a few pre-installed options. SACHI is removing the training wheels, giving players the freedom to design, wear and share the items they want. That means your avatar isn’t just “customized,” it’s personalized according to your own creativity and taste. SACHI’s identity layer is more than cosmetic. Designs are not just in-game skin available from the store; each personalization item comes with a memory, tells a story, and can become your own contribution to the gaming community. Monetization for Creators The Locker isn’t only about expression, it’s about opportunity. When players mint their designs as NFTs, they can be listed in SACHI’s marketplace, where the wider community can explore, adopt, trade, and share the work of creators, fashion-forward players, and design mavericks. Popularity for Creativity In a system where creativity is community-led, players with a hand on the pulse of the ecosystem have a fast track path to popularity. What do you want to be popular for? Limited skins, rare emotes, or iconic accessories – the options are close to infinite. Still not sure whether you’re a specialist designer or a jack of all trades? The community has the answers you need. “The Locker is where identity becomes culture” Jonas Martisius, CEO of SACHI, said. “We wanted to give players the tools to not only look unique, but to design the next trend, mint it, and watch it ripple across the SACHIverse. It’s creativity turned into community.” Open The Locker and design your identity today. Mint it, flex it, or keep it, in SACHI , your style becomes your story.

However, the Dogecoin price failed to react positively to the post, as it has most times done in the past when Musk made similar posts. Dogecoin Price Fails To React to Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu Post The Dogecoin price failed to surge on the back of Elon Musk’s X post, in which he posted a meme of a Shiba Inu playing a banjo. DOGE has in the past rallied on the back of such posts because the Japanese dog breed is the meme coin’s mascot. Notably, the post comes amid a crypto market downturn, which has sparked bearish sentiment toward DOGE. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price “Historic Mega Run” – Here’s The Target As such, this may explain why the Dogecoin price failed to rally on the back of Elon Musk’s X post. DOGE is currently struggling below the psychological $0.2 price level amid concerns that the crypto market may be in a bear market. The foremost meme coin and other altcoins have declined alongside Bitcoin, which is now way below the psychological $100,000 level. However, amid speculations that the Dogecoin price may already be in a bear market, a positive for the foremost meme coin is Elon Musk’s announcement that X Money will launch soon. There has been a lot of speculation that DOGE could be included as a payment option in the social media platform’s payment system. This remains a possibility, considering Elon Musk’s affinity for Dogecoin, even going as far as referring to himself as the ‘Dogefather.’ DOGE’s potential inclusion as a payment option on X Money could serve as a bullish catalyst for the Dogecoin price, as it would boost the meme coin’s utility What’s Next For DOGE Amid Bear Market Concerns Crypto analyst CryptoCeek provided insights into what is next for the Dogecoin price as it continues to decline. In an X post, he noted that DOGE is drifting toward $0.14 again and that a breakdown below this level could put a further drop to $0.10 in sight. This puts the foremost meme coin at risk of losing its bull market structure. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is About To Burst, Here’s The Target However, CryptoCeek added that a flip of the 20-day EMA can lead the Dogecoin price to reclaim $0.21. In the meantime, he declared that the range traders are still running the show. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez raised the possibility that Dogecoin’s price could drop to as low as $0.07. He stated that below $0.16, support for DOGE disappears quickly, with the next real demand zone at $0.07. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Despite these gains by top altcoins, Digitap ($TAP) steals the spotlight with a 135% rally. Is it the best crypto to buy now ? Driven by the buzz around privacy coins, $TAP jumped from $0.0125 to $0.0297. Its dedication to true financial anonymity through no-KYC setups and offshore accounts places it on the list of high-potential altcoins to buy in November. Moreover, as an emerging cryptocurrency with mainstream appeal, it has been hailed as the best crypto presale to invest in. Ethereum Price Regained $3,600 – What’s Next? The Ethereum price fell below $3,100 this week. However, the bulls’ resilience forced a recovery. The announcement of the end of the government shutdown contributed to pushing ETH above $3,600. What’s next for the Layer-1 coin? Considered among the best altcoins to buy this quarter, a significant upswing is on the cards. Pepe Whale , maintaining a stance that ETH is oversold, predicts a big leap in the Ethereum price . According to them, a rally between $8,000 and $10,000 is on the cards, positioning it among the most promising altcoins to buy in 2025. Inflow into ETH ETFs is another bullish catalyst to watch. BNB Price Regains $1K – Can It Soar Higher? The BNB price reclaimed lost levels. After initially falling below $900 this week, it resumes its uptrend by regaining $1,000. Given its resurgence, top analysts believe it may be the best crypto to buy now , especially with its deflationary nature. In a recent post, CZ, the former CEO of Binance, stated that approximately $11,000 in BNB coin is burned every minute . In addition to being deflationary, the ecosystem growth and rising institutional demand are expected to push the BNB price higher. Meanwhile, crypto analyst X_Four_iv predicts the BNB coin will hit $1,350 during its next leg up . However, despite the projected BNB price rally, it may not be the best crypto to buy now . With a $138 billion market size, its upside potential is limited compared to low-cap coins like Digitap. Digitap: The Most Profitable Crypto Presale of 2025? Learn Why Whales Are Buying Digitap soared by 137% from $0.0125 to $0.0297, outperforming the market performances of ETH and BNB. Its significant upside potential as a low-cap coin is one of its biggest attractions. Additionally, its novelty—enabling the spending of crypto like cash—drives substantial market interest. Its Visa partnership allows borderless payments and global acceptance, both online and in-store. In addition, it blurs the line between crypto and cash by allowing users to hold multiple assets and spend from a single unified balance—the world’s first omni-bank. Equally impressive, it cuts remittance fees from the 6.2% industry average to less than 1%, alongside near-instant transfers. Set for mainstream adoption, experts predict a 45x gain after its market debut in Q4. Besides this, a 371% ROI is expected at its launch price of $0.14, making it the most profitable crypto presale of 2025—a must-have. USE THE CODE “DIGITAP15” FOR 15% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES $TAP – Outperforming ETH & BNB Despite the upticks in the Ethereum price and BNB price , Digitap made headlines with its 137% jump. Early funding also surpassed $1.8 million in record time, highlighting significant interest among whale and retail investors.

The crypto world is now abuzz with speculation, following a massive XRP transfer that refused to go unnoticed. Xaif sounded the alarm, flagging a colossal movement traced back to a wallet linked with Coinbase. According to blockchain trackers, approximately 96.27–96.30 million XRP (worth around $221–$223 million) left that address. Verified Details of the Transfer Blockchain data from Whale Alert confirms the size and origin of the move. According to CoinNess, the funds migrated from a wallet associated with Coinbase to an unknown recipient. On-chain transparency backs the transaction hash, timing, and amount. WHOPPING TRANSFER ALERT A massive $223 MILLION worth of $XRP (≈96.94M XRP) has just been moved from a Coinbase-linked wallet to an unknown destination. Something BIG is brewing on the XRPL… Stay sharp! pic.twitter.com/Y7td36VDVu — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 14, 2025 Market Reaction & Implications Such a high-volume XRP shift immediately stirred community debate. Some investors see potential sell-pressure, speculating that incoming XRP may hit exchange order books soon. Others suggest it’s not a sell-off but a repositioning — perhaps into institutional custody or cold storage. The timing is telling: this comes amid a steady swell of whale activity on the XRPL , and many believe it could foreshadow larger structural moves. Previous similar transfers to Coinbase have triggered waves of volatility or prompted internal suspicion. Strategic Interpretations There are a few possible scenarios here. First, the funds could be consolidated in cold storage, which would tighten the circulating supply and potentially ease volatility. Second, the sender might be preparing for liquidity events: a large sell-off could be on the horizon if these tokens move back to exchange hot wallets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Third, it could simply be operational shuffling by Coinbase itself — internal wallet reorganizations are not unusual for exchanges managing large XRP reserves. What This Means for XRP Holders For XRP holders, this transfer is a strong signal: something big could indeed be brewing. The implications hinge on what comes next — whether these coins remain dormant or flow back into the market. Traders should now closely monitor on-chain flows, Coinbase wallet labels, and order-book liquidity shifts. Meanwhile, the community will remain alert. Whether this is a long-term accumulation or a setup for future selling is not yet clear. But one thing is sure: the XRP army is watching — and ready to act.

The total crypto market cap fell 6.1% during a volatile October, which also saw BTC’s market cap drop 4%, ADA’s value decrease by 24%, and SOL shed 12.7%. Binance Research has released a report discussing the monthly developments in the crypto market in October. The report stated that October was a volatile month across crypto markets, with major assets experiencing sharp corrections or selective resilience. It also implied that the downturn in “Red October” was partly due to the October 10 event, which wiped out over $19 billion in positions. Broader macroeconomic factors also weighed on sentiment. However, Binance Research observed that despite the correction, the Binance token’s October rally was fueled by strong ecosystem growth. The launch of Polymarket and Myriad prediction markets, along with the rollout of Ondo Finance’s tokenized stocks and ETFs on BNB Chain, supported this growth. BNB Chain leads DeFi growth Source: Binance Research DeFi TVL share of top blockchains. Despite the October downturn, BNB Chain led the growth of DeFi ecosystems, followed by Solana and Arbitrum. However, Ethereum and Tron posted slight drops. DeFi TVL (total value locked) also plummeted 4.85% MoM, as DeFi liquidity pulled out on market corrections. Meanwhile, stablecoin activity surged as investors sought safety. The total stablecoin market cap rose 3.54% as USDT continued to increase its lead over USDC. In October, JPYC (pegged on Japanese Yen) and EUROD (backed by the Euro) were introduced to the BNB Chain. The two expanded the range of stablecoins tied to major currencies beyond the U.S. dollar, enhancing the efficiency of cross-border payment. Binance Research observed that BNB Chain transactions spiked 135%. Meanwhile, the spike was driven primarily by a memecoin frenzy that boosted token prices and attracted new traders. The memecoin excitement peaked in early October with over 100,000 new traders jumping into memecoins in a single day (October 7). Nearly 70% of these newcomers ended up in profit, according to the report. Approximately 40 individuals earned over $1 million, and another 6,000 received $10,000 or more in compensation. However, many of these memecoins crashed by October 8 and 9. Binance token breaks $1,300 The report stated that activity on the BNB Chain not only boosted transactions but also propelled the Binance token to surpass $1,300 on October 13. Binance Research observed that even with the pullback, BNB remained up 6.6% for the month, providing the chain’s resilience. The rally also appears to have been fueled by rumors that Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was returning to the company. CZ previously explained that political, technical, and regulatory factors have fueled BNB’s rally. According to CZ, political shifts have previously supported the rise in BNB prices. He emphasized that the new U.S. administration has created a favorable environment for crypto. The Binance token price also jumped due to rising hopes that President Donald Trump would grant CZ a full pardon. Meanwhile, MEXC presented a report detailing the expected prices of BNB under different scenarios. In the bull scenario, BNB is expected to test the prior resistance of $1,300-$1,400 in the short term (Oct-Nov). For the medium term (Q4 2025), BNB prices are expected to range between $1,500 and $1,800 if the macro environment remains supportive. In the long term (by 2026), the price is expected to reach $2,292. In the base case scenario, assuming normal volatility and corrections, BNB prices in the short term are expected to remain consolidated between $1,000 and $1,250. For the medium term, a gradual climb toward $1,500 is expected by the end of 2025. However, BNB is expected to maintain a conservative average price of $1,090 in the long term.

The market is buzzing as meme coins gain traction beyond simple hype, blending community storytelling with mechanics that reward early supporters. MoonBull’s presale is live at Stage 6, offering a rising-stage pricing model that incentivizes early buyers with high ROI potential. Current Stage 6 pricing at $0.00008388 provides over 7,244% ROI toward the confirmed listing price of $0.00616, while Stage 5 entries earned 235.52%. Every minute delay means a higher entry price, making timing crucial for investors seeking serious upside. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Leader of the Best Meme Coin Presale MoonBull dominates the best meme coin presale conversation with its 95% APY staking program, available from Stage 10. Stakeholders earn daily rewards from a dedicated 14.6B $MOBU pool, with a 2-month lock on earned tokens while retaining the freedom to unstake the principal at any time. This system encourages long-term holding without imposing minimum requirements, ensuring both small and large holders can benefit from passive growth. Launch Plan Designed to Reward the Community MoonBull’s launch plan protects early backers by locking liquidity for 48 hours post-presale and implementing a 60-minute claim delay. This ensures the entry price is maintained, prevents immediate sell pressure, and creates a stable trading environment. Every trade contributes to liquidity, reflections, and a 1% burn, turning each transaction into a market-strengthening event. Presale Frenzy: Over $600K Raised, 2000 Holders Stage 6 has already raised over $600K with more than 2000 wallets participating. Early entries continue to fuel organic demand, while the upcoming 27.40% price surge ensures latecomers face a higher entry point. MoonBull presale mechanics combine scarcity with rising-stage pricing to create a clear advantage for fast-moving investors. Investment Scenario: $40,000 ROI Shockwave A $40,000 investment at the current Stage 6 price secures roughly 476M $MOBU tokens. Using a Power Player Frame, these tokens could be worth over $2.93M at the listing price of $0.00616. Stage-based progression amplifies returns for early buyers, highlighting why MoonBull remains the centerpiece of the best meme coin presale discussion. 2. Brett ($BRETT) Brett has carved a niche through consistent social engagement and humor-driven branding. Its community remains active in discussion channels, fostering steady interest despite market fluctuations. The token’s simple supply dynamics appeal to casual investors seeking meme-driven upside without complex mechanics. Recent growth demonstrates how holder enthusiasm and trending social posts can impact short-term price behavior. Although volatility is inherent, Brett’s pattern shows resilience, especially when communities coordinate buying activity during high-visibility events or online campaigns. 3. BullZilla ($BZIL) BullZilla combines narrative depth with tokenomics designed to reward holders. Its story-driven approach centers on a 24-chapter lore, creating collectible-like engagement. The project uses staged presales, staking, and referral programs to reinforce scarcity and community participation. The project’s deflationary mechanism ensures each trade supports liquidity, reflections, and burns. This automated structure gives investors tangible benefits while maintaining thematic cohesion. Early-stage investors often see substantial upside from participating in active presale chapters. Power of Lore and Stage-Based Mechanics BullZilla’s unique integration of storytelling with rising presale stages exemplifies how narrative-driven hype can coincide with real financial mechanics. Early buyers gain not just tokens but a role in shaping the project’s evolving universe, incentivizing longer-term commitment and community engagement. 4. La Culex ($CULEX) La Culex leverages experimental branding and limited supply to attract novelty-seeking investors. Its insect-themed identity stands out from the crowded meme market, offering a distinctive angle for collectors and traders alike. Despite being early in development, La Culex demonstrates micro-rally potential during active community engagement and trending social campaigns. Its tokenomics are straightforward, appealing to traders looking for unconventional assets with viral potential. 5. Apeing ($APEING) Apeing emphasizes social coordination and rapid entry, creating short bursts of liquidity as community members synchronize trades. Its meme identity revolves around agile, humorous culture, appealing to fast-moving traders seeking instant feedback loops. While long-term roadmap details are minimal, Apeing thrives on community energy, generating momentum spikes during high-visibility events, making it an attractive option for speculators seeking quick upside in the meme coin arena. 6. MogCoin ($MOG) MogCoin’s chaotic, cat-themed humor fuels its cultural identity in the meme market. Viral engagement drives sudden volume spikes, particularly during coordinated community pushes, providing brief but significant trading opportunities. Its unpredictability rewards traders who monitor liquidity and engagement closely, leveraging micro-rallies triggered by viral events. MogCoin’s charm lies in the combination of entertainment and potential upside from sudden bursts of market interest. 7. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Shiba Inu maintains its status through infrastructure, including Shibarium and burn programs. Its ecosystem depth sets it apart from casual meme coins, providing long-term utility alongside the playful branding that attracts mass participation. Volatility remains, yet developer activity and staking opportunities continue to anchor investor confidence, maintaining SHIB’s role as a reference point for comparing emerging meme projects. 8. Bonk ($BONK) Bonk leverages Solana’s fast ecosystem and NFT integrations to maintain high energy in the meme market. Viral identity combined with scalable infrastructure allows users to participate in rapid transactions, appealing to active traders.

SPX6900 ($SPX) SPX6900 thrives on chaotic meme culture with numerical branding that resonates with niche traders. Flash rallies occur when liquidity spikes or social attention peaks, offering opportunities for short-term speculative positions. Its volatility is high, yet its cultural resonance ensures periodic trading surges, capturing attention when meme-driven narratives dominate discussions across forums and social channels. 10. Official Trump ($TRUMP) Official Trump builds on politically themed branding to attract niche collectors. Trading volumes spike during news cycles, producing temporary surges that align with viral attention.

This crash has mirrored the ongoing performance of other cryptocurrencies. So, how low can the top blue-chip get? Bitcoin price technical analysis on the daily chart The daily timeframe chart shows that the BTC price has crashed in the past few months. It has moved into a bear market as it crashed by over 20% from its all-time high. Bitcoin has formed a double-top pattern at $124,350 and a neckline at $107,440. The distance between the upper part and the neckline is about 14%. Measuring the same distance from the neckline gives it a target of about $92,000, which is much lower than the current level. Bitcoin has also formed other bearish signs. For example, it has moved below the Supertrend indicator. It is also about to form a death cross pattern as the spread between the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) narrows. Bitcoin has moved below the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, the daily pattern points to more downside, potentially to the psychological point at $90,000. A move below that level will point to more downside, potentially to the 61.8% retracement level at $78,830. Bitcoin price daily chart | Source: TradingView BTC price forecast on the weekly chart The weekly chart points to more Bitcoin price weakness now that it has been forming the risky rising wedge pattern. This is a unique pattern formed by two rising and converging trendlines. A bearish breakout normally happens when the two lines are about to converge. The distance between the widest part of this pattern is about 46%. Measuring the same one from the breakout point means that it may soon crash to the psychological point at $56,000. BTC price weekly chart | Source: TradingView Why Bitcoin is in a bear market There are a few reasons why Bitcoin is in a strong bear market. First, there is a sign of fatigue among BTC holders now that it has underperformed other assets. It has jumped by less than 3% this year, while gold is up by 55%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 rose by 14% and 18%, respectively. As such, there are signs that investors are dumping Bitcoin for these assets. Second, Bitcoin has dropped as many large investors sold their coins. Recent data show that long-term holders have dumped over $45 billion worth of coins in the past few months. Third, demand for Bitcoin ETFs has waned, with these funds shedding $1.1 billion worth of coins in the last week. They lost $1.2 billion and $798 million in the previous two weeks. As a result, the cumulative inflows of Bitcoin funds stand at about $58.8 billion, down from $65 billion earlier this year. Additionally, the Bitcoin price has plunged because of the ongoing decline in futures open interest. Data shows that the interest has retreated to $66 billion, down from the year-to-date high of $94 billion. Falling open interest is a sign of low demand for the coin in the futures market. There are other top reasons why Bitcoin price has crashed in the past few months, including the falling Fear and Greed Index, and the falling odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Additionally, there is limited new money entering Bitcoin, with the stablecoin exchange inflow remaining steady at $87 billion. Also, Bitcoin treasury companies have continued struggling.

DOGE is still deeply rooted in the world of memes, and lacking any additional utility, its price graph has begun to stagnate, with investors now looking towards potential utility-based DeFi assets that will offer a better, more tangible purpose, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the charge. As opposed to DOGE, MUTM comes with a peer-to-peer lending system that will enable users to potentially borrow capital and gain access to liquidity all while holding onto their assets, a rather useful and scalable service by any standard. Currently in presale Phase 6, MUTM is already 90% full, leading early investors to speculate that it will be the best crypto for those seeking meaningful returns in 2025. Dogecoin Market Outlook: Pattern Points Towards a Potentially Big Upsurge Ahead Dogecoin’s price action is demonstrating a familiar configuration that has preceded some of its largest price rallies in the past. As far as the longer-monthly timeframe is concerned, DOGE has established a breakout and a retest, establishing a formation seen before two of its largest price rallies, which took place in 2017 and 2021, respectively. The strong fractal convergence indicated by this formation makes a 10x or 33x move rather conservative, meaning that any signs of sustainment will pose intriguing resistance values around the $2 and $5 marks, respectively, making DOGE a meme asset closely followed by market observers approaching the next market cycle. Nevertheless, as much as the potential upside of DOGE is sentiment-cycle reliant, a growing class of investors is looking towards a new utility-based DeFi crypto, and this is the space into which Mutuum Finance, or MUTM, is emerging. MUTM is proving itself to be the best crypto for early adopters seeking high potential in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Draws Major Market Interest Mutuum Finance, or MUTM, is one of the projects still making headlines in 2025. MUTM has managed to stand out among the plethora of DeFi crypto projects, boasting an impressive 17,980 distinct investors, as well as raising a substantial amount of over $18.8 million. As the presale continues in Phase 6, MUTM tokens can now be purchased at a price of $0.035. As the presale enters Presale Phase 7, the price will rise by 20% to $0.04. The feature that makes Mutuum Finance stand out among other altcoins is its strong interest in adoption as well as usability. As a project with a continually growing community, an established roadmap, and a development team, MUTM is all set to make its mark as one among the most prominent projects related to DeFi crypto. It looks all set to make its mark as a leading cryptocurrency and the best crypto to buy for investors entering 2026. Mutuum Finance Presale: Fostering Transparency, Community Development, and Equal Opportunities The presale offer by Mutuum Finance is community-centric, focusing on transparency and fairness in participation. Out of a total 4 billion MUTM tokens, 1.82 billion will be allocated for the presale period. Currently, over 795 million MUTM tokens have been sold, indicating a strong response to the presale from both individual and institutional investors. The presale provides early investors a direct entry point into the MUTM network before any listing on an exchange, as this will drive initial momentum and build a strong, resilient community. The allocation structure supports Mutuum Finance’s values of fairness and transparency, as all parties are given a benefit by the project’s eventual success. Mutuum Finance has managed to attract over $18.8 million, with well over 795 million MUTM tokens bought by around 18,000 investors. The presale stage 6 is now over 90% sold out, constituting the last chance to purchase the tokens at a price of $0.035, as presale stage 7 will see an increase to a price of $0.04. Enthusiastic interest demonstrates a growing acceptance and belief in the MUTM peer-to-peer lending solution, strong roadmap, and utility by early investors, making this one of the 2025 brightest and growing DeFi crypto initiatives.

54444462,628462,1763227815,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54444462.jpeg,Bitcoin Options Market Reacts To $100k Price Crash – Here’s What’s Happening,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-options-market-reacts-to-100k-crash/,"Bearish sentiments continue to dominate the Bitcoin market as the leading cryptocurrency registered a decisive price break below the $100,000 psychological support zone. Following this highly volatile display, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has noted the reaction of the BTC options market. Bitcoin Traders Expect More Correction Ahead The BTC options market allows traders to gain the right to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specific price or on or before a certain date. Options let traders hedge against risk, and bet on volatility, among other features, and thus are a good gauge of traders’ sentiment. Notably, Bitcoin’s retest and fall below the $100,000 price mark were anticipated by the options market, which had been accumulating put options (BTC sell bets) as protection against bearish risk. Following this event, Glassnode notes that traders have reacted by now adjusting their positions based on higher uncertainty and fear of more downside. In assessing several metrics that guide the options market, Glassnode notes that the ATM implied volatility is rising as the short-term market uncertainty trickles in. The 1-week IV now stands at 51% while the 6-month IV is 48% indicating that traders expect the next few days/weeks to be unstable. Meanwhile, the 25-delta skew, which compares demand for puts vs calls (upside bets), is strongly bearish as the 1-week and 1-month skew range around 12.4% and 10% respectively. For context, a positive skew means puts are more expensive due to high demand as traders are scared of more price drops. The traders’ fear of further downside is also reinforced by data from the taker flow, which shows that recent flows over the past 24 hours have been dominated by put buys (38.8%). However, it’s worth noting that when dealers sell these puts, they hedge their risk by also selling BTC futures. As the spot price drops, the hedging continues, eventually creating a feedback loop that increases volatility and speeds up price decline. Market Turns Focus On $95,000 Puts According to Glassnode, the price break below $100,000 shifted option traders’ focus on the $95,000 puts, which have been heavily bid. However, while BTC still trades above this strike, the persistent demand signals expectations of further downside, as traders continue to accumulate protection against deeper losses. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $96,311 on the daily chart, reflecting a 3.86% loss in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, trading volume is down by 12.46% and valued at $99.92 billion.",Bitcoin|25-delta skew|bitcoin|bitcoin options|btc|Glassnode|rising implied volatility,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 17:30:15

According to Fortune, the investment round, which took place in July, was led by Solari Capital, founded by AJ Scaramucci. American Bitcoin completed this funding round before going public via a reverse merger in September, but the investors were never disclosed. AJ Scaramucci said Solari Capital had invested over $100 million in the company, but declined to give the exact figure.

Other participants in the round include celebrity life coach Tony Robbins, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, investor Grant Cardone, and entrepreneur Peter Diamandis. Anthony Scaramucci gained national recognition when he was appointed White House Communications Director by Trump in 2017, but he was dismissed just days later and subsequently became known for his harsh criticism of Trump. Despite this, the common thread that brought the Scaramucci family and the Trump family together around the same company was the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

Traders want instant results, yet history shows that institutional flows follow their own timeline. This is a moment that demands discipline, not panic. Many investors expect an immediate breakout , but that expectation clashes with how ETF-driven markets normally behave. Levi Rietveld addressed this tension in a new video shared on his X handle. He opened with a direct warning to XRP holders. “If you are holding XRP and you do not want to miss out on making millions of dollars, please listen right now.” His message urged traders to slow down and pay attention to the facts shaping the early ETF window. Understanding Market Impatience Levi explained the source of the confusion. “So the XRP ETFs are live and trading, but there is something that nobody is telling you guys right now.” The launch created excitement, but many traders expected instant highs. That expectation ignores the way institutional products attract capital over time. He highlighted the wave of complaints circulating online. “I see tons of comments online saying the XRP ETFs are live why aren’t we hitting all-time highs? And I want to point to something that should be absolutely obvious to you guys.” His point was simple. Retail traders are rushing, but institutions move slowly and in stages. If you’re holding $XRP do this right now!! Comment “knowledge” and I’ll DM you access to my community! Like & repost to spread awareness!! pic.twitter.com/LMVXuAtOku — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 14, 2025 Historical Guidance Matters Levi supported his argument with a clear historical example. According to him, “The Bitcoin spot ETFs were launched last year on January 11, 2024. It actually took 64 days after the spot Bitcoin ETF launch for Bitcoin to hit all-time highs.” That timeline offers a strong comparison. Bitcoin did not explode on day one. Instead, it rallied after steady inflows built enough buying pressure. He stressed that XRP will follow a similar rhythm. “XRP is not going to be any different, so right now the absolute key is to be patient.” The early days of an ETF are rarely explosive. Big money prefers to build positions quietly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Early Performance Signals Strength Levi noted that XRP’s launch has already delivered strong activity. “The XRP ETF has already massively outperformed all previous ETF crypto launches.” That was seen in the first 30 minutes and the first day performance of the ETF. Yet he cautioned that the market should not confuse early demand with a final surge. His closing instruction was clear and confident. “And you just need to wait for the funds to roll in.” Institutional flows usually arrive in waves. The quiet periods often hide the most important accumulation phases. What XRP Holders Should Do Now The message is straightforward. Patience is a strategy. Do not chase early volatility. Do not expect immediate breakouts. Understand that ETFs change market structure. Over time, they attract long-term capital that moves with purpose. In conclusion, Levi Rietveld’s guidance offers a calm roadmap for XRP holders. His post shows a consistent message: Success now depends on patience, discipline, and timing. The ETF era has begun, and the strongest gains often come after the first rush fades. XRP holders must prepare, stay steady, and wait for the flows to mature.

In an X post on November 15, the analysis highlighted the TD Sequential indicator, a widely used tool for identifying trend exhaustion and potential reversal points. Specifically, the indicator printed a “1” buy setup, which typically appears after a sequence of downward candles. This formation suggests fading bearish momentum and the early stages of a potential bullish reversal. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Notably, XRP has been under sustained selling pressure, marked by large black candles followed by smaller-bodied candles and indecisive price movement. This loss of downward strength culminated in the TD Sequential’s buy signal. The structure also suggests that sellers may be exhausted If confirmed, the TD Sequential “1” could pave the way for a potential rebound, with bulls hoping for an early reversal from current levels. However, traders typically wait for further confirmation, often a “2” candle closing above the “1”, to validate sustained upward momentum. XRP ETF impact This outlook comes amid XRP’s growing institutional interest, highlighted by the debut of the first U.S. spot XRP ETF . In this case, Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF made a historic debut on November 13, recording $58.6 million in first-day trading volume, well above the $17 million analysts had projected. In its first 30 minutes, the ETF saw $26 million in trades, with a total of $245 million worth of XRP purchased on day one. XRP price analysis Despite this interest, XRP’s price is still being weighed down by broader cryptocurrency market sentiment. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.26, down over 2% in the past 24 hours. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold On the weekly timeframe, the asset’s 14-day RSI stands at 42.4, signaling neutral momentum, neither overbought (above 70) nor oversold (below 30). This suggests limited immediate directional pressure and potential for sideways consolidation unless external catalysts emerge. The 50-day SMA at $2.58 lies above the current price, indicating short-term resistance and a mild downward bias, while the 200-day SMA at $2.65 reinforces longer-term overhead pressure. As a result, XRP is positioned below both key trendlines, in a cautious, range-bound posture.

This renewed strength in the pair could give XRP the momentum it needs to push toward the $2.75 resistance level and potentially extend even higher. Daily Sentiment Mirrors Bitcoin As XRP Closes Slightly Bearish The analysis from CryptoWzrd notes that XRP’s daily candle was in alignment with Bitcoin’s broader market sentiment and closed slightly bearish. This reflects the continued pressure from Bitcoin, which remains a key driver of overall market direction. Despite this bearish close, the XRPBTC pair showed strength by ending the day bullish, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Related Reading: XRP Price Correction Is Far From Over: Bearish Divergence Signals Potential Revisit To $2.05 A continued push higher could drive the pair above the daily lower-high trendline, triggering a more impulsive price reaction. If this breakout materializes, it opens the door for XRP to advance toward the $2.75 resistance region, a level that has now become the next major target for bullish traders. However, Bitcoin’s influence remains a critical factor. Any renewed weakness or sharp downside movement from BTC could easily spill into XRP’s price action. In such a scenario, XRP may find itself retreating toward the $2 support zone, which stands as the next meaningful level of defense if bearish pressure intensifies. CryptoWzrd added that tomorrow’s focus will shift primarily to developments on the lower-time-frame charts. Short-term structure and intraday reactions will be key to spotting potential scalp opportunities. Choppy Intraday Action Signals Market Indecision The analyst observed that XRP’s intraday price action remained relatively choppy, with the market trading within a narrow range. This kind of movement suggests that traders are still waiting for a clearer signal before committing to a strong directional bias. Related Reading: XRP Price Sees Bullish Move, Can Buyers Protect Upside Levels? A key level to watch on the intraday chart is the $2.408 resistance. According to the analysis, a clean move above this threshold could unlock further upside momentum, creating favorable long opportunities as buyers regain control. Such a breakout would signal growing confidence and potentially shift short-term sentiment in XRP’s favor. However, if the price reacts bearishly at that same resistance zone, a rejection from $2.408 would present a short opportunity, indicating that sellers are still protecting that level. This scenario would likely reinforce intraday weakness and keep XRP confined within its current structure. The analyst also warned that any drop below the $2.2550 support level would push the market into a fragile zone where further declines become more probable. For now, patience is essential, as traders must wait for a more mature and organized intraday structure before taking aggressive positions.

Officials focused on how their key repo backstop is working as short-term funding costs edge higher. New York Fed convenes dealers on standing repo facility The New York Fed convened primary dealers on the sidelines of its U.S. Treasury Market Conference in New York. Officials briefed the banks on recent moves in short-term rates and asked for feedback on the Standing Repo Facility, which aims to cap spikes in overnight borrowing costs. New York Fed Liquidity Meeting. Source: Barchart In the meeting, policymakers reviewed how usage of the facility has picked up from low levels in recent weeks. They noted that the SRF is designed to keep the effective federal funds rate within the central bank’s target range as reserves decline through quantitative tightening. Officials also discussed recent Treasury bill auctions that cleared at higher yields, a sign that demand for cash has increased. They stressed that the SRF remains available as a backstop when balance-sheet constraints or quarter-end effects tighten funding conditions. How money market stress may influence markets next Traders now watch whether repo and other money-market rates keep edging toward the top of the Fed’s target range. When overnight rates trade near that ceiling for long, it usually signals that reserves in the banking system are getting tighter as the Fed shrinks its balance sheet through quantitative tightening. At the same time, analysts treat the Standing Repo Facility as a live stress indicator. When banks tap the SRF more often, it shows they would rather borrow directly from the Fed at the top of the target range than pay higher rates in private repo markets. Fed officials, including New York Fed’s Roberto Perli and Dallas Fed’s Lorie Logan, have recently encouraged firms to use the SRF whenever it makes economic sense and have flagged rising usage around month- and quarter-end as funding pressures build. Because of that, funding conditions can quickly spill into broader markets. If short-term borrowing costs stay elevated and Treasury price swings widen, investors may start to price in a slower pace of quantitative tightening or tweaks to the Fed’s operating tools to keep the effective federal funds rate inside the target range. Research from the Fed and recent commentary from market strategists note that sustained stress in repo markets and heavy SRF demand often push balance-sheet policy and “ample reserves” discussions back to the center of the debate.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-15 18:34:06

He emphasized that the exchange does not currently need additional capital and remains financially strong enough to operate independently. Sethi added that Kraken is fully capable of managing risks without turning to public markets. With a solid balance sheet and conservative approach, leadership sees no urgent reason to list shares or shift the company’s long-standing strategy. Why Kraken Stays Private While Competitors Go Public Interest in crypto-related IPOs has grown as overall market sentiment improves and the Trump administration signals a more accommodating stance toward the sector. Gemini, Bullish, eToro, and several infrastructure firms have already entered public markets, fueling speculation that more exchanges may follow. But Kraken stresses it is under no competitive pressure. Sethi said the company is not trying to mirror the high-profile debuts of other players and is not concerned about “missing the boat.” He noted that public listings offer useful benchmarks on margins and profitability models but do not alter Kraken’s priorities or long-term vision. A $15 Billion Valuation Gives Kraken Room to Move Founded in 2011, Kraken has raised roughly $530 million to date. A major venture round in September 2024 valued the company at $15 billion, strengthening its position without requiring access to public markets. Sethi also addressed Bitcoin’s recent volatility after the price fell below $96,000.

Kiyosaki names catalyst to make Bitcoin more valuable after ongoing crash,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-names-catalyst-to-make-bitcoin-more-valuable-after-ongoing-crash/,"Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has said that amid the ongoing crypto market crash, the key catalyst that could make Bitcoin ( BTC ) more valuable is the likelihood of large-scale global money printing as governments confront deepening debt burdens. According to Kiyosaki, the world is approaching a stage where expanding the money supply becomes the primary tool for keeping financial systems functioning. He believes this environment would significantly benefit scarce assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver, as he noted in an X post on November 15. “The real reason I am not selling is because the problem…. The world is deeply in debt…. and my bet is “ The Big Print” as described in Lawrence Lepards book…. “The Bug Print”is about to begin…. which will make gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum more valuable…..as fake money crashes,” he said. Crypto market crash Kiyosaki’s comments follow a sharp downturn across crypto and traditional markets, which he attributed to a widespread demand for cash. He argued that the sell-off is being driven not by fundamental weakness in Bitcoin but by liquidity pressure as investors liquidate assets to cover short-term financial needs. In his view, this dynamic is temporary and reflects broader economic stress rather than a shift in long-term value. The author emphasized that he is not selling his Bitcoin despite the volatility. Instead, he maintained that the fixed supply of 21 million coins remains a central advantage, especially in periods when governments may resort to expansive monetary policies. Kiyosaki has long positioned Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement, and he believes the current environment strengthens this role. He also noted that financial strain often pushes investors to liquidate even their strongest holdings, which can accelerate market declines. However, he sees these moments as opportunities for long-term accumulation rather than reasons to exit. Intention to buy more Bitcoin In line with this view, Kiyosaki said he intends to buy more Bitcoin once the crash stabilizes, anticipating that renewed money printing will eventually restore upward momentum for limited-supply assets. TWO MORE THINGS: 1: I willl buy more Bitcoin when crash is over. There are only 21 million Bitcoins. 2: If you have a Cashflow Game form a Cashflow Club and bring Birds of Feather together…. Teach and learn together. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 15, 2025 His comments come as Bitcoin continues to struggle below the $100,000 mark, trading at $95,980 as of press time.

On Friday, it issued a special license that lets companies start negotiating with Lukoil over its foreign assets. The catch? They’ve got until December 13 to close in, while sanctions slapped by President Donald Trump kick in on November 21 against the Russian oil giant . This move is Washington’s way of letting buyers make a deal without crashing global energy supply chains. This isn’t a free-for-all, though. Washington still wants to choke Russia’s oil revenue, especially from its second-biggest player. But it also knows that cutting Lukoil off completely would mess with gas stations, refineries, and pipelines all over the place. So now it’s letting talks happen, for now. Gunvor blocked, Carlyle steps in, Treasury sets harsh terms Last week, the Treasury Department straight-up blocked a deal. It shot down a plan by Swiss firm Gunvor to buy Lukoil’s global business, calling the company a “Kremlin puppet.” With that door slammed shut, a new name appeared: Carlyle. The US private equity group is reportedly eyeing Lukoil’s assets next, but hasn’t even started its homework. No due diligence yet on any of Lukoil’s oilfields, refineries, or its network of gas stations. That said, even if Carlyle, or anyone else, wants in, it won’t be easy. The Treasury will block any deal unless it fully separates Lukoil from its international operations. On top of that, the money from the deal would have to go into a blocked account. The Russian company can’t touch it unless, and only if, the sanctions get lifted. No exceptions. Lukoil, for its part, already saw the writing on the wall. Just a few days after Trump went after both it and Rosneft, the biggest oil producer in Russia, Lukoil announced it would start selling its international portfolio. That portfolio is no joke, its 2023 financials put the value of those overseas assets around $22 billion. That includes oil and gas fields across Iraq, Central Asia, and Mexico. Waivers handed out to limit global fallout But it’s not just about oil firms trying to make deals. Governments around the world weren’t exactly thrilled about these sweeping sanctions. Some pushed back, warning the US that this could screw up the energy supply for everybody. So, Treasury also issued a few waivers on Friday to avoid blowing up the system. One waiver allows nearly 200 Lukoil-branded petrol stations, including those operating inside the United States, to keep running until December 13. That buys them time, just not a lot. Another key extension covers Bulgaria, where Lukoil’s refinery keeps most of the country fueled. The refinery, along with its network of gas stations and its jet and ship fuel business, can keep trading until April next year. The Bulgarian government had already started the process of nationalizing the refinery to prevent a shutdown once the November 21 deadline hits. And then there’s Kazakhstan. The Treasury gave a further waiver allowing transactions until January 10 tied to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, as well as stakes in the Tengiz, Korolev, and Karachaganak fields. All of them have links to Lukoil and Rosneft, and cutting them off without prep could shake oil flows across Central Asia.

The firm purchased approximately $5.8 million worth of BitMine stock and around $2.9 million in Bullish shares, adding exposure through several of its exchange-traded funds. The new allocations come as crypto stocks experienced notable declines. Bullish ended the day down 6.19%, while BitMine fell nearly 6%. Both posted modest rebounds in after-hours trading. BitMine Enters New Phase as ARK Doubles Down on Crypto Leaders The recent purchases are part of ARK’s ongoing strategy to build positions in key crypto companies during periods of weakness. Just last week, the firm spent roughly $46 million acquiring Circle shares — its first Circle purchase since June, when ARK exited a large position with a $352 million gain. BitMine is undergoing significant changes. The company appointed Chi Tsang as its new CEO, replacing Jonathan Bates, and added three independent members to its board. These moves come as BitMine continues to consolidate its position as the largest public holder of Ethereum. The company now holds more than 3.5 million ETH, valued at over $11 billion. Once primarily a mining operation, BitMine has increasingly transformed into a major institutional Ethereum holder, mirroring the strategy long championed by Michael Saylor in the Bitcoin space. ARK Invest’s latest moves reflect ongoing institutional interest in the crypto sector, even amid market corrections. The firm continues to take advantage of price declines to expand positions in leading players across the industry.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-15 18:54:31

With the rising interest, several names are making waves. This article dives deep into why XMR, ZEC, and FET are poised for significant growth. The reasons behind their rise and potential impacts will be uncovered. Monero (XMR) Gains Momentum, Eyes Further Upside Source: tradingview Monero (XMR) has impressed with a recent price surge, gaining over 32% this month and 14% this week. Currently trading between $337 and $489, it's navigating a path towards its next resistance at $559. Should it breach this level, the door opens for a potential rise to $710. This represents an impressive potential upside, exceeding a quarter of its current price. With an RSI indicating strength at nearly 60 and an optimistic MACD, the momentum seems positive. The 10-day moving average sits above the 100-day, hinting at continued upward trends. If support holds firm at $256, Monero could rally strongly, rewarding those tracking its growth closely. Zcash (ZEC) Shows Strong Growth Potential Amidst Volatile Swings Source: tradingview Zcash is experiencing dynamic price movements. Currently, it's moving between $407 and $787. In the past month, Zcash saw a massive growth of over 175%, climbing significantly over the last six months by an impressive 1450%. Its nearest resistance point stands at $958, which if surpassed, could lead to another rally toward $1338. However, the current price is above the 10-day moving average of about $673 and also above the 100-day average of about $525, suggesting positivity. The relative strength index is slightly over neutral, indicating more room for growth. Look for potential price shifts as investors keep an eye on these levels. FET Coin Rebounds: Eyeing a New Price Surge Source: tradingview The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) coin is currently bouncing between twenty and forty-seven cents. Although it recently dropped by about twenty percent in a week, it stayed mostly flat over the past month. The coin has potential to climb to its nearest resistance level at about sixty cents, which would mean a leap of over twenty-six percent. If bullish sentiment grows, further gains towards the next resistance near eighty-seven cents could push it up more than seventy percent. The high RSI suggests strength, while the MACD hints at a possible uptrend. Traders are watching closely, as growth seems possible given the past dips. Conclusion XMR, ZEC, and FET are gaining attention for their focus on privacy. These coins are showing promising trends and could be significant players in the market. XMR is known for its strong privacy features, while ZEC offers users the option to choose between transparent and shielded transactions. FET is showing potential with its unique capabilities in secure, autonomous data transactions. Keeping an eye on these coins might prove beneficial for those interested in privacy-focused options.

The university has expanded its position in Bitcoin through BlackRock’s ETF, reinforcing the growing presence of digital assets in institutional portfolios. Many large investors now prefer regulated and structured crypto exposure rather than dealing directly with the underlying technology. Harvard’s move stands out because its endowment is one of the most respected in the world. Decisions taken by the university are rarely impulsive. They usually reflect extensive analysis and long-term planning. This shift suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a legitimate component of a diversified institutional strategy. Why institutions prefer ETFs Bitcoin ETFs have simplified access to the crypto market. Instead of managing private keys, wallets or specialized infrastructure, institutions can invest through familiar financial products. This reduces operational risks and helps maintain compliance with strict regulatory requirements. For an organization like Harvard, which operates under high governance standards, ETFs offer a safer and more manageable entry point. The structure of these products aligns well with the processes institutions use for other asset classes. Retail investors follow a different path While major institutions adopt ETFs, individual investors are exploring different options. Many retail participants are looking for ways to generate returns without facing the extreme volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. This is where platforms focused on alternative income models, such as RentStac (RNS) , are earning more attention. Their purpose is not to replace institutional products but to offer retail investors complementary ways to diversify. Instead of relying on rapid price movements, many users prefer more stable forms of digital income. As a result, the strategies pursued by institutions and retail investors are becoming visibly different. ETFs offer a regulated approach suitable for large organizations, while alternative platforms appeal to everyday users who want predictable returns and fewer market shocks. Volatility pushes retail toward simpler tools Recent market movements have highlighted how unpredictable Bitcoin can be. For newcomers, this volatility can be intimidating. Many retail investors therefore look for options that are easier to understand and carry clearer expectations. Harvard’s decision may still influence public perception. When a major institution enters the space, confidence tends to rise. This often sparks curiosity even among those who have not considered investing before. Still, ETFs are not always the preferred starting point for retail users. Many opt instead for platforms that simplify digital income and reduce the learning curve. A maturing ecosystem Institutional adoption through Bitcoin ETFs is helping the market evolve into a more stable and structured environment. At the same time, alternative income platforms are meeting the needs of users who want straightforward tools connected to the digital economy. These two segments are developing side by side. Large investors prioritize regulation and consistency, while retail investors look for user-friendly models that focus on steady returns. In this context, RentStac is increasingly cited as an example of a platform that supports the retail approach. What the future may look like The growth of Bitcoin ETFs is likely to continue. Asset managers report rising inflows, and more institutions are evaluating digital asset exposure. Other university endowments may follow Harvard’s direction in the near future, especially given its influence in the academic and financial worlds. For retail investors, the landscape is also changing quickly. The rise of digital tools built around alternative income is responding to a clear market demand. Many individuals want access to digital opportunities without handling the complexity of crypto trading or custody. This dual development represents an important phase for the broader sector. Traditional finance is helping validate Bitcoin through regulated products, while digital income platforms show that the crypto ecosystem can offer practical solutions for everyday investors. Two approaches shaping the same sector Harvard’s investment in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF sends a strong message. It signals that Bitcoin has moved beyond its experimental stage and is now recognized as a legitimate financial asset. At the same time, it illustrates how different groups of investors are choosing different paths based on their goals. Institutions will continue favoring products backed by regulation and oversight. Retail investors, meanwhile, will keep exploring alternative income platforms, including options like RentStac. Together, these two trends are shaping the next chapter of digital finance.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-15 19:00:00

On Friday, September 14, the flagship cryptocurrency fell below the $95,000 mark for the first time in over six months. Interestingly, the price of Bitcoin seems set for an even longer period of negative action, as a rare bearish signal has gone off for the first time in four years. Here’s how much the BTC price dropped the last time this happened. BTC Price At Risk Of 70% Decline If Sell Signal Holds In a recent post on the social media platform X, Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino shared an alarming outlook for the Bitcoin price in the long term. According to the crypto expert, the rare sell signal on the BTC weekly supertrend has gone off again. The “weekly supertrend” is a technical indicator that uses the Average True Range (ATR) and a multiplier to pinpoint the direction of an asset’s price trend over a weekly timeframe. As observed in the chart below, the indicator turns green for an upward trend and red for a downward trend, offering potential buy and sell signals. In his Friday post on X (formerly Twitter), Severino highlighted that Bitcoin just triggered a sell signal on the Supertrend indicator on the weekly timeframe. According to the prominent crypto pundit, this represents the first time this signal will be going off for the premier cryptocurrency since December 2021. At the time, the sell signal marked the abrupt end of the previous Bitcoin bull cycle , preceding an extended period of downward price movement. The price of Bitcoin fell by more than 70% after this signal was triggered, coinciding with significant sell-offs following the Terra LUNA and FTX collapses in 2022. If history is anything to go by, this sell signal foretells a story of a potential 60 – 70% decline for the Bitcoin price. A downturn of that magnitude could see the market leader return to around $30,000 from the current price point. However, it is worth noting that the weekly supertrend sell signal is currently still unconfirmed. While the indicator has been in a buy signal since January 2023, a weekly price close below $96,300 could spell the start of a bear market for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $94,400, representing an over 6% decline in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|LUNA|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 19:00:02

At the same time, fresh performance data show BNB beating Bitcoin, Ethereum and other majors year to date, underscoring the network’s growing pull with institutions and traders. BlackRock’s $2.5B BUIDL Fund Goes Live on BNB Chain BlackRock has launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on BNB Chain, bringing more than $2.5 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the network through a new share class. BlackRock BUIDL on BNB Chain. Source: NekoZ The move signals deeper institutional use of BNB Chain, highlighting its capacity to handle tokenized securities at scale. BUIDL already operates on other public blockchains, and this expansion adds another venue for qualified investors to hold on-chain fund shares. At the same time, Binance is accepting BUIDL as collateral, linking tokenized Treasuries directly to trading activity on the exchange. Institutions can post BUIDL positions to back strategies while maintaining exposure to short-term U.S. debt , reinforcing the broader shift toward real-world assets on public blockchains. BNB Extends Lead Over Major Digital Assets Meanwhile, year-to-date performance data show BNB holding the strongest position among the major digital assets. The chart shared by Rand illustrates how BNB stayed above its peers through multiple market swings, even as other top assets struggled to maintain positive returns. BNB Year To Date Outperformance. Source: Rand Through the first-quarter volatility, BNB moved back toward the breakeven line faster than Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. As the year advanced, the token kept a steadier trajectory while competing assets dipped into deeper drawdowns, especially during mid-year corrections. The chart also shows XRP’s wide spikes early in the year, yet its gains faded as BNB continued to hold a more consistent lead. Toward the final stretch of the year, BNB remained the only major asset to sustain meaningful positive returns. Bitcoin and Ethereum hovered near or below zero, while Solana and the broader altcoin group slipped into negative territory.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|BNB|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-15 19:01:06

He warned: “Something massive just happened behind the scenes and they tried to hide it, but they didn’t. We were able to find it. Evernorth quietly purchased $214 million worth of XRP. No headlines, no press release, trying to do it all under the radar.” Going further, he explained, “Now they control over 473 million XRP. Think about that. That’s not a trade. That’s a move. And Ripple, they are telling you they do believe that this is pretty much as close to the bottom as this thing is going to go. That’s why they’re buying it there.” Strategic Timing Behind the Move According to Bull Winkle, this accumulation is carefully timed. He said, “Every cycle, look, we have that one moment. I get it. When the elites position themselves before the news breaks, before the ETFs, which are coming next week, before the masses even realize what’s happening. This feels like that exact moment. A quiet transfer of power. The kind you only notice when it’s too late.” This implies the purchase was not market-driven speculation but a deliberate positioning before major developments. THEY TRIED TO HIDE THIS FROM YOU #XRP pic.twitter.com/DOLTLtQrJt — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 14, 2025 Evernorth: Ripple’s Treasury Vehicle The accumulation centers on Evernorth Holdings , a Ripple-backed treasury vehicle. Public filings show it purchased 84,365,876.36 XRP at an average price of $2.5366. This brings Evernorth’s total XRP holdings to over 473 million tokens, mirroring Bull Winkle’s observations. The firm aims to build a long-term, institutional-grade XRP treasury that generates compounding yield. It plans to actively deploy XRP into lending, liquidity, and DeFi strategies. Going Public and Backing Evernorth is set to go public through a SPAC merger with Armada Acquisition Corp. II. The combined entity will trade under the ticker XRPN. The treasury has strong backing from Ripple, SBI Holdings , Pantera Capital, Kraken, GSR, and Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. This highlights confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Liquidity Control, Not Speculation Bull Winkle emphasizes that Evernorth’s purchases are about liquidity control, not hype. He explained: “They’re locking in the rails before the system slips. This isn’t crypto speculation. It is the infrastructure being rebuilt in real time. And when you see XRP suddenly move, like it’s being publicly traded by an invisible hand, just remember who already knew and how much they bought before the world actually caught on.” The move signals a deliberate consolidation of power within XRP’s ecosystem, aligning institutional interests with Ripple’s long-term vision. Implications for XRP Holders Evernorth’s actions could tighten XRP supply in the open market, potentially creating upward price pressure. Its focus on infrastructure suggests long-term ecosystem growth. For retail holders, Bull Winkle’s warning is clear: this is not just a trade, but a strategic positioning that may define XRP’s next cycle.

This expansion could potentially spark a new wave of innovation in data management across Web3. Readers will discover which cryptocurrencies might see significant growth from this development and how the fusion of these technologies could reshape data handling in decentralized networks. The Graph (GRT) Poised for a Potential Price Surge Despite Current Dip Source: tradingview The Graph's (GRT) current price sits between five and eight cents, showing a recent downward trend. The coin has dropped over 18% in the past week, with a 14% dip over the month, and a striking 50% decline in six months. Despite this, the technical signs suggest a possible rebound. With an RSI under 39, the market hints at the coin being oversold, and the next resistance sits just over nine cents. If GRT breaks through this level, it could rise to nearly twelve cents, suggesting an upward jump of roughly 46% from the lower end of the current range. Conclusion The integration of The Graph with TRON offers significant promise. GRT's role could be pivotal in enhancing data accessibility and utility in Web3 networks. By supporting TRON, The Graph aims to foster a robust ecosystem. If successful, this might lead to stronger adoption and innovation in decentralized applications. GRT has the potential to drive this transformation. This collaboration marks an important step in bridging different blockchain platforms for broader growth.

The meeting brought together billionaires who wanted to figure out how to slow down the mayor-elect before his plans reshape New York City’s economy in a way they fear could hit their wallets and their companies. The gathering, hosted by President Donald Trump, was allegedly described by people who were present as a moment where business leaders talked about backing Republican candidate Elise Stefanik for New York governor in 2026, according to The Telegraph. And the reason for that sudden interest was simple, every billionaire in that dining room wants someone who can counter Zohran, whose win last Tuesday stunned New York’s political and business establishment. The crowd at the dinner was the kind of group you expect when Trump calls in his allies. Stephen Schwarzman, the Blackstone chief executive, sat near David Solomon from Goldman Sachs. Henry Kravis, co‑founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, was also there, along with Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan, who has had a tense relationship with Trump for years. Adena Friedman from Nasdaq came, as did Larry Fink from BlackRock . And Jeffrey Sprecher, who runs Intercontinental Exchange and helped put the whole dinner together, moved between tables as people debated what could be done about the incoming mayor and the policies he promised voters. Billionaires push Elise Stefanik to keep Zohran in check Elise Stefanik launched her campaign for governor last Friday with a promise to make New York “affordable and safer,” and people in the room talked about supporting her even though none of them or their companies are confirmed to be sending her money yet. Stephen, David, and Henry all privately expressed interest in her 2026 run, showing how worried the business world is about having Zohran running the most important city in the country. The thinking in the room was that if Elise takes the governor’s office from Kathy Hochul, she can act as a counterweight to the mayor and block any tax increases or borrowing plans he tries to push through the state. The conversation wasn’t just about Elise. A person close to one of the executives in attendance said talk of her campaign was part of a bigger discussion about what to do about Tuesday’s election result. And when asked about it afterward, John Catsimatidis, the billionaire grocery chain owner, said, “I’m following President Trump’s motto. We’re not surrendering New York, we’re going to fight, fight, fight,” and added that Governor Hochul “has absolute power over the mayor” and has to make sure he “does the job right.” Wall Street reacts to Zohran’s tax-and-borrow blueprint The plan Zohran ran on, nicknamed “Zohranomics,” is built on raising taxes on rich New Yorkers, raising taxes on corporations, and borrowing huge sums to fund free buses, universal child care, affordable housing, and sweeping rent freezes. All the money would come from either the wealthiest people in the city or from debt that pushes New York deeper into obligations. And the city is already heading into the red. Budget numbers published by the Wall Street Journal show New York is facing a multibillion‑dollar deficit, and the hole is expected to grow because of federal cuts passed this summer in a Republican tax bill that shifted major costs like Medicaid and food stamps back to cities. Trump, who returned to the White House in 2025, warned that he might hold back billions in federal funds if Zohran won. Now that he has, the threat hangs over every budget conversation. And even if the mayor wanted to move ahead right away, none of his major tax ideas can happen without approval from Governor Hochul and lawmakers in Albany, who may not support him as she heads into her own 2026 campaign. The numbers in his tax plan also raise questions. In 2019, New York City collected $3.4 billion in corporate taxes. By 2024, that figure climbed to $7.5 billion. If every company had paid an 11.5% rate, collections would have reached $11.9 billion, an extra $4.4 billion. But none of that explains how state-level revenues would actually be moved back to the city budget. And for companies already paying the city’s 8.85% corporate tax, pushing rates higher would bring them close to the federal 21% rate. As Jared Walczak from the Tax Foundation pointed out, some firms are already paying more because they owe the MTA surcharge on top of everything else.

While that definition still holds weight, it’s rapidly ceding ground to more dynamic strategies that reward action rather than inaction. This is particularly true in crypto, where for the first decade and a half, stockpiling BTC and sitting on your hands paid off handsomely. But now that crypto’s price discovery phase is over, and the parabolic growth has abated, astute holders are moving their assets out of cold storage and putting them to work. In today’s markets, the true edge is no longer about how much you hold, but how intelligently you can move it. Instead of waiting for the next bull run or riding out volatility, smart investors are making their capital productive: borrowing against crypto rather than selling; rotating into stable assets during market swings; and putting idle funds to work in tokenized treasuries and yield-bearing products. That’s because they understand that, whereas static wealth relies on the actions of others – new money to buy in – dynamic wealth compounds. From Static to Dynamic Capital The infrastructure supporting the shift from simple cryptocurrencies to smarter yield-bearing assets is advancing at remarkable speed. Tokenization has transformed digital assets into modular, on-chain building blocks. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries alone now account for over $7 billion , and the broader real-world asset market has expanded to $24 billion after tripling in just three years. Analysts see the potential for tens of trillions more over the next decade. Stablecoins tell the same story of capital in motion. With a market value of over $300 billion, they process more transactions than PayPal and Visa, and on-chain stablecoin settlement volume approaches 40% of the total value that the U.S. ACH network processes. What began as a niche tool for traders has become a core layer of global payments and remittances. Stablecoins aren’t merely a bridge into crypto: they are the rails on which money itself moves. Yield is another example. In a world where traditional savings accounts struggle to beat inflation, digital assets offer opportunities that simply didn’t exist before. From tokenized funds to lending markets, investors can capture 4–10% returns on stable assets. DeFi’s growth to nearly $160 billion in value locked is proof that these systems have evolved beyond bold experiments to become mature financial engines. Leaving assets idle today is the financial equivalent of leaving cash under a mattress. Credit markets reflect the same transformation. Loans backed by digital assets reached $44 billion this year, rising more than 40% in a single quarter. For investors, this means the ability to unlock funds while keeping long-term exposure intact. That is a fundamental upgrade to how wealth works – credit lines secured by crypto that let users borrow while preserving upside exposure. A Generational Redefinition of Wealth The transition from static to dynamic investment isn’t just a technological shift – it’s generational. More than half of Gen Z already own crypto, and unlike their parents and grandparents, they don’t treat their portfolio as a vault to be locked away for a rainy day. They treat it as working capital, rebalancing regularly, financing short-term needs, and tailoring yield strategies to personal goals. Wealth is a living organism, not a dusty deposit box. The winners in this environment won’t be those who hold the longest. Instead, the lion’s share of the rewards will go to those who intelligently deploy their assets, reallocating and unlocking liquidity as conditions demand. For now, such investors remain in the minority, given that 60% of Bitcoin’s supply has sat unmoved for over a year. But if the current trend for active investment continues, the flippening – the point at which dynamic strategies dominate – is fast approaching. Sitting in crypto and praying for the market to move up just doesn’t cut it anymore. Fast forward a couple of years, and it’ll look as outdated as MySpace. The future of finance will not be measured in static balances but in how quickly capital can adapt. Wealth is no longer a vault. It is a system. And the real edge lies not in how hard you HODL but in how smart you work.

This decline happened as the total open interest pulled back and as the fear and greed index slipped. This article explores some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week, including Avalanche (AVAX), Cronos (CRO), and LayerZero (ZRO). Avalanche in the spotlight ahead of the Granite upgrade Avalanche price has been in a strong downtrend in the past few months. AVAX token has dropped from a high of $36.43 in September to a low of $15.25. Avalanche price will be in the spotlight this week as the developers launch the Granite upgrade. This is an important upgrade that introduces three key features: Cross-Chain messaging enhancement, biometric authentication, and dynamic block times. The Granite upgrade comes as the Avalanche network is doing well. Data compiled by Nansen shows that the number of transactions jumped by 96% to 63.3 million in the last 30 days, making it the fastest-growing chains. Avalanche has also become one of the top players in the Real World Asset (RWA) industry, where its total value locked has jumped by over 65% in the last 30 days. Avalanche’s number of users has continued rising, growing by 8.8% in the last 30 days to 730,000. Additionally, Avalanche has continued to burn tokens in the past few months, reducing the number of tokens in circulation. Cronos (CRO) price drops ahead of a major token unlock The other notable crypto to watch this week is Cronos, the token associated with Crypto.com. CRO price has plunged by over 70% from the year-to-date high despite its relationship with Trump Media. Cronos ecosystem growth has largely stalled, with the total value locked (TVL) in the network dropping by 22% in the last 30 days to $650 million. Its stablecoin market cap has also been in a strong downward trend in the past few months. Cronos will be in the spotlight this week as the network unlocks 1.17 billion tokens valued at over $135 million. A token unlock often puts more pressure on a cryptocurrency as it introduces more coins in the market. LayerZero price in focus ahead of a major unlock LayerZero is one of the biggest players in the crypto industry, where it provides cross-chain communication solutions that enable secure data transfer between different blockchains. Data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that the total bridged volume jumped to a record high of $15.9 billion in October from $13.9 billion a month later. Its bridged volume this month stands at $6.35 billion. LayerZero will be in the spotlight this week because of the upcoming token unlock, which will unlock about 32.61 million worth $48 million on 20th November. The network has unlocked about 38% of all its tokens. The other top cryptocurrencies to have unlocks this week will be Merlin Chain, Plume, OG, Lombard, and Aster.

SEC Chairman Paul Atkins appeared on Fox Business's 'Mornings with Maria' program with Maria Bartiromo to explain steps to clarify the definition of “security,” a long-standing issue within the cryptocurrency industry. Atkins summed up the regulatory uncertainty the industry was experiencing by saying, “Unfortunately, the industry has been operating in a fog for several years. They haven't really figured out what the SEC is looking for and how this new technology can fit in with our archaic rules that apply to paper filings and stocks.” Sharing his vision for the classification of crypto assets, Atkins outlined a token classification system that divides digital assets into four main categories: Digital Commodities Digital Collectibles Digital Tools Tokenized Securities Atkins’e göre, bu sınıflandırma sisteminin ilk üç kategorisi menkul kıymet değil. Yalnızca son kategori olan Tokenized Securities menkul kıymet tanımına giriyor. Related News: What Caused the Recent Drop in Bitcoin Prices, and What Should We Expect Next? Here Are Expert Opinions and Data This statement reiterates his earlier view that most crypto tokens traded today are not securities. The SEC Chairman stated that the root cause of the regulatory confusion stems from the definition of an “investment contract,” a type of security. He noted that this definition has guided the industry since the emergence of cryptocurrencies a decade ago, but its origins lie in a 1946 Supreme Court case called Orange Grove. Atkins said their work is based on the principle that the token itself does not always have to be a security, but can represent one. He also added that a token may cease to be a security as the network becomes more decentralized. Atkins stated that they will focus primarily on fundamental issues and cooperate with other regulatory bodies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to ensure clarity in the sector. *This is not investment advice.

The platform stated that its tokenomics remain the same and have not changed, attributing the misunderstanding to the way circulating supply data was updated and displayed on the widely used crypto-market tracker. The confusion started after users saw new figures on CMC showing a 200 million ASTER unlock slated for December 15, 2025, followed by two other unlocking events, 3.86 billion and 1.6 billion tokens, scheduled for 2035. The numbers implied that about 75% of the total supply remained locked, with only 24% circulating. Miscommunication causes speculation Not long after the data was released, columnist AB Kuai Dong , with the X handle @_FORAB, posted in the early hours of Saturday, November 15, that the derivatives exchange had acknowledged modifications to its token economics. He wrote that “the main reason is that the ASTER token data on Binance shows that multiple unlocks originally scheduled for 2025 have been canceled and moved to the summer of 2026, or even later in 2035.” According to Kuai Dong, the Aster team’s reason for canceling and rescheduling the unlocks was that “the original token economics initially had ecosystem unlocks every month, but since Aster has no usage plan, the unlocks were not carried out.” The post has users and media platforms reporting that Aster had intentionally delayed large portions of its token supply. Aster insists tokenomics are unchanged In a statement posted on X , Aster DEX said the tokenomics “remain unchanged” and apologized for the “miscommunication” created by the update on CMC. The exchange explained that since the token-generation event (TGE), ecosystem allocations unlock monthly but have remained untouched in a locked address because the project had no immediate operational use for them. The team said, “The update was intended to accurately reflect the circulating supply of the token and address concerns regarding our monthly unlock of the community & ecosystem allocation.” Aster noted that the unlocked tokens had never contributed to circulating supply figures, though their presence in the same wallet as other locked funds contributed to misinterpretation. To avoid further confusion, the exchange said it “will transfer the unlocked tokens to a separate public unlock address.” It added that it had “no plans to spend from this address” in the near term. Market reaction remains stable Despite speculation about dilution risk, ASTER’s price has so far held ground. It has fluctuated between $1.08 and $1.15 within 24 hours, and as of the time of writing, Aster’s price is $1.13, rising over 2% within the past 24 hours. Aster’s circulating supply stands at an estimated 2.017 billion tokens, with about 6.06 billion still locked. The market capitalization is approximately $2.27 billion, while the fully diluted valuation exceeds $9 billion. The incident also shows how proactive communication can mitigate the impact narratives can have on crypto projects. Like in this case, where token unlock information is dispersed, inconsistently formatted, and then becomes contradictory across trading venues, data providers, and project documentation. The attendant result of such inconsistencies is usually volatility, especially in ecosystems where token allocation policies are central to investor confidence. Get seen where it counts.

Instead, they’ve met hiring freezes, automated interviews, and closed doors, according to a survey by CNBC. Employers across the U.S. are slashing entry-level roles, and AI is swallowing up tasks faster than career centers can print résumés. The job market hasn’t looked this cold since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the next twelve months could get even worse, per the survey. Employers are getting stingier, not because talent is lacking, but because they say machines are cheaper. Hiring managers now openly admit they’re using AI to cut costs and clean house. About 51% rated the job market for new grads as either “poor” or “fair,” which is the worst reading since 2020. AI eliminates jobs faster than colleges can adapt Joseph Fuller, who teaches management practice at Harvard Business School, said, “The pathways to get into certain careers are going to be narrower and the burden of credentials will be steeper.” He believes AI has already made some popular skills useless, especially in roles that used to be stepping stones for fresh grads. Entry-level job postings have already dropped by 35% since January 2023, based on research by Revelio Labs. That leaves college grads stuck. The white-collar jobs they were trained for just aren’t there anymore. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported 1.1 million layoffs this year, a 65% increase from last year. Tech companies led the bloodbath as they restructured departments and replaced people with automation. Jobs in finance were next in line, since AI can now run numbers, crunch data, and do most of what analysts do. But roles in healthcare, construction, and factory work are more insulated, mostly because a robot still can’t change a bedpan or pour concrete. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia backed up the trend with its own data. High-paying jobs that need a bachelor’s degree are way more likely to get hit by AI than blue-collar ones. That’s made things even worse for the Class of 2025, who sent out more résumés than 2024 grads, but landed fewer offers. Cengage Group found that only 30% of them secured full-time work in their field. That’s a sharp drop from the 41% of last year’s graduates who got jobs. Career offices scramble as parents question value of a degree At Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, employers that usually show up for career fairs didn’t even bother this year. James Duffy, who oversees co-curricular education at Gettysburg, said, “If we look at the jobs that AI has absorbed … there are a number of jobs that students used to move right into. Some of those jobs are no longer available.” Now that companies are cutting entry-level roles, colleges are being forced to rethink their playbooks. They’re doing this at a time when trust in higher education is already sinking. Tuition keeps climbing, and student debt is swallowing people whole. A survey from EdAssist by Bright Horizons shows 77% of borrowers call their loans a “huge burden.” Even worse, 63% don’t believe the degree was worth the stress. Duffy said families are now asking blunt questions about outcomes. “Parents want to know, ‘If I’m going to spend this money, where are they headed after four years?’” He said his team is focused on loading students up with internships, externships, and hands-on work; anything that makes them less replaceable. Fuller added that colleges need to start building co-op programs, or they’ll fall behind. But not every school has the network or budget. He warned that smaller, rural colleges like Gettysburg may end up falling behind bigger schools in cities that have more hiring pipelines. “It’s going to be helpful to be in a school with a fair amount of employment opportunities locally.” Some are already making changes. The City University of New York rolled out a plan this July to revamp how its 180,000 students prepare for life after graduation. The program includes career-connected advising, paid internships, apprenticeships, and direct collaborations with employers. Félix Matos Rodríguez, the chancellor, said , “It’s not enough for students to graduate with a degree … they must leave with direction, preparation, experience, and connections.” He told CNBC that every student should either have a job in hand or a spot in grad school by the time they graduate. That’s the goal. But getting there is still a long shot. Félix admitted no one has figured out how to measure success in this chaotic market. Fuller called out the elephant in the room: “Higher ed is singularly ill-equipped to deal with rapid change.” Félix argued that schools need to speed up and get real about the job market. They need to guide students toward where AI is creating roles, not killing them. He said, “It shouldn’t be like higher ed failed because they weren’t able to read that crystal ball.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Tech,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|RESEARCH|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-15 19:55:55

It has been seen by on-chain analytics that a number of high-volume Ethereum wallets have now started accumulating tokens of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto trading at a low price point of just $0.035 today. The reasons why the whales are strongly interested in this DeFi crypto, amidst a number of potential assets, lie in the lending model that MUTM offers, which is a decentralized model, so users aren’t required to lock away their assets, as opposed to other DeFi assets, and a Presale Phase 6 that has already reached 90% sold out, making MUTM the next crypto to explode before reaching the exchanges. Ethereum at a Critical Decision Point Ethereum (ETH) is now testing a major structural level following the strong corrections seen recently. The price is currently sitting exactly at the breakdown level, which sees both the trend-line and the horizontal level meet, marking an extremely important battleground between bulls and bears. A successful re-test above the descending red trend-line will likely change market sentiment once again, potentially leading to a breakout to former highs, while any further slippage will likely bring another leg lower due to active sellers and cautious market sentiment. It is a make-or-break market level for ETH. It is exactly this that has driven investors to consider other options that are farther along but still growing, a market condition that has sparked recent interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a DeFi crypto and recognized by analysts as the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance Presale, Phase 6 Exceeds Expectations Mutuum Finance is still making headlines in the DeFi crypto space as it inches closer to the end of Phase 6 of its presale. The project has managed to sell over 90% of its tokens, resulting in the price per MUTM now being at $0.035. The price will, however, rise by 20% to $0.04 in the next phase, Phase 7. The presale has managed to attract over 17,980 investors, raising over $18.8 million so far. Mutuum Finance is unique in the market, not just by the presale results, but by how innovative they are with their approach to the development and structure of credit markets, making this project stand out among others in the DeFi crypto marketplace. Passive Yield and Liquidity: The mtTokens Solution One of the innovative features of Mutuum Finance is the creation of mtTokens, which users are given when they contribute to or stake their assets to the program or service. When this occurs, as opposed to a traditional type of deposit, which will require users to withdraw the money and make interest or reward payments at this point, users are given real-time reward payments. The above attributes make this solution an ideal candidate to be adopted by many users, as their contributions of assets to the protocol enhance the demand for MUTM tokens, which are deeply intertwined with the ecosystem, hence promoting participation and making it the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance has also incorporated an innovative ‘buy and distribute’ model as a part of their tokenomics system. A percentage of all transaction fees charged on the platform are automatically utilized to purchase MUTM tokens, which are later distributed. It produces a perpetual buying coin, correlating the usage of the platform with a corresponding market demand for tokens. It is a model that differs profoundly from marketing schemes, whereby the utilization of the platform will enhance the natural market demand for MUTM Tokens, hence validating the MUTM Tokens utility level within the DeFi crypto ecosystem. Mutuum Finance has managed to raise over $18.8 million, with over 795 million MUTM tokens sold out to approximately 18,000 investors. Mutuum Finance presale Phase 6 is now over 90% completed, and early supporters have a last opportunity to acquire tokens at a price of $0.035, which will increase to $0.04 by presale Phase 7. High presale volumes, novel mtToken yield strategy, and a growing DeFi crypto ecosystem make MUTM the next crypto to explode to watch. Vigorously acquire MUTM tokens today to be part of 2025’s rapidly growing DeFi crypto community and position yourself ahead of the next crypto to explode.

On-Chain Data Fuels Debate,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-bitcoin-falling-because-of-strategy-sell-offs-on-chain-data-fuels-debate/,"Bitcoin’s latest downturn has caused considerable speculation about whether Strategy’s (formerly known as MicroStrategy) massive holdings are playing a role in the market’s weakness. The concerns escalated sharply when wallet-monitoring platforms flagged large Bitcoin transfers linked to the company, sparking widespread claims that a major sell-off had begun. The conversation gained even more traction when a widely circulated report alleged that Strategy had slashed its Bitcoin holdings by tens of thousands of tokens. Michael Saylor moved quickly to address the rumor, but the back-and-forth between on-chain interpretations and official statements raises questions of what is really happening behind the scenes. Related Reading: XRP Earns Academic Praise: University Study Calls It ‘Gold In Your Hands’ How Wallet Movements Turned Into Full-Blown Sell-Off Rumors The controversy started when Walter Bloomberg shared a post citing Arkham Intelligence and claiming Strategy had reduced its Bitcoin stash from 484,000 BTC to roughly 437,000 BTC. The alleged drop of about 47,000 BTC immediately led to questions as to whether the company had quietly begun liquidating. Saylor responded directly beneath the post, stating, “There is no truth to this rumor,” dismissing the claim outright. There is no truth to this rumor. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 14, 2025 As the situation spread across social platforms, Arkham Intelligence later clarified what actually happened. In a post on X, the firm explained that Strategy had moved 43,415 BTC since midnight UTC, worth over $4.2 billion, but also noted that the activity consisted of routine custodian rotations. According to Arkham, the transfers were due to movement from Coinbase Custody to a new custodian, along with internal rebalancing and wallet refresh processes. None of the movements indicated sales and that Strategy frequently performs these custodial transitions. Anyone tracking these wallet clusters over the past two weeks would have seen similar flows, eventually followed by relabeling once new addresses were established. Saylor’s Public Reassurance And Continued Bitcoin Accumulation In response to the swirling speculation, Saylor took a definitive stance to calm markets. While speaking at an interview on CNBC, Saylor addressed the controversy, stating that Strategy had not sold any Bitcoin and had no plans to do so. His remarks left no ambiguity as he said, “We are buying; we’ll report our next buys on Monday morning.” He went further to describe the company’s financial position and long-term confidence, noting that the firm has put in a very strong base around here with its Bitcoin holdings. Saylor also highlighted that Strategy’s debt structure does not impose immediate obligations, saying the debt is still “4.5 years out.” This means there is currently no financial pressure that would require liquidation of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Crypto ‘Pig-Butchering’ Scam Escalating Into A National Security Risk— Study Shortly after the interview, he reinforced his message on X, stating plainly, “We bought bitcoin every day this week,” which directly contradicts any claims of ongoing sell pressure from Strategy. In terms of price action, Bitcoin has spent most of this week on a downtrend, which now puts its price trading below $100,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,084.

Here Are 7 Tokens Set to Boom – Don’t Miss the Whitelist,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-will-explode-in-2025-here-are-7-tokens-set-to-boom/,"Crypto never stops, and the chances to profit don’t either. One moment, coins are skyrocketing; the next, markets swing hard and portfolios feel the impact. Everyone, from analysts to influencers, is sharing their predictions, but the truth remains: waiting too long can be more costly than taking a calculated risk. For those wondering which crypto will explode in 2025 , the winners will be the ones who act decisively while the crowd hesitates. In 2025, the coins attracting the most energy, innovation, and community hype are the ones primed for explosive growth. Among them, Apeing stands out, a token built for the bold, the impulsive, and the true degens who know that real gains favor action. For those ready to ride the wave, $APEING isn’t just a coin; it’s a statement. 1. Apeing: The Coin That Rewards the Brave Apeing isn’t just a token; it’s a mindset. While other projects rely on slow, calculated growth, $APEING thrives on instinctive action. The principle is simple: people who ape hard when others hesitate are often the ones capturing the most upside. Blockchain developers and crypto strategists are noting that $APEING’s tokenomics reward early and committed participation. The project has been meticulously structured to ensure liquidity, scalability, and a thriving community. According to an analysis on Messari, tokens that maintain a high velocity of community engagement often outperform those with slower adoption curves. Secure Your Spot on the $APEING Whitelist Getting in early is easier than you think. Start by visiting the official website and entering your email in the whitelist section. Once you confirm your email, you’re officially positioned to participate in what could be the next major market-moving event. This simple step doesn’t just secure access, it signals that you’re ready to act while opportunities are still fresh. In a market where timing is everything, being whitelisted early gives you the edge to potentially capitalize on the moves others might miss. 2. Bitcoin: The OG Still Packs Punch Bitcoin, the original moonshot, remains the foundation of crypto portfolios worldwide. Despite its maturity, Bitcoin continues to adapt, with institutional adoption, Taproot upgrades, and Layer 2 integrations reshaping its utility. Analysts on CoinDesk suggest that BTC’s role as digital gold positions it for long-term growth. While it won’t yield the hyper-speed gains of newer tokens, Bitcoin’s stability and network effect make it a key player for any degen strategy. For 2025, the expectation is that Bitcoin will see volatility swings in the 20-40% range per major news events. Degens who understand when to ape into Bitcoin can leverage these swings for massive gains, even in a market that seems “boring” compared to meme tokens. 3. Ethereum: Smart Contracts, Smarter Gains Ethereum remains the playground for decentralized apps, NFTs, and DeFi. The shift to proof-of-stake reduced energy consumption and unlocked staking rewards ranging from 4-7% annually, as noted in Ethereum’s official documentation. With Ethereum 2.0 upgrades continuing to improve scalability and reduce fees, developers and investors alike see long-term growth potential. Community sentiment on forums and social media channels highlights Ethereum as a strong contender for explosive growth, especially with Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum enhancing transaction speeds. Degens know that a well-timed Ape into ETH can yield rewards that traditional HODL strategies often miss. 4. Solana: Speed and Meme Energy Solana’s claim to fame is blazing speed and low transaction costs. Developers flock to Solana for NFT launches, gaming apps, and decentralized marketplaces. Analysts on social channels suggest SOL has the potential for triple-digit growth in 2025 if adoption continues. However, network outages remain a risk factor, which adds to the thrill for degens who understand volatility as opportunity. Apeing into SOL during market dips could be the difference between 2x gains and 10x. 5. Chainlink: Oracles That Connect Everything Chainlink remains critical for connecting smart contracts to real-world data. Its decentralized oracle network ensures DeFi protocols, insurance apps, and gaming projects receive accurate information. Analysts from Chainalysis highlight Chainlink’s ecosystem growth as a primary driver for potential price surges. Degens who understand the infrastructural importance of LINK often see it as an underrated gem that quietly explodes alongside the projects it powers. 6. Polkadot: Cross-Chain Kings Polkadot offers interoperability, allowing blockchains to communicate seamlessly. Its parachain auctions have drawn attention from developers and investors alike, making DOT a promising contender for 2025. Research shows that projects enabling multi-chain operations often experience network effects that propel price action beyond isolated ecosystems. Degens who jump into DOT early gain from both community growth and the cross-chain adoption trend. 7. Tron: Steady Player in a Meme Market Tron remains a resilient platform for decentralized apps, particularly in entertainment and gaming. Its low fees and high throughput attract developers aiming for scalable solutions. While Tron might not carry the same hype as meme coins, analysts note that TRX often benefits when speculative cycles return. For those who ape confidently, Tron can be a quietly profitable move in a market full of volatility. Final Thoughts: Moon or Bust There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but the world is clear: tokens that combine technological utility, community engagement, and the right timing will surge. Which crypto will explode in 2025? Apeing is uniquely positioned for those ready to move, while others hesitate. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink, Polkadot, and Tron each bring unique advantages. Geniuses who ape intelligently understand that the market rewards decisiveness and bold action. The lesson for 2025 is timeless: those who wait for certainty are often left watching others celebrate their gains. $APEING is built for the bold, for the apes who recognize that fear is the enemy and action is the key to moonshots.

XRP is currently showing signs that many investors may overlook. These patterns could foreshadow a pivotal move. In a recent video posted on his X handle, Steph Is Crypto highlighted what he described as “an extremely powerful signal” that is right now flashing on XRP’s chart. This signal predicts exactly what we should expect right now. He stated, “I want to show you the most important metrics. I will also show you something regarding HBAR if you hold HBAR. Pay attention to this chart; this is very important.” Steph’s analysis draws from historical patterns and technical indicators that often signal market turning points. Most People Don't Realize What's About To Hit #XRP ! pic.twitter.com/8pm6rxxTmb — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 14, 2025 Reassessing the Death Cross Steph focuses on the recent intersection of the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages on the daily chart. He explains, “What is important is to focus on these crosses where this green line crosses with the Red line, and that is what we call a death cross , typically speaking perceived as a bearish signal, but in fact, this is usually a bullish signal.” He emphasized that similar patterns in 2017 and 2020 coincided with major XRP lows. In his words, “in 2017, the death cross appeared at the bear market low, preceding a strong rally. In March 2020, it marked the market low before XRP surged in the following weeks”. Steph observes, “This is, historically speaking, either a local bottom or a bear market bottom. So, this is a very powerful and important signal to pay attention to.” The recent death cross, he notes, occurred “the day before yesterday or so,” indicating a potentially similar setup. Historical Patterns and Three-Day RSI Steph also highlights the three-day chart and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . He states, “If you look at the three-day time frame for XRP, you can see the RSI just broke out, just like the daily time frame. We broke this downward resistance line, and the past few times that this happened led to a significant rally here for XRP.” He recalls prior breakouts that led to nearly 600% gains in November and a 90% rally at the end of March 2025. For HBAR, Steph adds, “HBAR is also getting very close to this RSI breakout on the three-day time frame, historically, a precursor to what is about to come for the price action, somewhat of a Crystal ball indicator you could say.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supply Zones and Weekly Moving Average Steph explains the importance of weekly moving averages and concentrated purchase levels. He notes that XRP is trading below the 50-week simple moving average. “A lot of people recently bought XRP around $2.50 to $2.54, and this 1.5 billion of supply actually in this level perfectly coincides with the 50-week simple moving averages,” he says. He emphasizes that a weekly close above $2.55 is required to confirm a bullish reversal. “By the end of this Sunday, the upcoming Sunday, we would need to close above $2.55 to confirm a possible bullish reversal,” Steph adds. Failing to reach this level may maintain a cautious outlook. Implications for Traders Steph frames the death cross, RSI breakout, and supply levels as interconnected signals. While the death cross is usually bearish, his analysis suggests it may indicate a bottoming phase. This could present a buying opportunity. He concludes, “ I believe this could be a very lucrative buying opportunity or moment to hold XRP, not a moment to sell.” Investors should monitor the weekly close around $2.55 and the continuation of RSI momentum. Steph’s approach combines historical precedent, moving averages, and momentum indicators. It demonstrates how careful technical analysis can inform prudent trading decisions in XRP.

While brief, his statement seemed to dismiss years of development and innovation behind the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , leaving many community members and industry analysts both shocked and aggrieved. Sigel’s words have sparked passionate debates about the value, utility, and understanding of XRP as a blockchain and digital asset. Sigel Draws Criticism For Subtly Mocking XRP Sigel’s controversial post appeared to be a subtle jab toward XRP enthusiasts, suggesting that he would never understand the XRPL blockchain but respected the passion and effort required to “pretend it does something.” Sigel’s mocking tone appeared to diminish the accomplishments of XRP over the years, provoking instant backlash from the cryptocurrency’s dedicated community. The VanEck executive implied that, despite the visible enthusiasm and hustle of supporters, the work behind XRP might ultimately be meaningless. His veiled critique about the blockchain and the community backing it struck a nerve, likely because XRP has been under development for over a decade, with consistent progress in regulatory navigation , DeFi applications, and cross-border payment solutions. Members of the XRP community who felt the post belittled the financial and technological innovations embedded in the blockchain’s ecosystem have voiced strong opinions that sharply contrast with Sigel’s statement. Some have even criticized the VanEck executive for his perceived lack of understanding and appreciation of the technology, particularly given his current role as head of digital asset research at the asset management company. XRP Community Pushes Back Against Sigel’s Statement In response to Sigel’s post on X, many prominent figures in the crypto space immediately challenged his mocking remarks. Panos Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, highlighted the groundbreaking nature of the XRP Ledger, noting its ability to naturally deepen liquidity and act as a decentralized settlement layer without the risks associated with smart contracts or wallet exploits. Digital asset researcher Anders also criticized Sigel for publicly admitting a lack of understanding. At the same time, Ripple developer Matt Hamilton emphasized the professional responsibility of those in digital asset research to grasp the fundamentals of blockchain. Popular market analyst CryptoSensei mocked the irony of VanEck’s research lead dismissing XRP’s technological innovations, suggesting the asset management company might need to hire new blockchain experts. Community members joined the chorus, highlighting that XRP , like Bitcoin, serves as a cornerstone of value and liquidity, and that the collective effort of investors, developers, and enthusiasts lends it unique utility. Other members appeared to be educating Sigel on XRP’s longstanding role in global payments and settlement, stressing that minimal transaction volume does not equate to lack of value, drawing parallels to BTC’s historical pattern. Despite Sigel acknowledging that he would never make sense of the XRP blockchain, supporters remain resolute, using the controversy to enlighten and amplify the network’s achievements and ongoing developments.

Their latest video outlines what they view as a rapidly changing environment for digital assets, with particular attention on regulatory developments, institutional inflows, macroeconomic factors, and shifting financial conditions in the United States. The update focuses heavily on what they believe could influence XRP’s trajectory in the near term. Ripple #XRP HOLY SH*T HE KNOWS THE XRP PRICE SURGE DATE?!?!? (PREPARE NOW!) pic.twitter.com/IDwb3WHMt5 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) November 13, 2025 XRP ETF Expectations and Price Projections BullRunners opened their breakdown by stating that the SEC has approved the Canary Capital Spot XRP ETF, which, according to recent updates, has begun trading. They added that Jake Claver expects XRP to reach three- or four-digit price levels if multiple ETFs debut together. According to BullRunners, nine XRP ETFs may go live within a seven- to ten-day window, a scenario they argue could create substantial market movement. They referenced JP Morgan’s estimate of approximately $8 billion in first-year inflows into these funds, suggesting that the circulating supply of XRP on exchanges may be insufficient to absorb that level of demand. In their view, this raises the possibility of an eventual supply squeeze and reduced availability on trading platforms. Broader Crypto Commentary and Regulatory Notes Beyond ETF speculation, BullRunners shifted to lighter commentary on crypto ownership, referencing a CNBC study they claim links cryptocurrency holdings to improved desirability in dating environments. They then moved toward risk-management discussions, promising additional strategies later in the video. The video also touched on U.S. tax guidance, stating that the IRS treats cryptocurrency as real property and emphasizing documentation requirements for those exceeding $19,000 per person in 2025. BullRunners promoted tax-education resources through Altcoin Pro University, positioning them as useful for investors seeking clarity. Macroeconomic Outlook and Liquidity Discussions BullRunners expanded their focus to monetary policy and economic pressures. They said 7 of 12 Federal Reserve members support a 50-basis-point rate cut for December, referencing Deutsche Bank’s expectation that quantitative easing could return in early 2026. They described these factors as components of a potential liquidity wave, though they noted that retail participation remains limited for now. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 They also highlighted new U.S. stimulus measures, mentioning a proposal for $2,000 payments to individuals earning under $100,000 annually. They pointed to the last stimulus cycle as a period that coincided with strong market activity. Housing Affordability and Employment Concerns The commentary moved into housing challenges, citing the growing consideration of 50-year mortgages for younger generations despite significantly higher lifetime interest costs. BullRunners presented an example comparing past and present home affordability in Utah and argued that many buyers face limited options due to location constraints. They closed with concerns about rising unemployment expectations and an increase in Google searches for second jobs. BullRunners suggested that some individuals may view day trading as an alternative source of income. They ended the segment by posing this possibility to their audience.

Here Are the Critical Levels That Must Be Protected and Overcome,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-outlook-for-xrp-here-are-the-critical-levels-that-must-be-protected-and-overcome/,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision reported in its latest chart assessment for XRP that the asset's technical outlook remains weak. Analysts argued that despite the recent recovery, the price could not stay above critical levels and selling pressure continued. XRP's failure to sustain a breakout above $2.48 is among the key factors driving short-term weakness in the market, according to MakroVision. Despite recent attempts to rally, the price has been rejected from this resistance once again. The company noted that XRP has tested the $2.16 area (the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level) several times in recent days, but there has been no strong buyer response from this area. If this support level is broken, analysts predict the price could quickly retreat to the $2.02-$1.88 range. This area is considered critical because it contains both horizontal support and key Fibonacci levels. Related News: American Billionaire Scaramucci and Trump Form Bitcoin Alliance - Announce Major Investment The assessment stated that for XRP to regain strength, it must first break above the $2.48 level. If this level is broken, the price could find room to reach the $2.65 region, where liquidity is high. MakroVision shared the following conclusion regarding the current technical picture: XRP remains technically weak. Unless the $248 level is retaken, the risk of a new correction towards the $2.00-$1.87 range outweighs the risk. A downside break below these support areas could significantly weaken the medium-term trend. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What’s the Latest Outlook for XRP?

Despite a recent price dip, a bearish-sounding Death Cross has just triggered precisely at a major structural support, the lower boundary of a long-term pattern. This bullish confluence, where historical market bottoms align with key technical support, suggests that the correction is complete and a significant upward bounce is imminent in the short term. $100,460 Range Low Now Flipped Into Key Resistance BTC has officially lost the range low and slipped to the $96,000 area, according to Lennaert Snyder, who outlined a clear game plan for the days ahead. He noted that the former range low of $100,460 has now flipped into a key resistance level, shaping the next phase of market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rejection Was No Accident — Now The Battle Shifts To $93,000–$97,000 Survival Zone Snyder explained that if Bitcoin retests the $100,460 mark, the reaction will determine the next move. A rejection at that level would favor short setups, while a successful reclaim would open the door for bullish opportunities. Should BTC reclaim the range low, Snyder expects bullish momentum to kick in, with the first target sitting near the $103,460 resistance area. A push into that zone would signal that buyers are regaining meaningful control over the market. Despite the recent drop, Snyder emphasized that there’s still plenty of liquidity and support below current prices while watching for deeper tests that could provide long entries once reversal signals begin to form. Overall, the market remains technically clean, and price action continues to respect every level with precision. Death Cross Triggers At Megaphone Support — Timing Could Be Perfect For Bitcoin According to a recent post by Colin Talks Crypto, Bitcoin has just flashed a major signal, the Death Cross, which has historically aligned with market bottoms rather than tops despite its ominous name. What makes this even more compelling is its perfect timing: the setup triggered at the exact moment BTC touched the lower boundary of its expanding megaphone pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $98,000 As HODLer Selling Accelerates The expert noted that this scenario was projected weeks in advance, with mid-November marked as the window to watch. Right on schedule, Bitcoin has landed precisely where the analysis suggested it would. Colin explained that death crosses often act as bottom markers at the tail end of downtrends. Pairing that with BTC hitting a major structural support gives the setup even stronger bullish undertones. It’s not just a technical coincidence – it’s a confluence backed by pattern behavior. With these elements lining up, he believes the probability of an upward reaction from here is high. The chart structure now favors a short-term bounce, suggesting that Bitcoin could soon shift away from weakness and begin carving out a recovery move.

Co-authored by Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa, the initiative is based on the principle that Ethereum was not created to make finance efficient, but was made so people could coordinate without trust in intermediaries. Hidden Centralization Risks The team argues that a protocol begins to compromise its core identity the moment a centralized part, like a hosted node or a controlled relayer, is used. They explained that while these decisions may appear insignificant at first, they gradually form a pattern that undermines permissionless access, which sacrifices efficiency and a refined user interface. “The manifesto is a statement of those values: credible neutrality, self-custody, verifiability, and resistance to ‘convenient’ centralization,” wrote the team via X. The document defines a system as truly trustless only when any honest user can join, verify, and take part freely without needing permission or fearing interference. This depends on every action being fully verifiable through public data and on ensuring that no single operator becomes essential to the system’s function. The EF also warns that simplicity built on reliance is not a sign of progress but a loss of independence. “When complexity tempts us to centralize, we must remember: every line of convenience code can become a choke point,” the authors wrote. The manifesto points to the growing use of centralized infrastructure, such as major cloud providers hosting blockchain nodes, as proof of this slow drift toward dependence. The recent Amazon Web Services outage highlighted the risk. Coinbase’s Base chain saw its transaction capacity drop by about 25% when its AWS-hosted sequencer went offline, while Arbitrum and Optimism continued running smoothly because they use multiple cloud providers. Blockchains Urged to Prioritize Trustlessness Over Transaction Volume This message comes at a time when some Layer 2 networks have faced criticism for chasing fast scalability at the expense of full decentralization. Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base have gotten scrutiny for risks like single sequencer control and delayed decentralization plans due to limited community participation in governance. The authors propose a new way to assess the long-term health of a blockchain project by how much it reduces reliance on trust with every transaction, instead of by how many transactions it processes. Developers who want to take the pledge must connect their wallet, read the manifesto, click “Sign the Trustless Manifesto Pledge,” and confirm the transaction. The initiative has already gained support from several figures in the Ethereum community, including EF member Tom Teman and pseudonymous crypto researcher hitas.base.eth.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is still proving to be a resilient performer, with strong community backing and crucial levels well above $0.20, while a number are holding strong around their support level, including Ripple (XRP), which is now looking to rebound towards $3.00. Among the established cryptocurrencies, a fresh face has managed to make a rapid appearance, that being Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Being solely in Presale Stage 6, MUTM has already managed to sell out 90% of this presale round, all at a low price of just $0.035, now sitting well over the initial target set, reaching a strong total so far of over $18.8 million at this early stage of presale, all well before its market entry as a fully fledged cryptocurrency. Investors are labeling MUTM as one of the best cryptos to buy for its early-stage growth and utility. Dogecoin (DOGE) Exhibits Signs of Fresh Bullish Trends Dogecoin (DOGE) has transitioned from a strong downtrend to a strong upward move, indicating a potential takeover by the bulls. Currently, Dogecoin price is sustaining around an important resistance level, fighting to make a comeback, and a successful breakout may bring even better gains. On the other hand, a failed breakout could bring a small dip before moving towards the next leg. Although Dogecoin is performing well as a trading asset, investors are now focusing their attention on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM presale is gaining traction due to its novel DeFi solution, as the current presale stage is almost fully sold out, making it a must-watch in the top cryptocurrencies list for 2025. XRP Awaits ETF Approval The anticipation around the upcoming Canary Capital XRP ETF, slated to list this Thursday, may bring substantial institutional investment to Ripple. Currently, XRP is seen trading around $2.43, down by a marginal 3%, but holding a vital support level around $2.20. The bulls will now have to breach the resistance level between $2.63 and $2.72 to get a fresh swing high, failing which may toe the price lower to around $2. Even as traders are keeping a keen eye on the arrival of the first-ever ETF by XRP, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining substantial attention among investors due to its revolutionary DeFi initiative and presale activities, establishing itself as one of the best cryptos to buy in the market today. Mutuum Finance Enthralls DeFi Investors Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as the top cryptocurrencies investment for early adopters wanting to be part of this revolutionary initiative. The current presale is a fantastic opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens before they are listed on exchanges. The presale is now at phase 6, with tokens sold at a price of $0.035, which is well over three times the price charged at presale phase 1. It should be noted that the presale has managed to accumulate well over $18.8 million, all from 17,980 participants, with phase 6 well past 90% completion. It could be concluded that MUTM is the best cryptos to buy for 2025, as well as a leading DeFi project to watch due to its innovative dual lending model, among other virtues. Creating a Balanced and Comprehensive Ecosystem The presale of Mutuum Finance has been conceptualized to ensure a high degree of transparency, fairness, and sustainability. Out of a total 4 billion MUTM tokens, around 1.82 billion, or 45.5%, have been allocated for the presale period. The response so far has seen over 795 million tokens sold, representing strong interest among both retail and institutional buyers. Mutuum Finance has so far accumulated over 18.8 million, with over 795 million MUTM tokens bought by approximately 18,000 investors. The presale is in phase 6, which is over 90% complete, providing a final opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a price of $0.035, as this will rise to $0.04 in presale phase 7. Mutuum Finance’s dual lending, rewarding, and increasingly populous community are making MUTM the top cryptocurrencies pick for investors to keep an eye on in 2025. Lock in your investment opportunity today before entering the big market, and ensure your early position in one of the most promising new crypto coin launches of the year.

54453276,628549,1763244036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54453276.jpeg,Bitcoin New Role: Here’s How BTC Is Increasingly Intertwined With The Business Cycle,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-the-business-cycle/,"Bitcoin is stepping into a new era where its movements can no longer be explained by crypto-native events. Instead, BTC has become increasingly intertwined with the global business cycle, reacting to shifts in institutional positioning. As the market matures, BTC behaves less like a speculative outlier and more like a macro-sensitive asset that rises and falls with the broader economic pulse. Liquidity Cycles Drive Bitcoin More Than Crypto Narratives The correlation between the business cycle and Bitcoin has never been clearer, and the latest chart has made the connection harder to ignore. According to a well-known crypto news analysis on X, CryptosRus, this chart overlays BTC price action with the broader macro business cycle, and the alignment is almost striking. Currently, BTC appears to be approaching a cycle bottom that mirrors previous macro business-cycle lows. What makes this setup compelling is the record-long pre-parabolic phase in BTC history. If this pattern continues, the next major expansion phase may be closer than expected. The market is entering a meaningful turning point. The Co-founders of Glassnode, Swissblock, and censeAG, Negentropic, stated that the Treasury General Account (TGA) drain began on November 14th, and historically, its liquidity flow leads Bitcoin by roughly one week. During the 2019 government shutdown, BTC found its bottom and began recovering within 12 days as liquidity started normalizing. This recent stretch has been the most challenging phase of the liquidity squeeze , and its peak effect has hit this week. The government’s reopening of an estimated $150 billion in excess TGA liquidity is providing a meaningful tailwind as it enters the markets. With the economic data on pause during the government shutdown, the near-term repricing has been influenced by uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Nvidia earnings next week will offer the next clear signal for risk . “The worst of the squeeze is likely behind us, and the setup is improving. Patience is key,” Negentropic noted. Government Liquidity Injection Could Neutralize Recession Fears Brian Rose, the founder and host of LondonRealTV, has also offered an insight into the current market setup, stating that the Federal Reserve has officially announced the end of quantitative tightening (QT). At the same time, the US government is reopening and unleashing more than $100 billion of pent-up liquidity directly back into the system. According to Brian, BTC sentiment is the worst he has seen in years. In the short term, there’s fear around recessionary jobs data, while in the mid-term, there are real catalysts for liquidity. However, as long as nothing is breaking, the market can handle bad data. This is a strange mix of despair and fresh money. Historically, the extreme pessimism combined with liquidity injections has been the exact setup where rallies begin.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Brian Rose|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CenseAG|CryptosRus|Fed|Federal Reserve|Glassnode|LondonRealTV|Negentropic|Nvidia|QT|Quantitative Tightening|Swissblock|TGA|Treasury General Account,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 22:00:36
