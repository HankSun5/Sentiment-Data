54408376,https://cryptonews.com/?p=452058,1763159700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54408376.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now 14 November – XRP, Ethereum, Zcash",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-14-november-xrp-ethereum-zcash/,"Bitcoin surged to an unprecedented high of $126,080 in early October, but the much-anticipated “Uptober” rally abruptly stalled after Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on China triggered a sharp market-wide selloff on October 6. That drop set the stage for a month-long correction across the crypto sector. For veteran digital-asset traders, the retracement was far from unexpected, and in many ways, welcomed. Corrections help eliminate excessive leverage and speculative froth, often laying the foundation for stronger, more sustainable rallies that follow. Now that volatility is easing and investor sentiment is steadily improving, analysts believe momentum could accelerate heading into 2026. Here’s why XRP, Ethereum, and Zcash may become some of the top performers in the next major bull cycle. XRP (XRP): Fueling the Next Era of Global Payments Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to reshape the environment of international payments with its fast, low-cost blockchain settlement system, positioning itself as a more efficient alternative to legacy networks like SWIFT. Ripple’s technology has been spotlighted in reports from the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, while the company continues forging high-level partnerships with global financial institutions. This expanding ecosystem has helped XRP secure its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap hovering near $135.6 billion. Ripple’s newest initiative, the RLUSD U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, highlights its aggressive push into what many view as crypto’s most important use case. Every RLUSD transaction, and all activity on the XRP Ledger, requires a tiny XRP burn, tying network adoption directly to long-term token value. XRP has climbed 214.5% over the past year, reaching $3.65 in July, its first all-time high since 2018. Over the same 12-month period, Bitcoin’s price grew just 3.4%. If the U.S. approves spot crypto ETFs and passes Project Crypto, a legislative framework aimed at clarifying digital-asset regulation, XRP could realistically target $10 or more by early 2026. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart-Contract Titan Gears Up for Major Expansion Ethereum ($ETH) , boasting a market cap of roughly $371.7 billion, remains the backbone of decentralized finance and Web3 development. Holding about $72.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) , Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi and smart-contract sectors, reinforcing its vital role across the blockchain ecosystem. A bullish scenario places ETH at $10,000 by year-end, a major leap from its current $3,206 level and roughly double its previous all-time high of $4,946 recorded in August. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade, scheduled for early December, will significantly improve data availability for Layer-2 solutions while boosting sustainability, security, and network scalability. These enhancements could push ETH toward the $5,000 mark by the end of the month. However, achieving a run to $10,000 will largely depend on clearer U.S. regulations, which will unlock broader institutional participation. Earlier this year, ETH broke out of a bullish flag pattern, rising from $1,800 to an ATH, though stronger momentum is required to propel it into five-digit territory. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Coin Soars 147% in a Week Launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin fork, Zcash ($ZEC) was developed with one mission in mind: preserving financial privacy. ZEC uses zk-SNARKs, a powerful cryptographic technique that validates transactions without exposing the sender, receiver, or amount involved. Its dual-address design offers users a choice between transparent and shielded transactions, maintaining a balance between anonymity and regulatory compatibility. ZEC has rallied 17% in the last 24 hours and an astonishing 1,359% in the last 365 days. Now trading around $566, it accounts for most of the $32.7 billion privacy coin sector’s overnight gains of 17%. It also boasts a hefty market cap of over $9 billion. With an RSI hovering near 68, ZEC is nearing overbought territory, suggesting a mild pullback could occur as traders take profits. Still, strong fundamentals and renewed interest in privacy tech could propel ZEC to $1,000 before year-end. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme Coin with Real Utility and Layer-2 Scaling One rising star poised to make waves in 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a project merging meme-coin culture with meaningful blockchain infrastructure. Unlike typical meme tokens, HYPER provides tangible utility as a Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling solution, aiming to increase the network’s transaction throughput, reduce fees, and enable smart-contract functionality. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper supports DAO governance, cross-chain interoperability, and programmable contracts, enabling seamless interaction with Bitcoin across multiple networks. The project has already raised $27.5 million during its presale phase, with analysts such as Borch Crypto projecting potential gains of up to 100×. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed no security flaws in the smart contract, boosting investor confidence. The HYPER token powers staking, network fees, and governance. Early presale stakers can earn up to 42% APY. With Bitcoin approaching new highs and HYPER’s presale experiencing strong demand, many analysts expect this project to become one of 2026’s breakout performers.

Its native token, RNS , is currently in presale and gaining significant traction thanks to its transparent structure, property-backed model, and measurable revenue potential. As interest continues to rise, investors are closely monitoring the RNS token price , how it evolves across the presale phases, and what expectations look like once the token goes live on exchanges. Here is a complete breakdown of the current price, phase progression, the effect of bonuses on the actual cost per token, and projections shared by market analysts. Current RNS Token Price in Presale According to the official RentStac website, the presale is currently in Phase 1 , with the token priced at: $0.025 per RNS With nearly a million dollars already raised and demand increasing daily, RentStac’s entry into the RWA sector is being met with strong early enthusiasm. The Real Price Is Lower: Bonuses Reduce the Actual Cost Per Token A key detail that many newcomers overlook is the presence of multiple bonus tiers on the official site. These bonuses provide additional tokens when users invest above certain thresholds, effectively reducing the real cost per token . This means that while the displayed Phase 1 price is $0.025, investors who benefit from bonuses often pay significantly less on a per-token basis . Early buyers are therefore able to secure a much more favorable entry point compared to later phases. For RWA-focused investors, this early discount is one of the main reasons the presale is attracting so much strategic attention. How Much Will the RNS Price Increase in the Next Phases? The RentStac presale is structured across 7 progressive phases , each with a clearly defined price increase. This ensures full transparency and reinforces the incentive for early participation. Here are the key price markers: Phase 1 price: $0.025 Phase 2 price: $0.030 Final phase price: approximately $0.055 per RNS From start to finish, this represents an increase of around +120% within the presale alone. When combined with bonus allocations, early presale buyers obtain tokens at a meaningfully discounted effective rate, often far below the listed price. This layered structure creates a strong foundation for investor confidence and sets expectations for future performance. Why Analysts Believe RNS Could Move Toward $1 After Launch As the RWA narrative strengthens, analysts tracking RentStac are increasingly vocal about its post-launch potential. Their projections are based on two dominant factors: 1. Real estate backing Unlike speculative tokens that rely purely on hype or market momentum, RNS is tied to real rental properties that produce verifiable cash flow. This grounding in real-world value adds stability and credibility to the token. 2. Rising demand for RWA tokens Real-world asset tokenization has become one of crypto’s fastest-growing sectors. Platforms offering passive income backed by tangible assets have historically shown strong early performance upon exchange listing. Because of this, several analysts are forecasting that RNS could experience a substantial appreciation shortly after launch. Among the more optimistic projections: RNS could approach the $1 mark in the early post-launch period, especially if the platform scales its property acquisitions quickly and demand mirrors what similar RWA projects have experienced. These predictions are speculative, but they are grounded in comparisons with past RWA token launches, sector growth trends, and the inherent appeal of property-backed yield. The Path Forward: Why Investors Are Watching the Price Closely The RNS token price is drawing significant attention for three main reasons: The current presale price is still at its lowest point Bonuses drastically reduce the true purchase cost Analysts foresee meaningful upside after exchange listing This combination of discounted entry, growing presale momentum, and expanding interest in RWAs positions RentStac as one of the more closely watched early-stage projects of 2025. As the presale progresses through its next phases, the token’s price will continue increasing, while the bonus structures make early participation notably more advantageous.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-14 23:00:00

The $0.1130–$0.1150 support zone remains critical, as the current structure shows risk of deeper declines if it breaks. CRO is moving within a tightening range, signaling that a decisive move is likely once price escapes this narrowing structure. On November 14, 2025, Cronos trades at $0.1175, down 4.68% over the past 24 hours. The price moved between $0.1132 and $0.1229, showing moderate volatility as sentiment shifted. Activity across the Cronos ecosystem remained steady, with users engaging through explorer.cronos.org and supported wallets like MetaMask and Crypto.com Wallet. Traders watched CRO closely as it tested support levels while struggling to hold above $0.12. Cronos daily price chart: CRO shows softening buyer momentum On the daily chart, CRO stayed below the $0.1200 resistance, showing limited buyer strength. The price held just above $0.1130, but the candle structure signaled that bulls needed stronger momentum. Indicators showed weakening upside energy as CRO traded under short-term moving averages, while flat volume pointed to a drifting, consolidating market. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView A dip toward $0.1150 led to a mild rebound, but the move failed to return CRO to the upper range. Sellers stayed active between $0.1180 and $0.1200, keeping pressure on every attempt to climb. The chart showed repeated rejections, forming a tight trading corridor that traders watched closely as CRO neared its next key decision point. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO intraday structure points to short-term bearish control On the 4-hour chart, CRO formed a series of lower highs, confirming a short-term bearish pattern. The price hovered near $0.117, while momentum indicators signaled weakening pressure. Buyers attempted moves toward $0.119, but each push lost strength before reaching resistance. This descending structure kept CRO vulnerable to deeper declines if $0.1150 failed to hold. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView Small recovery candles appeared, showing light accumulation but not enough to shift direction. Sellers kept control as CRO stayed below its intraday trend line, with each bounce forming new lower resistance levels. The structure pointed to continuation unless CRO produced a clean break above $0.120, the key level traders continued to watch.

On the daily chart, resistance near $0.1200 keeps buyers in check, while support at $0.1130–$0.1150 is critical amid flat volume and consolidating price action. The 4-hour chart shows a series of lower highs, confirming short-term bearish control, with attempts toward $0.119 losing momentum and leaving CRO vulnerable to a dip below $0.1150. Traders should watch $0.1150 for support and $0.1200 for resistance, as a break of either level could dictate the next trend. Is Cronos a good investment? Cronos (CRO) trades at $0.1175, down 4.68% over 24 hours, moving between $0.1132 and $0.1229. Despite steady ecosystem activity, CRO struggles to hold above $0.12 as sellers remain active.

Attempts toward $0.119 continue to lose momentum, leaving CRO vulnerable to a dip below $0.1150. Traders should monitor these key levels for signs of a breakout or breakdown, keeping in mind that CRO’s price remains sensitive to market sentiment and technical trends, making it a watchlist asset rather than a guaranteed investment. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? Cronos (CRO) trades at $0.1175, down 4.68% over the past 24 hours, moving between $0.1132 and $0.1229.

Intraday attempts toward $0.119 have lost steam, leaving the token vulnerable to a dip below $0.1150. The decline today reflects this persistent selling pressure and market consolidation, with traders closely watching key support and resistance levels for the next decisive move. Recent news Cronos completed its “Smarturn” upgrade on October 30, 2025, boosting EVM compatibility, scalability, and interoperability. The update added EIP-7702 smart accounts, integrated Go-Ethereum v1.15.11 (with Cancun/Prague opcodes), introduced eth_getBlockReceipts, and improved transaction speed through PriorityNonceMempool and AnteCache.

Cronos market price prediction: Analysts’ CRO price forecast Firm 2025 2026 DigitalCoinPrice $0.46 $0.54 Coincodex $0.407 $0.507 Cronos’ historic price sentiment CRO price history | Coinmarketcap CRO launched at $0.01977 in December 2018 and saw early fluctuations, hitting $0.07344 by March 2019, but ended 2019 at $0.03358. In 2020, CRO rose steadily, reaching above $0.20 by August before dropping to $0.06 by year-end. In 2021, CRO followed the crypto bull run, surpassing previous highs and achieving an all-time high of $0.9698 on November 24, boosted by listings on Coinbase Pro and Bitrue. CRO opened 2022 at $0.5575 but fell to $0.4409, partially due to concerns over a potential security breach on the Crypto.com platform, which temporarily suspended withdrawals in January. In 2023, Cronos experienced a peak in mid-March at around $0.80, followed by a steep decline and stabilization at around $0.20 by mid-year. It maintained a slight oscillation around this range in the following months. CRO started 2024 at $0.10, rallied to a yearly high of $0.18 in March, and declined to $0.12 by June. It stabilized between $0.08 and $0.10 from July to October, traded at $0.07193 and $0.09521 in November, and ended the year in a range of $0.138 and $0.234 in December. In January 2025, Cronos traded within the range of $0.158 to $0.163 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, resulting in a trading range of $0.1005 to $0.160 in February. Later in March, Cronos traded within the range of $0.08076 and $0.0950. However, after touching the $0.1 mark by the end of March, the Cronos price triggered a bearish rally. In April, the CRO price declined heavily due to the rising trade war between the US and China. The Cronos price dropped to a low of $0.08. However, it has been surging toward $0.09 in recent weeks of May. As of June, Cronos (CRO) declined from approximately $0.098 to $0.081, experiencing a steady downtrend with brief attempts at recovery near $0.085 in July. By the end of August, the price of Cronos skyrocketed toward $0.38, but it later declined below $0.25 in early September. In September 2025, Cronos traded around $0.22 before rising slightly to approximately $0.25 in October 2025. As of November 2025, Cronos (CRO) traded around $0.126 after recovering from a dip near $0.120.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|OTHER|CRO|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-14 23:00:00

In light of this, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley made some thought-provoking remarks about the current market conditions, suggesting that a bear market cycle has been playing out for the past six months. New Bullish Phase Ahead For Bitcoin? In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Horsley emphasized the shift in market dynamics, stating, “We talk about four-year cycles, but the reality is that model is based on a bygone era of crypto.” He pointed out that with the advent of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a new pro-crypto administration by President Trump, the landscape has evolved significantly.

Horsley’s statement could be met with optimism for investors about the future direction of crypto prices, suggesting that the digital asset ecosystem may soon transition into a new bullish phase. “I think there’s a pretty good chance that we’ve been in a bear market for almost six months now and are almost through it,” he remarked, noting that the current market setup appears stronger than ever. Animoca Brands Co-Founder Weighs In Meanwhile, crypto-linked stocks also experienced declines on Friday. Notably, Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), which focuses on a Bitcoin treasury strategy, saw its shares drop by 6%. Other significant players, including Gemini (GEMI) Space Station and Bullish (BLSH), saw their stock prices decrease by 2%, while Coinbase’s (COIN) shares fell by 1%. Further, digital asset mining firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies traded 3% lower. Adding to the discourse, Yat Siu, co-founder of the blockchain development firm Animoca Brands, shared insights with CNBC, stating that lack of liquidity in the market has led to investors divesting certain assets to address financial concerns. “There’s less money in the system,” Siu noted, attributing some sell-offs to those shortfalls. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Tumbles Toward $98,000: What’s Driving The Drop And What Lies Ahead Siu echoed Horsley’s perspective, suggesting that this current market cycle may differ from previous ones, particularly due to the influx of institutional investment in digital assets. He explained that institutional investors do not typically follow the longstanding belief system of major Bitcoin holders regarding the four-year price cycle. “People think Bitcoin is going to go down to $60,000 because of the four-year cycle and the token’s history of drops and corrections,” Siu explained. However, he believes that these institutions will view market downturns more as buying opportunities than signals for panic. As of this writing, BTC has recovered the $96,750 line but is still recording losses of 4% over the past 24 hours and seven days.

54411151,627753,1763161204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54411151.jpeg,Here’s How XRP Holders Reacted Before And After The Game-Changing Spot ETF Announcement,https://bitcoinist.com/before-and-after-xrp-spot-etf-news/,"On-chain data has revealed an interesting trend among XRP investors amid certain crucial updates regarding the leading altcoin, particularly the XRP Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). With the market shifting towards a bearish state, the current behavior of investors could play a pivotal role in shaping the token’s next trajectory. Before Vs. After The XRP Spot ETFs Update XRP’s market dynamic has entered a decisive new chapter, as holders make key moves in the market. A recent report from CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain data analytics platform, has broken down the actions of investors before and after the announcement of XRP Spot ETFs , revealing a notable trend. In the quick-take post, Woominkyu, a market expert and author, highlighted that whale investors acted prior to the spot ETFs announcement, but retail investors only arrived after the crucial update. This trend ended up changing the asset’s market setup. Once the ETF confirmation was released, sentiment transformed almost immediately. Before the news about XRP Spot ETFs broke, on-chain data unveiled that futures data demonstrated a clear rise in whale-sized orders. Such a steady acquisition indicates early strategic positioning by high-net-worth players while the price of the token was still compressed and moving sideways. However, the most important development is the retail investors’ orders, which were being observed following the spot ETFs news. The stark difference between pre-announcement caution and post-announcement confidence highlights how revolutionary this milestone will be for XRP and its ecosystem. Woominkyu stated that this pattern, whales first, retail last, is typical and frequently indicates a change in the state of the cryptocurrency market. As sentiment begins to mix with earlier informed movements, the market typically becomes more erratic and unpredictable after retail investors arrive late. Meanwhile, news regarding the spot ETFs bolstered this transition by attracting traders who were not available during the buildup. This does not imply that the move is finished, but it does indicate that the market has arrived at a stage where retail and whale behavior collide. A trend of this kind makes it difficult for traders to read the next market direction. Several Spot ETFs Set For Launch As anticipation builds in the sector, Ripple Bull Winkle, a researcher and host of The Crypto Blitz Show, has outlined a potential timeframe for several XRP spot ETFs to go live. Ripple Bull Winkle declared that 7 of the funds are officially set to launch in just 12 days, marking one of the most significant countdowns in the altcoin’s history. According to the expert, these funds will trade on Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE at the same time when they secure approval from the US SEC . Following years of waiting, XRP is about to enter the global ETF market, allowing direct institutional access to the altcoin. “Institutions aren’t gambling, they’re positioning before the next leg,” the expert stated. Thus, the expert believes that the token’s move is already being orchestrated underneath the surface.",XRP|CBOE|CryptoQuant|Nasdaq|nyse|ripple|Ripple Bull Winkle|The Crypto Blitz Show|US SEC|Woominky|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Spot ETFs|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 23:00:04

These shifts show a market focused on small upgrades and fast capital moves. But what if a project avoided this whole cycle by arriving fully built from the start with an enterprise-level design? That’s where Zero Knowledge Proof comes in! The project is quickly becoming what analysts now view as the best upcoming crypto in 2025. It did not rely on a future plan. It spent $100 million before its presale to create a complete privacy-first base layer that fixes major enterprise issues on Ethereum. This type of early commitment aimed at real market reach is rare, and the whitelist is open now. Zero Knowledge Proof Built Its System Before Any Sale! Analysts describe Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) as the first real Ethereum competitor with the strength to claim part of its market. While Ethereum’s open data limits enterprise use and its Layer 2 networks create a mixed experience, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) built a private and unified layer from the start. The team invested over $100 million before launching any sale, which is more than what Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano secured in their early stages. This heavy build-out is why many speak about 1000x future growth. This is far more than a concept. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) will begin its presale with $20 million in completed infrastructure. It also created $17 million in $249 Proof Pods that can earn revenue and will begin shipping five days after the presale auctions start. This ready-to-use setup offers direct use cases, managing private smart contracts, and high-scale AI computation for enterprise tasks. This working capability makes it a main choice for the best upcoming crypto coin of 2025. The upcoming presale uses a daily Initial Coin Auction (ICA) with a $50 starting point and a $50,000 upper limit so whales and VCs cannot control the supply. This layout, paired with its built system, places it in front as the strongest option for the best upcoming crypto 2025. The whitelist for these auctions is open now, giving the public a direct path into what may become the next major leap in crypto design. Whale Pressure Shapes the Hyperliquid Landscape Hyperliquid (HYPE) is now a major zone of activity for heavyweight traders, with its price support strengthened by deep-pocketed accumulation. The ongoing Hyperliquid (HYPE) whale activity has been striking. Venture capital group Paradigm recently staked $581 million in HYPE tokens, setting off a wave of similar moves from influential holders. One whale added $19 million in USDC to buy HYPE, while another opened a long position valued at $4.75 million. These large entries have helped create a strong price base for the token. The platform has turned into a live arena for opposite trading strategies. On-chain data highlights the size of these positions, such as one whale holding a $103 million long on ETH, while another set up a $9.02 million short position on UNI. This steady Hyperliquid (HYPE) whale activity keeps the market intense. With strong backing from institutions and large traders, HYPE has formed a firm zone between $34 and $36. It is now moving within the $37 to $41 range, with many watching closely to see if momentum builds toward the next key level at $50. ZkSync Turns to a New Utility Model ZkSync (ZKSYNC) is preparing for a major shift with a plan to rebuild its economic system. The new ZkSync (ZKSYNC) tokenomics plan aims to turn the ZK token into a core utility asset instead of a simple governance unit. Under this model, the network will collect revenue from protocol fees and enterprise licensing, using that value to push a new growth engine. A portion of the revenue will buy back ZK tokens, with a large share permanently burned. This reduces supply, while the remaining value supports staking rewards and ecosystem grants. This plan is not limited to early ideas. The team intends to begin a token staking pilot in Q4 2025, giving holders their first chance to engage with the redesigned model. This makes the upcoming November 17 token unlock, which will release 173.08 million ZK, a major moment for traders watching supply shifts. With the Fusaka Upgrade also scheduled for December 3 to improve compatibility across networks, attention is now on how the new ZkSync (ZKSYNC) tokenomics plan may attract deeper institutional interest. Final Thoughts The market continues to follow the intense Hyperliquid (HYPE) whale activity and the structural change introduced by the latest ZkSync (ZKSYNC) tokenomics plan. Both stories highlight how active platforms adjust their systems to compete and maintain their share of the market. But this close attention to updates can make it easy to overlook the arrival of a complete shift in direction. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is not refining an old model. It enters the space as a fully built network that aims to challenge Ethereum directly. With more than $100 million invested before its presale begins, it addresses the long-standing enterprise need for privacy at scale. This level of preparation and early financial backing places it firmly in discussions about the best upcoming crypto in 2025 . It is presented as a complete, enterprise-ready base layer rather than a token still under construction. The whitelist is open now.

Why is US AI Research Falling Behind China? Konwinski, speaking at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit, revealed shocking insights from top academic institutions. “If you talk to PhD students at Berkeley and Stanford in AI right now, they’ll tell you that they’ve read twice as many interesting AI ideas in the last year that were from Chinese companies than American companies,” he stated. This represents a dramatic shift in the global AI innovation landscape that few saw coming. The Open Source Advantage: China’s Secret Weapon While major US AI labs like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic keep their breakthroughs proprietary, China is embracing open source as a strategic advantage. Konwinski points to Chinese government support for open-source AI projects from labs like DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen, allowing rapid iteration and collective improvement. Chinese AI research is predominantly open source Government actively encourages collaboration Faster innovation through shared knowledge Broader adoption and implementation The Talent Drain: How US Companies Are Killing Innovation Major US AI companies are offering multimillion-dollar salaries that dwarf academic pay, creating what Konwinski calls “an existential threat” to the American AI research ecosystem. “We’re eating our corn seeds; the fountain is drying up,” he warned, emphasizing that this short-term strategy will hurt everyone in the long run. Why Open Source Drives Breakthrough AI Innovation Konwinski reminds us that generative AI itself emerged from the Transformer architecture – a breakthrough published in a freely available research paper. “The first nation that makes the next ‘Transformer architectural level’ breakthrough will have the advantage,” he emphasized, highlighting how open source accelerates discovery. Factor United States China Research Approach Mostly proprietary Predominantly open source Government Support Limited coordination Active encouragement Talent Distribution Concentrated in private companies Spread across academia and industry Knowledge Sharing Restricted Widespread collaboration The Democracy Risk: Why This Matters Beyond Technology Konwinski frames the issue in stark terms: this isn’t just about business competition. The shift in AI research dominance represents what he calls an “existential” threat to democracy itself. When one nation controls the most powerful AI technologies, it gains unprecedented global influence. Actionable Solutions: How the US Can Regain AI Dominance Konwinski’s venture fund Laude and the Laude Institute represent one approach – offering grants to researchers and supporting open source projects. But he argues much more needs to be done: Increase government funding for open AI research Create incentives for corporate-academic collaboration Protect researcher mobility and knowledge sharing Support open source AI infrastructure development The Five-Year Warning: What Happens if We Do Nothing “Fast forward five years, the big labs are gonna lose too,” Konwinski predicted. Without a thriving academic research community feeding innovation, even the best-funded private companies will eventually stagnate. The current model of hoarding talent and research is unsustainable for long-term AI innovation . FAQs: Understanding the US-China AI Competition What companies are leading China’s AI research? Chinese companies like Alibaba with their Qwen models and research labs like DeepSeek are at the forefront of China’s open source AI push. Which US companies are mentioned as keeping research proprietary? Major AI labs including OpenAI , Meta , and Anthropic are noted for their largely closed research approaches. Who is Andy Konwinski and what are his credentials? Andy Konwinski is co-founder of Databricks and co-founder of AI research and venture capital firm Laude, giving him unique insight into both commercial and research AI landscapes. What is the Laude Institute? The Laude Institute is an accelerator run by Konwinski that offers grants to researchers, supporting the kind of open academic collaboration he argues is essential for breakthrough AI innovation . How does this affect cryptocurrency and blockchain development? As AI increasingly integrates with blockchain technologies, whichever nation leads in AI research will also shape the future of decentralized systems and smart contract capabilities. Conclusion: A Call to Action for American AI Leadership The warning from Konwinski couldn’t be more clear: the United States stands at a crossroads in artificial intelligence. Our current path of proprietary research and talent hoarding is leading us toward second-place status in the most important technological revolution of our time. The solution lies in embracing the very open source principles that drove previous American technological dominance. As the crypto community understands better than anyone, open systems often defeat closed ones through network effects and collective intelligence. The choice is ours: continue down the path of slow decline or rediscover the collaborative spirit that made American technology the envy of the world.

Daily active addresses (DAAs), a key on-chain metric, have surged 40% over the past few days. This spike in on-chain activity suggests growing demand for XRP, especially as new institutional infrastructure comes online following the launch of the first XRP spot ETF on Thursday. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Eyes Critical Breakout as Bulls Target $2.70 for Full Trend Reversal XRP has surged 8.6% in the past 24 hours, backed by a 28% jump in trading volume, signaling renewed momentum. The $2.20 level has emerged as a critical support zone, repeatedly absorbing selling pressure during recent market dips. If XRP holds this line once more, bulls may push toward a decisive move above $2.70 — a breakout that could mark the beginning of a major trend reversal. The end of the U.S. government shutdown does not seem to be doing any favors to market sentiment, as the odds that the Fed will cut rates in December dropped dramatically from 91% to 50% at the time of writing. XRP needs to climb past $ 2.70 to confirm a bullish outlook, as that would indicate a breakout above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). If XRP breaks above $2.80, it could mark the beginning of a major trend reversal — setting the stage for a rally toward $3 or even $4 as bullish momentum accelerates. But while the market waits for confirmation, early investors are already piling into Pepenode ($PEPENODE), a fast-rising crypto presale that could offer even bigger upside. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Simplifies Meme Coin Mining with Virtual Rigs Mining crypto used to mean shelling out thousands for bulky gear. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) flips that model on its head with a fully virtual mining experience , no hardware needed. Just launch rigs, climb the leaderboard, and start earning top meme coins in a gamified ecosystem built for this bull cycle. Top miners in Pepenode climb the leaderboard to unlock surprise airdrops of tokens like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), keeping the competition fierce and the rewards exciting. Players can boost their virtual rigs by spending $PEPENODE tokens, and 70% of those tokens are permanently burned — creating long-term scarcity. As more players join and upgrade their setups, demand for $PEPENODE is expected to soar, potentially driving a major breakout once the presale wraps up. To buy $PEPENODE before the next price increase, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet . You can swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead. Buy $PEPENODE Here.

Bitcoin is down 6% in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum has plunged 10%, with capital flowing out of stocks and crypto as traders brace for a potential AI bubble unwind. Despite the selloff, core crypto fundamentals remain intact, suggesting that major coins could rebound once volatility cools. At the same time, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is flashing early breakout potential, with momentum building as its presale approaches completion and prepares for its first major market debut. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 14 November Liquidations in the cryptocurrency market have topped $1 billion in the past 24 hours , underlying the negativity that’s currently dominating investors. This is unlikely to last, however, and one coin positioned to perform well once markets rebound is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based mine-to-earn token that recently opened its presale. $PEPENODE Shielding you from all of the gimmicky memes out there. It's simple. 1. Mine 2. Earn https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/EAoo8XedQu — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 25, 2025 It has now raised $2.1 million in its ongoing presale, which is starting to gain some strong momentum after going live in late September. It seems that what’s attracting investors to PEPENODE is its unique mine-to-earn system, which will enable users to earn rewards without having to invest in traditional (and expensive) mining equipment. What PEPENODE does is provide investors with the ability to build their own virtual mining rigs, which they can then use to mine for tokens such as the original Pepe and Fartcoin. And what’s especially bullish is that users can buy more virtual nodes by spending PEPENODE itself, with more nodes equalling greater rewards. As such, there will be a real incentive to buy more PEPENODE, boosting the coin’s price over time. Staking Yields and How to Buy Early It’s also worth pointing out that holders will be able to stake the token, with PEPENODE currently offering a staking yield of 605%. We could therefore witness big demand for the token, which will launch after its presale closes. Investors can join this sale by going to the coin’s official website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. $PEPENODE is currently available at a price of $0.0011454, although this will rise every three days until the sale ends. Interested buyers should get moving, with the coin showing potential for a big rally once it lists, especially if the market has become more bullish by the time it launches.

Shetty was reportedly hired in March 2021 as chief financial officer (CFO) of a private software company that was in the process of raising multiple rounds of funding. Shetty commingled funds as CFO As part of his role, Shetty helped draft an investment policy statement that limited corporate cash to FDIC-insured bank and treasury accounts, a conservative approach intended to preserve capital as the business scaled. Despite this, prosecutors found that between April 1 and 12, 2022, after being informed the previous month that he would no longer continue as CFO due to performance concerns, Shetty secretly transferred $35,000,100 from the company’s account into an entity he had created, named HighTower Treasury. The firm’s board and executive team were reportedly unaware of the transfers. Shetty’s crypto gamble falls flat Once the funds were in HighTower Treasury, Shetty invested them into decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols that promised yields of roughly 20%. He was planning to pay his former employer 6% of the promised interest while keeping the rest for himself and his business partner. The illegal venture earned him and his partner about $133,000 in the first month. However, everything went on a downward spiral after that, and by May 13, 2022, the value of the investment had collapsed to near zero as the crypto markets plunged. After the loss, Shetty confessed to two colleagues and was fired immediately. The company reported the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ). Closing their arguments and speaking to the jury on what inspired Shetty to commit the crime, the prosecutor stated that it was “Greed – to line his own pockets. That is what explains his lying, sneaking around, and telling half-truths.” Trial and conviction The nine-day jury trial concluded on 7 November 2025, and after roughly ten hours of deliberation, the jury returned a guilty verdict. Shetty faces sentencing on 11 February 2026 and may be looking at up to 20 years in prison because wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of that same number of years of imprisonment. U.S. Attorney Neil Floyd said, “This defendant exploited his position of power and trust in an attempt to profit from his crime and then lied to cover it up.” The fact that Shetty helped author the company’s conservative investment policy and then acted in direct violation of it also shows how formal controls are only as good as the integrity and oversight of those who implement them. From the crypto angle, the case also speaks to the danger of overleveraging into DeFi protocols promising aggressive yields , only to see the value vanish due to the volatility, the infamous drawback that has dogged the crypto market since day one.

As of November 14, 2025, the asset has declined by 1.92% within 24 hours, moving from a recent peak of $2.52 to an intraday low of $2.32. Despite this pullback, trading activity remained strong, recording approximately $7.3 billion in volume. The asset is still holding a slight gain of 2.9% over the past week, although its performance over the last two weeks shows a cumulative decline of 7.8%. Technical Overview: Critical Areas to Watch Current price action shows XRP trading close to a key technical threshold. The daily chart places the asset around $2.32, which is closely aligned with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level near $2.30. This region represents the first major area where buyers may attempt to stabilize the market after the recent decline. Should XRP fall below this zone, the next important level appears at roughly $2.21, which coincides with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement mark. A breakdown toward that level would signal weakening momentum and may expose the market to additional downward pressure. The support around $2.2172 is particularly important for establishing any meaningful shift in direction. Sustaining price action above this lower retracement increases the likelihood of buyers attempting to regain control, with the next significant resistance forming near the $2.50 region. A move back toward this range would indicate market stabilization after the recent volatility. Technical indicators reflect a mixed environment. The MACD line is currently positioned above the signal line, which generally indicates early signs of recovery. The histogram remains in positive territory, suggesting that downward momentum may be moderating. While this does not guarantee an immediate rally, it highlights the potential for a near-term price improvement if support levels remain intact.

According to Coinglass, approximately $28 million in XRP positions were liquidated over the last 24 hours. Notably, long positions represented the majority of these expirations, with losses totaling $24.94 million, compared to $3.06 million from short positions. This imbalance shows that traders anticipating a continued upward move were significantly impacted by the price correction. Shorter-term intervals show similarly strong liquidation activity. Over one hour, about $1 million in total liquidations were recorded, split between $675,410 in short positions and $328,910 in long positions. The four-hour window produced an even larger figure, $8.54 million, with long positions once again representing the bulk of forced closures. The concentration of long liquidations indicates a shift in sentiment as traders adjust their expectations following the asset’s rapid decline. If XRP continues consolidating near current levels, market participants are likely to remain cautious until clear signs of recovery emerge and the critical support region demonstrates durability.

According to recent analysis, the current cryptocurrency landscape shows surprising resilience that contradicts typical bear market patterns. Let’s explore why experts believe we’re experiencing something entirely different. What Exactly Defines a Bear Market? CryptoQuant contributor CrazzyBlockk provides clear insights into what separates normal market corrections from genuine bear markets. A true bear market typically emerges when panic selling becomes widespread, often triggered by short-term investors facing substantial losses between 20-40%. This creates a domino effect that drives prices significantly lower. However, the current situation tells a different story. Recent data reveals that short-term investors are experiencing much smaller losses, ranging from just 5-13%. This crucial difference suggests we’re not witnessing the panic-driven selloff that characterizes actual bear markets. Why Current Conditions Don’t Match Bear Market Patterns The absence of several key bear market indicators provides compelling evidence that we’re in a different phase entirely. Consider these important factors: Limited panic selling among short-term investors Moderate loss ranges well below bear market thresholds Sustained investor confidence despite price fluctuations Healthy market fundamentals supporting current valuations These conditions align more closely with what analysts call a mid-cycle correction. This represents a healthy market adjustment rather than the beginning of a prolonged downturn. How Can Investors Navigate This Market Phase? Understanding the difference between a correction and a bear market provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making. Mid-cycle corrections typically offer excellent opportunities for long-term investors to accumulate positions at favorable prices. Key strategies during this phase include: Focusing on fundamental analysis rather than short-term price movements Dollar-cost averaging into strong projects Maintaining a diversified portfolio Avoiding emotional trading decisions based on temporary dips Remember that market corrections serve an important purpose in shaking out weak hands and establishing stronger support levels for future growth. The Big Picture: What This Means for Crypto Investors The analysis strongly suggests we’re experiencing normal market behavior rather than the beginning of a bear market. This perspective becomes crucial when making investment decisions and setting realistic expectations. Historical patterns show that mid-cycle corrections often precede significant upward movements. By recognizing these patterns, investors can maintain perspective during temporary market weakness and avoid making fear-based decisions that could undermine long-term strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What’s the main difference between a correction and a bear market? A correction represents a temporary price decline of 10-20%, while a bear market involves sustained declines of 20% or more over an extended period, typically accompanied by widespread pessimism. How long do mid-cycle corrections typically last? Mid-cycle corrections in cryptocurrency markets usually last several weeks to a few months, though duration can vary based on market conditions and external factors. Should I change my investment strategy during a correction? Corrections often present buying opportunities for long-term investors, but it’s crucial to maintain your risk management strategy and only invest what you can afford to lose. What signs would indicate we’re entering a true bear market? Key indicators include sustained losses above 20% for most investors, prolonged negative sentiment, declining trading volumes, and breaking of major support levels. How reliable are these market phase classifications? While helpful for context, market phases should inform rather than dictate investment decisions. Always combine technical analysis with fundamental research. Can corrections turn into bear markets? Yes, if negative catalysts emerge or market conditions deteriorate significantly. However, most corrections resolve positively within the broader market cycle. Found this analysis helpful? Share these insights with fellow investors who might be worrying about market conditions.

Investors looking for the top altcoins to buy this week face growing pressure to identify projects that combine momentum, strong fundamentals, and structured presale mechanics. With token supplies dwindling at ultra‑low entry prices, early participants can potentially capture remarkable returns if the market reacts favorably. Beyond mere hype, the presale stage, scarcity model, and community adoption are becoming critical success factors for new crypto projects. Savvy investors are analyzing metrics like token distribution, holder growth, staking rewards, and projected listing prices to make well‑timed moves that could significantly outperform established coins over the coming months. Enter a new era of crypto investing where measurable tokenomics, presale stages, and community engagement determine which projects gain serious traction. Traditional, excitement-driven decisions are giving way to data-backed strategies that emphasize long-term value creation. This article highlights five crypto coins set to explode, focusing on their presale dynamics, staking incentives, and liquidity structures. Among these, one project emerges as a particularly compelling opportunity, blending aggressive ROI potential with proven growth mechanics. Readers will gain insights into key indicators such as scarcity progression, listing price milestones, and APY-based rewards, helping them navigate volatile markets while aiming for strong upside. These insights are essential for identifying the top altcoins to buy this week. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL) – Top Altcoins to Buy This Week Promises Structured Growth Among the top altcoins to buy this week , BullZilla (BZIL) blazes ahead. Currently on Stage 10 (Castle Bravo), pricing at $0.00025239. To date, the presale has raised over $1 M, boasts over 3,500 token holders, and has sold over 31 billion tokens. Early joiners at Stage 10B already enjoy a current ROI of around 1,988.6%, and those who joined even earlier are at 4,289.4%. A $1,000 investment at $0.00025239 earns roughly 3.962 million BZIL tokens today. The next price step (Stage 10C) moves from $0.00025239 to $0.00025906 (2.64% increase). What sets BullZilla apart: a presale that uses a structured stage model with built-in scarcity. A strong narrative exists not only around growth but around the upcoming listing price of $0.00527. Frequently Asked Questions About Bullzilla Presale What makes BullZilla a strong presale investment? BullZilla’s multi-stage presale, low entry price, and token scarcity, combined with staking incentives, community growth, and potential upcoming listings, position it as one of the top altcoins to buy this week for significant ROI opportunities. How much ROI can early BullZilla investors expect? Early participants in Stage 10B have already seen ROI surpass 4,200%, with future stages expected to deliver further gains, illustrating why BZIL presale investors are closely watching the project for potentially exponential returns on timely investments. How does the presale stage affect BullZilla’s token value? Each presale stage reduces token availability, increasing scarcity and raising potential listing prices. Stage progression directly influences ROI for early participants, creating strong incentives for investors to join promptly and maximize their BullZilla presale rewards. 2. Ripple ($XRP) – Established Asset Ready for Upside When exploring the top altcoins to buy this week, Ripple (XRP) remains a familiar but still significant candidate. Unlike early‑stage presales, XRP is a well‑established token with deep institutional relationships. Key indicators include regulatory clarity (in major markets), an active developer ecosystem, and broad exchange listings. For investors seeking projects beyond speculative hype, Ripple offers a large‑cap alternative. While ROI potential is more modest than that of micro‑cap presales, the risk profile is relatively lower. Metrics to watch: transaction volume, new partnerships, on‑chain staking (where applicable), and overall token circulation trends. XRP’s listing price dynamics and its role in cross‑border payments may drive renewed interest. 3. MoonBull ($MOBU) – Meme Mechanics Meet DeFi Structure Among the top altcoins to buy this week, MoonBull (MOBU) is carving out a niche where meme culture meets structured DeFi. Its presale is built on Ethereum, supports staking with up to 95% APY, uses a 23‑stage scarcity system, and features locked liquidity with audit documentation. The model rewards conviction and long‑term holders rather than quick flips. It also incorporates referral bonuses and a token burn/auto‑liquidity system. Such mechanics offer a more sustainable path to value growth than pure hype coins. As industry analysts note, presales built around clear mechanics are outperforming unstructured launches. Investors looking at the top altcoins to buy this week might view MoonBull as a strong mid‑tier risk/reward balance: less “safe” than large caps like XRP, but less speculative than brand‑new micro‑presales. Frequently Asked Questions About MoonBull What makes MoonBull staking unique?

The presale spans 32 stages, pushing scarcity as supply dwindles, with a listing target of $0.007.Community incentives include 80% APY via staking (Hive Vault) and a 12% referral system.

For portfolio diversification, Bitcoin provides a foundation of safety, allowing investors to pair it with higher-risk altcoins. Its network security, capped supply, and continuous development make BTC a perennial choice for both new and seasoned crypto participants. 7. Ethereum ($ETH): The Smart Contract Leader Ethereum (ETH) remains a top altcoin to buy this week thanks to its unmatched smart contract ecosystem and DeFi dominance. ETH’s strength stems from its broad adoption across decentralized applications, NFTs, and layer‑2 scaling solutions, which drive long-term demand for the token. Investors track key indicators like active developer activity, gas usage, staking participation, and upcoming protocol upgrades, which can significantly influence price and adoption. ETH staking provides annualized yields while reducing circulating supply, creating added scarcity and upside potential. Compared with newer presales, Ethereum balances growth opportunities with stability. Its continuous upgrades, including energy-efficient consensus mechanisms and interoperability improvements, make it a compelling choice for investors seeking both sustainable returns and exposure to foundational blockchain technology. 8. Solana ($SOL): Big‑Cap Platform with Upside Potential Among the top altcoins to buy this week, Solana (SOL) stands out as a platform-level investment rather than a speculative presale. Its high throughput, low transaction costs, and fast block times have attracted a thriving ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFTs, and decentralized applications. Investors evaluating SOL monitor key indicators, such as network growth, user adoption, daily transaction volume, and active wallets, alongside ecosystem expansions, including new dApps, cross-chain bridges, and partnerships. Staking participation and whale accumulation metrics provide insight into long-term confidence in the token. While Solana’s upside may not match ultra-low-entry presales, it offers stability, lower volatility, and meaningful exposure to the infrastructure layer of crypto, making it a strategic choice for balanced portfolios seeking sustainable growth. Conclusion At the same time, Ripple, MoonBull, La Culex, and Solana diversify the risk‑reward spectrum. BullZilla roars among the top altcoins to buy this week with its structured presale mechanics, rising holder base, and early ROI that already impresses. For investors seeking bold upside, its listing target of $0.00527 and current price of $0.00025239 offer a clear jump‑off point. Ripple offers institutional strength, Solana offers platform exposure, while MoonBull and La Culex bring meme‑coin upside wrapped in tokenomics. If a $1,000 investment could turn into $100,000 within a few months, BullZilla currently stands at the head of the table. But success hinges on timing, execution, and market conditions. Investors should verify official links, perform due diligence, and understand that high upside comes with high risk.

According to a statement from Google on Friday, November 14, this investment is expected to continue through 2027. One of the data centers will be located in Armstrong County, which is in the Texas Panhandle, while two others will be situated in Haskell County, near Abilene. Moreover, one of the facilities in Haskell will work in conjunction with a new solar and battery energy storage plant to help alleviate strain on the power grid. “This investment will create thousands of jobs, offer skills training for college students and electrical apprentices, and speed up energy affordability projects across Texas,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, during an event near Dallas where Google already operates two other data centers. Google eyes Texas for expansion with substantial investments in the state Texas has become a prime location for data centers because companies are drawn to its lower energy costs, extensive available land areas, and a state government that supports infrastructure for the growing artificial intelligence sector. In sharing its plans , Google highlighted its dedication to adding new energy resources to the grid, covering operational costs, and backing community energy efficiency programs. Additionally, the company announced that an electrical training program would increase the number of apprentices in Texas with support from Google.org’s AI Opportunity Fund. During an event with Pichai, Texas Governor Greg Abbott commented on the topic of discussion. Abbott predicted that Texas would become the main hub for Google’s AI data centers. He argued that companies can come to Texas and carry out their operations knowing that the state acts quickly in business. Meanwhile, after-hours trading, Alphabet’s stock increased by 1.7%, following a closing price of $276.41 in New York. It is worth noting that Texas is also attracting commitments from other businesses. Texas positions itself as a hub for tech investment Texas has solidified its position as a hub for tech-related investments. To support this claim, sources noted that Anthropic announced plans to invest $50 billion in data centers across the US, including locations in New York and Texas, which offer ample land and lower energy costs, earlier this week. The facilities, which are part of the company’s broader effort to remain competitive in the AI infrastructure market, are being developed in collaboration with Fluidstack. The firm is targeting its enterprise clients, the ones responsible for most of its revenue, and these new sites are built to match the size of that demand. Moreover, the first data center being developed by the Stargate project, supported by OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT), Oracle Corporation, and SoftBank Group Corporation, is located in Abilene, Texas. Company leaders have indicated that they will establish more facilities in the state. On the other hand, Meta Platforms Inc. is constructing a new data center in Texas, capable of generating a gigawatt of power. To put it into perspective, a gigawatt can simultaneously supply power to 750,000 people. Additionally, Microsoft Corp. signed a nearly $10 billion agreement earlier this month for five years of computing capacity in Texas. Fermi Inc., a real estate investment trust co-founded by Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas and energy secretary under President Donald Trump, also revealed plans to construct four nuclear power reactors in the state for a private data center campus. As for Google’s plan, analysts noted that the tech giant typically makes significant spending promises, and this year, an investment of more than $90 billion in capital expenses is expected. The figure is much greater than originally thought, with the majority of the money coming from servers, customized chips, and new data centers to support its AI and cloud services.

The company’s mNAV multiple just dipped below the critical threshold of 1, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency investment community. This significant development raises important questions about investor confidence and Bitcoin valuation metrics. What Exactly is the mNAV Multiple? The mNAV multiple serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency investment firms. It measures a company’s market capitalization against the total value of its Bitcoin holdings. When this mNAV multiple falls below 1, it indicates the market values the company less than the Bitcoin it owns. This mNAV multiple calculation provides clear insights into market sentiment. Why Should Investors Care About This mNAV Multiple Drop? The recent decline in Strategy’s mNAV multiple below 1 signals several potential concerns: Weakening investor confidence in the company’s management Potential debt or liquidity issues affecting market perception Sustainability concerns about long-term operations Market skepticism about future growth prospects This mNAV multiple movement often precedes significant market adjustments. What Triggered the mNAV Multiple Decline? Market analysts point to Strategy’s substantial Bitcoin transfer as a key factor. The company moved 58,915 BTC, valued at approximately $6.04 billion, to a new address. Such large transactions typically influence the mNAV multiple as investors reassess risk factors and company stability. How Does the mNAV Multiple Affect Your Investment Strategy? Understanding the mNAV multiple helps investors make informed decisions. When the mNAV multiple drops below 1, it may indicate: Potential buying opportunities if the company fundamentals remain strong Need for closer monitoring of company financial health Possible market overreaction creating temporary undervaluation Important signals about broader cryptocurrency market trends What’s Next for Strategy’s mNAV Multiple? Market watchers will closely monitor how Strategy’s mNAV multiple evolves in coming weeks. The company’s response to market concerns and its Bitcoin management strategy will significantly impact whether the mNAV multiple recovers or continues facing pressure. This mNAV multiple situation serves as a valuable case study for cryptocurrency investors. Key Takeaways for Smart Investors The mNAV multiple provides essential insights beyond simple stock prices. This recent mNAV multiple movement below 1 emphasizes the importance of: Regularly monitoring key financial metrics like the mNAV multiple Understanding the relationship between Bitcoin holdings and company valuation Recognizing early warning signs in cryptocurrency investments Maintaining diversified investment strategies Frequently Asked Questions What does mNAV multiple below 1 mean? When the mNAV multiple falls below 1, it means the company’s market capitalization is less than the value of its Bitcoin holdings, indicating potential undervaluation or market concerns. How often does Strategy’s mNAV multiple change? The mNAV multiple fluctuates daily based on both Bitcoin price movements and changes in the company’s stock price, making it a dynamic metric. Is a low mNAV multiple always bad? Not necessarily. While a low mNAV multiple can signal concerns, it may also present buying opportunities if company fundamentals remain strong. How can I track the mNAV multiple? You can monitor the mNAV multiple through financial data platforms, cryptocurrency analytics websites, and company financial reports. What other companies use mNAV multiple? Several cryptocurrency and Bitcoin-focused investment firms utilize similar metrics to assess their premium value relative to digital asset holdings. Can the mNAV multiple predict Bitcoin prices? While the mNAV multiple reflects market sentiment, it’s not a direct predictor of Bitcoin prices but rather indicates how the market values companies holding Bitcoin.

His comments came during a recent discussion with CoinDesk, where he evaluated the token’s progression and the factors that supported its development. Novogratz noted that only a small number of cryptocurrencies have passed the point where people rely on them as a monetary instrument rather than a speculative asset. He stated that XRP is one of the few that has accomplished this transition, a result he considers unusual within the broader market. He explained that creating a digital asset that functions as money is a complex task involving technology, long-term stability, and user conviction. According to him, XRP’s ability to cross this threshold distinguishes it within the industry. Novogratz acknowledged that the achievement was unexpected even to him, despite his firm’s early exposure to Ripple as an investor. ""How do you turn something from being a token into money?… XRP has done it."" Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz ( @novogratz ) called it early. Today, the market confirmed it: The $XRPC ETF has just broken BSOL’s record for the biggest day-one debut of the year. Thank you @OwlTing … pic.twitter.com/KdqjFinmsO — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) November 13, 2025 Early Doubts and How They Changed Over Time During the interview, Novogratz reflected on the skepticism he previously shared with many critics. He recalled concerns about XRP’s architecture, governance, and the degree of decentralization associated with the network. These criticisms were common among early crypto adopters who believed that only certain models of blockchain systems could succeed. However, he stated that the issues he once emphasized eventually became less significant than he anticipated. Over time, Ripple’s corporate development, combined with consistent user commitment, reshaped his view. Novogratz emphasized that while Ripple’s growth played an important role, it was not the only factor that shifted perception. Community Influence and Its Impact on XRP’s Status According to Novogratz, one of the decisive elements behind XRP’s evolution was the persistence of its global community. He observed that XRP supporters maintained long-term confidence in the asset throughout market downturns, regulatory disputes, and extended periods of criticism from industry commentators. He argued that this sustained commitment strengthened the token’s position and contributed to the point where many users treat XRP as a dependable monetary instrument. Novogratz stated that community strength is now a significant driver of success within the crypto sector and that XRP is a clear example of this dynamic. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His remarks are consistent with previous statements in which he conceded that his early assessment of XRP’s potential was inaccurate. He has also compared the discipline of the XRP community to that of major crypto groups, highlighting how collective confidence can influence the use and perceived value of digital assets. Broader Context and Industry Implications Novogratz pointed out that communities can exert substantial influence over how digital assets are adopted, interpreted, and valued. He noted that similar patterns are evident in other industries, where strong user groups shape how companies or products are perceived. In his view, XRP’s trajectory shows that community-driven support can elevate a token from speculative trading to practical monetary use. He also emphasized that the strength of a token’s user base can at times outweigh traditional evaluations based on network structure or design. XRP’s continued presence in the market, particularly during periods of regulatory scrutiny, demonstrates, in his view, that sustained community confidence can enhance longevity and relevance. Novogratz’s latest assessment comes at a time when XRP-related investment products, including recently launched exchange-traded funds, are gaining traction and recording significant interest in early 2025. His comments are likely to be seen as notable recognition by supporters who have long argued that XRP has maintained a distinct position within the digital asset market.

Solana URPD Reveals Supply Chasm Below $144 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Solana support is looking from an on-chain lens. In on-chain analysis, the potential of any price level to act as support or resistance lies in the amount of coins that investors last purchased at it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $98,000 As HODLer Selling Accelerates The reasoning behind this is that holders look at their cost basis as a special level and are sensitive to retests of it. The more holders that have their cost basis at a particular level, the larger the reaction from a retest could theoretically be. As for what the nature of this reaction is likely to be, it comes down to the direction of the retest, as well as the mood in the market. When the retest occurs from above, holders might decide to accumulate more, thinking that the decline is a temporary dip and they would return in profit again. Retests of major supply levels from above can, for this reason, provide support to the cryptocurrency. Similarly, retests in the opposite direction may be met with resistance, as holders panic exit at their break-even level, fearing going underwater again. To showcase how the supply cost basis distribution on the Solana network is like right now, Martinez has shared the data of the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) from Glassnode. As is visible in the above graph, the largest Solana supply zones on this indicator are all located above $144. Below this level, the cryptocurrency has relatively thin clusters. “There’s barely any meaningful demand until $24,” noted the analyst. SOL has already started slipping under the last major support level of $144, so it only remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency will develop in the near future, considering the lack of any meaningful on-chain support cushions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Most Fearful Since March: Is A Bottom Near? In a separate X post, Martinez has also shared the URPD data for Bitcoin. Unlike Solana, the number one cryptocurrency’s supply distribution is more even, meaning the asset has levels to rely on below the current range. In particular, $82,000 and $67,000 are two levels below $95,000 that hold the cost basis of a significant amount of supply, and thus, could potentially be support barriers on the way down. SOL Price Solana dropped to $135 during its latest plunge, but the coin has since recovered back to $141.

According to co-CEO Arjun Sethi, the exchange is “financially sound” and holds enough capital on its balance sheet as a private company. Kraken has raised $530 million since its 2011 founding, with a $500 million round in September that valued the firm at $15 billion. “We have enough capital on our balance sheet as a private company,” Sethi said. “We don’t race to the door as quickly as possible.” Company Says It Has Plenty Of Capital Sethi told Yahoo Finance that Kraken won’t rush things up just because peers are going public. Reports have disclosed that other crypto firms have seized the moment; still, Kraken’s leaders say they prefer to set their own timetable. A Wave Of Crypto Listings Has Shifted Investor Views Several rival businesses have listed this year, and that has helped push investor interest in crypto firms. Circle’s IPO attracted attention after shares jumped over 160% to above $83, and a later rally briefly boosted the price past $260 before cooling back to about $82. Grayscale filed to debut in the US as others, including Gemini, Bullish and eToro, completed listings. Custody firm BitGo also filed to go public in September. Clues On Profitability Sethi argued that early movers are educating investors on margins and business models. He said seeing public filings helps buyers and sellers better judge which revenue streams matter. Market Drop Tests Exchanges’ Fortitude Bitcoin has slid amid a wider market wobble. Based on reports, the coin fell over 4% in the past day to near $97,000, marking more than a 22% pullback from a peak above $126,000 in early October. Crypto-related stocks also weakened. Cipher Mining sank 14%, Riot Platforms and Hut 8 each fell 13%, and MARA Holdings and Bitmine Immersion slipped over 10%. Coinbase and Strategy dropped around 6%. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 15, hitting seven-month lows as investor mood turned cautious. Kraken Downplays Short-Term Price Swings Sethi did not sound alarmed by the drop, saying the long-term reasons people buy Bitcoin or Ethereum matter more than brief moves. He emphasized looking at the “thesis” behind assets rather than chasing daily swings. That stance was presented as part of a wider company approach that favors steady risk management over reactive moves. No Rush Despite Policy Signals And Peer Listings Based on reports, the friendlier regulatory posture from US President Donald Trump’s administration and improving market conditions have prompted some firms to go public. Still, Kraken’s leadership says timing should fit its own targets. Bloomberg reported earlier that the company had been lining up an IPO possibly as early as the first quarter of 2026, but Kraken’s co-CEO stressed there is no FOMO driving the decision.

The firm named Chi Tsang as the new Chief Executive Officer, and he now sits on the Board of Directors. The move represents a drastic shift for the company as it transforms from a mining-oriented company to an enormous digital asset treasury. Alongside Tsang’s appointment, BitMin e appointed three new independent board members: Robert Sechan, Olivia Howe, and Jason Edgeworth. All appointments took effect immediately. The outgoing CEO, Jonathan Bates, said the transition from a digital miner to a publicly listed entity and making BitMine the world’s largest holding company of Ethereum has been “an incredible journey.” He stepped aside with the assumption that the new heads were equipped to further the company. Chairman Thomas “Tom” Lee stated that the new team, composed of veterans from technology, decentralized finance, and global financial markets, would lead the program. He noted that BitMine was emerging at what he described as a critical moment, when Ethereum was beginning to reshape the behaviour of capital markets. Lee added that he believed the company was now positioned to act as a point of contact between traditional finance and what he referred to as the “Supercycle Ethereum era.” The new CEO, Chi Tsang, echoed this. He likened the current revolution in blockchain to the explosion of mobile phones and the internet in the 1990s. The strength of BitMine’s position on Ethereum and its credibility among Wall Street and the crypto community make it a potential global financial institution based on the creation of digital assets in the future, he said. Ether Holdings surge as the company changes course BitMine’s new leadership comes as the company has posted a steep increase in its Ethereum holdings. Currently managing over 3.5 million ETH, representing nearly 3 percent of the total Ethereum supply. All this makes BitMine one of the biggest single holders of Ether on Earth. The firm’s crypto, cash, and long-shot investments account for a total value of nearly $ 13.2 billion. Its Treasury also includes roughly 400 million dollars of unencumbered cash, some Bitcoin, and an array of early-stage “moonshot” assets. Its recent accumulation pace has been one of the highlights — or at least a way of celebrating it. In just a week, the company acquired more than 110,000 ETH — nearly one-third of the previous week’s buying rate. BitMine has also been open about its goal: to own roughly 5 percent of the current circulating Ethereum. It’s an aggressive move that reveals something about what is happening beyond the gold miner. BitMine is increasingly becoming something akin to an asset bank or Treasury, with some individuals holding terms of 5 to 10 years, effectively serving as a long-term crypto reserve. Ethereum woes test BitMine’s market resilience Despite the company’s high-profile strategy, BitMine’s share price has come under pressure over the past few days. Such a drop comes along with broader declines in Ethereum’s value. Investors have described companies with substantial crypto treasuries as having better market sensitivity. As crypto prices diminish, the market value of these companies frequently also suffers an accelerated loss. Investors will assess whether the leadership change will give BitMine’s strategic direction new life or inject some immediate risk into the short term. Analysts are also questioning whether BitMine’s explosive Ethereum accumulation is sustainable amid a market that’s far from steady-state and heavily regulated. Still, the company’s board members sounded optimistic. Robert Sechan commended Tom Lee’s longstanding record of spotting leading technological and financial trends early. Olivia Howe said she has watched BitMine grow from an obscure company into the world’s largest Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury. Jason Edgeworth emphasized that he considers BitMine a major player in Ethereum infrastructure and still sees it as driving further shareholder value. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The market’s emotional barometer just hit its lowest point since February, plunging to a worrying 10 points. This dramatic drop signals that extreme fear has gripped cryptocurrency investors worldwide, creating both challenges and opportunities for savvy traders. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional thermometer. It calculates investor sentiment using six key factors that reveal how traders truly feel about cryptocurrency prices. The index ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents maximum fear and 100 indicates extreme greed. Currently sitting at just 10 points, we’re witnessing one of the most fearful market environments in recent months. The index components break down as follows: Market volatility: 25% weight Trading volume: 25% weight Social media mentions: 15% weight Market surveys: 15% weight Bitcoin dominance: 10% weight Google search trends: 10% weight Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear Levels? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits such low numbers, it often creates contrarian opportunities. Historically, extreme fear periods have frequently preceded market rebounds. However, this current reading also suggests heightened risk and potential for further price declines. Understanding these sentiment extremes helps you make informed decisions rather than emotional ones. Market veterans know that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides valuable context beyond price charts. It helps answer crucial questions: Are we approaching a market bottom? Is this panic selling or rational caution? The current 10-point reading clearly indicates widespread panic among cryptocurrency participants. How Can You Use This Information Strategically? Monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index gives you an edge in market timing. When fear dominates, consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into quality projects Setting limit orders at key support levels Diversifying across different cryptocurrency sectors Maintaining cash reserves for potential opportunities Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures current sentiment, not future performance. While extreme fear often precedes buying opportunities, it doesn’t guarantee immediate rebounds. Use this tool as part of a comprehensive strategy rather than your sole decision-maker. What Historical Patterns Reveal About Fear Cycles Previous instances where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reached similar lows provide valuable lessons. In February 2025, when the index last touched these levels, markets experienced significant volatility before establishing stronger foundations. Studying these patterns helps you understand that extreme fear periods, while uncomfortable, are normal market cycles. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 10 represents more than just numbers—it captures the collective psychology of millions of investors. This emotional extreme often creates the best long-term entry points for patient investors who can withstand short-term uncertainty. FAQs: Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index What time frame does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index cover? The index updates daily and reflects current market sentiment based on real-time data from multiple sources. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price movements? While it doesn’t predict exact prices, extreme readings often signal potential trend reversals or continuations. How accurate is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? It provides reliable sentiment measurements but should complement other analysis tools rather than replace them. Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? You can find daily updates on Alternative.me and various cryptocurrency data platforms. Does the index work for altcoins or just Bitcoin? While Bitcoin-heavy, it reflects overall cryptocurrency market sentiment affecting all digital assets. How often should I check the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Regular monitoring helps, but avoid overreacting to daily fluctuations—focus on broader trends. Share This Market Insight Found this analysis of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

Are you wondering where Bitcoin might be heading next? According to Ledn’s Chief Investment Officer John Glover, the cryptocurrency could experience a significant downturn, potentially falling to $84,000. This surprising Bitcoin price prediction comes from detailed technical analysis that suggests we might see some turbulence ahead in the crypto markets. What Does This Bitcoin Price Prediction Mean for Investors? John Glover’s analysis points to a potential drop in Bitcoin’s value based on key technical indicators. The expert explains that since Bitcoin breached the $100,000 support level, which represented a 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, the path has opened to the next major support at $84,000. This Bitcoin price prediction isn’t all doom and gloom though – Glover anticipates Bitcoin will likely reclaim the $100,000 mark before falling below $90,000. Why Should You Pay Attention to This Analysis? Technical analysis provides valuable insights for cryptocurrency investors. The current Bitcoin price prediction suggests we’re entering a corrective phase that could extend until summer 2026. Here are the key factors supporting this outlook: Fibonacci retracement levels indicating support breakdown Historical price pattern analysis Market momentum indicators Long-term trend projections How Can You Navigate This Potential Market Shift? While this Bitcoin price prediction might concern some investors, it’s important to remember that market corrections are normal in cryptocurrency cycles. The analysis suggests this could be a healthy pullback before the next major upward movement. Understanding these patterns helps investors make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions to market volatility. What Timeframe Are We Looking At? The current Bitcoin price prediction indicates this corrective phase could last until summer 2026. This extended timeframe suggests we’re looking at a gradual adjustment rather than a sudden crash. Investors should consider this when planning their strategies and remember that cryptocurrency markets often move in multi-year cycles. Key Takeaways from This Bitcoin Price Prediction Glover’s analysis provides several important insights for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This Bitcoin price prediction highlights the importance of technical analysis in understanding market movements. The potential drop to $84,000 represents a significant support level that could provide buying opportunities for long-term investors. Meanwhile, the expected reclaim of $100,000 before further decline suggests we might see some volatility in the coming months. Frequently Asked Questions What is Fibonacci retracement in Bitcoin trading? Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool that uses horizontal lines to indicate potential support and resistance levels based on Fibonacci numbers. How reliable are these Bitcoin price predictions? While technical analysis provides valuable insights, all cryptocurrency predictions should be considered as educated estimates rather than guarantees. Should I sell my Bitcoin based on this prediction? Investment decisions should be based on your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall market research rather than any single prediction. What other factors could affect Bitcoin’s price? Bitcoin’s price can be influenced by regulatory developments, institutional adoption, macroeconomic factors, and technological advancements. How long do cryptocurrency correction phases typically last? Correction phases can vary significantly, from several months to multiple years, depending on market conditions and broader economic factors. What support levels should I watch for Bitcoin? Key support levels to monitor include $100,000, $90,000, and the predicted $84,000 level mentioned in this analysis. Found this Bitcoin price prediction analysis helpful?

Michael Saylor just revealed MicroStrategy’s groundbreaking approach to building their cryptocurrency reserves. The company’s CEO announced through his X platform that they’ve executed their Bitcoin buying strategy every single day this week, demonstrating unprecedented commitment to digital asset acquisition. What Makes This Bitcoin Buying Strategy So Revolutionary? MicroStrategy’s daily purchasing approach represents a significant shift in how corporations view cryptocurrency investment. Instead of waiting for market dips or specific entry points, the company has adopted a consistent accumulation model. This Bitcoin buying strategy eliminates timing risks and reinforces their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition. The company now holds one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries globally. Their systematic approach demonstrates how institutional investors can implement dollar-cost averaging at scale. This method smooths out price volatility while steadily increasing their cryptocurrency exposure. How Does Daily Bitcoin Acquisition Impact Market Sentiment? When a publicly traded company commits to daily Bitcoin purchases, it sends powerful signals across financial markets. This consistent Bitcoin buying strategy creates several important effects: Reduced volatility through continuous demand Increased institutional confidence in cryptocurrency markets Demonstration of long-term commitment beyond speculative trading Validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset Market analysts observe that such persistent accumulation strategies help stabilize Bitcoin’s price during turbulent periods. The knowledge that major buyers remain active provides psychological support to retail and institutional investors alike. What Challenges Does This Bitcoin Strategy Overcome? Implementing a daily Bitcoin buying strategy at the corporate level presents unique challenges that MicroStrategy has successfully navigated. The company has developed sophisticated execution methods to minimize market impact while maximizing accumulation efficiency. Regulatory compliance remains paramount, and the company’s transparent reporting demonstrates how corporations can integrate cryptocurrency into traditional financial frameworks. Their approach provides a blueprint for other companies considering similar treasury diversification strategies. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to This Approach? MicroStrategy’s consistent Bitcoin buying strategy offers valuable lessons for all cryptocurrency investors. The company’s success with this method highlights several key principles: Consistency matters more than timing in long-term wealth building Transparent strategy execution builds investor confidence Corporate adoption drives mainstream cryptocurrency acceptance Strategic accumulation outperforms emotional trading decisions This disciplined approach to Bitcoin acquisition demonstrates how removing emotion from investment decisions can yield superior results over time. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The sustained implementation of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying strategy signals growing institutional maturity in cryptocurrency markets. As more companies observe their success, we can expect increased corporate adoption of similar accumulation methods. This trend could accelerate Bitcoin’s transition from speculative asset to established treasury reserve. The daily purchasing pattern establishes a foundation for more stable price discovery and reduced manipulation susceptibility. Conclusion: A Blueprint for Institutional Crypto Adoption Michael Saylor’s revelation about MicroStrategy’s daily Bitcoin purchases represents more than just corporate news—it provides a working model for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Their systematic Bitcoin buying strategy demonstrates how companies can responsibly integrate digital assets into their balance sheets while maintaining regulatory compliance and shareholder transparency. The consistent execution of this approach during both market highs and lows shows genuine conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As other corporations observe MicroStrategy’s success, we may witness a fundamental shift in how businesses approach treasury management and asset diversification in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin has MicroStrategy purchased through this strategy? While exact daily amounts vary, MicroStrategy has accumulated one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holdings globally through consistent purchasing over several years. Why does MicroStrategy buy Bitcoin daily instead of in larger batches? The daily approach minimizes market impact, reduces timing risks, and implements dollar-cost averaging at the institutional level. Does this buying strategy affect Bitcoin’s price significantly? While individual daily purchases may not move markets dramatically, the consistent demand provides underlying support and reduces volatility. Can individual investors replicate this strategy? Yes, retail investors can implement similar dollar-cost averaging approaches through recurring purchase features available on most cryptocurrency platforms. What regulatory considerations does MicroStrategy face with daily purchases? The company maintains strict compliance with securities regulations and provides transparent reporting to shareholders about their cryptocurrency holdings. How has this strategy performed for MicroStrategy shareholders? The company’s Bitcoin accumulation has generally correlated with strong shareholder returns, though cryptocurrency investments remain volatile.

His comments arrived after a steep 24-hour price drop that pushed Bitcoin from above $100,000 to below $95,000. Saylor Says Reports of Bitcoin Selling Are False In a Friday post on X, Saylor said there was “no truth” to suggestions that Strategy had cut its Bitcoin reserves by about 47,000 BTC — a reduction worth $4.6 billion at current prices. He emphasized that the company was continuing to purchase Bitcoin, even as volatility intensified and the price fell more than 4% in a single day. “I think the volatility comes with the territory,” Saylor said in a CNBC interview on Friday. “If you’re going to be a Bitcoin investor, you need a four-year time horizon and you need to be prepared to handle the volatility in this market.” Strategy remains the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder with a treasury of roughly 640,000 BTC. However, its dominance has tapered as other institutions increased their accumulation. Companies including Coinbase and Metaplanet acquired more Bitcoin in October than Strategy, reducing the firm’s lead. Strategy Stock Declines Amid Market Uncertainty Shares of Strategy (MSTR) have mirrored some of the weakness seen in the crypto market. According to Nasdaq data, the stock fell to $205.38 at the time of publication — a drop of more than 17% over the previous five days. Market analysts noted that declining Bitcoin prices, combined with increased competition in corporate BTC accumulation, have added pressure to the stock. Government Shutdown Ends, Bitcoin Reaction Mixed The end of a 43-day U.S. government shutdown brought a temporary boost to financial markets earlier in the week, though it remains unclear whether the resolution will have a lasting influence on Bitcoin’s trajectory. BTC surged above $106,000 on Sunday amid optimism that lawmakers were nearing a funding deal. A second rally occurred on Wednesday after the House passed a continuing resolution followed by President Donald Trump signing it into law. However, data from Nansen showed the rally faded once government operations officially restarted on Thursday. Bitcoin’s price fell below $100,000 shortly afterward, suggesting that macro relief alone is insufficient to sustain upward momentum in current market conditions.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-15 00:59:21

The same stages are what investors are currently targeting in new projects; and one such project that is sitting within those stages is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with prices still pegged at only $0.035 in the current presale stage. As such, Mutuum Finance, with its pricing still low in the current presale stages with rapid sell-outs with each stage reached, is a DeFi lending and yield ecosystem that seeks to enable consumers to borrow money from the platform to invest in other areas with the aim of earning yield without necessarily going to centralized exchanges. The venture offers something that has previously been conspicuous by its absence in the DeFi sector – an innovative risk-pooled asset insurance mechanism that safeguards lenders. Shiba Inu Price Analysis The price has been repeatedly tested by two descending trendline resistances. Each test resulted in a sell-off. This action demonstrates bearishness; however, there is also an important technical implication here. It is that buying activity is still present below the levels that protect SHIB from further declines. The decisive move to the next destination for the SHIB price rests with a clean break above the first descending trendline. If that occurs, then the price has every chance to move towards the higher trendline. Here begins the true test. A successful breach above the latter trendline would immediately result in strongly more bullish market activity and possibly lead to a rally similar to those that SHIB has produced in the past. Until these verification signals are seen, SHIB is in the waiting zone with possible momentum but no guarantee. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 6 Exceeds Expectations Mutuum Finance is still making waves within the DeFi sector as it approaches the end of Phase 6 in its presale. Since over 90% has already been sold during Phase 6, the current price per MUTM token is set at $0.035, which marks the last stage before the price is set to increase to $0.04 during Phase 7. The presale event has managed to draw in over 17,950 investors who have helped it raise over $18.8 million. What sets Mutuum Finance apart is that it is certainly doing great in the presale stage, as well as other areas such as platforms and credit market structuring. Passive Yield and Liquidity: The Strengths of mtTokens One notable aspect about Mutuum Finance is the introduction of the mtTokens that the users receive after contributing to the platform. In standard deposits that people make to obtain loans from financial institutions or platforms, money is tied, and the user gets benefits after withdrawal. The use of mtTokens earns rewards in real-time; therefore, people receive passive income without the need to stop operations in other DeFi platforms that they are utilizing with the initial assets. This complementarity between yield creation and flexibility offers significant encouragement to adoption. As more people participate to supply assets to the protocol, more demand would be generated to possess MUTM tokens to share in the yield creation process. Built-In Tokenomics Yet another interesting aspect of the tokenomics model that Mutuum Finance has adopted is its buy-and-distribute function. The platform deducts some fees and automatically uses them to buy MUTM tokens in the market. These tokens are then further redistributed within the ecosystem. Notably, such an arrangement also applies perpetual buying pressure in the market and thereby establishes an intrinsic linkage between the use of the platform and buying demand in the market rather than mere advertising. Mutuum Finance has managed to raise over $18.8 million with 18,000 participants, with Phase 6 over 90% sold at $0.035. Phase 7 pricing will move up to $0.04, which marks the end of the early stage to be part of it. Based on its DeFi twin-lending structure, yield mechanism mtToken, and buy-and-distribute tokenomics, MUTM is touted to be the next big cryptocurrency to invest in.

Now, the spotlight shifts to a critical survival zone between $93,000 and $97,000, a range that could determine whether bulls can mount a recovery or if deeper losses are on the horizon. Micro-Resistance Zone Holds Firm, Forcing Another BTC Low More Crypto Online, in a recent update shared on X, pointed out that Bitcoin reacted precisely at the expected level. The micro-resistance zone between $99,386 and $100,972 rejected the price cleanly, a move fully aligned with the current market structure. This rejection led BTC to print yet another lower low, reinforcing the short-term bearish pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply-Loss Chart Flashes Possible Bottom Signal — Is Reversal Emerging? According to the update, Bitcoin has now reached the next major support zone, an area the analyst has repeatedly emphasized: the 50% retracement of the larger support box near $96,000. This zone is considered a crucial checkpoint, as a reaction here could determine whether BTC stabilizes or continues its descent. More Crypto Online also outlined a smaller internal target zone, derived from the structure of the developing yellow wave 5. To complement this, an extended projection zone between $91,322 and $82,523 was mapped out — an area that aligns perfectly with the broader Elliott Wave structure. While not guaranteed, this projection highlights the potential path BTC may follow if sellers remain in control and no strong bullish reaction emerges from the current support levels. Bulls Must Defend The $93,700–$97,500 Demand Zone According to Crypto Online, Bitcoin is currently sitting inside a crucial decision zone between $93,733 and $97,595. Holding this area is essential, as it represents the last meaningful support before deeper downside targets come into play. A strong reaction within this zone would suggest that buyers are finally attempting to regain control after the recent wave of selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Confronts Major Technical Wall Around $107K, Momentum Starts to Slow If Bitcoin fails to show strength here, Crypto Online warns that the next critical level lies around $91,300. A drop into this area would signal continued weakness and potentially accelerate the bearish momentum. This level becomes even more important because losing it would shift the broader market outlook toward a much more extended corrective phase. Despite the uncertainty, Crypto Online is clear about one thing: a legitimate sign of a local bottom will only emerge once Bitcoin breaks and holds above $100,500 again. Anything below that threshold keeps the overall structure firmly bearish. Even if the price bounces within the current range, it should be considered a short-term move unless buyers manage to reclaim that key resistance and flip market sentiment in their favor.

Analyst Says Get In Before This Switch Happens,https://bitcoinist.com/is-it-time-to-buy-xrp/,"XRP investors are once again considering whether now is the right time to enter the market . New reports from analysts warn that XRP could soon become the center of a significant wealth shift, creating a rare opportunity for early adopters. They warn that acting sooner may give investors a critical advantage before broader forces and institutions jump in and limit access to the cryptocurrency. Early XRP Buyers To Gain Massive Edge Time Traveler, a pseudonymous XRP commentator on X social media, has described XRP as the digital asset at the center of an upcoming financial shift. In his post, he stated that individual investors are largely inconsequential to global financial systems, representing less than 0.09% of the world population. According to him, roughly 8 million investors who participate in rail systems are already factored into the strategies of financial elites. This means that the actions of average investors are unlikely to sway market outcomes significantly, and any advantage comes primarily from those who position themselves ahead of larger institutional moves . Time Traveler argued that although crypto millionaires cannot alter existing power structures, billionaires and major players are closely watched but are largely left to operate freely as long as they stay within legal and political boundaries. The primary concern his post highlighted is the potential for the mass adoption of XRP before a major market shift. He warns that if too many people buy too quickly, it could disrupt the strategies used by those controlling the market. Based on this perspective, accumulating early could give smaller investors an advantage before future market changes. He noted that institutions do not want everyone to buy XRP and other digital assets before the “quick switch,” as this could diminish their ability to monopolize the market and capitalize on major price movements. Analyst Says To Secure The Token Now Market analyst CryptoTank has warned of an underground financial shift set to launch soon, with the altcoin positioned at the heart of the movement. He strongly urged investors and traders to start securing a stake in XRP , emphasizing the importance of accumulating as early as possible. CryptoTank advised acquiring the token off crypto exchanges using secure cold wallets such as D’Cent or Xaman, to ensure maximum safety and control over holdings. He stressed that buying now and holding it long term could not only position investors to benefit from the upcoming market changes but also potentially safeguard their financial future and that of their families. According to the analyst, the vast majority of the population remains unaware of the impending market transition, which positions the altcoin as the base settlement layer. He also warns that soon, XRP’s availability could be limited, as upcoming Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and institutional buying absorb the remaining supply.

This groundbreaking move positions the Bitcoin ETF as the single largest holding in Harvard’s prestigious endowment portfolio, signaling a major shift in institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency investments. Why Is Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF Investment So Significant? Harvard University’s massive Bitcoin ETF commitment represents more than just another institutional investment. It serves as a powerful endorsement from one of the world’s most respected educational institutions. When an Ivy League endowment of Harvard’s caliber allocates nearly half a billion dollars to a Bitcoin ETF, it validates cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class for conservative investors. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas revealed this game-changing development on social media platform X. His analysis confirms that IBIT now dominates Harvard’s investment portfolio, surpassing traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This strategic allocation demonstrates how leading institutions are rethinking their approach to portfolio diversification. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin ETF Adoption? The Harvard Bitcoin ETF investment creates a powerful ripple effect across the financial landscape. Other educational endowments and institutional investors often follow Harvard’s lead when making asset allocation decisions. This massive Bitcoin ETF position could trigger similar moves from: Other university endowment funds Pension funds seeking diversification Conservative institutional investors Family offices monitoring elite investment strategies Moreover, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s design provides institutional investors with regulated exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency custody. This eliminates significant barriers that previously prevented traditional investors from entering the crypto space. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Harvard’s substantial Bitcoin ETF allocation serves as a crucial validation point for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. When prestigious institutions embrace Bitcoin through regulated vehicles like ETFs, it reduces the perception of cryptocurrency as a speculative gamble. Instead, it positions digital assets as strategic portfolio components. The timing of this Bitcoin ETF investment coincides with growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency exposure. BlackRock’s IBIT has emerged as a preferred vehicle for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure without direct ownership challenges. This trend suggests we’re witnessing early stages of widespread institutional Bitcoin adoption. What Challenges Remain for Bitcoin ETF Adoption? Despite Harvard’s bold Bitcoin ETF move, several challenges persist for broader institutional adoption. Regulatory uncertainty continues to create hesitation among some traditional investors. Additionally, volatility concerns and custody issues still weigh on decision-makers at conservative institutions. However, the Harvard Bitcoin ETF investment demonstrates that these concerns are becoming manageable for sophisticated investors. The university’s risk management team clearly determined that the potential rewards outweigh the perceived risks, especially when accessed through a regulated Bitcoin ETF structure. Actionable Insights from Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF Strategy Individual investors can learn valuable lessons from Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF approach. The university didn’t allocate their entire portfolio to cryptocurrency, but rather made a strategic position in a regulated Bitcoin ETF. This balanced approach suggests: Start with small allocations rather than going all-in Choose regulated vehicles like established Bitcoin ETFs Consider long-term holding rather than short-term trading Monitor regulatory developments continuously The Harvard Bitcoin ETF story represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency acceptance. It demonstrates that even the most conservative institutions recognize Bitcoin’s potential role in modern portfolio theory. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of Harvard’s portfolio is the Bitcoin ETF? While exact percentages aren’t disclosed, the $442 million Bitcoin ETF investment represents the single largest holding in Harvard’s endowment portfolio, indicating significant allocation. Why did Harvard choose BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF? Harvard likely selected BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF due to the firm’s established reputation, strong track record, and robust ETF infrastructure that meets institutional standards. Is this Harvard’s first cryptocurrency investment? While not necessarily their first crypto-related investment, this represents their most significant public Bitcoin ETF position to date through a regulated vehicle. How might this affect other university endowments? Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF move often sets trends for other educational endowments, potentially encouraging similar allocations from peer institutions. What risks does Harvard face with this Bitcoin ETF investment? Like any Bitcoin investment, the Bitcoin ETF carries volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty, and market correlation risks that Harvard’s team has evidently deemed acceptable. Can individual investors replicate Harvard’s Bitcoin ETF strategy? Yes, individual investors can purchase shares of the same BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) that Harvard selected, though allocation sizes should match individual risk tolerance.

This significant movement suggests we might be entering a period where alternative cryptocurrencies could outperform Bitcoin. For investors and traders watching market cycles, this development offers crucial insights into potential portfolio opportunities. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Measure? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market indicator that tracks whether we’re in an altcoin season or Bitcoin season. This important metric analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over a 90-day period. When 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, the index declares an official altcoin season. Currently sitting at 32, the Altcoin Season Index shows we’re still in Bitcoin-dominated territory. However, the recent three-point jump indicates growing strength among alternative cryptocurrencies. This movement suggests investors might want to pay closer attention to altcoin opportunities. Why Should You Care About the Altcoin Season Index Movement? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index provides several key benefits for crypto enthusiasts: Market timing insights – Helps identify optimal entry points for altcoin investments Portfolio diversification guidance – Indicates when to shift focus between Bitcoin and altcoins Risk management – Shows broader market sentiment and trend directions Profit potential identification – Highlights periods when altcoins typically outperform The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 32, while still below the 75 threshold for a confirmed season, shows promising upward momentum. This gradual climb suggests we might be approaching a transition phase where altcoins begin capturing more market attention. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? Smart investors use the Altcoin Season Index as one tool in their comprehensive market analysis toolkit. While the index hasn’t reached the magic 75 number that confirms an altcoin season, the recent increase to 32 provides valuable information. This movement suggests it might be time to start researching promising altcoin projects and preparing watchlists. However, remember that the Altcoin Season Index shouldn’t be your only decision-making factor. Always combine this data with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and thorough research. The current environment presents both opportunities and challenges that require careful consideration. What Historical Patterns Tell Us About Current Altcoin Season Index Levels Historical data shows that when the Altcoin Season Index begins climbing from lower levels, it often precedes significant altcoin rallies. The journey from 29 to 32 might seem small, but in context, it represents increased altcoin strength against Bitcoin. Previous cycles have demonstrated that sustained upward movement in the index frequently leads to extended altcoin outperformance periods. Market analysts watch these incremental changes closely because they can signal the beginning of broader trend shifts. The current Altcoin Season Index movement, while modest, aligns with patterns that have historically preceded more substantial altcoin gains. Final Thoughts: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Landscape The Altcoin Season Index climb to 32 delivers an encouraging signal for altcoin enthusiasts. While we haven’t entered a full altcoin season yet, the upward momentum suggests the market might be preparing for a shift. This development reminds us that cryptocurrency markets move in cycles, and being prepared for transitions can lead to strategic advantages. As the Altcoin Season Index continues to evolve, staying informed and maintaining a balanced perspective remains crucial. The current reading provides hope for altcoin investors while reminding Bitcoin holders that diversification matters in dynamic market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. A score above 75 indicates an altcoin season. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index updates regularly, with recent data showing a three-point increase from the previous day’s reading. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 32 mean? A reading of 32 indicates we’re still in Bitcoin season territory, but the upward movement suggests growing altcoin strength. Should I buy altcoins when the index rises? While a rising Altcoin Season Index suggests improving conditions, always conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before investing. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index? The index provides valuable market sentiment data but should be used alongside other analysis tools for comprehensive decision-making. What’s the difference between Bitcoin season and altcoin season? Bitcoin season occurs when Bitcoin outperforms most altcoins, while altcoin season happens when the majority of top altcoins beat Bitcoin’s performance.

These revelations come at a critical moment for cryptocurrency and AI investors seeking to understand the true economics behind the artificial intelligence boom. OpenAI Microsoft Partnership Financial Details Exposed According to documents obtained by tech blogger Ed Zitron, Microsoft received $493.8 million in revenue share payments from OpenAI in 2024 alone. The situation intensified dramatically in 2025, with Microsoft collecting $865.8 million in just the first three quarters. This financial arrangement stems from Microsoft’s massive $13 billion investment in OpenAI, creating one of the most significant partnerships in tech history. AI Revenue Sharing Model Complexity Revealed The leaked information reveals a complex revenue sharing arrangement where OpenAI pays Microsoft approximately 20% of its revenue. However, the relationship works both ways – Microsoft also returns about 20% of revenues from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service back to the AI startup. This creates a sophisticated financial ecosystem where both companies benefit from each other’s success. OpenAI pays Microsoft 20% of total revenue Microsoft returns 20% of Bing and Azure OpenAI revenues Leaked numbers represent net revenue share after deductions Actual gross payments likely significantly higher Soaring AI Compute Costs Threaten Profitability The most alarming revelation concerns OpenAI’s compute expenditure. Analysis suggests the company spent approximately $3.8 billion on inference costs in 2024, skyrocketing to $8.65 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Inference represents the computational power required to run trained AI models and generate responses – essentially the ongoing operational cost of providing AI services. Year Inference Costs Revenue Share to Microsoft 2024 $3.8 billion $493.8 million 2025 (First 9 months) $8.65 billion $865.8 million AI Industry Finances Under Microscope These leaked documents provide unprecedented insight into the financial health of the AI industry’s leading company. Based on the 20% revenue share percentage, we can infer OpenAI generated at least $2.5 billion in 2024 revenue and $4.33 billion in the first three quarters of 2025. However, CEO Sam Altman has suggested the company’s actual performance is even stronger, claiming OpenAI could reach $100 billion in revenue by 2027. Leaked Documents Raise AI Bubble Concerns The financial data suggests OpenAI might be spending more on inference costs than it earns in revenue, raising serious questions about the sustainability of current AI business models. This revelation comes as the AI industry faces increasing scrutiny about whether current valuations and investment levels are justified by actual financial performance. Frequently Asked Questions What is the nature of the OpenAI Microsoft partnership? The partnership involves Microsoft providing substantial computational resources through Azure cloud services in exchange for revenue sharing and exclusive access to OpenAI’s technology for certain applications. How much has Microsoft invested in OpenAI? Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI through multiple funding rounds, making it the startup’s primary financial backer and strategic partner. What are inference costs in AI? Inference costs refer to the computational expenses required to run trained AI models and generate responses for users, as opposed to training costs which involve initially developing the models. Who leaked the OpenAI financial documents? Tech blogger Ed Zitron obtained and reported on the leaked documents, though the original source remains unidentified. How does this affect the broader AI industry? These revelations could impact investor confidence and valuation expectations across the AI sector, particularly for companies with similar compute-intensive business models. The leaked financial documents between OpenAI and Microsoft reveal an industry grappling with the enormous costs of artificial intelligence while pursuing unprecedented growth. As compute expenses potentially outpace revenue, the entire AI sector faces crucial questions about sustainability and profitability that will shape investment decisions for years to come.

The broader crypto market remains on edge, as fear and uncertainty continue to weigh on sentiment following days of steady declines across major assets. Traders are watching closely to see if Ethereum can stabilize above this key support zone — a failure to do so could trigger a deeper correction toward the $3,000 area. Related Reading: $1.33B Ethereum Whale Just Moved Another $120M USDT to Binance – Details Despite the mounting pressure, one prominent Ethereum whale — known for a series of large-scale purchases this month — continues to accumulate aggressively. This investor has consistently added to their position even as the price fell, signaling strong long-term confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals and recovery potential. This divergence between short-term fear and long-term accumulation paints a complex picture for Ethereum. While short-term volatility remains a concern, large holders’ continued buying may be setting the foundation for a more sustained rebound once market conditions stabilize and sentiment improves. Ethereum Whale Keeps Buying Despite Market Turbulence According to data from Lookonchain, the prominent Ethereum investor known as Whale ’66kETHBorrow’ has continued his large-scale accumulation despite the ongoing market downturn. Earlier today, the whale purchased 19,508 ETH worth approximately $61 million, expanding his already massive position built over the past week. Shortly after, an update revealed yet another purchase — 16,937 ETH valued at $53.91 million — bringing his total accumulation since November 4 to 422,175 ETH, worth roughly $1.34 billion at an average price near $3,489. Despite the recent price drop, the whale is currently sitting on more than $120 million in unrealized losses, but continues to double down on Ethereum exposure. This aggressive strategy indicates strong long-term confidence, as the investor appears unfazed by short-term volatility. Market observers suggest this accumulation pattern could signal institutional-level conviction that Ethereum’s current prices represent a strategic buying zone. While retail sentiment remains cautious amid heightened uncertainty, the whale’s consistent activity underscores a broader trend: large players are quietly accumulating, positioning themselves ahead of a potential recovery once macro conditions stabilize and risk appetite returns to the crypto market.

The daily chart shows ETH struggling to hold above its 200-day moving average (red line) — a key support level that often defines long-term market structure. A decisive close below this line could confirm a deeper correction phase. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages continue to trend downward, reinforcing the short-term bearish outlook. If Ethereum fails to recover momentum, the next major support sits near $3,000, followed by $2,850, where buyers previously stepped in during the summer consolidation. Conversely, a recovery above $3,400–$3,500 would be the first signal that bullish momentum is returning.

Reports from Farside Investors showed that spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded about $866 million in withdrawals on Thursday, a sharp move that arrived even after the US government reopened following a 43-day shutdown . The flow of money leaving these funds caught the attention of traders who had expected a stronger reaction once political uncertainty cleared. Heavy Withdrawals Hit Major Bitcoin Funds According to new data, this wave of outflows marked the second straight session of losses for US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. A separate reading from SoSoValue pointed to nearly $897 million leaving those products on the same day, suggesting widespread pullback from institutional players. The shift surprised some market watchers because ETF inflows had been one of the main drivers of Bitcoin’s strong run earlier in 2025. Those who entered Bitcoin 6 to 12 months ago have a cost basis near 94K. Personally, I do not think the bear cycle is confirmed unless we lose that level. I would rather wait than jump to conclusions. pic.twitter.com/i9a5M0xnMW — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 14, 2025 Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant warned that the broader uptrend could weaken if Bitcoin falls below $94,000, which he identified as the average buying level for holders who entered during the past six to 12 months. XRP Fund Shines Amid Market Pressure While Bitcoin funds struggled, one new altcoin product posted an unusually strong debut. The Canary Capital XRP (XRPC) ETF reached $58 million in first-day trading volume, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. That figure barely topped the $57 million logged by a Solana ETF earlier this year, but it still ranked as the biggest opening among roughly 900 ETF launches in 2025. Reports also noted that Ether ETFs faced $259 million in withdrawals on Thursday, while Solana ETFs extended a 13-day run of inflows by adding another $1.5 million. Rate Cut Doubts Add To The Slide Bitcoin slid under the $100,000 line on Friday and traded around $96,900 by 00:00 ET (05:00 GMT). It dipped to an intraday low of $96,650, pressured by fading hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. Markets now price about a 45% chance of a 25 basis point cut at the December 10-11 meeting, down from 63% a week earlier. The government shutdown created gaps in official inflation and jobs data, leaving the Fed with fewer signals to work with and keeping traders cautious about taking on risk. Mixed Sentiment As Crypto Heads Into The Weekend Institutional demand has been cooling, shown by repeated outflows and slowing treasury purchases. Some analysts believe the market has been in a quiet bearish phase for months. Hunter Horsley of Bitwise said the downturn may be closer to ending than many assume, although broader risk markets have offered little support. Others caution that continued ETF withdrawals could extend Bitcoin’s losing streak, which is now headed toward a third week.

Following this move, the company stated that it held approximately a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet at the end of the third quarter. As the multinational powerhouse invested in Alphabet, it continued to reduce its investment in Apple significantly. The company reduced its investment by another 15% this quarter, totaling $60.7 billion. Regarding the company’s holdings in Alphabet, several individuals stated that they were shocked by this decision. This is because Buffett is renowned for his value investing strategy and typically hesitates to make investments in rapidly growing tech firms. Meanwhile, with this investment in place, a regulatory filing revealed that Alphabet solidified its position as the 10th biggest stock holding for the conglomerate as of the end of September. Buffett confesses to missing out on investing in Google early on Berkshire has reportedly owned Apple for several years. However, analysts discovered Buffett views the iPhone maker as a consumer products firm rather than a typical tech company. Following this perspective, the analysts concluded that Berkshire’s investment managers, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, likely made this purchase. According to their argument, these individuals have actively engaged with technology stocks. Their statement followed reports from sources revealing that one of them began investing in Amazon in 2019, and Berkshire still owns roughly $2.2 billion of Amazon shares. Notably, Amazon has been attracting firms to invest in the company after it was ranked as a top performer this year, with its stock price escalating by 46%. On the other hand, the significant demand for AI has greatly enhanced its cloud services business. Buffett once confessed that he had missed out on investing in Google early on, although he had noticed its advertising possibilities. Interestingly, Berkshire’s auto insurance company, Geico, was once Google’s early user, paying approximately $10 every time someone clicked on their ad. “I had seen the product work, and I knew what kind of profits they were making,” Buffett said in 2018. He admitted that he did not understand much about technology to conclude whether this would be the one that would defeat all other technologies in the competition. Berkshire reduces several of its holdings under the leadership of Buffett Buffett sold off two-thirds of Berkshire’s Apple shares in 2024. This move shocked many individuals as they viewed Buffett as a long-sighted investor. Apart from the 95-year-old investor’s move, Berkshire also decreased its Apple holdings in the second quarter of this year. However, despite those ongoing sales, sources pointed out that Apple remains Berkshire’s largest stock investment. After reducing its Apple holdings, the company also reduced its stake in Bank of America by 6%, which is worth under $30 billion. Additionally, Berkshire reduced its investments in Verisign and DaVita during the third quarter. According to sources close to the situation, Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters as prices climbed in the tech-focused bull market. In the meantime, Buffett is stepping off as CEO at year’s end with his longtime partner Greg Abel set to take over. Investors are paying close attention to how Berkshire is positioning itself for insights on the upcoming leadership change and any shifts in its investment strategy .

The company’s dashboard showed total Bitcoin holdings of 641,692 BTC as of Monday, matching its previous disclosure, and its SEC filings confirmed continued accumulation throughout early November. The sudden movement of coins earlier in the day added fresh uncertainty to already fragile crypto markets. Strategy( @Strategy ) moved 58,915 $BTC ($5.77B) to new wallets today, likely for custody purposes. https://t.co/FgZG2ZWlVi pic.twitter.com/fimqXsgLH0 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 14, 2025 On-chain analysts reported that Strategy transferred more than 58,000 BTC to new wallets, a shift that triggered algorithmic trading activity and accelerated the sell-off. Although analysts later attributed the transfers to custody restructuring rather than liquidation, the clarification did little to ease broader concerns. MSTR Drops to One-Year Low as Investors Reassess Bitcoin Proxy Premium Market pressure quickly spread to Strategy’s financial footing. Shares of its Nasdaq-listed stock, MSTR, fell below $200 in pre-market trading on Friday, its lowest level since October 2024. The company’s Net Asset Value multiple briefly slipped below 1 for the first time, indicating that investors were valuing the firm at less than the worth of its Bitcoin holdings. Source: X The multiple has since recovered to 1.09, but the shift marks a break from years in which Strategy consistently traded at a premium. That reversal reflects cooler investor expectations. According to K33 Research, Strategy’s equity premium has contracted by $79.2 billion since November 2024. $79.2bn reduction in MSTR's equity premiums relative to its BTC holdings since November 20, 2024. With $31.1bn raised through dilution over this period, roughly $48.1bn of the implied demand for BTC via MSTR never translated into spot purchases. pic.twitter.com/14sf9dL4tl — Vetle Lunde (@VetleLunde) November 14, 2025 While the company raised over $31 billion through share issuance during that period, analysts estimate nearly $48 billion of implied Bitcoin demand never translated into actual BTC purchases. Some market watchers say investors are no longer using MSTR as a straightforward proxy for Bitcoin exposure. Others dismissed liquidation fears. Analyst Willy Woo said Strategy is unlikely to face pressure to sell before 2027 as long as MSTR trades above $183.19, a threshold linked to the company’s debt structure. He noted that only a weak 2028 Bitcoin cycle could force partial sales. MSTR liquidation in the next bear market? I doubt it, Here's their debt, the date the debt is due and the price MSTR stock needs to exceed to prevent partial liquidation of their BTC treasury to pay the debt. Equivalent BTC price assumes mNAV 1.0 pic.twitter.com/AzVgecI7i2 — Willy Woo (@woonomic) November 4, 2025 The dispute comes amid wider turbulence across digital assets and U.S. markets. Bitcoin briefly jumped above $106,000 after lawmakers ended a record 43-day government shutdown , but the rally faded as expectations for a December Federal Reserve rate cut diminished. Despite the volatility, Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin; however, its market share has fallen from 75% to 60% as more firms add BTC to their treasuries.

The entity known as Seven Siblings is making waves with their aggressive Ethereum investment strategy, purchasing millions worth of ETH during price drops despite facing substantial unrealized losses. This bold approach to Ethereum investment reveals fascinating insights about market psychology and long-term crypto strategies. What Is Seven Siblings’ Ethereum Investment Strategy? Seven Siblings has developed a clear pattern in their Ethereum investment approach. They consistently buy ETH during price declines, demonstrating a contrarian investment philosophy. According to recent reports from EmberCN on X, the entity just borrowed $11 million from Spark protocol to purchase 3,496 ETH at an average price of $3,147. This latest Ethereum investment follows their established pattern of accumulating during market weakness. The timing of their purchases suggests they believe in Ethereum’s long-term value regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Their strategy shows conviction in their Ethereum investment thesis, even when market sentiment turns negative. How Large Is Their Current Ethereum Investment Position? Seven Siblings’ total Ethereum investment has reached staggering proportions. Since the market crash on October 11th, they have deployed $174 million to acquire 49,287 ETH. Their average cost basis stands at $3,531 per ETH, which currently positions them in negative territory given market prices. Key facts about their Ethereum investment portfolio: Total ETH holdings: 49,287 coins Average purchase price: $3,531 per ETH Total investment: $174 million Current unrealized loss: $18.97 million Zero ETH sold to date Why Continue Ethereum Investment During Losses? This persistent Ethereum investment strategy raises important questions about risk management and long-term planning. Despite facing nearly $19 million in paper losses, Seven Siblings continues their accumulation pattern. This approach suggests they either have: Strong conviction in Ethereum’s future price appreciation Substantial capital reserves to weather volatility A specific price target or timeline for their investment Hedging strategies elsewhere in their portfolio Their unwavering commitment to Ethereum investment during downturns demonstrates either remarkable confidence or concerning risk exposure. However, experienced crypto investors often remind us that major wealth transfers occur during market fear phases. What Does This Mean for Average Ethereum Investors? While most investors don’t have $174 million for Ethereum investment, there are valuable lessons from Seven Siblings’ approach. Their strategy highlights the importance of: Having a clear investment plan and sticking to it Using dollar-cost averaging during volatility Maintaining long-term perspective despite short-term losses Understanding risk tolerance before making major investments However, their massive Ethereum investment also serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of concentrated positions and leveraging during uncertain market conditions. Conclusion: Brave or Reckless Ethereum Investment Strategy? Seven Siblings’ ongoing Ethereum investment during price declines showcases either brilliant market timing or dangerous overconfidence. While their $18.97 million unrealized loss seems alarming, experienced crypto investors know that paper losses only become real when positions are closed. Their consistent accumulation strategy suggests they’re playing a long game with their Ethereum investment, potentially anticipating substantial future returns that would dwarf current losses. The true test of their Ethereum investment thesis will come when markets recover. If Ethereum prices rebound above their $3,531 average cost basis, their strategy will appear prescient. If prices remain depressed, their losses could mount significantly. Either way, their moves provide fascinating insights into institutional-grade cryptocurrency investment strategies. Frequently Asked Questions Who is the Seven Siblings entity? Seven Siblings is a cryptocurrency investment entity known for making large Ethereum purchases during price declines.

This remarkable Bitcoin price surge represents one of the most significant cryptocurrency achievements in recent history, sending waves of excitement through the digital asset community. What’s Driving This Massive Bitcoin Price Surge? The current Bitcoin price surge didn’t happen overnight. Several key factors have contributed to this impressive rally. Market analysts point to increased institutional adoption, growing mainstream acceptance, and favorable regulatory developments as primary catalysts. Moreover, the limited supply of Bitcoin continues to create scarcity value that drives price appreciation during periods of high demand. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC reached an impressive $96,005.6 on the Binance USDT market. This represents a substantial gain that has exceeded many expert predictions. The sustained upward momentum suggests strong buyer confidence and reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Milestone? Breaking the $96,000 mark represents more than just a number—it signals a fundamental shift in market sentiment. This Bitcoin price surge demonstrates several important market characteristics: Increased institutional interest from major financial players Growing retail investor confidence in cryptocurrency markets Enhanced market liquidity across major trading platforms Strong technical indicators supporting continued bullish sentiment The current Bitcoin price surge reflects growing recognition of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Traditional financial institutions are increasingly allocating resources to Bitcoin, while individual investors see it as both a store of value and growth opportunity. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Price Movements? While the current Bitcoin price surge is impressive, many investors wonder about sustainability. Historical patterns suggest that after significant breakthroughs, Bitcoin often experiences consolidation periods. However, the underlying fundamentals remain strong. The limited supply mechanism, combined with increasing adoption, creates a compelling case for long-term value appreciation. Market experts recommend cautious optimism. The Bitcoin price surge represents both opportunity and potential volatility. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon when evaluating positions during such dynamic market conditions. Key Takeaways From This Remarkable Bitcoin Achievement This Bitcoin price surge teaches us valuable lessons about cryptocurrency markets. First, it demonstrates the asset’s resilience and growing mainstream acceptance. Second, it highlights the importance of understanding market cycles and timing. Finally, it reinforces Bitcoin’s position as the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization and influence. The journey to $96,000 has been characterized by volatility, innovation, and growing global recognition. This Bitcoin price surge represents another chapter in the digital asset’s remarkable evolution from niche technology to mainstream financial instrument. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $96,000? The Bitcoin price surge resulted from multiple factors including increased institutional investment, positive regulatory developments, growing mainstream adoption, and limited supply meeting rising demand. Is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin? While the Bitcoin price surge presents opportunities, investors should conduct thorough research and consider their financial goals and risk tolerance before investing during periods of rapid price appreciation. How high can Bitcoin prices go? Predicting exact price targets is challenging, but many analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential based on its limited supply and growing adoption. What risks come with such rapid price increases? Rapid Bitcoin price surges can lead to increased volatility, potential corrections, and regulatory scrutiny. Investors should be prepared for price fluctuations. How does this compare to previous Bitcoin bull markets? This Bitcoin price surge shows similarities to previous cycles but features stronger institutional participation and more developed market infrastructure. What should I watch for in the coming weeks? Monitor trading volume, regulatory announcements, institutional activity, and technical support levels to gauge the sustainability of this Bitcoin price surge.

Bulls are struggling to defend critical support, and sentiment has turned decidedly fearful, with traders scaling back leverage and rotating into stablecoins amid heightened volatility. Despite this weakness, on-chain data suggests that large buyers may already be positioning for a potential rebound. Related Reading: $1.33B Ethereum Whale Just Moved Another $120M USDT to Binance – Details According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, massive bid walls have been spotted on Binance Futures, signaling that aggressive buyers are stepping in to absorb the recent wave of selling. Historically, such large-scale bids have often coincided with local bottoms, as whales and institutional traders accumulate into weakness. This emerging liquidity pattern may suggest growing confidence among deep-pocketed players that Bitcoin’s downside could be limited. However, with macro uncertainty still weighing heavily on the market, traders remain cautious. Aggressive Buyers Step In As Bid Walls Signal Dip Accumulation According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, recent order book data reveals a strong layer of support forming on Binance Futures, where two major bid clusters have emerged — one around 800 BTC and another stacking up to 2,000 BTC. This concentration of buy orders suggests that large traders, often referred to as aggressive dip buyers, are actively accumulating Bitcoin at current levels around $97,000. Bid walls of this size are significant because they indicate a willingness among deep-pocketed investors to absorb selling pressure and defend price levels perceived as undervalued. In practice, such large orders create a temporary price floor, making it harder for BTC to fall further without massive selling volume. This behavior is often observed in early phases of market reversals. Smart money begins building positions while retail sentiment remains fearful. Maartunn notes that these clusters reflect renewed confidence from high-volume traders who see long-term value despite the recent correction. If these orders remain active and continue to absorb liquidity, Bitcoin could stabilize above the $95,000–$97,000 range. Historically, periods of strong bid support have preceded short-term relief rallies, suggesting that the current dip may be setting the stage for a broader recovery.

The three-day chart shows a decisive break below the $100,000 psychological threshold, confirming a short-term bearish shift as sellers dominate. Volume has spiked notably in recent sessions, suggesting panic-driven liquidations as traders unwind leveraged positions. The 50-day moving average has crossed below the 100-day, signaling fading momentum, while the 200-day moving average — currently near $88,000 — stands as the next central support zone if selling pressure persists. Despite the breakdown, price is showing early signs of stabilization around current levels, hinting that dip buyers may be stepping in. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Adds $105M To His ETH Position – $1.33B Bought Since Nov 4 Market structure remains corrective but not fully bearish. Bitcoin has repeatedly found support above its 200-day MA during previous mid-cycle retracements. A pattern that often precedes recovery once selling exhausts. The RSI (not shown here) is likely near oversold territory, reinforcing this view. If BTC can reclaim and hold above $100,000, a short-term relief rally toward $105,000–$108,000 could unfold. However, failure to defend $95,000 may accelerate the decline toward $90,000. Overall, the chart reflects a market in consolidation, balancing between capitulation risk and early accumulation.

54417487,628276,1763175632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54417487.jpeg,XRP Under Fire: VanEck Research Chief Questions Its Real Utility,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-vaneck-research-chief-questions-utility/,"A senior VanEck executive has reignited a long-running debate over XRP’s real-world utility, questioning both the relevance of the XRP Ledger and the economic case for holding the token—just as a new spot ETF has posted the strongest launch numbers of any fund this year. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, took direct aim at supporters on X, opening with a post that combined sarcasm and skepticism. “Dear XRP maxis,” he wrote, “I may never understand what your ‘blockchain’ actually does, but I’ll always respect the passion required to pretend it does something. So keep hustling!” XRP Utility Debate Reignites The tone set the stage for a thread that pushed beyond memes into pointed questions about developer activity and value accrual. In a follow-up post, Sigel asked: “Genuine question: has any developer ever woken up and said, ‘Time to build… on XRP’? Would love citations.” Hours later, he underscored the lack of detailed responses from the community with a terse update: “Zero replies so far”. The challenge is clear. In a market where developer traction and on-chain activity are often treated as proxies for network value, Sigel is not just criticizing the narrative, but demanding evidence that ledger is actually a target platform for builders. When an supporter pointed to Ondo Finance launching its OUSG tokenized Treasury fund on the XRP Ledger as proof the ecosystem is active, Sigel shifted the discussion to token economics. “Cool initiative, but does any of this actually accrue value to XRP token holders? I’m not aware of any fee capture, revenue share, burn, or economic linkage. I think maybe I’m not smart enough to understand but I’ll keep trying to learn and update my views!” The exchange also touched on the fortunes created around the token and the controversies attached to them. After one user sarcastically wrote that XRP had “funded a whole company [Ripple] on nothing and got a few billionaires out of it,” Sigel replied: “Like the one who funded Greenpeace’s ‘Change the Code’ campaign to pressure Bitcoin into abandoning PoW? Quite a legacy.” The remark alludes to the well-known funding of Greenpeace’s anti–proof-of-work campaign by a Ripple co-founder, a move that has long polarized Bitcoin and XRP communities. When another commenter accused him of trying to “hold ppl back” from investing in the token and dismissed Bitcoin as “completely speculative,” Sigel contrasted the two assets in terms of institutional adoption and state-level engagement. He argued that “retail investors like University Endowments, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and today a Central Bank” are now in bitcoin, and claimed that “12 countries are now mining Bitcoin with direct government support, thanks to its synergies with the electrical grid,” before adding, “Anyway by all means, invest away in XRP. I’m not stopping you.” The thread drew in Solana Foundation’s Vibhu Norby, who has previously clashed with the XRP community but here offered a more reconciliatory, if still critical, framing. “XRP is a SoV coin similar to Bitcoin with cheaper fees wrapped in 13 years of payments mythology. Instead of Satoshi, the collective unconscious of the XRP Army centers around a company (which btw happens to be very well run). The XRPL has minimal usage for transactions compared to smart contract blockchains, but it is not important to its value just like Bitcoin has minimal transactions compared to smart contract blockchains but it is not important to its value,” Norby commented. All of this unfolded against a striking market backdrop. Canary Capital’s spot ETF XRPC, began trading on November 13 and generated around $58 million in first-day volume, including $26 million in its first hour—enough to make it the biggest ETF debut of 2025 so far and narrowly surpass the launch-day volume of Bitwise’s Solana ETF, BSOL. The two funds now define the upper tier of single-asset ETF launches this year, with the next-best newcomer more than $20 million behind in day-one trading.

On June 14, these funds experienced a staggering net outflow of $502.73 million, shaking investor confidence. This significant movement highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments and raises questions about market sentiment. What Caused the Massive Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outflow? The outflow was primarily driven by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw withdrawals of $473.72 million. Other major players like Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC also contributed to the trend. However, Grayscale’s Mini BTC fund bucked the trend with a small inflow. This situation shows how Bitcoin spot ETFs can quickly reflect changing investor behaviors. How Do Bitcoin Spot ETFs Impact Your Portfolio? Bitcoin spot ETFs directly track Bitcoin’s price, making them popular for exposure without holding the asset. The recent outflows suggest some investors are taking profits or reducing risk. Key factors influencing these decisions include: Market volatility and price swings Regulatory news and global economic conditions Institutional investment patterns Understanding these elements helps you make informed decisions about Bitcoin spot ETFs. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Spot ETFs Performance? While outflows can signal caution, they also create buying opportunities for long-term believers.

Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the current price of Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Why did BlackRock’s IBIT have the largest outflow? As one of the largest Bitcoin spot ETFs, IBIT’s size makes it more susceptible to significant movements during market shifts or profit-taking by major investors. Are outflows always negative for Bitcoin spot ETFs? Not necessarily. Outflows can indicate profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing, which might lead to healthier long-term growth if underlying demand remains strong. How can I track Bitcoin spot ETFs performance? Use financial platforms like TraderT or Bloomberg to monitor daily flows and trends, helping you stay informed about market dynamics. Should I invest in Bitcoin spot ETFs during outflows? It depends on your risk tolerance and strategy. Some investors see outflows as buying opportunities, while others wait for stability. What risks come with Bitcoin spot ETFs? Risks include market volatility, regulatory changes, and liquidity issues, so always assess your financial situation before investing. Found this analysis helpful?

This significant movement raises crucial questions about the short-term outlook for Ethereum investment products and what it means for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. What Triggered the Massive Ethereum ETFs Outflow? The September 14th data reveals a concerning trend for Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone accounted for $175.03 million of the total outflow, while Grayscale’s ETHE contributed $4.63 million. More importantly, not a single spot Ethereum ETF registered net inflows for the day, indicating widespread investor caution. This substantial capital movement suggests several possible factors driving investor behavior. Market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, or shifting investment strategies could all contribute to this Ethereum ETFs exodus. However, the concentrated nature of the outflows demands closer examination. Breaking Down the Ethereum ETFs Performance Let’s examine the key players in this Ethereum ETFs outflow scenario: BlackRock’s ETHA : $175.03 million outflow Grayscale’s ETHE : $4.63 million outflow Total Net Outflow : $179.66 million Inflow Activity : Zero funds reported positive inflows The data from TraderT clearly shows that the Ethereum ETFs market experienced uniform selling pressure. This coordinated movement across multiple funds suggests broader market forces at play rather than isolated fund-specific issues. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? While significant outflows from Ethereum ETFs might cause concern, they don’t necessarily signal long-term trouble for Ethereum itself. These investment products represent just one avenue for Ethereum exposure, and daily flows can be volatile. However, the scale of this particular Ethereum ETFs outflow warrants attention. Investors should consider whether this represents temporary profit-taking or a more fundamental shift in sentiment toward Ethereum investment products. Monitoring subsequent trading sessions will provide clearer context. Navigating the Ethereum ETFs Landscape The current Ethereum ETFs situation highlights the importance of understanding these investment vehicles. Unlike direct cryptocurrency ownership, Ethereum ETFs provide traditional market exposure to Ethereum’s price movements. This makes them accessible to investors who prefer conventional brokerage accounts. Yet, as we’ve seen with these Ethereum ETFs outflows, they remain subject to market sentiment and broader financial trends. The concentration of outflows in major funds like BlackRock’s ETHA suggests institutional investors might be reallocating capital rather than abandoning Ethereum entirely. Key Takeaways from the Ethereum ETFs Outflow The September 14th Ethereum ETFs data delivers several important insights: Daily flows in Ethereum ETFs can be extremely volatile Major funds dominate the overall flow picture Outflows don’t necessarily reflect Ethereum’s fundamental value Investor sentiment can shift rapidly in cryptocurrency markets This Ethereum ETFs episode serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investment products, while convenient, still carry significant volatility and require careful monitoring. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the massive Ethereum ETFs outflow on September 14th? The exact causes aren’t specified in the data, but likely factors include market volatility, profit-taking after recent gains, or broader economic concerns affecting cryptocurrency investments. Should I be worried about my Ethereum ETFs investment? Single-day outflows don’t necessarily indicate long-term trends. Monitor subsequent trading sessions and consider your investment horizon before making decisions about your Ethereum ETFs holdings. Which Ethereum ETFs were most affected? BlackRock’s ETHA saw the largest outflow at $175.03 million, representing the majority of the total $179.66 million Ethereum ETFs outflow for September 14th. Do these outflows affect Ethereum’s price directly? While there’s correlation, Ethereum ETFs outflows don’t directly impact Ethereum’s spot price since these are separate markets, though they can influence market sentiment. Has this happened before with Ethereum ETFs? Yes, cryptocurrency ETFs often experience volatile flows. This level of outflow is significant but not unprecedented in the relatively new Ethereum ETFs market. What should I watch for in coming days? Monitor whether the outflow trend continues, if any funds show inflows, and how Ethereum’s price responds to these Ethereum ETFs movements.

The president’s remarks came while he was at a government meeting held to discuss the performance of the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant, rising electricity consumption and proposals for new nuclear capacities. Lukashenko’s faith in crypto as a way to escape dollar dominance The president has asked for a report on the measures taken to increase electricity consumption, their results, and proposals for the further development of the electric power industry and related sectors. In his comments, Lukashenko directly highlighted the global de-dollarization efforts, calling it a “global problem” and identifying things like cryptocurrency mining as potential solutions. “The focus is on the prospects for utilizing existing and new capacities,” the head of state said. In response to fears linked to cryptocurrency mining, especially how unstable it can be, the president implied it was a sacrifice worth making as the world struggles to distance itself from the dollar. “This process will intensify,” Lukashenko said. “So why are we so worried? Some volatility… Well, there probably will be. But nothing ventured, nothing gained.” Belarus , the nation Lukashenko presides over, is closely allied with Russia and is one of the countries serious about fighting the dollar’s dominance. It has actively de-dollarized trade, reduced its USD holdings, and is currently exploring alternatives like BRICS payment systems, and if Lukashenko’s comments have anything to do with it, crypto. Lukashenko has always encouraged mining in Belarus Lukashenko’s comments on mining come weeks after he urged his country’s regulators to finalize long-delayed rules for cryptocurrencies and digital tokens in September. Lukashenko had complained at the time that his 2023 instructions to craft comprehensive regulations had yet to produce approved documents and called for “transparent rules of the game” and new oversight mechanisms, without which he believes that Belarus will lag behind in global crypto adoption. The president also highlighted how technology seemed to be advancing faster than legislation, thereby creating pressure for new branches of law. He instructed regulators and the Hi-Tech Park — the special economic zone that oversees much of Belarus’ digital economy — to split responsibilities and dedicate their expertise to drafting rules that would reassure businesses at home and abroad they could “work calmly in our digital haven.” Those comments came months after Lukashenko publicly considered another way to expand Belarus’ role in crypto. In March, he raised the possibility of harnessing the country’s excess electricity for digital asset mining. “Look at this mining. More and more people are turning to me. If it is profitable for us, let’s do it,” he reportedly told his newly appointed energy minister. Lukashenko cited developments in Washington, calling attention to the fact that the White House had floated the concept of a strategic crypto reserve. “You see the path the world is going. And especially the largest economy in the world. They announced yesterday that they will keep [a crypto] reserve,” he said. Belarus would not be the first country to consider exploring such a path. Countries like Bhutan and El Salvador have embraced Bitcoin mining and BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Belarus could benefit greatly because of it its power surplus, but regulators have to give the green light. Already, decree No. 8 “On the Development of the Digital Economy”, which was signed on December 21, 2017, has established a framework for digital assets to thrive in Belarus under the Hi-Tech Park umbrella, and this has attracted foreign blockchain startups. The decree formally recognized digital tokens in Belarusian law and created a legal basis for their issuance, circulation, and exchange. The decree also offered tax exemptions on digital asset transactions for companies and individuals operating within HTP and recognized the validity of smart contracts. All those measures have positioned Belarus as one of the earliest jurisdictions to adopt a state-backed framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain services.

The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has now agreed to scrutinize whether Apple’s redesigned blood oxygen feature in newer watches still infringes on Masimo’s patents. Apple will know its fate in six months On Friday, ​​the U.S. International Trade Commission decided to hold a new proceeding to determine whether imports of Apple’s updated Apple Watches should be banned as part of the patent dispute with medical monitoring technology company Masimo. The investigation is to be concluded within six months, but it does not sit right with Apple . The company has called the case a meritless attempt to block its smartwatches’ blood oxygen feature while claiming that Masimo was actually the one who had copied its watch design to bring the complaint. It looks like a simple rivalry on the surface, but the conflict between Apple and Masimo goes deeper and is actually part of a contentious, multi-front patent fight that has seen Masimo accuse the tech company of luring away its employees in an attempt to steal its pulse-oximetry innovations. The conflict can be traced back to 2023 when the commission restricted imports of Apple’s Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches after it found that Masimo’s patents were infringed. Apple had to remove blood-oxygen reading technology from its watches to avoid the ban and has had to continue selling its watches in America without the feature enabled. Masimo claims Apple met with U.S. Customs on August 1, 2025, when it secured approval for re-enabling the blood-oxygen feature, a meeting Masimo argues they had no idea was going on, and bypassed due-process protections. Apple allegedly presented an updated version of the technology to Customs, offloading some of the processing to the iPhone, and arguing the updated system was sufficiently different to side-step the previous infringement ruling. It got approval from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, causing Masimo to sue Customs over the approval, while Apple separately challenged the ITC’s ban at a federal appeals court. Masimo claims it did not learn of the feature’s return until Apple publicly announced it. Despite the contention, the feature is currently enabled. Masimo CEO who started the conflict has stepped down The conflict between Apple and Masimo has lasted for years now, but while Apple and Masimo continue to duke it out in the legal boxing ring with the ITC as referee, the CEO who started everything, Joe Kiani, has reportedly stepped down. This came after he was removed from Masimo’s board by shareholders, a decision that was prompted after a proxy battle with hedge fund Politan Capital Management. That conflict ensued after a $1 billion acquisition of Sound United pushed Kiani out. Politan nominated key board members, one of whom is now interim CEO, Michelle Brennan. Regarding Masimo’s conflict with Apple, which he started, Kiani has given the excuse of waiting for a call from Apple to deal with the matter on numerous occasions. Meanwhile, Apple said something different: that they had indeed reached out, but were mostly rebuffed by the CEO at the time. It remains unclear if Apple has had further discussions with Masimo or the new CEO since the Apple Watch blood oxygen sensing was restored.

The university’s holdings represent a 257% increase from 1,906,000 shares previously reported in the second quarter, valued at around $117 million. Its GLD gold ETF holdings also surged by almost 100%. It currently has 661,391 shares of the GLD gold ETF valued at $235 million, up from 333,000 shares in June. Analysts note that the scale of the endowment’s increase is noteworthy, given its long-standing conservative investment approach. Harvard is looking at long-term investment despite price swings The Ivy League institution has been steadily expanding its ETF footprint , complementing a portfolio that includes significant positions in technology giants such as Back in 2018, a Harvard economist and former IMF chief predicted Bitcoin was more likely to crash to $100 than ever hit $100,000 by 2028. Now, with a little over two years remaining, BTC is still far from reaching that $100 prediction. Harvard’s move to scale up its investment also changes the narrative. Its latest disclosure places it high on the list of IBIT’s institutional holders, highlighting just how quickly Bitcoin ETFs are spreading through traditional finance. According to MacroScope , Harvard’s investment is another indication of significant long-term capital shifting toward Bitcoin, regardless of its short-term price fluctuations. An X user by the name Zane Hauck even noted that he believes Harvard isn’t reacting to day-to-day swings; instead, they’re aligning with a reality where monetary dilution and scarce compute capacity shape investment strategies. According to its Q2 holdings, the university was already the 29th holder of IBIT assets. Another user advised Harvard: “They can wait years for a thesis to play out. Best to temper everyone’s expectations, especially given the near-term price action.” Some suggested that other universities may join Harvard in accumulating Bitcoin. As of August 8, Brown University, another Ivy League institution, held more than $13 million worth of IBIT shares. Bitcoin ETFs drew in over $60 billion in net inflows Launched in early 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have opened the door for large institutions to access the asset under strict regulatory oversight. Filings now indicate that pensions, insurance firms, and sovereign wealth funds are allocating to them, signaling a major shift in traditional finance’s stance on crypto. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows of $60.8 billion, and trading volume exceeding $1.5 million. The explosive rise of Bitcoin ETFs has transformed the institutional investment terrain. BlackRock’s IBIT now rules the day, managing more than half of all assets in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Fidelity FBTC continues to see solid inflows, along with IBIT, from wealth managers, pensions, and other large institutional allocators, too. The appeal of these newer ETFs comes from their lower fees, tighter trading spreads, and increased liquidity, elements that have driven adoption and entrenched Bitcoin’s increasingly prevalent position in mainstream finance. On Wednesday, Bitcoin climbed back over $104,700 after U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $524 million on Tuesday — their best inflow day since early October. BlackRock’s IBIT dominated Tuesday’s inflows with $224.2 million. Fidelity’s FBTC was next at $165.9 million, ARKB attracted $102.5 million, and Grayscale tacked on $24.1 million. Overall, BlackRock’s IBIT has captured over 35% of total Bitcoin ETF inflows. It added $1.2 billion in the last month alone, raising AUM past $19.4 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC also continues to attract pension and wealth-management investors, adding $165.9 million in a single day and surpassing its total assets to reach $13.6 billion. Meanwhile, Ark 21Shares’ ARKB continues to serve as a top hybrid of retail and institutional investors, with $102.5 million in inflows driven by short-term trader rebalancing.

The drop underscores the growing weakness in bullish momentum, as traders struggle to defend key support levels amid mounting macroeconomic uncertainty and fading risk appetite. Market sentiment has turned sharply fearful, with investors showing increased caution following a wave of liquidations and declining volume across major exchanges. According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s performance has notably lagged behind traditional assets. Year-to-date, BTC is up just 5.5%, a gain that now risks evaporating entirely if current conditions persist. In stark contrast, gold surged 5.6% in just the last week, continuing its strong rally as investors seek safer havens amid global volatility. While Bitcoin’s long-term structure remains intact, its short-term weakness reflects a tightening liquidity environment and growing skepticism about risk assets. Bitcoin Faces Harsh Comparison As Traditional Markets Outperform Axel Adler highlights how Bitcoin’s muted performance stands in sharp contrast to the impressive gains seen across traditional markets this year. His analysis paints a sobering picture of where capital has been flowing in 2025. Gold leads the pack with a staggering 55% year-to-date (YTD) increase, driven by global uncertainty and strong institutional demand. Copper follows with +27%, benefiting from industrial expansion and supply constraints. Meanwhile, risk assets like the Nasdaq (+21%) and S&P 500 (+16%) have also delivered consistent returns, reflecting continued investor confidence in equities despite macroeconomic headwinds. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s modest 5.5% YTD gain appears increasingly underwhelming. Adler notes that professional fund managers are often measured against the S&P 500 benchmark, meaning any underperformance tends to attract swift scrutiny. “If a fund manager delivers less than the S&P 500, they usually don’t stay in the job for long,” Adler remarks — a pointed reminder of how traditional assets continue to set the standard for performance. His final comment cuts to the heart of the matter: “You don’t need a Harvard degree to buy SPY.” The implication is clear — in a market where simplicity and stability outperform speculation, Bitcoin must prove its resilience or risk losing investor attention. Bitcoin Slips Below $100K as Selling Pressure Builds Bitcoin’s price has fallen sharply below the psychological $100,000 mark, currently hovering around $97,300 after losing more than 2% in the past 24 hours. The daily chart reveals a clear continuation of the recent downtrend, with BTC now trading well below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, signaling sustained weakness in short-term momentum. The next significant support zone sits near $94,000, where Bitcoin previously consolidated in early summer. A decisive breakdown below this level could open the door to deeper retracements toward the 200-day moving average near $88,000–$90,000. On the flip side, reclaiming $100,000 as support will be crucial for any potential recovery, as that level now acts as a strong resistance barrier. Volume data shows an uptick in sell-side activity, confirming growing pressure from profit-taking and possible liquidations. Despite the pullback, analysts suggest that the recent correction may serve as a market reset, allowing leverage to unwind and preparing for a healthier recovery phase. Bitcoin remains in a volatile consolidation period, with macro uncertainty and exchange inflows weighing on sentiment. Bulls must defend current levels to prevent momentum from shifting decisively toward a deeper mid-cycle correction.

After years of struggling with traditional financial systems, which often overlooked her, Sophia’s story is a testament to the potential of decentralized credit solutions in providing financial inclusion. Sophia’s financial journey was marked by constant stress over bills and lack of savings. Traditional banking systems offered little support, leaving her feeling trapped in an unbreakable cycle. However, everything changed when she discovered decentralized finance, a system that offers individuals the ability to earn stable yields through peer-to-peer lending and liquidity provision. “I had never heard of something like this before. At first, I didn’t believe it could work for me,” said Sophia. “But after researching and seeing how Credit Blockchain operated with transparency and UK regulatory compliance, I felt it was a real opportunity.” A Simple, Accessible Path to Financial Inclusion Credit Blockchain is a decentralized platform that allows users to deposit stablecoins into liquidity pools, earning stable returns. It is designed to be user-friendly, with no complicated trading required, making it accessible even for those without a background in finance. The platform’s compliance with UK regulations and use of smart contracts provides users with transparency and security. Sophia’s initial step into the platform was hesitant, but after just 24 hours, she was able to see her first yield payment—a small but meaningful milestone. “It wasn’t just about the money. It was the first time I felt a sense of empowerment and hope for the future,” she recalled. From Struggle to Stability Since joining Credit Blockchain, Sophia’s financial situation has improved significantly. She no longer worries about monthly bills and has even been able to move into a new home with her child. “For the first time, I’m not just surviving, I’m building a stable future,” she shared. The platform’s straightforward design, clear compliance with regulations, and secure wallet protections have given Sophia the confidence to continue using the service. “Credit Blockchain isn’t just a platform to me; it’s been a bridge to stability and a reminder that change is possible,” she said. Credit Blockchain’s Commitment to Security and Transparency Unlike many financial services, Credit Blockchain emphasizes transparency and security. The platform’s user-friendly interface, along with email verification and collateralization measures, ensure a safe experience for users like Sophia, who are new to decentralized finance. A Step Towards Financial Independence Sophia’s experience highlights the potential of decentralized finance to empower individuals who may have previously been excluded from traditional financial systems. By offering a simple, transparent, and secure way to earn passive income, Credit Blockchain is helping users like Sophia take control of their financial futures.

The firm transferred 43,415 BTC, worth $4.26 billion, to more than 100 addresses starting from 00:00 UTC. Social media immediately ignited with speculation of a liquidation event. But that narrative didn’t last long. Arkham Intelligence stepped in fast, clarifying that the transactions were routine custodian rotations, not sales. ON TODAY’S STRATEGY BITCOIN MOVEMENTS Since 00:00 UTC today, Strategy moved 43,415 BTC worth $4.26B to over 100 different addresses. Over the past two weeks, Strategy has been making transfers from Coinbase Custody (their existing custodian) to a new custodian. We believe… pic.twitter.com/RY9mcT8MDv — Arkham (@arkham) November 14, 2025 Michael Saylor himself confirmed the same on X: “There is no truth to this rumor.” Still, the timing of the transfers couldn’t have come at a worse moment, Bitcoin is already sliding below six figures, volatility is surging, and option-market pressure is intensifying. Why Strategy Moved Over $4B in BTC Today Arkham’s explanation aligns with Strategy’s historical patterns. For two weeks, the firm has been transitioning assets away from Coinbase Custody, its long-time custodian, to a new provider. We are ₿uying. pic.twitter.com/6g11E9G6pO — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 14, 2025 Today’s transfers are believed to include: Outflows from Coinbase to the new custodian Internal wallet restructuring by the new custodian Coinbase’s periodic internal wallet refreshes None of these movements represent selling activity, and Arkham emphasized that wallet movements ≠ asset liquidation. Anyone watching Strategy’s entity tags would have seen: 1. Similar transfers last week 2. Re-labeled addresses 3. Fresh custodian wallet assignments 4. Zero evidence of BTC hitting exchanges for sale This is standard operational rotation, but the market, already tense, reacted aggressively. Saylor Doubles Down: “We’re Buying. A Lot.” Saylor addressed the rumors again on CNBC, directly confronting the panic. “We’re buying. A lot. Monday’s update will surprise people.” The comment adds fuel to widespread speculation that Strategy may soon announce one of the largest BTC acquisition updates in months. The timing aligns with the firm’s typical quarterly treasury behavior, accumulate during high volatility phases and expand their long-term holdings when market fear peaks. Today’s fear is well-timed. 41,000 BTC and 228,000 ETH Options Expire, Market Reacts The calm surrounding Strategy’s custody rotations did little to soothe broader market pressures. Today delivered one of the heaviest options expiration events of the quarter. Bitcoin Options Expiry 41,000 BTC contracts expired Put–call ratio: 0.61 Max pain: $105,000 Notional value: $3.95B Ethereum Options Expiry 228,000 ETH contracts expired Put–call ratio: 0.59 Max pain: $3,475 Notional value: $730M The numbers paint a clear picture: the market is leaning toward protection, not speculation. Puts are gaining momentum. Volatility is rising. And traders are bracing for more downside. Bitcoin Breaks Below $100K Again Both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue their downward slide. BTC has dropped below $100,000, breaking the psychological threshold for the second time this month. The price shows no immediate rebound signals, and bearish sentiment is tightening its grip. ETH isn’t faring better, the asset has now recorded three consecutive monthly losses, a pattern that hasn’t occurred since early-cycle correction years. Market mood is shifting from cautious to pessimistic. Liquidity is thinning. Fear is spreading. Volatility Surges: IV Spikes Across BTC and ETH Analysts at Greeks.Live report a sharp rebound in implied volatility (IV) across major expiries. The market is preparing for big swings, likely downward. BTC IV Levels Near-term IV: approaching 50% Average IV: ~45% This marks one of the sharpest IV jumps since late Q3.

What used to be an unusual spike, elevated put buying, has now become a baseline market behavior. Puts now make up 30% of all BTC options trading, a figure Greeks.Live calls “the new normal.” The message is straightforward: Risk aversion is dominating. Traders aren’t betting on upside. They’re insulating themselves from further downside. Q4 is shaping up to be one of the worst performing quarters on record, driven by macro pressure, declining liquidity, and speculative cooling. Leveraged trading? analysts warn against it Given the mix of: Rising volatility Increasing put ratios Heavy BTC/ETH expiries A weakening BTC price floor Growing macroeconomic strain Analysts are urging caution. Greeks.Live summarized the market in one line: “Sentiment is deeply divided. Leveraged trading is inadvisable.” Retail traders are getting whipsawed by sudden long squeezes. Whales are staying hedged and patient. And institutional flows remain sideways. Custodian Rotations Shouldn’t Overshadow The Real Story While today’s $4.26B Strategy movements triggered temporary panic, the real story remains the broader market structure: High volatility Heavy expiries Macro pressure Weak spot demand Rising put-option dominance Sub-$100K BTC weakness Strategy’s decision to rotate custodians is routine, they’ve done it dozens of times. But the timing amplified community stress as Bitcoin struggles to maintain psychological support levels. Still, Saylor’s messaging is direct: nothing was sold, and the firm is preparing to buy aggressively. If Bitcoin stays in the mid-$90Ks, Strategy may use this volatility to expand its already massive BTC position. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

54421847,https://nulltx.com/?p=152675,1763184116,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Analyst Links BTX Capital to $25M POPCAT Manipulation on Hyperliquid,https://nulltx.com/analyst-links-btx-capital-to-25m-popcat-manipulation-on-hyperliquid/,"A new investigation from on-chain researcher @SpecterAnalyst is pointing toward one of the most aggressive market manipulation attempts seen on Hyperliquid this quarter, and the trail leads directly to BTX Capital and its founder, Vanessa Cao. According to the analyst, a coordinated attack involving 26 wallets, a $25 million artificial buy wall, and a web of transactions tied to OKX, Bybit, and prior $TST manipulation campaigns resulted in $4.9 million in losses for Hyperliquid’s liquidity provider (HLP). Meanwhile, the attacker likely covered their personal losses by taking the opposite position on centralized exchanges. Investigation into how @BTX_Capital and its founder @vc_btxcap are behind the token manipulation like $POPCAT on @HyperliquidX . They leverage their access to large capital to manipulate token prices and profit from it. pic.twitter.com/7BHmRmegxo — Specter (@SpecterAnalyst) November 13, 2025 The evidence paints a picture of a sophisticated price-action stunt designed to trigger liquidations, and a trading firm with enough capital to absorb millions in collateral losses to profit elsewhere. The Setup: A $25M Buy Wall That Never Intended to Fill On November 12 around 4PM UTC, Hyperliquid’s order books for $POPCAT suddenly showed life. A buy wall worth ~$25 million appeared near the $0.21 level. The signal was clear: heavy demand. That demand wasn’t real. More than 26 wallets placed synchronized orders to push sentiment upward. Traders reacted instantly, opening leveraged long positions into what looked like a major bullish move. Then the entire wall disappeared. The attacker pulled the bids, drained liquidity beneath the price, and triggered a chain reaction of forced liquidations across the board. The result: Attacker’s own collateral loss: ~$4 million HLP losses: ~$4.9 million Real profit engine: short positions on centralized exchanges This pattern matches textbook manipulation, except the financing behind it points to a deeper operation. The Wallet Trail: From POPCAT to TST to BTX Capital The wallets used in the $POPCAT stunt didn’t appear out of nowhere. Blockchain tracing shows the main wallet 0x0A11…773C3 was previously involved in the $TST manipulation event months prior. That wallet funded seven additional wallets in the POPCAT operation. From there, the chain grows: On August 4, the TST-linked wallet received 0.003 ETH from 0xad67. 0xad67 sent 0.0457 ETH to 0x9e8, which forwarded assets to 0xf6c. 0xf6c funded 0xc10, which deposited 598.6K USDT into OKX on August 10. The OKX deposit wallet involved, 0x71b578…, shows even more activity: Received 688.7K USDT from 0xbBf4 on July 3 Deposited 393.9K USDT to another OKX wallet on June 4 That secondary OKX wallet received 593K USDT from 0x01c8 on May 11 The same 0x01c8 wallet also funded fees for 0xC0a, which later deposited 506K USDT into a Bybit account: 0xaE7A4A99Db2d7eE28aE244F05a1833388321Ab72 This Bybit wallet is where the story turns unmistakable. It received 50 million $AKI tokens on Polygon from a multisig wallet (0x6cb) created by 0xf97. And 0xf97 connects directly to Vanessa Cao: On Ethereum, funded by vanessacao.eth On Polygon, funded by BTX Capital’s own wallet on March 6 These links position BTX Capital and its founder at the heart of the funding chain behind the wallets used in the POPCAT manipulation. BTX Capital’s Role: “Liquid Token Strategies” Taken Literally BTX Capital describes itself as a “liquid trading and investment firm” focused on liquid token strategies. Founded in 2019, the firm markets itself as a sophisticated player capable of moving large amounts of capital quickly. The investigation suggests they may be taking this mission statement quite literally. The size of the POPCAT buy wall, and the willingness to burn $4 million in personal collateral, signals a firm with deep liquidity and a high tolerance for risk when paired with profitable off-chain positioning. This isn’t the first time analysts have flagged tokens possibly influenced by BTX. The firm is suspected of involvement in several sudden, unnatural pumps on Hyperliquid, including: $ZEREBRO $JELLYJELLY $HIFI and potentially $ZEC In every case, the pattern is similar: on-chain manipulation, off-chain profit capture. UPDATE: @BTX_Capital just deleted every single post, repost, and reply except one on their page following my investigation into them being behind the $POPCAT manipulation. I was able to get their page look https://t.co/cetJ8OqzsE pic.twitter.com/DfXleV2XAM — Specter (@SpecterAnalyst) November 14, 2025 How They Profit: Manipulate On-Chain, Hedge Off-Chain The strategy is simple but deadly efficient. Step 1: Manipulate token price using overwhelming buy or sell pressure on Hyperliquid. Step 2: Wait for traders to take the bait. Step 3: Trigger liquidations through sudden reversals. Step 4: Capture profit using large short or long positions on centralized exchanges where liquidity is deeper and slippage is low. This is why the attackers could afford losing millions on Hyperliquid. Their real gains likely happened on OKX or Bybit. Unusual Silence: BTX Capital Wipes Its Page Perhaps the most telling moment came after the investigation surfaced. @BTX_Capital deleted every post, repost, and reply on their X account except one. The timing aligns precisely with @SpecterAnalyst publishing the wallet evidence. The move has only intensified suspicion. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The earnings report, released Friday night, showed that revenue for the September quarter jumped to $64.2 million, up sharply from $11.6 million in the same period last year. The company also expanded its gross margin to 56%, up from 49% in the previous quarter. All of this comes as crypto prices cool off after a red-hot run earlier in the year, with bitcoin falling another 2.6% on Friday alone. American Bitcoin gained momentum this year as traders bet on looser rules under President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House earlier this year. His sons are directly tied to the company: Eric Trump serves as co-founder and chief strategy officer, while Donald Trump Jr. is a stockholder. In a post-earnings call, Eric said, “Since our Nasdaq debut, we’ve added over 3,000 bitcoin to our reserves, steadily advancing among the world’s leading public bitcoin treasuries.” American Bitcoin now holds 4,004 bitcoin as of November 5, which is worth about $400 million based on Friday’s closing price. Trump family’s crypto push expands as mining costs fall American Bitcoin, a majority-owned unit of Hut 8 Corp, is the latest in a string of crypto ventures linked to the Trump family. That list also includes a meme coin and World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform partially owned by Donald. During the earnings call event, CEO Mike Ho emphasized their cost advantage, saying, “While conventional vehicles accumulate bitcoin at spots, we mine at less than half the cost.” The company continues to mine bitcoin using its own infrastructure, instead of buying it at market price. Eric also commented on the ongoing trade tensions with China, which have escalated since Donald’s return to office. He brushed aside concerns about the proposed 100% import tax on Chinese goods, saying the policy hasn’t affected their business, even though American Bitcoin sources mining hardware from China. Instead, Eric pointed to declining energy prices, saying it’s been a “major advantage” for their mining operations since his father took office. Bitcoin drop hits crypto stocks, but American Bitcoin stays the course After releasing the results, American Bitcoin’s stock briefly rose before dipping 1.3% in morning trading. Its movement mirrored the price of bitcoin, which tumbled as investors pulled out of risk assets. That’s common for crypto treasury stocks, since their reserve values are tied directly to token prices. Despite that, companies like American Bitcoin have kept growing their holdings, trying to lock in gains from earlier rallies. While the token’s price action has cooled off, interest in crypto hasn’t. The Trump administration has repeatedly stated its aim to make the U.S. a global leader in crypto, promising a lighter hand from regulators. But the family’s growing stake in the industry has raised alarms from ethics experts and political opponents, who say Donald’s involvement in policy and crypto projects could lead to conflicts of interest. Still, the numbers are clear: American Bitcoin has gone from red to black in one year. A $3.5 million net income, a $52.6 million jump in revenue, lower mining costs, and a growing bitcoin reserve, all while navigating market drops and political backlash, has put the Trump-backed company at the center of crypto’s political economy.

Retail Panic Spikes,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-slips-below-100k-again-as-liquidations-hit-1b-retail-panic-spikes/,"Bitcoin has broken below the $100,000 level for the second time this month, igniting another round of fear, doubt, and outright chaos across the market. The drop pushes BTC into a fresh zone of retail panic, a pattern that historically sets the stage for opportunistic buying as weak hands exit the market. And this time, the selloff comes with force. According to Binance market data, BTC dipped under 97,000 USDT, marking its lowest level since May 8. The asset now trades around 97,375 USDT, down 4.07% in the last 24 hours. It’s another sharp move in what has become one of Bitcoin’s most volatile months of 2025. But it’s not the price alone causing shockwaves, it’s the scale of the leverage wipeout that followed. Bitcoin has dumped below $100K for the second time this month. Predictably, this has caused a wave of FUD and concerned social media posts from retail traders.

Data from Coinglass shows: $1.022 billion total liquidations in 24 hours $887 million wiped from long positions $135 million from shorts It’s a clean sweep. Overleveraged bulls got hit the hardest, creating a feedback loop that dragged Bitcoin down faster as cascading forced sells accelerated the drop. This kind of liquidation profile usually signals one thing: retail traders were leaning heavily into high-risk leverage, expecting a bounce, and they got steamrolled. Social media reacted immediately, and the sentiment map tells a clear story. According to Binance market data, Bitcoin fell below 97,000 USDT, hitting its lowest level since May 8. It is currently trading at 97,375 USDT, down 4.07% in the past 24 hours. Data from Coinglass shows that total liquidations across the market reached $1.022 billion over the… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 14, 2025 Retail Sentiment Flips to Full Fear, A Historically Bullish Zone Santiment’s sentiment analysis paints the current emotional landscape with three simple boxes: Bullish/greedy bias – markets overheated Neutral bias – whale-driven movements Bearish/fearful bias – retail panic zones Right now, Bitcoin has slipped directly into the bearish/fearful zone, indicating that retail is capitulating. This is the exact environment where long-term players typically accumulate. Historically, heavy retail fear aligns with local bottoms because: Forced liquidations remove short-term leverage Retail panics and sells Whales step in and absorb liquidity Prices stabilize In other words, the panic everyone sees may actually be reducing downside risk, not increasing it. The more emotional retail becomes, the calmer experienced traders tend to get, and sentiment right now is flashing classic capitulation patterns. CryptoQuant: “This Correction Is Driven Primarily by the United States” While retail panic amplifies the volatility, on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant says the deeper drivers are far more structural. Their latest analysis highlights three key forces: 1. U.S. Liquidity Stress American liquidity conditions have tightened. This limits risk appetite and slows capital inflows into crypto, especially from U.S. institutions. 2. Long-Term Holders Taking Profits for Tax Purposes CryptoQuant notes a significant uptick in long-term holder (LTH) profit realization. With Bitcoin still up massively year-over-year, many U.S. holders are securing gains ahead of tax deadlines or rebalancing for the quarter. Bitcoin’s Decline Driven by U.S. Liquidity Stress, LTH Tax-Driven Profit Taking, and Persistent American Selling “Together, these factors form a clear narrative: the current correction is driven primarily by the United States.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/mIPbwqgM4r — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 14, 2025 3. Increased Selling Pressure From U.S. Based Investors Persistent American selling has formed the backbone of the current correction. Combined with liquidity stress, the sell pressure has amplified every downward move. CryptoQuant summarized it bluntly: “Together, these factors form a clear narrative: the current correction is driven primarily by the United States.” The data suggests that while U.S. markets are offloading, global demand hasn’t stepped in aggressively enough to neutralize the supply. Market Eyes $90K: Polymarket Traders Boost Probability to 73% While on-chain data and sentiment point toward capitulation, which usually precedes a bounce, prediction markets are leaning the other way. Polymarket traders now assign a 73% probability that Bitcoin drops below $90,000 in the short term. That’s a big uptick and reflects a growing belief that BTC hasn’t fully flushed leverage from the system. Prediction markets often track broader trader psychology rather than fundamentals. So while they’re not always accurate, they do show where traders are emotionally positioning, and right now, that’s clearly downward. Volatility Returns Just as Retail Loses Confidence Bitcoin’s pullback under $100K comes at a time when macro uncertainty and market-wide leverage clashes are creating dramatic daily swings. A month ago, BTC seemed stable above six figures. Today, traders are on edge as every bounce gets sold into within hours. The irony? This is exactly the kind of environment where long-term capital quietly enters. We’ve seen this pattern repeatedly: Panic Liquidations Forced sells Whale accumulation Trend reversal Retail rarely recognizes it in real time. Sentiment, Structure, and the Road Ahead Three dynamics now define the market: 1. Retail Panic Is Peaking Social sentiment is deep in the bearish zone. Historically, that’s when downside risk starts to flatten. 2. Structural U.S. Selling Remains Heavy CryptoQuant’s data suggests ongoing pressure from tax-driven profit taking and liquidity stress. These forces may continue to weigh on BTC until U.S. markets stabilize. 3. Prediction Markets Expect More Pain Polymarket’s pricing shows traders betting on at least one more leg downward. But markets often bottom when sentiment, leverage wipes, and fear align, and we’re close to that intersection now. Final Outlook: A Market Sitting at the Edge Bitcoin slipping below $100K, again, has reset expectations across the board. Retail is fearful. Leverage has been flushed. U.S. liquidity remains tight. Prediction markets lean bearish. But beneath all the fear, Bitcoin has entered a zone that historically favors disciplined buyers over emotional sellers. As the crypto market recalibrates, all eyes remain on whether BTC can recover above the psychological six-figure line, or whether the 73% probability of a sub-$90K retest becomes reality. One thing is certain: volatility is back, and the next major move is loading. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The company said it earned an adjusted profit of 1 cent for the September quarter, which flips the 6-cent loss recorded a year earlier. Revenue hit $384,000, which is a massive jump from last year and far above the $100,000 analysts expected going into the announcement. Traders didn’t wait, because Quantum Computing stock surged more than 7% almost immediately in extended trading to 11.38, after already rallying by more than 5% during the regular session, though the same stock is also still down 42% YTD. The company said the revenue spike came from larger development service work, more custom hardware contracts, and the first dollars coming in from cloud access to its Dirac-3 optimization system. Analysts also expect about $200,000 in revenue for Quantum Computing in Q4, based on the guidance discussed during the call. The business keeps building out its tech stack. The team operates a foundry in Tempe, Arizona, where it makes photonics-based quantum machines, which are the systems behind all of this. Quantum Computing said the quantum sector is still volatile this year because of debates involving Nvidia about how soon commercial-level quantum products will land in the real world. But for now, Quantum Computing carries a Composite Rating of 45 out of 99 from IBD’s Stock Checkup and an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-minus, which reflects how the stock behaved across the last 13 weeks. Quantum Computing boosts liquidity and outlines its outlook Interim Chief Executive Yuping Huang said during the briefing that the firm finished the quarter with $352 million in cash and $461 million in investments. Yuping said the business also raised $750 million after the quarter ended, which brings the total liquid position to more than $1.5 billion. Yuping said this pile of money is what the team plans to use to push the long-term strategy the company has talked about for the last year. The company also answered questions about how the machines work.Quantum systems run on subatomic behavior and need exotic hardware such as supercold chips.These systems are built to solve problems regular computing can’t touch. That’s why 2025 has been a chaotic year across the entire sector. Investors are still trying to figure out which teams will build products that can actually work at large scale. Quantum Computing execs discuss partnerships, fabs, banks, and security pressure Analysts asked Yuping for more details on the work with Poet Technologies. Yuping said the partnership uses Poet’s tech for next-gen high-speed transceivers that the telecom world sees as a route to faster internet. Yuping also said the team is studying new partnerships with other groups building for telecom and datacom use cases. Another question was about quantum security tools already sold to a top-five U.S. bank. Yuping said the company is in talks with other large firms and is looking at how its tools can be built into photonic integrated chips. Yuping said these chips could serve wireless and aerospace companies working to solve long-term quantum-internet problems. Chief Financial Officer Christopher Roberts was asked about spending. Christopher said Fab 1 is fully active and will add high-speed testing tools that cost around $2 million. Christopher said Fab 2 is being planned to expand machine production and meet rising demand for thin-film chips at large volume. Christopher also answered a question about mergers. Christopher said the company is reviewing deals that could bring new customers, revenue, and product lines. Christopher said these deals would help speed up commercialization and help the company close important technology gaps. The final question was about rising fears that quantum machines could break RSA-2048 encryption. Yuping said more firms are looking at quantum-secured internet because of that threat. Yuping said the company’s system works with today’s fiber-based telecom lines, which makes it possible to build secure networks with tech companies already use.

The latest data reveals an exciting development: BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF just experienced a remarkable 15% increase in institutional holders during Q3. This surge signals a major shift in how traditional finance views cryptocurrency investments. Why Are BlackRock IBIT Institutional Holders Growing So Rapidly? The third quarter brought significant growth for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. According to TraderT analysis, the number of BlackRock IBIT institutional holders jumped by 15% compared to the previous quarter. This growth isn’t just about numbers – it represents a fundamental change in investment strategy among major financial players. More importantly, the proportion of institutional investors among all IBIT holders increased by one percentage point to reach 29%.

CEO McAndrew Rudisill, who is also chairman, told investors that “this quarter marked a transformative leap for ETHZilla, establishing us as a technology leader in DeFi and positioning us for real‑world asset tokenization,” and he said the company placed its Ethereum holdings into major restaking platforms to produce compounding yield and support network security. McAndrew said the company’s new partnership with Liquidity.io, backed by a 15% stake in its parent Satschel, gives ETHZilla the setup it needs to begin tokenizing real‑world and financial assets on Ethereum Layer 2. He said the company wants to start putting these assets on‑chain in the coming weeks and wants to build a position inside what he described as a future multi‑trillion‑dollar market. ETHZilla raises new money and expands restaking operations ETHZilla said it secured $931 million in new institutional capital across three financings during August and September. The company said that the first deal was a $425 million PIPE on August 4, followed by a $156 million convertible note on August 11, and then a $360 million convertible note on September 23. ETHZilla told investors that this capital came from firms that support its pivot into crypto tokenization and its attempt to build infrastructure for real‑world assets. Management said ETHZilla partnered with Electric Capital to earn about 7.5% yield on its deployed Ethereum during the quarter. The company also deployed $257 million into Ether.fi and Puffer Finance to expand its liquid restaking footprint. ETHZilla said this approach helped the firm increase income while keeping exposure to Ethereum’s upside. McAndrew said the strategy creates high‑margin cash flow directly on‑chain and improves the company’s capital efficiency. ETHZilla also detailed the terms of its Liquidity.io partnership, which includes a $15 million investment and the 15% equity stake in Satschel. The company said this deal gives it exclusive Ethereum L2 listing rights for tokenized assets. Management said this structure will allow it to issue assets that are fully compliant while offering both primary and secondary market access on the same network. ETHZilla reshapes its portfolio, expands leadership, and reports Q3 figures ETHZilla said it repurchased 2,099,472 shares for $46.3 million, including fees, under its board‑authorized $250 million share buyback plan. The company said it plans to continue to repurchase shares below NAV with the remaining funds from its recent Ethereum sale when it believes the move is accretive. The company also said it resolved all litigation tied to its old identity as 180 Life Sciences and sold off its legacy biotech assets. ETHZilla will continue to hold its previously acquired iGaming assets until its tokenization‑related cash flow begins. Management said this change gives the firm a cleaner structure as it grows its crypto tokenization platform. The leadership team changed as well. McAndrew became chairman and CEO, John Saunders became CFO, John Kristoff became SVP of corporate communications and investor relations, and Max van der Griend became VP of corporate finance. ETHZilla also added Jason New, vice chairman of investment banking at Lazard, to its board. The near‑term outlook includes plans to bring revenue‑producing tokenized assets on‑chain within weeks and expectations for positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. ETHZilla said yield from L2 protocols should land between 3.5% and 4.5% if no new Ethereum is deployed. If more Ethereum is used, ETHZilla said yields could improve. The company also plans to continue buying shares below NAV under its same $250 million authorization. For the quarter, ETHZilla reported $4.1 million in revenue, all from Ethereum staking and incentive rewards earned since mid‑August. Gross profit matched revenue. The company reported zero CapEx and said it ended the period with $559 million in cash and equivalents. ETHZilla posted a $208.7 million net loss, almost all of it tied to one‑time non‑cash charges from July’s transaction expenses and write‑downs, and about $208.4 million of that amount came from those fees. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.5 million.

Santiment’s latest analysis suggests this widespread consensus might actually be a warning sign for further declines. When too many traders chant ‘bottom’ in unison, history shows the real low often lies ahead. Why Market Bottom Consensus Often Fails Crypto analytics firm Santiment recently dropped a crucial insight that every trader should understand. Their data reveals that genuine market bottoms rarely occur when everyone expects them. Instead, true bottoms materialize when most market participants still fear further drops. Consider this pattern: when social media fills with ‘Bitcoin bottom’ calls and traders confidently declare the worst is over, that’s often the signal to remain cautious. Santiment’s historical analysis shows such optimistic consensus typically precedes additional price declines. How Can You Spot a Real Market Bottom? True market bottoms share distinct characteristics that differ from temporary support levels. Here’s what Santiment’s data reveals about genuine turning points: Limited social media discussion about bottoms Most traders expecting further declines Reduced trading volume and interest Minimal ‘buy the dip’ enthusiasm The current environment, where Bitcoin bottom calls trend across platforms, contradicts these historical markers. This divergence suggests we might not have seen the final low yet. What Does This Mean for Your Trading Strategy? Santiment’s findings provide valuable guidance for navigating volatile markets. Instead of following the crowd’s bottom calls, consider these alternative approaches: Wait for capitulation: Real bottoms often follow extreme fear Monitor sentiment data: Use tools like Santiment to gauge true market mood Diversify entry points: Avoid going all-in on suspected bottoms Watch volume patterns: Genuine reversals show distinct volume characteristics Remember, the most profitable opportunities often emerge when conventional wisdom appears most certain. When everyone agrees we’ve hit bottom, that’s precisely when you should question the consensus. The Psychology Behind Market Bottom Calls Why do traders consistently misidentify bottoms during declines? Human psychology plays a crucial role. After sustained losses, market participants desperately seek signs of reversal. This emotional need often overrides objective analysis. Moreover, social media amplifies these psychological tendencies. When influential accounts declare a bottom, their followers often echo the sentiment without independent verification. This creates the illusion of widespread agreement where none truly exists. Actionable Insights for Smart Trading Santiment’s research offers more than just warnings—it provides practical guidance. Here are key takeaways for implementing their findings: Use sentiment data as a contrarian indicator Combine social metrics with technical analysis Maintain cash reserves for true capitulation events Track mentions of ‘market bottom’ as potential reversal signals By understanding these patterns, you can avoid common pitfalls and position yourself for genuine recovery phases rather than false dawns. Frequently Asked Questions Why does market bottom consensus often signal further declines? When too many traders agree on a bottom, it suggests most potential buyers have already entered positions. This leaves limited buying power to drive prices higher, often leading to further declines. How reliable is Santiment’s market bottom analysis? Santiment’s findings are based on historical data across multiple market cycles. While not infallible, their sentiment analysis has consistently identified patterns that precede significant market moves. What indicators should I watch for genuine bottoms? Focus on extreme fear levels, declining social media activity, reduced trading volumes, and widespread expectation of further declines rather than bottom calls. Can social media sentiment predict market movements? While not predictive in isolation, social sentiment serves as a valuable contrarian indicator when combined with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. How quickly should I act on market bottom signals? Genuine bottoms typically develop over time rather than occurring at precise moments. Consider scaling into positions rather than making large, immediate commitments. Does this analysis apply to all cryptocurrencies? While most relevant to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, sentiment patterns can vary for smaller altcoins due to different market dynamics and participant behavior.

The drop wiped out more than $120 billion in total valuation, creating uncertainty across major centralized exchanges and pushing traders toward assets showing stronger stability. A number of investors have been looking at alternative blockchain projects with real utility, and Remittix (RTX) has been one of the names circulating across crypto forums as the downturn unfolded. The interest comes from its role in crypto-to-fiat transfers, which has become a talking point as Bitcoin volatility rises. Bitcoin Trading Activity Spikes Across Exchanges In contrast, Bitcoin is trading at $96,617.84, a significant drop of 3.51% over the past 24 hours. Activity, though, remains fierce, with trading volume surging to $127.91 billion, up 61.51%, as traders shuffle their portfolios. The $1.93 trillion market cap maintains Bitcoin’s position as No. 1 among cryptocurrencies, but the selloff of late has reignited discussions about which cryptocurrencies will benefit if the correction continues. This wide uncertainty has re-awakened interest in assets linked to crypto, solving real-world problems and low gas-fee crypto options, which draw users from outside typical trading circles. Bitcoin downturns often influence sentiment, and this latest move has pushed many traders to evaluate upcoming crypto projects and new altcoin to watch narratives more closely. Growing Focus on RTX as Utility Demand Strengthens As Bitcoin adjusts, Remittix stands out for its steady progress in the payments niche. The project runs at $0.1166 per token and has crossed $28.1 million raised from private funding, supporting development of a global payments rail designed for direct crypto-to-bank transfers. More than 685 million tokens have already been acquired by early supporters. A key update from the team is the expanded Beta Wallet program, now open to more iOS users. The team has also revealed future listings on BitMart and LBANK, giving users clarity on where the RTX token will be available after launch. These listings form part of a wider push to strengthen accessibility as interest grows from those looking for crypto with real utility rather than speculative momentum.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031.

A rebound is possible, yet confirmation only comes if FLOKI manages to break above $0.0000600–$0.0000635. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of November 15, Floki is attempting a small recovery around $0.0000559 after several days of controlled bleeding, yet the broader structure remains bearish. The coin’s price is still pinned beneath the mid-Bollinger band at $0.0000635, and the lower band at $0.0000517 continues to act as the primary support zone. The slight bounce from that lower band suggests sellers may be slowing down, but the lack of a decisive candle shows buyers are not reclaiming momentum yet. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram is still negative, and the lines remain open to the downside, signaling that bearish momentum hasn’t fully cooled. FLOKI’s RSI is at 39 and is climbing, but it is still below equilibrium, indicating that the market is recovering from oversold conditions rather than demonstrating genuine strength. If today’s rebound expands, the first resistance is $0.0000600–$0.0000635. A rejection there likely ushers in another retest of $0.0000520. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, price is hovering around $0.0000559–$0.0000562 with a slow drift into a sideways consolidation pattern. The Alligator lines are still fanned downward, emphasizing that the micro-trend remains bearish even though sellers are losing aggression.

FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD bars remain red but are becoming less negative, hinting that momentum is flattening rather than continuing to deepen. Until price closes above the green Alligator line around $0.0000571, bulls will struggle to generate even a short-term surge.

FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

The venture capital giant recently disclosed it sold exactly half of its Bitmine stake, raising important questions about institutional crypto strategy. What Does This Bitmine Stake Reduction Mean? The SEC filing reveals Founders Fund reduced its Bitmine stake by 50%, leaving Thiel with 2,547,001 shares. This partial divestment comes at a time when Bitmine maintains substantial Ethereum exposure. The move suggests a strategic rebalancing rather than a complete exit from cryptocurrency investments. Market analysts are closely watching this development because Peter Thiel has been a long-time cryptocurrency advocate. His fund’s decision to sell half its Bitmine stake indicates careful portfolio management rather than bearish sentiment toward the crypto sector overall. Why is Bitmine Important in the Crypto Ecosystem? Bitmine represents a unique bridge between traditional markets and cryptocurrency. As a Nasdaq-listed company with significant Ethereum focus, it offers institutional investors regulated exposure to crypto assets. The Bitmine stake adjustment signals several key insights: Portfolio rebalancing rather than complete exit strategy Risk management in volatile market conditions Strategic positioning for future opportunities Liquidity needs for new investments How Does This Affect Ethereum Investors? The reduced Bitmine stake doesn’t necessarily reflect negative sentiment toward Ethereum specifically. In fact, Bitmine continues its Ethereum-focused investment strategy. However, institutional moves like this often create ripple effects across related assets. Ethereum investors should monitor how other institutional players respond to this Bitmine stake adjustment. Large-scale portfolio changes by respected funds like Founders Fund can influence market sentiment and trading patterns in the short term. What’s Next for Institutional Crypto Investment? This Bitmine stake reduction comes during a period of increased regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. The careful, measured approach shown by Founders Fund suggests sophisticated investors are becoming more strategic about their cryptocurrency exposure. Key factors driving institutional decisions include: Regulatory developments Market volatility patterns Portfolio diversification needs Long-term growth prospects Conclusion: Strategic Moves in Evolving Markets The partial Bitmine stake sale by Peter Thiel’s fund demonstrates thoughtful portfolio management in dynamic market conditions. Rather than signaling reduced confidence in cryptocurrency, this move shows institutional investors are maturing in their approach to digital assets. As markets continue to evolve, such strategic adjustments will become more common. The key takeaway is that sophisticated investors like Founders Fund remain engaged with cryptocurrency while managing risk through careful position sizing. Frequently Asked Questions How much of its Bitmine stake did Founders Fund sell? Founders Fund sold exactly half of its Bitmine stake, reducing its position by 50% while maintaining 2,547,001 shares in the company. Why would Peter Thiel reduce his Bitmine exposure? There are several possible reasons including portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, risk management, or freeing up capital for new investment opportunities. Does this affect Bitmine’s Ethereum investments? No, this stake reduction doesn’t directly impact Bitmine’s operations or its Ethereum investment strategy. It only changes Founders Fund’s ownership percentage. What does this mean for other crypto investors? While notable, this single transaction shouldn’t dramatically alter individual investment strategies. It’s more indicative of institutional portfolio management practices. Will Founders Fund completely exit its Bitmine position? The 50% reduction suggests a measured approach rather than complete exit. Maintaining half the stake indicates continued interest in Bitmine’s prospects. How does this compare to other institutional crypto moves? This partial reduction aligns with patterns of sophisticated investors taking profits while maintaining core positions in promising crypto-related companies. Found this analysis helpful?

Seasoned Ethereum Holders Are Increasing Their Distribution As explained by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the 3 to 10 years old Ethereum holders have notably raised their spending recently. These investors belong to a broader group known as the long-term holder (LTH) cohort, which has a holding time cutoff of 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the LTHs as a whole can be considered diamond hands. Since the 3 to 10 years old ETH investors would be old even by the standard of the LTHs, they may be assumed to include the most stalwart of HODLers. Given this stature of the cohort, the behavior of its investors may be worth keeping an eye on, for selling from them could be a sign that market conditions have forced even the most seasoned hands into exiting. One way to track the behavior of the group is through the Spent Volume by Age indicator, which tracks the transactions that the various investor age bands are making on the blockchain. Below is the chart for the metric shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in its 90-day moving average (MA) for Ethereum over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the Spent Volume by Age has shot up for the investors belonging in the 3 to 10 years holding time bracket since late-August. At present, the 90-day MA is sitting above 45,000 ETH, meaning the veterans of the market are selling tokens worth $139 million every day. “This marks the highest spending level by seasoned investors since Feb 2021,” noted the analytics firm. Besides the selloff in February, this group also participated in almost the same level of distribution alongside the bull run top in the second half of that year. As the latest wave of selling has arrived, Ethereum has witnessed bearish momentum. It only remains to be seen whether this decline in the price would lead into another bear market like in late 2021, or if the bull run will regain its footing as in February 2021. LTH selling isn’t the only bearish factor that ETH has had to deal with recently. As the chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn shows, the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have witnessed significant outflows over the past month. From the above chart, it’s apparent that Ethereum spot ETFs are seeing a negative 30-day netflow of $1.21 billion, while Bitcoin has had it even worse with $2.80 billion in net outflows. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,100, down over 4% in the last week.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum HODLers|Ethereum Long-Term Holders|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 06:00:04

This strategic move reinforces the growing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum and signals strong belief in the future of cryptocurrency investments among traditional financial giants. Why Is Goldman Sachs Doubling Down on Spot ETH ETF? The investment bank’s latest acquisition brings its total holdings to 42.3 million shares, maintaining its position as the largest institutional holder of BlackRock’s Ethereum fund. This substantial investment highlights several key advantages of spot ETH ETF investments: Direct exposure to Ethereum price movements Regulatory compliance and security Institutional-grade custody solutions Simplified investment process for traditional investors How Does This Impact the Spot ETH ETF Market? Goldman Sachs’ continued dominance in the spot ETH ETF space creates significant market implications. The bank now controls the largest institutional position in BlackRock’s fund, while global hedge fund Millennium Management follows as the second-largest holder with 28.1 million shares. This concentration of institutional interest demonstrates: Growing institutional confidence in Ethereum Increased liquidity for the spot ETH ETF market Potential for broader cryptocurrency adoption Enhanced credibility for digital asset investments What Challenges Face Spot ETH ETF Investors? Despite the growing institutional interest, investors considering spot ETH ETF positions should remain aware of potential challenges. Market volatility remains a significant factor, along with regulatory uncertainties and technological risks associated with blockchain networks. However, the continued investment from major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs suggests these concerns are being carefully managed through: Sophisticated risk management strategies Long-term investment horizons Diversified portfolio approaches Expert market analysis Actionable Insights for Spot ETH ETF Consideration For investors inspired by Goldman Sachs’ move, several practical steps can help navigate the spot ETH ETF landscape. First, research the specific terms and fees associated with different spot ETH ETF offerings. Second, consider your investment timeline and risk tolerance. Third, monitor regulatory developments that could affect spot ETH ETF valuations. Finally, remember that institutional moves like Goldman Sachs’ significant spot ETH ETF acquisition often signal broader market trends worth watching. The Future of Institutional Spot ETH ETF Investment The continued accumulation of spot ETH ETF shares by major financial institutions points toward a maturing cryptocurrency market. As more traditional players enter the space through vehicles like BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF, we can expect increased market stability, improved regulatory frameworks, and greater mainstream acceptance. This trend suggests that spot ETH ETF investments may become a standard component of diversified institutional portfolios. The stunning expansion of Goldman Sachs’ spot ETH ETF position represents more than just a single investment decision—it signals a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. With the bank maintaining its leadership in BlackRock’s Ethereum fund and other institutions following suit, the spot ETH ETF market appears poised for continued growth and institutional adoption. Frequently Asked Questions What is a spot ETH ETF? A spot ETH ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Ethereum tokens, providing investors with direct exposure to ETH price movements without needing to manage cryptocurrency wallets or private keys. Why is Goldman Sachs investing in spot ETH ETF? Goldman Sachs likely sees long-term value in Ethereum and prefers the regulated, secure structure of a spot ETH ETF for institutional investment rather than direct cryptocurrency ownership. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large institutional investments in spot ETH ETF typically increase demand for underlying Ethereum tokens, potentially supporting price stability and growth over time. Can individual investors buy the same spot ETH ETF? Yes, individual investors can purchase shares of BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF through standard brokerage accounts, though specific availability may vary by region and platform. What risks come with spot ETH ETF investment? Spot ETH ETF investments carry market volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty, and technological risks associated with the Ethereum network, similar to direct cryptocurrency ownership. How does this compare to Bitcoin ETF investments? While similar in structure, spot ETH ETF provides exposure to Ethereum’s different use cases and market dynamics compared to Bitcoin-focused products.

Fed member Lorie Logan maintained her hawkish stance, stating in December that she would not support another interest rate cut. Logan had also opposed the cut at the October meeting, highlighting the risks of high inflation. In his statement, Logan stated that inflation is still above target and the upward trend continues: “Looking at the December meeting, it’s hard for me to support another rate cut unless we see strong evidence that inflation is falling faster than I expected, or a more significant cooling in the labor market than a gradual slowdown.” Related News: Death Cross Alert in Bitcoin (BTC) - Watch Out for Tomorrow, Analyst Warns Meanwhile, fellow Fed member Stephen Miran adopted a more dovish stance, arguing that recent data provided a strong case for a rate cut. In his assessment on November 15th, he said that all economic data released since the September meeting pointed to a more lenient policy stance. Milan noted that inflation was better than expected, while the labor market weakened significantly: “All the data we've received supports a dovish stance. Under these circumstances, we need to be more dovish, not the other way around.” *This is not investment advice.

This alarming development follows the devastating $100 million exploit that rocked the DeFi community in early July. According to blockchain analytics firm Onchain-Lenz, the perpetrator is systematically moving stolen Ethereum to the controversial mixing service, raising serious concerns about fund recovery and DeFi security. How is the Balancer hacker moving the stolen funds? The Balancer hacker has adopted a sophisticated laundering strategy that involves multiple steps. First, the perpetrator transfers the stolen ETH to an intermediary address. Then, the funds move to Tornado Cash in carefully calculated batches of 100 ETH each. This methodical approach suggests the hacker understands blockchain tracking techniques and aims to obscure the money trail effectively. Security experts note this pattern is common among experienced cybercriminals. By using intermediate addresses and batch transfers, the Balancer hacker attempts to complicate forensic analysis. However, blockchain analytics companies continue monitoring the movement, hoping to identify potential weaknesses in the laundering scheme. What made Balancer vulnerable to this massive hack? The July 3rd exploit resulted from a critical vulnerability in Balancer’s smart contract code. This security flaw allowed the Balancer hacker to drain funds from multiple pools simultaneously. The attack highlights ongoing challenges in DeFi security, particularly regarding: Smart contract auditing processes Code review and testing protocols Rapid response mechanisms for detected vulnerabilities Insurance and recovery options for affected users Despite previous security audits, the vulnerability remained undetected until exploitation occurred. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even established DeFi protocols face significant security risks. Why is Tornado Cash the preferred choice for crypto hackers? Tornado Cash has become the go-to tool for cybercriminals seeking to obscure cryptocurrency transactions. The Ethereum-based mixer provides privacy by breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses. For the Balancer hacker and similar perpetrators, this service offers several advantages: Decentralized operation makes it difficult to shut down Non-custodial design means no central party controls funds Proven track record of effectively obscuring transaction history Relatively easy to use compared to other mixing methods However, regulatory pressure on privacy tools continues to increase. The U.S. Treasury Department already sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, making it illegal for American citizens to use the service. What does this mean for DeFi security and regulation? The ongoing movement of stolen funds by the Balancer hacker underscores critical issues in decentralized finance. As protocols handle increasingly large amounts of value, security becomes paramount. This incident likely will accelerate several developments: Enhanced regulatory scrutiny of DeFi platforms Improved security auditing standards and practices Greater adoption of insurance protocols and risk mitigation tools Increased collaboration between projects on security matters The community must address these challenges collectively to ensure DeFi’s long-term viability and user protection. Can the stolen funds be recovered or tracked? While Tornado Cash complicates tracking, recovery efforts continue through multiple channels. Blockchain analytics firms work with exchanges and law enforcement to identify the Balancer hacker and potentially freeze funds. However, complete recovery remains challenging due to: The anonymous nature of blockchain transactions Jurisdictional complexities in international investigations Technical limitations of current tracking methods The sophistication of modern money laundering techniques Victims of the hack should monitor official Balancer communications for updates on recovery efforts and potential compensation plans. Frequently Asked Questions How much ETH did the Balancer hacker steal? The Balancer hacker stole over $100 million worth of Ethereum in the July 3rd exploit, making it one of the largest DeFi hacks this year. What is Tornado Cash and how does it work? Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based privacy tool that mixes cryptocurrency transactions to break the link between sender and receiver addresses, making funds harder to trace. Can authorities track funds through Tornado Cash? While Tornado Cash makes tracking difficult, advanced blockchain analysis techniques and coordination with exchanges can sometimes identify laundered funds, though success rates vary. What should Balancer users do now? Affected users should monitor official Balancer communications, check if their funds were in vulnerable pools, and follow security best practices for future DeFi interactions. Has Balancer taken steps to prevent future hacks? Yes, Balancer has implemented security patches, enhanced monitoring, and is working with security firms to prevent similar incidents, though specific details may be limited for security reasons. Are other DeFi protocols at similar risk? All DeFi protocols face security risks, but the level varies based on code quality, auditing processes, and security measures. This incident highlights the importance of thorough security practices across the ecosystem. Help spread awareness about DeFi security!

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/canary-capital-to-pause-on-etf-filings-following-xrp-etf-launch-heres-why/,"As reported by CoinDesk, Canary Capital is likely to pause submissions for new cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the remainder of 2025 after completing filings for all tokens currently eligible under existing regulatory frameworks. The firm’s CEO, Steve McClurg, confirmed that the company has reached a point where additional filings can’t meet the current criteria set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP ETF Debuts Amidst Active Market Interest This week, Canary Capital launched its XRP ETF. It immediately attracted notable attention . It shows demand from institutions for the XRP-backed product. The ETF opened with $58 million in trading volume, as Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that it was one of the most successful ETF launches this year. McClurg, who had previously predicted that the XRP ETF would likely double Solana’s performance , reiterated this prediction, attributing this potential to the broader familiarity of XRP among traditional finance participants and institutions compared to Solana, which has a stronger presence in crypto-native communities. Regulatory Framework Limits New Filings McClurg emphasized that Canary has filed applications for all assets that meet the SEC’s generic listing standards . These standards permit certain crypto-backed ETFs to proceed without undergoing the agency’s lengthy review process. To qualify, a cryptocurrency must satisfy conditions such as maintaining a futures market with at least six months of trading history. According to McClurg, only a limited number of digital assets currently meet these requirements, constraining the firm’s ability to submit additional applications. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Focus Shifts to Existing Products McClurg previously predicted inflows of $5 billion within the first month of the XRP ETF launch. With the XRP and Solana ETFs now live, Canary Capital intends to concentrate on managing these funds while monitoring regulatory developments. McClurg noted that future launches will depend on whether additional cryptocurrencies meet the generic listing standards or can obtain approval through the SEC’s more detailed 19b-4 authorization process, which involves a comprehensive review of ETF applications. Canary Capital’s pause on new ETF filings reflects both regulatory constraints and a strategic focus on managing existing products. The firm aims to ensure recently launched ETFs, including XRP and Solana funds, perform effectively and remain compliant with SEC guidelines. While new ETF launches are unlikely in the near term, the company is prepared to act once additional digital assets meet eligibility requirements.
