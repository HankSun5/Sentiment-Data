Gilbertie shared his perspective during a recent interview with analyst Paul Barron, where he emphasized Ripple’s disciplined approach and the scale of its ambitions. Ripple’s Structure and Vision Impress Teucrium CEO During the interview, Gilbertie described Ripple as an organization with strong internal coordination and a clear plan for expanding its blockchain-based payment solutions. He noted that the company’s operational structure and execution place it in a position to challenge established institutions. According to Gilbertie, the blockchain company is developing technology that aims to serve markets traditionally dominated by JPMorgan, a firm that manages more than $4.6 trillion in assets and plays a central role in global financial operations. JPMorgan processes approximately $10 trillion in transactions every day across more than 160 countries. Gilbertie pointed out that Ripple’s payment products are designed to target a share of this high-volume settlement activity. He added that Ripple has been moving in this direction methodically, and its ambitions will become more pronounced once it secures a banking license. Ripple applied for a U.S. banking charter through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in July. If granted, the license would permit the company to offer fiduciary services, including custody solutions for its RLUSD stablecoin. Gilbertie believes this development would significantly strengthen Ripple’s competitive position in the financial industry.

These concerns resurfaced after CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified that XRP remains central to Ripple’s roadmap, despite the firm’s expansion into other areas of financial technology. Gilbertie supported Garlinghouse’s stance, stating that Ripple has little incentive to dispose of its XRP reserves. He questioned the rationale behind selling large amounts of the token, arguing that maintaining its holdings aligns with the company’s broader objectives. However, he acknowledged that Ripple may sell limited quantities of XRP in the future, particularly if the asset’s value rises substantially. According to Gilbertie, Garlinghouse’s comments about XRP’s role in Ripple’s strategy were understated. He suggested that Ripple’s technology and services have a much larger potential impact than some observers recognize. This is not the first time Gilbertie has expressed confidence in Ripple’s direction. Earlier in the year, he stated that Ripple could one day serve as an alternative to SWIFT, the dominant messaging system used for international bank transfers. He also reiterated his view that XRP offers considerable utility and demand within the digital asset market.

BLOK's portfolio balances core blockchain companies with exposure to bitcoin miners, exchanges, fintech, and AI-adjacent large caps, reducing single-stock and bitcoin price risk. Compared to peers, BLOK delivers superior risk-reward, lower volatility, and thematic diversification, making it a standout choice for crypto ecosystem exposure. I rate BLOK as overweight in a crypto portfolio, emphasizing its structural advantages, empirical performance, and potential to benefit from broader blockchain adoption. There are many alternatives when it comes to investing in the crypto ecosystem, looking beyond just bitcoins and bitcoin mining companies. I recently wrote about an AI-powered Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF (STCE), and found it a decent Buy. The Amplify Blockchain Technology ETF ( BLOK ) is another name I recommend. It has been an outperformer, remaining with the top half of the crypto pack (say STCE, DAPP, BKCH) in most market conditions and has some structural advantages (that we will discuss in this article) that make it a long term Buy. The volatility of the crypto space is huge and investors need to have high growth high risk appetite to be able to ride this ETF. Also, to cut idiosyncratic risks, I particularly emphasize a basket of ETFs each having their own strengths. So, while STCE does find a place in that portfolio for its unbiased rules-based but active-like positioning (backed by performance data), BLOK's active strategy presents a decent balance of investments beyond mining and bitcoin prices, optional plays in AI and a well-diversified portfolio (low single-stock risks). Methodology and Portfolio BLOK's investment universe starts from companies meaningfully involved in blockchain development, usage, R&D or commercialization. Managers check for blockchain relevance (including profiting from blockchain based data). The portfolio of 40-60 stocks comprises a 70% core holding in companies who derive significant revenue from blockchain. The remaining portfolio (secondary ~30%) consists of companies having partnerships and investments in the space. Stocks are weighted equally within each group, although the active methodology means deviations over time (particularly given the portfolio size and idiosyncratic volatile moves between stocks). However, individual stock risk looks relatively muted compared to STCE (top weight ~11.3%), VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) (top weight ~8.64%) and Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) (~13.12%). The top 10 holdings account for a reasonable ~35% of the total portfolio — not too concentrated. For comparison here are the top 10 total weightings: for DAPP ~60%, BKCH ~71% and STCE~60%. The diversification is a real structural strength for a crypto-themed ETF and should help protect the portfolio from adverse movements in single stocks. Top 10 Holdings - BLOK (Seeking Alpha) Inferences from the Portfolio Based on a manual scan of the current holdings , I found ~22% investments in bitcoin miners and infrastructure, names like HUT 8 Corp (HUT), Cipher Mining, Inc. (CIFR) and TeraWulf, Inc. (WULF). This is the most correlated part of BLOK to crypto prices and is reasonably low exposure to that extent. Adding another ~8% exposure in bitcoin ETFs and Trusts like iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) or even Strategy Inc (MSTR), the total bitcoin correlated part of the portfolio adds up to only ~30%. The bulk of the portfolio benefits beyond simply bitcoin price moves, unlike a mining focused ETF like say CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF (WGMI). Exchanges and Brokerages account for a significant ~24% of the portfolio — companies like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD), Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) and CME Group, Inc. (CME). These companies generate revenues from trading and services fees. They need transaction volumes and not bitcoin price appreciation directly. They can benefit from greater bitcoin adoption and trading, so lower volatility over time in crypto prices is more important than a bull market alone (of course, a bull market helps). Then there is a ~17% exposure in payments and fintech to companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL), NU Holdings Ltd. (NU) and even MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI). This layer is very diversified on its own with companies like MercadoLibre's share prices having very low dependency on bitcoin prices. Even the more dependent names like Paypal and Nu Holdings will benefit from increased crypto adoption (i.e. if bitcoin becomes a more accepted currency globally) versus sheer price appreciation. BLOK also has ~15% in enterprise blockchain and AI-adjacent large caps — NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) are in this mix. They walk into the ETF on the basis of infrastructure support to mining and blockchain technology (from chips to cloud support). This is a very good diversification away from crypto prices and happens to have an AI optionality too in a lot of cases (like Nvidia and AMD). Performance Insights The diversification by theme and a breakaway from the crypto prices provide substantial alpha avenues for BLOK. BLOK could grow in many ways: AI compute, semis, fintech volumes, enterprise software spending or even tokenization. The bulk of BLOK doesn’t need Bitcoin prices to rise - it only needs Bitcoin to keep getting adopted. Adoption happens when volatility falls, not when prices spike alone. Even within the ~30% of the portfolio more directly linked with bitcoin prices, surprises happen. Some traditional miners are turning into AI compute and hosting, like TeraWulf and Core Scientific, Inc. (CORZ). These shares actually led to a significant surge in BLOK at a time when bitcoin prices did not rise at all. At some point in October, BLOK was up 50% while bitcoin was still flat. Data by YCharts This AI side story was of course very well captured in a bitcoin mining focused ETF like WGMI where IREN Limited (IREN) and Cipher Mining (both together account for over a third of the overall portfolio). WGMI tripled in October due to this evolving story, but has also fallen by 42% since. WGMI's volatility is actually what makes BLOK's diversification more risk aware, both in terms of single stock exposure as well as exposure to several agnostic themes. I have already charted the outperformance in BLOK versus IBIT (a proxy for bitcoin), illustrating its reward potential versus bitcoins. This comes at the cost of volatility that is lower than bitcoin's. In terms of standard deviations, BLOK shows 10% lower standard deviation than IBIT and less than half of WGMI. Both empirically, and in terms of how the portfolio is structured, expect BLOK to have a far superior risk-reward asymmetry than IBIT or WGMI like bitcoin focused bets. A comparison with other crypto-themed ETFs also show BLOK has been in the top 2 most of the time over the past 3 years (observe the trajectory and not only the end point outperformance). Here are the standard deviation numbers for the risk/volatility perspective - BLOK ~45, STCE ~63, BKCH ~77 and DAPP ~74. Overall, BLOK is consistently towards the higher end of the total return spectrum within the crypto pack, while its risks are far lower. That calls for overweighing BLOK in any crypto and blockchain portfolio. Data by YCharts Overweight BLOK I rate BLOK a Buy backed by several empirical evidences and structural advantages. First, its single stock diversification is best-in-class. Secondly, thematic diversification means lower volatility. Third, empirical performance shows these expectations actually translate to real life performance. BLOK outperforms most of the crypto pack most of the time and keeps volatility levels low. Overall, I am bullish this ETF segment, that invests on a crypto ecosystem rather than just bitcoins and mining. This positions it to gain from simply better adoption over bitcoin appreciation. With regulatory supports coming in , in the US as well as elsewhere, as bitcoin adoption grows, this theme will likely keep growing. Crypto investing cannot be defensive given its volatility, so investors should have the risk appetite to wade through 50% MTM losses at some point. A systematic accumulation over time works. At least the wider crypto plays makes for lower volatility levels - but still may require similar levels of risk appetite. The overall crypto ecosystem bet looks bullish otherwise, with BLOK a material overweight in that portfolio.",STCE|BKCH|DAPP|BLOK,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-26 23:38:12

Whales have started moving large volumes of PEPE to exchanges, a classic red flag that a sell-off could be near. According to Nansen, exchange-held PEPE has jumped from 250 trillion on November 6 to 258 trillion today, marking a 30-day high. This comes as open interest in PEPE futures sinks to just $165 million, far below its $1 billion peak in July. With sentiment crumbling and traders pulling back, the risk of a deeper drop is growing fast. Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Could Bounce Back Strongly If It Drops to This Key Area Since the year started, Pepe has lost over 77% of its value. As a result, it is one of the worst-performing tokens in the market and the biggest loser of the top 5 in the meme coin category. The weekly chart shows that Pepe just hit a key support area at $0.0000040. This level lies right above a weekly fair value gap (FVG). These FVGs are price imbalances caused by a strong surge in the demand for an asset. This FVG dates back to February 2024, back when Pepe’s popularity was surging. If the price dips to this level in the next few days, the odds of a strong rebound will increase. In the mean time, a new mine-to-earn (M2E) game inspired in the Pepe the Frog meme called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has received millions from investors. This early presale gamifies crypto mining and could outperform the OG Pepe this year. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Turns Mining Into an Interactive Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is reimagining how crypto mining works by introducing a fun game where players can launch virtual servers and rigs to earn meme coins and compete for rewards. No expensive hardware is needed to run your mining operation. Simply invest $PEPENODE tokens to get your virtual server up and fire up as many rigs as you want. Top miners who make it to the leaderboard will receive airdrops of top tokens like Bonk ($BONK) and Pepe ($PEPE). In addition, the game incorporates referral boosts, anti-bot protection, and a token burn program. This last feature removes up to 70% of the $PEPENODE used for upgrading rigs from circulation, increasing scarcity of the token. To buy $PEPENODE and start mining right away, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet. You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead.

The body representing exchanges voicing its concerns comes as the SEC considers whether to issue a form of “innovation exemption” that would allow crypto companies to offer blockchain-based tokens representing exposure to listed stocks, instruments that would be sold to US retail investors without the platforms registering as broker-dealers. This proposal, which is supported by several crypto platforms, is being considered by SEC chair Paul Atkins, highlighting the agency’s recalibrated approach to digital assets under the Trump administration . The tokenization debate divides traditional and crypto finance This is not the first time the WFE has raised concerns about tokenized equities. In August, it wrote to regulators in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, urging a crackdown on unlicensed platforms offering tokenized stocks, warning of investor-protection issues and reputational risks for listed companies whose names are used without consent. It went further to ask that regulators apply the same rules used on securities to tokenized assets. Despite the body’s concerns, interest in tokenization continues to grow across the financial sector. Large banks, asset managers, and trading venues have begun exploring blockchain-based settlement and token-form assets as part of efforts to modernize financial infrastructure. The trend has gained more traction this year as crypto-native platforms seek direct access to the US equities market, while traditional exchanges experiment with on-chain settlement models. Nasdaq’s push for regulated tokenized securities. Nasdaq, one of the WFE’s most prominent members, has simultaneously been pushing for a regulated path toward tokenization. In September, it submitted a formal rule-change proposal that would allow the exchange to list and trade stocks in tokenized form, assigning the digital instruments the same regulatory treatment, including rights and CUSIP identification, as conventional shares. However, Ondo Finance, a blockchain startup offering financial market solutions, called for delays until Nasdaq provides further details on how trades in tokenized form would be processed through the Depository Trust Company, which operates the core plumbing of US securities settlement. Within the WFE itself, members acknowledge tokenization’s potential. The letter describes blockchain-based equity instruments as a “natural evolution in capital markets.” However, many exchanges argue that innovation must occur within the existing regulatory framework rather than through exemptions granted to unlicensed crypto platforms. James Auliffe, head of the WFE’s technology working group, said equity markets are already “very, very efficient,” and that proponents of moving trading onto blockchains still need to prove the benefits outweigh the costs. High stakes for regulators and markets The SEC’s decision on the matter will shape the future of how equities are traded and accessed in the US. Allowing tokenized stocks to be offered without conventional broker-dealer oversight could potentially enable firms outside the traditional financial system to compete directly with exchanges and brokers that face far stricter compliance obligations. Investor advocates fear that retail traders may not understand the difference between owning a token linked to a stock and holding the real equity itself. Earlier this year, companies including OpenAI warned that tokenized versions of their shares circulating on trading apps did not represent actual ownership. Don’t just read crypto news.

In a move that highlights the critical importance of metadata privacy , Buterin donated 128 ETH each to two decentralized messaging platforms – Session and SimpleX. This substantial contribution underscores his commitment to solving one of the most pressing challenges in modern technology. Why Is Metadata Privacy So Crucial Today? When we think about privacy, we often focus on message content. However, metadata privacy protects the information about our communications – who we talk to, when we communicate, and for how long. This data can reveal sensitive patterns about our lives, relationships, and activities. Buterin recognizes that true digital freedom requires protecting both message content and communication patterns. What Makes Session and SimpleX Special for Metadata Protection? Both platforms approach metadata privacy from different but complementary angles. Session uses a decentralized network of service nodes that don’t require phone numbers or personal information. Meanwhile, SimpleX employs a unique architecture where users control their own servers. Here are their key advantages: No phone number or email required for registration Decentralized infrastructure prevents single points of failure Advanced encryption protects both content and connection data Open-source code allows community verification How Will These Donations Advance Metadata Privacy Technology? The 256 ETH total donation (approximately $800,000 at current prices) provides significant resources for both projects to accelerate development. This funding will help them tackle the core challenges Buterin identified: Permissionless account creation without personal identifiers Enhanced protection against metadata analysis Improved user experience while maintaining security Broader adoption through better documentation and tools What Does This Mean for the Future of Private Communication? Buterin’s endorsement signals a major shift in priorities for the cryptocurrency community. By supporting these projects, he’s encouraging developers and users to prioritize metadata privacy as a fundamental right. This move could inspire similar investments and innovations across the decentralized technology space. How Can You Support Metadata Privacy Initiatives? Buterin explicitly encouraged the community to participate in both projects. Here are practical ways you can contribute: Download and use Session or SimpleX for your daily communications Contribute to their open-source code repositories Help with documentation and user education Spread awareness about the importance of metadata privacy Vitalik Buterin’s strategic donations represent more than just financial support – they’re a clear statement about the future direction of private communication. By backing Session and SimpleX, he’s helping build a world where true metadata privacy becomes accessible to everyone, not just technical experts. This investment in foundational technology could ultimately benefit millions of users seeking genuine digital privacy. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is metadata in messaging? Metadata refers to information about your communications rather than the content itself. This includes who you’re talking to, when messages are sent, message frequency, and device information. Why did Vitalik choose 128 ETH specifically? While Buterin didn’t specify why 128 ETH, the number holds significance in computer science as a power of two, potentially symbolizing his technical background and the binary nature of digital systems. Are Session and SimpleX completely anonymous? While they offer strong privacy protections, no system provides perfect anonymity. Both platforms significantly reduce metadata exposure compared to traditional messaging apps. Can I use these apps alongside my current messaging services? Yes, both Session and SimpleX can be installed alongside other messaging apps, allowing you to gradually transition sensitive conversations to more private platforms. How do these donations impact Ethereum’s price? While the donations show confidence in Ethereum’s utility, the amount represents a small fraction of daily trading volume and isn’t likely to significantly impact price movements. What makes these platforms different from Signal or Telegram? Unlike Signal and Telegram, Session and SimpleX don’t require phone numbers and use decentralized architectures that provide stronger protection against metadata collection.

Then every post tied to the rollout quietly disappeared from his social media platforms without explanation, That disappearance was enough rocket fuel for McGregor. “There is just no way good guy Khabib used his late father’s name, as well as Dagestan’s culture, to scam his fans,” McGregor wrote on X. “Fire selling digital NFTs online and then deleting all the content after they were sold, he added. “what a shame and a stain on his father’s name,” he wrote further. Khabib denies NFT scam He didn’t stop there and stated that “Father’s plan has now become Father’s scam. Very sad.” McGregor’s timing wasn’t accidental, as he recently insisted on preparing for a 2025 comeback. However, recently re-entered the drug-testing pool. The former champ has been teasing a return ever since the UFC confirmed plans for a blockbuster White House event in 2026. Khabib did respond to the allegations and denied the accusations. He went on to call McGregor “an absolute liar” while defending both the project and his family’s reputation. Sources close to the launch say the NFT collection was framed as a tribute to his late father, Abdulmanap. It was supposed to be a digital keepsake rather than a speculative cash-grab. Source: Conor McGregor’s X post (Now deleted) The situation took a hit within hours when On-chain investigator ZachXBT stepped into the conversation. He didn’t defend Khabib, but turned McGregor’s own words against him. He reposted McGregor’s accusations with receipts from the fighter’s own 2022 NFT project, “McGregor Realm.” It was rolled out with celebrity fanfare and then quietly vanished from his feeds in a similar fashion. “Sound familiar?” the investigator asked. The back-and-forth instantly revived one of MMA’s most bitter rivalries. NFTPRICEFLOOR data shows that the global NFT market cap hovers around $3,3 billion. It jumped by around a 4% change over the last 24 hours. The global crypto turned up for the recovery rally as its total market cap regained the $3.1 trillion mark. Its 24 hour trading volume clicked $140 million. Bitcoin price surge above $90,000 has given bulls some hope. Their feud has stayed alive for six years, even though one retired as the undefeated lightweight champion and the other has been recovering from a career-halting leg break. As of now, McGregor is signaling a comeback and Khabib is returning fire publicly for the first time in a while.

Market data across multiple timeframes indicates that ADA continues to face an uncertain short-term outlook despite minor intraday improvements. Overview of Recent ADA Performance The asset experienced a sharp retracement late in November, declining from approximately $0.47 on Nov. 20 to around $0.39 the next day. Over the last 24 hours, ADA has traded within a relatively narrow range between $0.4065 and $0.4274, reflecting efforts by buyers to stabilize the market while still encountering selling pressure near the upper band of the range. On broader time horizons, bearish sentiment remains dominant. Cardano has recorded a 6.4% decline over the past week and a 38.52% drop across the past month. The token’s market capitalization has also fallen to $15.06 billion, reinforcing market concerns about sustained weakness. With these indicators, analysts are watching to see whether buyers can regain influence or whether ADA may extend its corrective structure. Technical Assessment: Resistance Levels Remain Firm Analysis of Cardano’s weekly chart shows that the asset is still positioned beneath several influential resistance zones. The Ichimoku Cloud framework continues to identify a negative trend, with ADA trading well below the cloud. This structure confirms ongoing weakness and reinforces the challenge ahead for any bullish reversal. The Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen lines are also aligned in a bearish configuration, currently positioned at $0.59 and $0.65. These levels represent immediate barriers that ADA must reclaim before attempting any broader recovery. For a shift in market structure toward a more favorable trajectory, Cardano must close decisively above the cloud, with the region around $0.75 serving as the central threshold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If sellers maintain their hold, ADA could revisit lower supports, particularly near $0.29. The Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) provides additional insight, currently registering at -75.33. Although some signs of stabilization exist, the indicator reflects continued difficulty in generating sustained upward momentum. The lack of a firm close above key resistance, combined with depressed momentum readings, supports a cautious outlook for the near term. Beyond technical indicators, Cardano’s social activity offers a contrasting data point. A recent snapshot from Mintern shows that ADA holds a 9.6% share of social media discussions among major chains. This significantly exceeds the engagement levels of networks such as XRP at 2.9%, Solana at 1.55%, and USDC at 1.55%. High social visibility suggests that Cardano maintains a notably active and involved community. While social dominance does not guarantee immediate price appreciation, it often reflects resilience in market interest, which can influence sentiment-driven trading activity.

Related Reading: Hoskinson Claims Cardano Revival Starts Now: Here’s What’s Coming The fifth-largest U.S. bank is piloting a dollar-backed stablecoin on Stellar, an initiative that could accelerate institutional adoption and strengthen market confidence in XLM heading into year-end. U.S. Bancorp Selects Stellar for Bank-Grade Stablecoin Infrastructure The Minneapolis-based banking giant has partnered with PwC and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) to test programmable deposits and stablecoin payments on Stellar’s public blockchain. What sets Stellar apart, according to U.S. Bank’s digital assets head Mike Villano, is its built-in ability to freeze assets, unwind transactions, and enforce compliance at the protocol level. These capabilities are essential for regulated banks that must adhere to KYC, AML, and consumer protection standards. Unlike traditional “business logic” solutions, Stellar offers these controls directly at the blockchain layer, giving banks the confidence needed to explore tokenized finance. The pilot arrives amid a resurgence of institutional interest. Banks, including Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, have begun designing stablecoin frameworks. U.S. Bank recently relaunched its digital assets division to tap into opportunities in custody, tokenisation, and blockchain-based payments. Institutional Momentum Could Drive Mainstream Stablecoin Adoption If successful, U.S. Bancorp’s trial could pave the way for fully regulated, deposit-backed stablecoins issued directly by banks, unlocking new efficiencies for cross-border transfers, treasury operations, and global settlements. With projections suggesting that stablecoin payments could reach $1 trillion annually by 2030, banks are racing to claim their share of the digital payments market. Stellar’s high uptime, low-cost settlement, and remittance-focused architecture make it an appealing choice for real-world financial applications. As institutions embrace public blockchains, Stellar stands positioned as one of the few networks offering both decentralization and the regulatory controls banks require. XLM Price Outlook: Analyst Targets Signal 24–36% Upside The U.S. Bancorp announcement has arrived at a pivotal time for Stellar’s native token, XLM . Trading near $0.25, the asset is showing early signs of bullish momentum, supported by: MACD bullish divergence Neutral RSI at 42, offering room to climb Price sitting on 20-EMA support Breakout potential above $0.28–$0.31 Analysts expect XLM to target the $0.31–$0.34 range within the next 2–4 weeks, a potential 24–36% upside, if volume expands and the broader crypto market remains stable. A break below $0.22 would invalidate the bullish thesis. Related Reading: South Korea Risks Stablecoin Legislation Delay As Financial Authorities Clash With BOK As Wall Street experiments with Stellar’s blockchain, institutional utility could become a significant driver for XLM’s long-term valuation.

With price momentum weakening and long-term trend indicators flashing bearish warning signals, the possibility of a price crash to $38,000 is becoming hard to ignore. 50-MA Breakdown To Trigger $38,000 Bitcoin Price Crash The Bitcoin price action took a decisive turn this week as the market slipped below the 50 MA for the first time in this four-year cycle. Severino noted in his technical analysis shared on X this Monday that the 50 MA has historically marked the beginning of extended downturns. He stated that following Bitcoin’s launch over 14 years ago, every time it has closed below the 50 MA, a prolonged bear market has followed. Related Reading: Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days Severino’s price chart highlights BTC’s price performance from 2017 to date. In the past three Bitcoin bear markets, after the price fell below the 50-week MA, BTC continued to drop an additional 61%, 59%, and 67%. On average, the cryptocurrency has lost 62% from the break point. Applying the 62% drawdown to this cycle’s 50 MA level, the analyst predicts Bitcoin could soon experience a price crash to $38,000. From the cryptocurrency’s current price of above $87,000, this represents a staggering 60% decline. Additionally, it would imply a roughly 70% decline from its all-time high of more than $126,000. Severino warns that traders calling for a price bottom may be ignoring how far Bitcoin has historically fallen once this long-term trend fails. He indicated that the 50-week MA has repeatedly served as a dividing line between bullish and bearish phases, and that price slipping below it has more often led to extended periods of weakness and capitulation. Bitcoin Momentum Indicator Falls To Historic Lows A second analysis presented by Severino focuses on Bitcoin’s daily LMACD, which is now near levels not seen in more than 1,250 days. The oscillator has only pushed below this level six times since BTC’s 2017 macro peak. These past instances correspond to periods of heavy downside momentum where the cryptocurrency had yet to complete its bottoming process. Related Reading: One Of The Most Popular Bitcoin Advocates Dumps Millions In BTC, Here’s Why Looking at Severino’s price chart, the extended period without revisiting this lower bound suggests Bitcoin may be overdue for a momentum reset. The LMACD indicator’s current reading is also unusually weak historically, signaling that market momentum has not yet reached extreme pessimism. The readings further indicate that, although BTC remains in a downtrend, price corrections remain possible before a true bottom is established. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is trading below $87,000 amid volatile, choppy conditions that have contributed to its 24% decline over the past month.

This approval positions Securitize as the only available company possessing licensed tokenisation infrastructure in both the European Union and the US. This news was made public after Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) reportedly permitted the company to run its system throughout the bloc. Notably, this government agency is the country’s securities regulator responsible for supervising and regulating Spain’s securities markets and financial sector. With this go-ahead in place, Securitize outlined its intentions to make use of its European trading and settlement system on Avalanche . When reporters asked the firm why it chose this network, it acknowledged that the network has fast settlement times and an adaptable setup that meets the needs of institutions. In the meantime, sources hinted that the first issuance under this new approval is expected to take place in early 2026. Securitize secures approval to run its system throughout the EU Apart from securing approval to run a regulated trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime, an earlier report dated December 2024 also noted that Securitize acquired a separate Investment Firm license from CNMV. This license played a significant role in the firm’s operations, as it enabled its team to execute orders, secure assets, and serve as a digital transfer agent for tokenised securities. Since then, Securitize has solidified its position as a leader in the financial services and fintech sectors. It achieved this major success after the license began to be recognised in key countries in the EU, such as the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany, and Luxembourg. Interestingly, the new approval takes a step further by permitting Securitize to manage the market infrastructure directly. This means that the company can freely establish a regulated setting primarily for issuing, trading, and settling tokenised securities across the EU. Moreover, the new authorisation links smoothly with Securitize’s existing US operations, where the firm acts as a registered broker-dealer, digital transfer agent, fund administrator and alternative trading system. To further illustrate its commitment to solidify its position as a leader in the industry, Securitize recently made clear its plan to go public via a $1.25 billion SPAC deal backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. Following the announcement of this intention, sources revealed that the company has become a significant provider of tokenisation infrastructure for key institutions, including Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, and VanEck. To support this claim, it was discovered that Securitize is responsible for BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which is the first on-chain Treasurys product to surpass a record of $1 billion in assets and has now surged to over $4 billion. Securitize made clear its intentions to go public Last month, reports highlighted that Securitize was the latest crypto-focused firm to reveal its intentions to go public. At the time, the company had valued itself at $1.25 billion before any investments were made. The tokenisation leader is planning to list in the US. Once the necessary steps for going public are finalized, sources close to the situation pointed out that the new entity will go by the name Securitize Corp. and be listed on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol SECZ. Securitize also plans to tokenise its own shares. In a statement, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo commented that this is a crucial moment for Securitize and for the future of finance. “We started this company to make capital markets more open, clear, and efficient through tokenisation. This marks an important step toward making financial markets as fast as the internet and advancing our mission to bring the next generation of finance on-chain and tokenize everything.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This sudden maintenance action, which began at 11:55 p.m. UTC on November 26, affects millions of users worldwide. The Upbit emergency inspection represents a crucial security measure, but it also raises important questions about what prompted this urgent action and when normal operations will resume. What Triggered This Upbit Emergency Inspection? The cryptocurrency community was taken by surprise when Upbit announced its emergency maintenance. While the exchange hasn’t revealed specific details about what prompted this urgent Upbit emergency inspection, such measures typically occur for several reasons. Exchange platforms often conduct emergency inspections to address potential security vulnerabilities, update system protocols, or investigate suspicious activities. This proactive approach demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to user asset protection, though it does cause temporary inconvenience. Regular maintenance helps prevent larger issues down the line. However, emergency inspections like this Upbit emergency inspection usually indicate the platform has identified something requiring immediate attention. The timing suggests the exchange prioritizes security over convenience, even if it means disrupting trading activities during peak hours. How Does This Upbit Emergency Inspection Affect Your Trading? During this Upbit emergency inspection period, users face specific limitations that impact their trading strategies. Understanding these restrictions helps you plan accordingly and avoid frustration. All digital asset deposits are temporarily suspended Withdrawal requests cannot be processed Existing balances remain secure and unaffected Trading between cryptocurrencies may continue normally Fiat currency transactions are also paused This comprehensive Upbit emergency inspection means you cannot move funds onto or off the exchange until maintenance completes. However, your stored assets remain safe, and the inspection doesn’t affect your ability to trade between different cryptocurrencies already in your Upbit wallet. When Will Normal Services Resume After This Upbit Emergency Inspection? Upbit has not provided a specific timeline for when the Upbit emergency inspection will conclude. Historically, similar emergency maintenance periods on major exchanges have lasted anywhere from a few hours to several days. The duration typically depends on the complexity of the issues being addressed and the thoroughness required to ensure complete system security. Users should monitor Upbit’s official communication channels for updates. The exchange will likely provide progress reports through their website, social media accounts, and email notifications. Patience is crucial during these security measures, as rushing the process could compromise the effectiveness of the Upbit emergency inspection. Why Should You Support This Upbit Emergency Inspection? While temporary service suspensions are inconvenient, this Upbit emergency inspection ultimately benefits all users. Security measures protect your investments from potential threats that could cause far greater damage than temporary access restrictions. The cryptocurrency space has seen numerous exchange hacks resulting in massive losses, making proactive security essential. This Upbit emergency inspection demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to maintaining robust security standards. By addressing potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, Upbit protects both individual users and the broader ecosystem. Such responsible practices help build trust in cryptocurrency platforms and contribute to mainstream adoption. What Can You Do During the Upbit Emergency Inspection? While waiting for the Upbit emergency inspection to conclude, savvy traders can use this time productively. You can research new investment opportunities, analyze market trends, or educate yourself about security best practices. This unexpected pause provides an opportunity to review your trading strategy and ensure you’re prepared when services resume. Remember that other exchanges continue operating normally, though transferring assets between platforms isn’t possible during the Upbit emergency inspection. Use this time to diversify your knowledge rather than worrying about temporary access limitations. Final Thoughts on the Upbit Emergency Inspection The Upbit emergency inspection, while inconvenient, represents the exchange’s strong commitment to security and user protection. In the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, such proactive measures are essential for maintaining trust and preventing catastrophic security breaches. While the temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals disrupts trading activities, the long-term benefits of enhanced security far outweigh the short-term inconveniences. As we await further updates from Upbit regarding their emergency inspection, remember that security should always take priority over convenience in the digital asset space. This incident serves as a reminder that even major exchanges must remain vigilant against emerging threats in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is happening with Upbit? Upbit is conducting an emergency inspection of its digital asset deposit and withdrawal systems, temporarily suspending these services to ensure platform security. Can I still trade cryptocurrencies on Upbit during the inspection? Yes, trading between different cryptocurrencies already in your Upbit wallet should continue normally.

Emergency maintenance typically lasts from several hours to a few days, depending on the issues being addressed. Is my money safe during this inspection? Yes, your existing balances remain secure and unaffected. The inspection is a preventive measure to enhance security, not a response to lost funds. Will I be notified when services resume? Upbit will likely announce when services resume through their official website, social media channels, and email notifications to registered users.

This crucial market sentiment indicator has climbed seven points from yesterday’s reading, yet remains firmly in the danger zone. But what does this actually mean for your cryptocurrency holdings and future investments? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Should You Care? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional thermometer, measuring investor sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100. When the index reads 0, it indicates maximum fear, while 100 represents extreme greed. Currently sitting at 22, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests that market participants are overwhelmingly pessimistic. This emotional gauge combines multiple data points to provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. The index calculation incorporates six key factors: Volatility (25% weighting) Market volume (25% weighting) Social media sentiment (15% weighting) Survey results (15% weighting) Bitcoin dominance (10% weighting) Google search trends (10% weighting) How Does Extreme Fear Impact Cryptocurrency Prices? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index drops into extreme fear territory, several market dynamics typically emerge. First, selling pressure often increases as nervous investors exit positions. Second, buying opportunities may appear for contrarian investors who recognize that extreme fear often precedes market rebounds. Historical data shows that when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaches these levels, it frequently marks potential turning points in market cycles. However, extreme fear can also create self-fulfilling prophecies. As more investors react to the low Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading, their fearful actions can drive prices even lower. This creates a challenging environment where emotional decisions often override rational analysis. Strategic Moves During Extreme Fear Periods Navigating markets when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicates extreme fear requires careful strategy. Consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into quality projects Setting clear stop-losses to manage risk Diversifying across different cryptocurrency sectors Maintaining cash reserves for potential opportunities Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures current sentiment, not future performance. Many successful investors have used periods of extreme fear to accumulate positions at discounted prices. Historical Patterns of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has proven remarkably accurate at identifying market extremes throughout cryptocurrency history. Previous instances where the index reached similar levels often preceded significant price movements. However, timing these turns remains challenging even with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a guide. Market veterans often watch for divergence between price action and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. When prices make new lows while the index begins improving, it can signal potential trend changes. This makes monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index essential for informed decision-making. FAQs: Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 22 mean? A reading of 22 indicates extreme fear in cryptocurrency markets. This suggests most investors are pessimistic and selling pressure dominates trading activity. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing regular snapshots of market sentiment as conditions evolve throughout trading sessions. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price bottoms? While not a perfect timing tool, extreme fear readings often coincide with market bottoms, making it valuable for identifying potential buying zones. Should I sell when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear? Extreme fear often presents buying opportunities rather than selling signals, though individual circumstances and risk tolerance should guide decisions. How accurate is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index historically? The index has reliably identified emotional extremes in past market cycles, though it works best when combined with other analysis tools. Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index work for altcoins? While heavily weighted toward Bitcoin, the index reflects overall cryptocurrency sentiment that typically affects altcoins as well.

The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) is raising alarms about unregulated crypto firms selling these digital assets. In a bold move, they’ve urged the SEC to step in and protect investors from potential market risks. This clash between innovation and regulation could determine the future of digital finance. Why Are Tokenized Stocks Causing Regulatory Concerns? The WFE recently sent a crucial letter to the SEC expressing deep concerns. They warned that allowing crypto companies to sell tokenized stocks without proper oversight could harm investor interests. This comes after the SEC considered exempting these firms from broker-dealer registration requirements. The federation argues this creates an uneven playing field where traditional exchanges follow strict rules while crypto platforms operate with more freedom. What Risks Do Unregulated Tokenized Stocks Pose? Tokenized stocks represent real company shares but exist as digital tokens on blockchain networks. However, without regulation: Investors might lack proper protection against fraud Market manipulation could become easier Price discrepancies between real and tokenized stocks may occur Legal recourse for investors could be limited The WFE emphasizes that exemptions shouldn’t let companies bypass fundamental regulatory principles that protect markets. How Does Fair Competition Affect Tokenized Stocks? The federation insists that all market participants must compete under the same rules. Traditional stock exchanges undergo rigorous oversight, while crypto platforms might operate with less scrutiny. This imbalance could: Undermine market integrity Create unfair advantages Weaken investor confidence in tokenized stocks Potentially destabilize financial markets Therefore, the WFE advocates for consistent regulation across all platforms offering tokenized stocks. What’s Next for Tokenized Stocks Regulation? The SEC now faces pressure to balance innovation with investor protection. Their decision could set a precedent for how tokenized stocks are treated globally. Market participants are watching closely as this could determine whether digital assets can safely coexist with traditional financial instruments. The outcome will likely influence how quickly tokenized stocks gain mainstream adoption. Conclusion: Striking the Right Balance for Tokenized Stocks The WFE’s intervention highlights the critical need for thoughtful regulation of tokenized stocks. While innovation drives progress, investor protection must remain paramount. As digital assets continue evolving, regulatory frameworks must adapt to ensure markets remain fair, transparent, and secure for all participants. The future of tokenized stocks depends on getting this balance right. Frequently Asked Questions What are tokenized stocks? Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional company shares that exist on blockchain networks, allowing for easier trading and transfer. Why is the WFE concerned about tokenized stocks? The WFE worries that unregulated trading of tokenized stocks could expose investors to unnecessary risks and create unfair market conditions. What does the SEC’s proposed exemption mean? The SEC considered allowing crypto firms to sell tokenized stocks without registering as broker-dealers, which would reduce regulatory oversight. How could unregulated tokenized stocks harm investors? Investors might face higher fraud risks, limited legal protection, and potential market manipulation without proper regulation. What solution does the WFE propose? The WFE wants all platforms, whether traditional or crypto, to follow the same regulatory rules when offering tokenized stocks. Will this affect cryptocurrency regulation broadly? Yes, the SEC’s decision on tokenized stocks could influence how other digital assets are regulated in the future.

This decision, made public on Wednesday, stems from what the agency describes as “persistent gaps in disclosure” and a growing allocation of “high-risk assets” within Tether’s reserves. The assets highlighted include Bitcoin (BTC), gold, corporate bonds, secured loans, and other investments, all of which entail various risks, including credit, market, interest rate, and foreign exchange vulnerabilities. Tether CEO Responds To S&P Downgrade In a recent research note, S&P Global detailed that this upgrade came as part of a new assessment scale implemented in 2023, ranging from 1 to 5. This scale evaluates the risk associated with different stablecoins. Following the assessment, S&P rated Tether’s USDT stablecoin as “5 (weak),” marking it as the lowest possible score and down from its previous rating of “4 (constrained).” S&P expressed concerns regarding the limited insight Tether provides into the creditworthiness of its custodians and counterparties. Related Reading: Has The Bitcoin Price Hit Its Bottom? Key On-Chain Data Signals Potential Rebound Ahead Despite this, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) stating, “We wear your loathing with pride.” He argued that traditional credit rating methods used by agencies like S&P arose from a system that has faltered, leading regulators to challenge these legacy models. Ardoino contended that Tether stands out as a “overcapitalized” organization within the financial sector, claiming it does not harbor “toxic reserves.” He further suggested that S&P’s methods are better suited for conventional banks and insurers with opaque financial histories, rather than being applicable to digital asset issuers who operate under different reserve structures. Ardoino’s remarks indicate a belief that the agency’s downgrade indicates discomfort within traditional finance toward entities like Tether that aim to transcend a “broken financial system.” The firm’s CEO noted: The traditional finance propaganda machine is growing worried when any company tries to defy the force of gravity of the broken financial system. No company should dare to decouple itself from it. Largest Independent Gold Holder In the aftermath of the downgrade, Tether strongly rejected S&P’s characterizations, emphasizing its resilience through various financial crises, including banking collapses, exchange failures, liquidity challenges, and extreme market fluctuations—all while maintaining full stability and the ability to redeem USDT. Tether also pointed to its issuance of approximately $184 billion worth of USDT, assuring stakeholders that it holds sufficient reserves, including US Treasuries and other assets, to satisfy redemptions. Related Reading: Monad (MON) Price Skyrockets 80%, Emerges As Best Performer Among Top 100 Cryptos Notably, recent reports from the Financial Times reveal that Tether has emerged as the largest independent holder of gold globally, highlighting the firm’s increasing exposure to non-traditional reserve assets. According to the report, the stablecoin issuer bought more gold in the last quarter of the year than any central bank in the world. The figures show that the firm bought 26 tons of gold, adding to its substantial gold reserve of nearly 120 tons.

This massive movement, tracked by Onchain Lens, has sent ripples through the crypto community and raised important questions about institutional cryptocurrency strategies. What Does This SpaceX Bitcoin Transfer Mean? The recent SpaceX Bitcoin transaction represents one of the largest institutional crypto movements this month. According to blockchain analysts, the transfer occurred in a single transaction, moving the funds to a completely new address. This type of large-scale movement typically indicates either portfolio rebalancing, security upgrades, or strategic repositioning. SpaceX has been quietly accumulating Bitcoin since 2021, when Elon Musk first revealed the company’s cryptocurrency holdings. However, this particular SpaceX Bitcoin transfer stands out due to its timing and scale. Market observers are closely watching whether this signals a broader trend in corporate cryptocurrency management. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Moves So Important? When major companies like SpaceX make significant Bitcoin transactions, the entire market pays attention. Here’s why these moves matter: Market confidence indicators – Large transfers can signal institutional sentiment Price impact potential – Movements of this size can affect liquidity Adoption trends – Shows how corporations are integrating crypto into treasury management Regulatory implications – Demonstrates compliance with financial regulations The SpaceX Bitcoin transaction comes at a crucial time when institutional adoption is accelerating. Many corporations are following Tesla’s lead in adding cryptocurrency to their balance sheets, making movements like this SpaceX Bitcoin transfer particularly significant for market analysts. How Do We Know It’s Really SpaceX? Blockchain analytics firms like Onchain Lens use sophisticated tracking methods to identify wallet ownership. While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, several factors help identify the SpaceX Bitcoin address: Previous transaction patterns matching known corporate movements Connection to other verified institutional wallets Timing correlations with public company announcements Amount consistency with reported corporate holdings However, it’s important to note that absolute certainty in wallet attribution remains challenging. The identification of this as a SpaceX Bitcoin address relies on probabilistic analysis rather than definitive proof. What Could This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? This substantial SpaceX Bitcoin movement highlights several key trends in cryptocurrency adoption. First, it demonstrates that major corporations continue to actively manage their crypto assets rather than simply holding them statically. Second, the transaction size shows confidence in Bitcoin’s liquidity and market depth. Moreover, the SpaceX Bitcoin transfer occurs against a backdrop of increasing institutional interest. As more companies follow similar strategies, we can expect to see: More sophisticated corporate crypto management tools Increased regulatory clarity around institutional holdings Greater market stability from diversified ownership Enhanced security protocols for large-scale transfers Key Takeaways from the $105 Million Move The SpaceX Bitcoin transaction reminds us that institutional players are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their cryptocurrency strategies. This isn’t just about holding digital assets—it’s about active portfolio management and strategic positioning. For individual investors, movements like this SpaceX Bitcoin transfer serve as valuable learning opportunities. They demonstrate how large institutions approach risk management, security, and strategic allocation in the volatile crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions How was the SpaceX Bitcoin address identified? Blockchain analytics firms use pattern recognition, transaction history analysis, and correlation with public information to identify likely corporate wallets, though absolute certainty is difficult. Why would SpaceX move such a large amount of Bitcoin? Possible reasons include security upgrades, wallet management, portfolio rebalancing, or preparing for specific corporate actions. Does this affect Bitcoin’s price? While single transactions rarely directly impact price, large movements can signal institutional sentiment that influences market psychology. How common are corporate Bitcoin transfers? As more companies hold cryptocurrency, institutional transfers are becoming increasingly common as part of normal treasury management. Is my Bitcoin safe if large holders move funds? Yes, individual holdings are separate from corporate wallets. The Bitcoin network is designed to handle transactions of all sizes securely. What should I watch for after this SpaceX Bitcoin move? Monitor for follow-up transactions, official company statements, and whether similar movements occur with other corporate holders.

The latest data reveals the Altcoin Season Index remains firmly at 25, indicating Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency landscape. This crucial metric gives traders valuable insights into market cycles and investment opportunities. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital thermometer for cryptocurrency markets. Created by CoinMarketCap, this innovative tool measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period. When the index approaches 100, we enter altcoin season – that exciting period when alternative cryptocurrencies surge against Bitcoin. Currently sitting at 25, the index clearly signals we’re in Bitcoin season. This means most altcoins are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. Understanding this metric helps investors make informed decisions about portfolio allocation and timing. Why Does the Altcoin Season Index Matter for Your Portfolio? The Altcoin Season Index provides more than just market trivia – it offers actionable intelligence for crypto investors. Here’s why this metric deserves your attention: Market cycle identification – Helps recognize transitions between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance Risk assessment – Indicates when altcoin investments carry higher potential returns Timing strategy – Assists in determining optimal entry points for different cryptocurrency categories Portfolio rebalancing – Guides decisions about when to shift between Bitcoin and altcoins Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index regularly can significantly improve your investment timing and risk management. What Current Market Conditions Tell Us The persistent low reading on the Altcoin Season Index reflects several market realities. Bitcoin continues to attract institutional investment and mainstream attention, while many altcoins face regulatory uncertainty and reduced retail interest. However, experienced traders know that market conditions can change rapidly. Historical patterns show that extended Bitcoin dominance often precedes strong altcoin rallies. When the Altcoin Season Index eventually climbs, it typically signals increased risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller cryptocurrencies. Therefore, watching this index closely could help you catch the next major trend shift. How to Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy Successful cryptocurrency investing requires both patience and preparation. While the current Altcoin Season Index reading favors Bitcoin, smart investors use this time to research promising altcoin projects. Consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into selected altcoins during Bitcoin dominance periods Setting price alerts for when the Altcoin Season Index crosses key thresholds Diversifying across different cryptocurrency sectors and use cases Monitoring fundamental developments in altcoin projects you believe in Remember that the Altcoin Season Index is just one tool in your analytical toolkit, but it provides valuable context for broader market movements. When Might We See the Next Altcoin Season? Predicting exact timing for market shifts remains challenging, but several factors could trigger the next altcoin season. Increased regulatory clarity, breakthrough technological developments, or renewed retail interest could all contribute to a rising Altcoin Season Index. Many analysts watch for Bitcoin dominance to peak before expecting significant altcoin rotations. The current Altcoin Season Index at 25 suggests we might need to wait for broader market catalysts. However, cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile and can change direction quickly. Staying informed about this metric helps position you to capitalize on opportunities when they emerge. Final Thoughts on Navigating Crypto Seasons The Altcoin Season Index provides crucial insights for navigating cryptocurrency market cycles. While Bitcoin currently dominates, understanding these patterns helps prepare for future opportunities. Successful investors combine metric analysis with fundamental research and risk management. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to cryptocurrency, monitoring the Altcoin Season Index can enhance your market awareness and timing decisions. The current reading reminds us that patience often rewards investors who understand market cycles and maintain disciplined strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The Altcoin Season Index tracks whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. What reading indicates altcoin season? When the index approaches 100, it signals altcoin season. Readings closer to zero indicate Bitcoin dominance in the market. How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index updates daily, providing current insights into market performance and cryptocurrency rotations. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict exact price movements? While it indicates market trends, the index cannot predict exact prices. It serves best as one of several analytical tools for market assessment. Should I only invest during altcoin season? Different investment strategies work during various market phases. Many successful investors build positions during Bitcoin dominance periods in anticipation of future altcoin seasons. Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? You can find the Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap’s website along with other valuable cryptocurrency metrics and data. Found this analysis helpful?

A new crypto that is priced below $0.04, is surging towards a complete allocation and investors are responding rapidly. As the demand is growing every hour, they believe that it may be one of the last opportunities to enter before the next big crypto price step. The Presale of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving towards a full Phase 6 sellout. The current price of the token is $0.035 and the final allotment is diminishing rapidly. The sale began early 2025 at $0.01, and since then MUTM has been increasing by 250%. The initial offer price will be pegged at $0.06, and this will provide the initial participants with a clear direction of potential upside. The presale has already secured a good momentum. The project has raised approximately $19 million. The holder numbers are constantly on the rise and they have already surpassed 18,200 participants. The number of sold tokens is 805 million. Phase 6 currently stands over the 95% mark and hence, it comes as a last chance to numerous investors to grab it before Phase 7 forces the price to go up. The high growth rate exhibits the extent of the intense demand in the new cryptocurrency. A variety of users seek the most appropriate crypto to purchase at the moment, which is below $0.04 and MUTM is one of the most favorable options. What Mutuum Finance Is Developing Mutuum Finance is developing a two-sided lending environment that is made to be useful and not hyped. It aims to provide a clean and predictable means by which users can lend, get yield and liquidity by utilizing automated smart contracts. Users are given mtTokens when they ever deposit assets. The value of these tokens increases due to the re- entry of interest into the pool. The increasing price of the mt Token allows users to have a stable APY without taking advantage of overvalued token issues. This is among the things that make MUTM stand out in the DeFi crypto industry. A buy and distribute model is also used in Mutuum Finance. Availing revenue in the lending platform is utilized to purchase MUTM in the open market. The acquired tokens are then delivered to the users that stake the mtTokens on the safety module. This generates continuous buying pressure and assists in rewarding long term owners. Security is a major focus. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK audit with a score of 90 out of 100 on the Token Scan. The team also introduced a bug bounty worth $50,000 to find and fix the possible code risks before the protocol is launched. Secured Coin and Oracle Plans In later phases of the roadmap, Mutuum Finance will roll out its own USD pegged stablecoin. This stablecoin will go through minting and burning overcollateralized positions within the platform. The team will utilize Chainlink oracles with fallback feeds in order to be accurate of price. Sound oracles are important in sound liquidation and secure borrowing. Such characteristics should ensure that the protocol is more resilient in the current volatile crypto prices. According to some analysts, such upgrades will enable MUTM to go way beyond what it was selling earlier. Early estimates suggest that there could be a 4x to 6x growth of the current positions following listings. According to other models, in a better case, MUTM might hope to increase by 700% by the time the stablecoin and oracle system becomes online. V1 Launch Timing The official X account of Mutuum Finance stated that V1 would appear in Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial iteration will consist of a liquidity pool, mtTokens, a debt token and a liquidation bot, and the initial assets will be ETH and USDT. It is already coded and is currently being vetted by Halborn Security. Frequent updates should follow up to the time the launch window is assured. The sale out of this fast in phase 6 has been considered a very good sign. The positions by early holders are also expanding, some of which are whale buyers prior to the increase step. This is regarded by many as one of the best crypto opportunities under $0.04 owing to the fact that allocation is nearly depleted. Also, the 24 hour leader board makes it more active. Every single day, the highest contributor would be awarded with $500 worth of MUTM which further propels more interaction and maintains high demand.

54959483,634685,1764205201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54959483.jpeg,Short-Term Holders Log Biggest Realised Losses in Bitcoin History – Over $900M per Day,https://bitcoinist.com/short-term-holders-biggest-losses-bitcoin-history/,"Bitcoin is struggling to find support as selling pressure accelerates and uncertainty spreads across the crypto market. After hitting its all-time high near $126,000 in early October, BTC has now lost more than 35% of its value, shaking investor confidence and fueling growing calls that the current bull cycle has ended. Market sentiment has shifted rapidly, with traders, analysts, and long-term participants reassessing expectations as price volatility intensifies and liquidity thins across major exchanges. What makes the current phase even more concerning is the behavior of short-term holders, who historically act as the most reactive segment of the market. According to key data shared by On-Chain Mind, short-term holders are now locking in the biggest realized losses in Bitcoin’s entire history. This level of loss realization surpasses the capitulation seen during the China mining ban, the FTX collapse, and even the COVID crash, marking an extreme phase of market distress. This unprecedented level of capitulation suggests that panic has taken control, with newer entrants exiting positions at steep losses. While some analysts argue that such events have historically preceded major reversals, others believe it signals the beginning of a prolonged downtrend. The coming days may determine which narrative takes hold. Short-Term Holders Face Record Losses as Market Capitulates On-Chain Mind reports that short-term holders are locking in more than $900 million in losses per day. This extreme level of loss realization reflects a phase of true capitulation. Short-term holders are historically the most sensitive to sharp price swings, and when they begin exiting at such magnitude, it often signals a breaking point in market sentiment. The data suggests that panic selling has reached levels never seen before, even when compared to major historical shock events. During the COVID crash, the China mining ban, and the FTX implosion, realized losses spiked sharply, yet none of those events reached the current scale. This places the present correction in a category of its own and raises questions about the structural stability of the market over the coming weeks. Some analysts argue that this marks the definitive beginning of a bear cycle, where confidence erodes and capital rotates out of risk assets. However, there remains a smaller group of optimistic voices who note that extreme capitulation has often preceded powerful recoveries. If Bitcoin stabilizes and buyers return, this could form a major macro bottom. The next move will likely define the market’s trajectory. BTC Tests Weekly Support After Sharp Reversal Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a steep reversal from the all-time high near $126,000, with price now trading around $86,900 after a rapid decline. The drawdown has positioned BTC back toward the key 100-week moving average, which is currently sitting just above $83,000 and acting as an important structural support level. Historically, this moving average has defined the boundary between bull-phase retracements and full macro trend breakdowns. A clean weekly close below it would strengthen the bear-market narrative that many analysts are now beginning to promote. Despite the severity of the decline, price is beginning to stabilize, forming a small reaction wick suggesting early attempts at demand absorption around the $80,000–$85,000 zone. This region coincides with prior consolidation from early in the cycle, making it a logical area for buyers to defend. However, momentum indicators remain pointed downward, and the distance from the 50-week moving average highlights the loss of trend strength. For the bullish case to re-emerge, Bitcoin would need to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 band, where broken support now acts as resistance. Until then, uncertainty remains elevated, and the weekly structure leans cautiously bearish.

The Pump.fun team just deposited $75 million to Kraken, adding fuel to growing cash-out concerns. This latest move brings their total withdrawals to a staggering $480 million, creating waves across the cryptocurrency community. What’s driving the Pump.fun cash-out speculation? According to blockchain analytics firm AmberCN, a wallet linked to the Pump.fun team transferred 75 million USDC to Kraken just eight hours ago. This follows a massive $400 million deposit on November 24th. The pattern suggests systematic withdrawal activity, though the team maintains these transfers aren’t cash-outs. However, the evidence tells a different story. Shortly after arriving at Kraken, 69.26 million USDC from today’s transfer moved directly to Circle. This movement to the stablecoin issuer typically indicates conversion to traditional currency, strengthening the cash-out theory. Why should investors care about this Pump.fun cash-out pattern? Large-scale withdrawals by project teams often signal important market shifts. When founders move significant amounts to exchanges, it can indicate: Profit-taking after substantial token appreciation Liquidity needs for operational expenses Portfolio rebalancing across different assets Market timing decisions based on price outlook The cumulative $480 million Pump.fun cash-out activity represents one of the largest DeFi team withdrawals this year. This scale naturally raises questions about the project’s treasury management and future plans. How does this affect the broader cryptocurrency market? Major movements like this Pump.fun cash-out activity create ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. Other DeFi projects may face increased scrutiny from investors watching for similar patterns. Exchange liquidity can also be impacted when large amounts enter the market simultaneously. Moreover, the timing of these transactions matters. The crypto market remains sensitive to large sell pressure, especially when it comes from prominent project teams. The continued denial from Pump.fun while evidence mounts creates uncertainty that can affect investor confidence. What’s next for Pump.fun amid cash-out concerns? The team’s previous clarification that deposits were unrelated to cashing out now faces serious challenges. The movement to Circle specifically contradicts their earlier statements. Investors will be watching closely for: Official statements addressing the latest transactions Treasury reports showing remaining project funds Development updates confirming ongoing commitment Market response to PUMP token price This situation highlights the importance of transparency in DeFi projects. When teams make large financial moves, clear communication helps maintain trust with their community. Key takeaways from the Pump.fun cash-out situation The pattern of large exchange deposits combined with transfers to Circle strongly suggests this is indeed a Pump.fun cash-out operation. The $480 million total represents significant selling pressure that could impact the token’s price stability. Investors should monitor these developments closely and consider what they might mean for their own positions in similar projects. While teams have every right to realize gains from their work, the manner and communication around these activities matter greatly for market confidence. The ongoing Pump.fun cash-out speculation serves as a reminder that in cryptocurrency, actions often speak louder than words. Frequently Asked Questions How much has Pump.fun withdrawn total? The total estimated amount cashed out now reaches approximately $480 million, including the latest $75 million deposit and previous $400 million transaction. Why are people calling this a cash-out? The movement of funds to Kraken followed by transfer to Circle typically indicates conversion to traditional currency, which is why analysts classify this as cash-out activity. What has Pump.fun said about these transactions? The team previously stated that deposits were unrelated to cashing out, but the evidence from recent transactions contradicts this explanation. How does this affect PUMP token holders? Large sell pressure from team members can impact token price and market confidence, making this important news for all PUMP holders. Should investors be worried about this activity? While concerning, investors should monitor official communications and project development updates to assess the long-term implications. What signs should investors watch for next? Key indicators include further large transactions, official team statements, treasury transparency, and development progress updates.

Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why With Federal Reserve rate-cut odds now above 80%, traders are positioning for a potential shift in risk appetite that could benefit major cryptocurrencies, especially ETH. ETH's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Fed Pivot Hopes and Institutional Demand Bolster Ethereum Ethereum has traded between $2,700 and $3,300 in recent weeks, but fresh catalysts are helping the asset stabilize above $2,900. The biggest driver is macroeconomic. CME FedWatch data shows the probability of a December interest-rate cut has surged from 30% to more than 80%. Lower interest rates typically encourage investment in risk-on assets such as crypto. Institutional flows reflect that shift. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $96.67 million in inflows on November 24, with BlackRock alone contributing $92.6 million, its first inflow in two weeks Treasury giant BitMine continues to accumulate aggressively, adding 69,822 ETH (over $200 million) last week and bringing its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, around 3% of the circulating supply. At the same time, whale wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH amassed 440,000 ETH in one week, signaling renewed confidence despite broader market caution. Ethereum (ETH) Poised for a Breakout Toward $3,400 Despite trading under the 20-day SMA at $3,132, Ethereum is showing early signs of bullish momentum. The MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory, and the RSI is sitting near the neutral 50 line, with room to move higher before hitting overbought levels. Other indicators strengthen the bullish case: Bollinger Bands: ETH’s position near 0.32 suggests price is closer to the lower band, a common rebound zone. Volume: Binance 24-hour trading volume around $1.27 billion indicates enough liquidity to support a breakout. ATR: With daily ATR at $201.62, volatility remains elevated, favoring sharp upside moves if momentum builds. The first major test remains $3,132. A clean breakout and two consecutive daily closes above this level would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push ETH toward the $3,400 target within 5–7 days. Beyond that, resistance at $3,658 becomes the next upside objective. Market Risks and Short-Term Outlook While bullish momentum is building, Ethereum still trades in a broad descending channel, and market structure remains fragile. Failure to reclaim $3,132 soon could send ETH back toward $2,750, with deeper support at $2,623 and the cycle low of $2,659. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November Broader crypto weakness, negative spot flows, or delays in network upgrades could delay a breakout. However, with rising institutional demand, whale accumulation, and rate-cut optimism, Ethereum’s probability of retesting $3,400 is steadily improving. Confidence Level medium is at Medium (65%), as ETH’s path to $3,400 remains viable but requires confirmation through key resistance levels.

The central bank’s decision to maintain the Bank of Korea benchmark rate at 2.50% marks the fourth consecutive hold, creating significant implications for digital asset investors worldwide. Why Does the Bank of Korea Benchmark Rate Matter for Crypto? The Bank of Korea benchmark rate serves as a crucial indicator for global financial markets. When central banks maintain stable rates, it typically signals economic caution that can influence cryptocurrency prices. Moreover, this stability often drives investors toward alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum seeking better returns. Here’s what the current rate environment means for crypto investors: Reduced traditional banking returns push capital toward cryptocurrencies Stable rates decrease market volatility fears Long-term investment strategies become more attractive Institutional crypto adoption may accelerate How Will This Bank of Korea Decision Impact Your Portfolio? The consistent Bank of Korea benchmark rate policy creates a predictable environment for cryptocurrency trading. However, understanding the broader implications requires looking at several key factors that affect your investment decisions. First, consider the global context. Other major central banks are also pausing rate hikes, creating a synchronized environment that benefits risk assets like cryptocurrencies. This coordinated approach reduces currency fluctuation risks and provides clearer signals for international investors. What Should Crypto Investors Watch Next? While the current Bank of Korea benchmark rate remains stable, smart investors should monitor several upcoming indicators. The bank’s future guidance, inflation data, and global economic trends will all influence when policy might change. Key monitoring points include: Upcoming economic growth projections Inflation trend analysis Employment data releases Global central bank coordination Actionable Crypto Strategies in This Rate Environment The maintained Bank of Korea benchmark rate presents unique opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. With traditional returns remaining limited, digital assets offer compelling alternatives for portfolio diversification and growth. Consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into established cryptocurrencies Exploring DeFi opportunities for enhanced yields Monitoring regulatory developments closely Balancing portfolio risk across different asset classes Frequently Asked Questions How does the Bank of Korea benchmark rate affect Bitcoin prices? When the Bank of Korea maintains stable rates, it often reduces traditional investment returns, making Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. Will this rate decision impact cryptocurrency regulations? While not directly linked, stable monetary policy often provides regulatory clarity that can benefit cryptocurrency markets and encourage institutional adoption. Should I adjust my crypto investment strategy based on this news? The rate hold suggests continued economic stability, which typically supports risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, always consider your personal risk tolerance and investment goals. How often does the Bank of Korea review its benchmark rate? The Bank of Korea typically reviews its benchmark rate eight times per year, with decisions announced after monetary policy board meetings. What other factors should crypto investors watch alongside interest rates? Monitor inflation data, employment figures, global economic trends, and specific cryptocurrency regulatory developments for comprehensive market understanding. Could this rate decision affect cryptocurrency mining profitability? Indirectly yes, as stable interest rates influence energy costs and equipment financing, which are crucial factors in mining operations. Found this analysis helpful?

According to groundbreaking analysis from Hashed CEO Simon Seojoon Kim, that’s exactly what’s happening with Ethereum right now. The blockchain investment expert reveals that Ethereum is significantly Ethereum undervalued , presenting what could be one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the crypto space today. Why Is Ethereum Undervalued According to Experts? Simon Seojoon Kim, CEO of South Korean blockchain investment firm Hashed, has dropped a bombshell revelation. His firm’s comprehensive analysis shows Ethereum’s fair value sits at $4,747, meaning the current market price represents a staggering 57% discount. This isn’t just speculation – it’s based on sophisticated financial modeling that traditional investors would recognize immediately. The Hashed team developed a unique dashboard that integrates eight different valuation models. This multi-faceted approach ensures the analysis isn’t relying on just one methodology. Instead, it combines multiple perspectives to create a robust fair value assessment that accounts for Ethereum’s diverse utility and revenue streams. What Makes This Ethereum Undervalued Analysis Different? Traditional crypto analysis often focuses on simple metrics, but Hashed’s approach is remarkably comprehensive. Their eight-model dashboard includes: Discounted Cash Flow analysis based on staking yields 25x Price-to-Earnings ratio assessment Total Value Locked multiples evaluation Staking scarcity valuation models Layer 2 ecosystem growth metrics This integrated approach means the conclusion that Ethereum is Ethereum undervalued comes from multiple angles of verification. Each model tells part of the story, and together they paint a compelling picture of significant upside potential. How Do These Models Prove Ethereum’s True Value? The Discounted Cash Flow analysis alone provides fascinating insights. By treating staking yields as Ethereum’s “cash flow,” the model applies traditional financial valuation techniques to the crypto world. Meanwhile, the Price-to-Earnings ratio comparison shows how Ethereum stacks up against traditional tech companies. Perhaps most importantly, the Layer 2 ecosystem valuation captures Ethereum’s network effects. As more applications build on Ethereum and its scaling solutions, the fundamental value of the network increases exponentially. This creates a powerful growth engine that the current market price doesn’t fully reflect, making Ethereum clearly Ethereum undervalued according to these metrics. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For investors watching the crypto markets, this analysis provides concrete numbers to support what many have suspected. The gap between current prices and fair value represents significant potential upside. However, it’s crucial to remember that market sentiment and short-term volatility can keep assets Ethereum undervalued for extended periods. The key takeaway is that fundamental analysis supports a much higher valuation for Ethereum. As the crypto market matures and more institutional investors apply traditional valuation methods, we may see prices move closer to these calculated fair values. Could This Ethereum Undervalued Situation Change Soon? Market conditions evolve rapidly, and several factors could accelerate Ethereum’s price discovery. Increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological upgrades could all contribute to closing the valuation gap. The current situation where Ethereum remains Ethereum undervalued might not last forever as these fundamental strengths become more widely recognized. Moreover, the growing ecosystem of decentralized applications and the continued expansion of Layer 2 solutions create natural demand drivers. As more value flows through the Ethereum network, the economic case for higher valuation strengthens. Final Verdict: Time to Pay Attention to Ethereum’s True Worth The comprehensive analysis from Hashed provides a data-driven case for Ethereum’s substantial upside potential. While markets can remain irrational longer than investors can remain solvent, the fundamental metrics suggest we’re looking at a significant opportunity. The evidence strongly indicates that Ethereum is profoundly Ethereum undervalued at current levels. As with any investment, due diligence and risk management remain essential. However, for those who believe in Ethereum’s long-term vision and technological capabilities, the current valuation disconnect might represent a rare window of opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly does ‘Ethereum undervalued’ mean? It means that according to Hashed’s analysis, Ethereum’s current market price is 57% below its calculated fair value of $4,747 based on eight different financial models. How reliable is this Ethereum undervalued analysis? The analysis uses multiple validated financial models including DCF, P/E ratios, and ecosystem metrics, making it more robust than single-method approaches. What time frame does this Ethereum undervalued assessment consider? While not explicitly stated, valuation models typically consider long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements. Could Ethereum remain undervalued for long? Yes, markets can stay irrational for extended periods, but fundamental analysis suggests the gap should close over time. What are the main drivers making Ethereum undervalued? Staking yields, Layer 2 growth, network adoption, and Total Value Locked all contribute to the fair value calculation. How does this affect my investment strategy? This analysis provides fundamental support for long-term Ethereum investment, but always combine with your own research and risk tolerance.

Federal Decree Law No. 6 of 2025, signed in September and made public this week, allows the UAE Central Bank (CBUAE) to license all crypto and blockchain entities operating in or from the country, regardless of the technology they use. Unlicensed operations could be fined up to 1 billion dirhams, equivalent to approximately $272 million. New licensing rules redefine compliance for Web3 and blockchain players Replacing the existing central bank framework of the UAE, the law expands its oversight beyond just direct issuance to cover virtual assets, DeFi protocols, stablecoins, tokenized real-world assets, decentralized exchanges, wallets, bridges, and blockchain infrastructure. Marina D’Angelo, head of Europe at DLT Law, an international regulatory and legal blockchain advisory firm, suggested that it is still too soon to speculate on how the new law will benefit the Gulf nation’s position as a global crypto hub. “With the new federal law now in force the UAE has effectively redrawn the regulatory perimeter around digital assets,” D’Angelo told Coindesk. “How this ultimately plays out concerning DeFi remains to be seen.” Such regulations of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 in the UAE are revolutionized by the new UAE central bank law. Federal Decree Law No. 6 of 2025 requires all entities involved in providing financial services via digital assets (e.g., traditional banks, crypto exchanges, or blockchain protocols) to obtain a license. This comprises decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing platforms, wallets, tokenized RWA platforms, stablecoins, bridges and other blockchain infrastructure. And law experts recently underscored that the “code is not a shield” principle now applies: just a protocol running open-source software or in some decentralized manner is not exempt from licensing requirements. Even middleware and infrastructure suppliers that allow payments, custody, or tokenization might come under the jurisdiction of the UAE Central Bank. There is also a one-year window for existing players to be compliant, until September 2026, with new license applications stretching over a certain period, of 60 days. Nonetheless, unlicensed activities are subject to heavy penalties and administrative fines, while others may be subject to criminal sanction. mBridge launch signals UAE’s leap into cross-border digital payments The United Arab Emirates’ new central bank law, enacted recently, follows the UAE’s official launch of the mBridge cross-border CBDC platform, which included a payment to China. The event was attended by the UAE’s Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister, His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who oversaw the transaction. HH Sheikh Mansour also chairs the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), with both the Governors of the CBUAE and the People’s Bank of China in attendance in person. mBridge enables direct cross-border payments between banks, bypassing the need for correspondent banking and facilitating near-instant international transfers. In June last year, mBridge entered the minimum viable product (MVP) phase , with this announcement signalling it is now live. The “Jisr” platform, also known as MBridge, for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), was developed by the BIS in collaboration with a group of UAE and Chinese banks. It aims to facilitate cross-border payments, significantly reduce transaction costs, and provide instant payment settlement. According to the announcement , the platform is expected to undergo further expansion in 2026, with the addition of more central banks.

The tech giant’s CEO just dropped a major update that will surprise many investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. In a recent statement, Naver CEO Choi Soo-yeon clarified the company’s position on this highly anticipated Nasdaq listing move. What’s the Current Status of Naver’s Nasdaq Listing? According to TechM reports, Naver CEO Choi Soo-yeon made it clear that no decisions have been finalized regarding a potential Nasdaq listing for either Naver Financial or Dunamu. This announcement comes amid growing speculation about the company’s international expansion plans. The CEO emphasized that the company understands the significance of such a move and is proceeding cautiously. Choi acknowledged the public controversy surrounding dual listings and stressed the importance of national consensus on this matter. The company recognizes that a Nasdaq listing represents a major strategic decision that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Why is the Nasdaq Listing Generating So Much Attention? The potential Nasdaq listing has captured investor interest for several key reasons: Global market access – A Nasdaq listing would provide international exposure Increased liquidity – Access to deeper capital markets Enhanced credibility – Meeting stringent U.S. listing requirements Competitive positioning – Joining other tech giants on the exchange However, the CEO noted that while Naver Financial operates as a Naver subsidiary, it has already merged with a larger company. This existing corporate structure adds complexity to any potential Nasdaq listing decision. What About the Merger Possibilities? In her statement, CEO Choi provided crucial insights about potential mergers. She specifically mentioned that the likelihood of a merger between a combined Naver Financial-Dunamu entity and Naver appears low. This clarification helps investors understand the company’s strategic direction and eliminates some speculation about corporate restructuring. The company’s approach reflects a thoughtful consideration of both domestic and international market conditions. A Nasdaq listing decision would need to align with the company’s long-term vision and stakeholder interests. How Will This Nasdaq Listing Decision Impact Investors? For current and potential investors, this update provides important clarity. The uncertainty around the Nasdaq listing timeline means investors should focus on the company’s fundamental performance rather than speculative listing gains. The CEO’s transparent communication helps set realistic expectations about the company’s international expansion plans. Moreover, the emphasis on national consensus suggests that regulatory and public sentiment factors will play significant roles in any future Nasdaq listing decision. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the company’s commitment to responsible corporate governance. What’s Next for Naver’s International Strategy? While the Nasdaq listing remains undecided, the company continues to evaluate all strategic options. The CEO’s comments indicate that any future Nasdaq listing would be part of a broader international strategy rather than an isolated move. Investors should watch for further announcements about the company’s global expansion plans and how they might incorporate potential Nasdaq listing opportunities. The company’s cautious approach to the Nasdaq listing decision reflects its understanding of the significant implications for shareholders, employees, and the broader tech ecosystem. This measured strategy may ultimately serve the company better than rushing into a premature Nasdaq listing. Final Thoughts on the Nasdaq Listing Uncertainty The clarity provided by Naver’s CEO brings valuable transparency to the market. While the lack of a definitive Nasdaq listing decision may disappoint some investors, the honest assessment of the situation helps everyone make more informed decisions. The company’s commitment to seeking national consensus before proceeding with any Nasdaq listing demonstrates responsible leadership. As the situation evolves, the potential Nasdaq listing will remain a key topic of discussion. However, investors now have a clearer understanding of the current status and the factors influencing this important decision. Frequently Asked Questions Has Naver completely ruled out a Nasdaq listing? No, the CEO stated that no decision has been made yet, meaning all options remain open for future consideration. What is the main reason for delaying the Nasdaq listing decision? The company recognizes the need for national consensus on dual listings and wants to ensure any decision aligns with broader stakeholder interests. How does Dunamu factor into the potential Nasdaq listing? Dunamu is part of the consideration for any potential Nasdaq listing, but no separate or combined listing decisions have been finalized. What would a Nasdaq listing mean for Naver Financial? A Nasdaq listing would provide international exposure and access to deeper capital markets, but the company is weighing all implications carefully. When can we expect a final decision on the Nasdaq listing? The company hasn’t provided a timeline, as they’re focused on achieving necessary consensus before making any definitive moves. How are investors reacting to this news? While some may be disappointed by the uncertainty, others appreciate the transparency and careful approach to such a significant decision.

The sharp downturn from the recent cycle high has left bullish traders on the defensive, with confidence weakening across spot and derivatives markets. Analysts who just weeks ago projected continuation toward new all-time highs are now shifting their tone, with many calling for the beginning of a bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze Flushes Out Late Longers as Funding Turns Negative: Classic Capitulation Signal The broader market environment has amplified these concerns. Momentum has flipped downward, liquidity has thinned, and buyers have been unable to reclaim key resistance levels that would signal strength. As Bitcoin searches for support, investors are now watching reactions around the high-$80K region to determine whether this decline is part of a deeper structural reversal or a temporary correction within the larger trend. According to top analyst Axel Adler, Long-Term Holders have played a pivotal role in the current downturn. He reports that this cohort conducted the largest profit-taking event of the entire cycle, reducing positions by 1.57 million BTC over the quarter as prices fell toward $80,000. This scale of distribution historically aligns with exhaustion phases and late-cycle tops, intensifying speculation that Bitcoin may be entering a more prolonged period of weakness. Long-Term Holder Distribution Signals Major Cycle Shift Axel Adler highlights that Long-Term Holders (LTH) are conducting massive profit-taking, pushing supply levels back to early 2023 lows. According to his data, the 30-day Net Position Change now reflects one of the deepest sell-offs seen in the entire bull cycle. LTH supply has fallen sharply from the peak of 15.75 million BTC to the current 13.6 million BTC—marking the lowest reading since the beginning of the cycle. Adler notes that this pattern aligns with a classic smart-money distribution phase often observed near major market tops. Over just the past two weeks (November 11–25), LTH sold 803,399 BTC, representing a drop of 5.54% and averaging 53,560 BTC per day. Historically, such compression in supply has only occurred during major inflection periods. Adler compares the current reading to previous extremes—March 2024, following the $73,000 all-time high sell-off, and October 2024, when Bitcoin corrected from the ATH toward $85,000. The present phase demonstrates aggressive coin dumping, with deeply negative red bars on the Net Position Change while price simultaneously declined from the October peak. This combination of rapid supply reduction and falling price suggests that LTH distribution is exerting meaningful pressure on the market. The data implies that the cycle may be transitioning toward a structurally weaker phase unless new demand re-enters to absorb the sell-side volume.

The current trading level around $86,800 reflects an attempted relief bounce, yet the broader trend remains clearly bearish. Price is positioned below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, all of which are now sloping downward—a structure that typically signals sustained downside momentum. The rejection from the mid-November breakdown zone reinforces the idea that former support has flipped into resistance. Related Reading: 63K Bitcoin Exits Long-Term Wallets: A Surge of Speculative Short-Term Buying Volume spikes during the selloff indicate forced liquidation and capitulation-driven selling rather than orderly distribution, while the recent bounce has occurred on noticeably lighter volume, suggesting weak conviction from buyers.

Losing this level could expose further downside toward $78K and potentially $72K.

Here’s how Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum compare. Bitcoin, XRP, And Ethereum Are Currently Far Below Solana In Loss Supply In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how some of the top assets in the cryptocurrency sector compare in terms of the Percent Supply in Loss . This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the percentage of a given asset’s circulating supply that’s currently being held at a loss. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If the last transfer price was more than the current spot price for any token, then that particular token is considered to be in a state of net unrealized loss. The Percent Supply in Loss adds up all coins of this type and determines what part of the supply they make up. Like this indicator, there also exists the Percent Supply in Profit , which tracks the supply of the opposite type. Since the total supply should add up to 100%, only one of these metrics needs to be known; the other can simply be found by subtracting it from 100. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows how the Percent Supply in Profit has changed for Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, and Solana over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Percent Supply in Profit has plummeted for all of these cryptocurrencies recently. In other words, the Percent Supply in Loss has shot up. This shift in investor profitability has come as a result of the bearish momentum that the various assets have faced. It’s visible in the chart, however, that the change hasn’t been proportionate for all of the coins. While XRP, Ethereum, and Bitcoin have shown similar trajectories, Solana has broken away with a much steeper decline in the indicator. Today, the Percent Supply in Profit is sitting at a value of 25.16%. This means that almost 75% of the cryptocurrency’s supply is underwater now. In contrast, the Percent Supply in Loss remains at 34.91%, 38.37%, and 36.70% for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, respectively. Thus, despite the market downturn, a majority of the supply is still in the green for the three largest coins in the sector (excluding stablecoins ). Typically, a high value on the Percent Supply in Loss corresponds to market conditions where not many profit-sellers are left anymore. Considering this, Solana having most of its supply underwater could, in theory, imply that it’s closer to seller exhaustion than Bitcoin and company.

A new bill targeting VASP shareholders with criminal records is making its way through the National Assembly, and the implications for crypto businesses are massive. This legislation represents one of the most significant regulatory moves in the Asian crypto market this year. What Does the VASP Shareholders Bill Actually Propose? The proposed legislation gives financial authorities unprecedented power to reject Virtual Asset Service Provider registrations. The key change focuses on VASP shareholders who have domestic or international criminal records. Under the new rules, major stakeholders in cryptocurrency companies must pass rigorous background checks before operations can proceed. Major shareholders include not just the largest stakeholders but all key investors with significant influence. The bill requires complete transparency about these VASP shareholders during the application process. This represents a major shift from current regulations that only examine the company itself. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About VASP Shareholders Screening? The implications extend far beyond new applicants. Existing VASP operators face re-evaluation based on their major shareholders’ backgrounds. This means established companies might suddenly find their licenses at risk if their investors don’t meet the new standards. Here’s what makes this legislation particularly impactful: Existing operators must undergo re-screening Future applications face stricter scrutiny Criminal records from any country can disqualify VASP shareholders The definition of ‘major shareholders’ includes all key stakeholders When Will These VASP Shareholders Changes Take Effect? The bill is scheduled for review at a plenary session of the South Korean National Assembly’s National Policy Committee on November 27. If passed, the implementation could happen rapidly, giving VASP shareholders little time to prepare for the new requirements. This timing is crucial because it coincides with South Korea’s broader efforts to clean up its cryptocurrency industry. The government appears determined to create a safer environment for investors while maintaining the country’s position as a crypto hub. How Will This Impact South Korea’s Crypto Ecosystem? The legislation could lead to significant consolidation in the market. Smaller VASPs with complex shareholder structures might struggle to comply, while larger, well-established companies could benefit from increased credibility. Key challenges for VASP shareholders include: Proving clean criminal records across all jurisdictions Restructuring ownership if key stakeholders don’t qualify Managing the compliance costs of ongoing screenings Maintaining investor confidence during transitions What’s the Global Significance of Targeting VASP Shareholders? South Korea’s move could set a precedent for other nations considering similar regulations. As one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets, its regulatory decisions often influence global standards. Other countries might follow suit with their own versions of VASP shareholders screening requirements. The international aspect is particularly noteworthy. The bill considers criminal records from any country, meaning VASP shareholders with legal issues anywhere in the world could face exclusion from South Korea’s crypto market. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Regulation South Korea’s proposed legislation marks a turning point in cryptocurrency regulation. By focusing on VASP shareholders’ backgrounds, authorities aim to build a more trustworthy and secure digital asset ecosystem. While this creates immediate challenges for some businesses, it could ultimately strengthen the industry by weeding out bad actors and boosting public confidence. The success of this approach will depend on balanced implementation that protects investors without stifling innovation. As the November 27 review approaches, all eyes are on how this will reshape South Korea’s position in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are VASP shareholders? VASP shareholders are individuals or entities that hold significant ownership stakes in Virtual Asset Service Providers. The new bill defines them as major stakeholders who can influence company decisions. When will the new rules take effect? The bill goes for review on November 27. If approved, implementation could begin shortly after, though exact timelines depend on the legislative process. Do existing VASPs need to re-apply? Yes, existing operators will face re-evaluation based on their major shareholders’ eligibility under the new standards. What types of criminal records disqualify shareholders? The bill doesn’t specify particular crimes, meaning any domestic or international criminal record could potentially disqualify VASP shareholders. How does this affect foreign VASP shareholders? Foreign VASP shareholders are subject to the same requirements, including disclosure of criminal records from their home countries or any other jurisdiction. Can VASPs replace disqualified shareholders? Yes, companies can restructure their ownership to comply, though this may involve significant operational changes and time constraints.

This sudden shutdown sends shockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry and raises serious questions about the sustainability of large-scale crypto mining operations in regions facing energy challenges. Why Did Tether’s Crypto Mining Venture Fail? Tether launched this ambitious crypto mining project in November 2023 with high expectations. The company invested half a billion dollars to establish one of South America’s largest cryptocurrency mining facilities. However, the operation faced immediate challenges that ultimately proved insurmountable. Local media outlet El Observador broke the story, revealing that Tether is completely shutting down its Uruguayan crypto mining operations. The decision comes after months of struggling with operational costs that made the venture economically unviable. What Were the Main Challenges for This Crypto Mining Operation? The primary factors behind Tether’s decision to halt crypto mining in Uruguay include: Sky-high energy costs that made operations financially unsustainable Lack of competitive tariff structures from local energy providers Increasing operational expenses that eroded profit margins Unfavorable economic conditions for large-scale crypto mining These challenges highlight the delicate balance required for successful crypto mining operations. Energy consumption remains the single biggest expense for any crypto mining venture, and when costs spiral out of control, even well-funded projects can collapse. How Did Tether Handle the Crypto Mining Shutdown Rumors? Interestingly, Tether had previously denied rumors about shutting down its Uruguayan crypto mining facility. As recently as September 2024, company representatives dismissed speculation about the operation’s closure. This makes the current announcement particularly surprising for industry observers. The company’s reversal demonstrates how quickly circumstances can change in the volatile world of crypto mining. What seemed like a viable operation just months ago has now become economically unsustainable due to shifting energy market conditions. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto Mining Projects? Tether’s experience in Uruguay serves as a cautionary tale for other companies considering large-scale crypto mining investments. The shutdown underscores several critical lessons: Energy cost stability is crucial for crypto mining profitability Long-term tariff agreements are essential before committing major investments Regional economic conditions can dramatically impact crypto mining viability Due diligence must include comprehensive energy market analysis This development may cause other crypto mining companies to reconsider their expansion plans in regions with unstable energy pricing. The focus may shift toward locations with more predictable energy costs and supportive regulatory environments. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Tether stop crypto mining in Uruguay? Tether halted operations due to prohibitively high energy costs and the lack of competitive electricity tariffs that made the $500 million crypto mining venture economically unviable. How much did Tether invest in Uruguayan crypto mining? Tether invested approximately $500 million in the crypto mining operation when it launched in November 2023. When did Tether start crypto mining in Uruguay? The company began its crypto mining operations in Uruguay in November 2023 with substantial financial backing and high expectations. Are there other crypto mining operations in Uruguay? While Uruguay has attracted some crypto mining interest due to its renewable energy resources, Tether’s departure may discourage similar large-scale investments until energy pricing issues are resolved. Could Tether restart crypto mining in Uruguay later? While possible, restarting would require significant changes in energy pricing structures and economic conditions that currently make crypto mining unprofitable in the region. What does this mean for cryptocurrency prices? While one crypto mining operation closure typically doesn’t significantly impact broader cryptocurrency markets, it does highlight the operational challenges facing the mining industry.

This significant adjustment occurred at 1:16 a.m. UTC on November 27, creating new opportunities for mining operations worldwide. But what does this Bitcoin mining difficulty change actually mean for you? What Is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty and Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin mining difficulty represents how challenging it is to find a new block on the blockchain. Think of it as the network’s built-in thermostat that adjusts every 2016 blocks to maintain consistent block times. When the Bitcoin mining difficulty decreases, miners can solve blocks more easily using the same computational power. This recent 1.95% drop means mining operations suddenly became more profitable. The adjustment helps balance the network after periods of reduced mining activity or when older equipment comes offline. Currently, the network’s seven-day average hashrate stands at 1.02 ZH/s with the actual rate at 1.07 ZH/s. How Does This Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Adjustment Benefit Miners? The immediate effects of this Bitcoin mining difficulty reduction are substantial for mining operations: Increased profitability for existing mining setups Lower operational costs per Bitcoin mined Extended lifespan for older mining equipment Improved margins for all mining operations This adjustment comes at a crucial time when energy costs and operational expenses have been challenging for many miners. The reduced Bitcoin mining difficulty means the same hardware now generates more Bitcoin rewards, providing much-needed relief to the mining community. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Mining Difficulty? The next Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment is expected in approximately 14 days. This gives miners a valuable window to optimize their operations and maximize returns. However, the long-term trend of Bitcoin mining difficulty typically moves upward as more participants join the network and technology improves. Network health remains strong with current hashrate levels indicating robust participation. The slight decrease in Bitcoin mining difficulty suggests some miners may have temporarily scaled back operations, possibly due to seasonal factors or equipment upgrades. Key Takeaways from This Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Change This 1.95% reduction in Bitcoin mining difficulty to 149.30T represents a positive development for the mining ecosystem. It demonstrates the network’s ability to self-regulate and maintain stability while providing temporary relief to mining operations. The adjustment ensures Bitcoin remains decentralized and accessible to miners of all sizes. Looking ahead, miners should monitor the next Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment closely. Strategic planning around these regular changes can significantly impact long-term profitability and operational efficiency in the competitive world of cryptocurrency mining. Frequently Asked Questions What causes Bitcoin mining difficulty to change? Bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts automatically every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to mine those blocks. If blocks were mined too quickly, difficulty increases; if too slowly, it decreases. How often does Bitcoin mining difficulty adjust? Approximately every two weeks, or more precisely, every 2016 blocks. The exact timing depends on block discovery rates. Does lower mining difficulty mean less network security? Not necessarily. The network automatically adjusts to maintain security. Lower difficulty typically indicates temporary changes in mining participation rather than security concerns. How can miners benefit from difficulty drops? Miners can mine more Bitcoin with the same equipment, improve profitability margins, and potentially bring older hardware back online. What was the previous Bitcoin mining difficulty? Before this adjustment, Bitcoin mining difficulty stood at approximately 152.27T before dropping to the current 149.30T. How does difficulty affect Bitcoin’s price? While not directly correlated, significant difficulty changes can influence market sentiment and mining economics, which may indirectly affect price movements. Found this analysis helpful?

Tom Lee, the prominent chairman of Bitmine, just dropped a bombshell prediction that has the crypto community buzzing.

Market sentiment has been shifting positively, institutional adoption continues growing, and macroeconomic conditions appear favorable for cryptocurrency investments. Moreover, his track record of previous accurate forecasts adds credibility to this latest projection. What’s Driving This Bullish Bitcoin Outlook? Several fundamental factors support Lee’s confident Bitcoin price prediction. First, institutional investment has been steadily increasing throughout 2024. Major corporations continue adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Second, regulatory clarity has improved in several key markets.

Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout 2024, maintaining strong support levels despite periodic volatility. The cryptocurrency has already shown it can recover quickly from corrections, suggesting underlying strength that could propel it toward Lee’s targets. What About Lee’s Previous Bitcoin Forecasts? It’s worth noting this isn’t Lee’s first bold Bitcoin price prediction. Earlier this year, he projected Bitcoin could reach $250,000. While that might seem ambitious, his revised $100,000 forecast appears more grounded in current market realities. His adjustment demonstrates careful analysis of evolving market conditions rather than blind optimism. This pragmatic approach strengthens the credibility of his current Bitcoin price prediction. Key Takeaways From This Bitcoin Analysis Lee’s Bitcoin price prediction rests on solid fundamental analysis. The combination of increasing institutional participation, improving regulatory frameworks, and growing mainstream acceptance creates a perfect storm for potential price appreciation. While cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, the underlying trends suggest sustained upward momentum could push Bitcoin toward and possibly beyond Lee’s targets.

Let’s explore why this dip might actually be good news for long-term holders. What Defines a Bitcoin Bull Market Correction? Every Bitcoin bull market experiences temporary setbacks, and the current situation fits historical patterns perfectly. Corrections serve to reset over-leveraged positions and create healthier foundations for continued growth. The recent price movement represents exactly this type of necessary market adjustment. XWIN Research Japan confirms we’ve completed a leverage overheating phase across multiple market segments. This cleansing process typically precedes strong recoveries in established Bitcoin bull market cycles. The data suggests we’re witnessing normal market behavior rather than trend reversal. Key Metrics Signaling Bitcoin Bull Market Recovery Several important indicators point toward imminent recovery in this Bitcoin bull market. The Market Value to Realized Value ratio has dropped to 1.54, a level historically associated with price rebounds. This metric compares Bitcoin’s market cap to the total value investors paid for their coins. Open Interest dropped from $37B to $29B, indicating leverage flush-out Whale addresses (10-1,000 BTC) show consistent accumulation Short-term holders realized over $900M in losses, signaling capitulation Long-term capital inflow beginning to emerge Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Has Room to Run The current Bitcoin bull market differs from previous cycles in important ways. Improved global regulatory clarity provides stronger institutional confidence. Early signs of professional capital inflow suggest deeper market participation than previous cycles. Moreover, the fundamental adoption story remains intact. The leverage reset creates healthier conditions for sustainable growth. Historical patterns show similar corrections within ongoing Bitcoin bull market trends typically resolve upward. What Should Investors Do During This Bitcoin Bull Market Phase? Seasoned investors recognize these correction phases as potential accumulation opportunities. The key is maintaining perspective about the broader Bitcoin bull market context. While short-term volatility can be unsettling, the underlying fundamentals remain strong. Consider these actionable insights during this Bitcoin bull market correction: Focus on long-term trends rather than daily price movements Dollar-cost average during price weakness Monitor on-chain metrics for confirmation of recovery Maintain risk management appropriate for your investment goals Conclusion: The Bitcoin Bull Market Story Continues The evidence strongly suggests we’re experiencing a healthy correction within an ongoing Bitcoin bull market. Multiple technical and fundamental indicators align with historical recovery patterns. While no investment guarantees exist, the current setup favors continued upward movement once the correction completes. Remember that successful cryptocurrency investing requires patience and perspective. This Bitcoin bull market appears to have substantial runway remaining based on current data and market structure. Frequently Asked Questions How long do Bitcoin bull market corrections typically last? Corrections within Bitcoin bull markets usually last several weeks to a few months, depending on market conditions and the extent of leverage that needs unwinding. What’s the difference between a correction and a bear market? A correction represents a temporary price decline within an ongoing uptrend, typically 10-20%. A bear market indicates a sustained downtrend of 20% or more with changing market structure. Should I buy during a Bitcoin bull market correction? Many investors use corrections to add to positions at better prices, though this depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. What are the strongest signs of Bitcoin bull market recovery? Key recovery signs include declining leverage, whale accumulation, improving MVRV ratios, and reduced selling pressure from short-term holders. How does institutional interest affect Bitcoin bull markets? Institutional participation typically extends bull market duration and reduces volatility over time as more stable capital enters the ecosystem. What risks remain for the current Bitcoin bull market? Potential risks include regulatory developments, macroeconomic factors, and unexpected global events that could impact investor sentiment. Found this analysis helpful?

54964214,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=223519,1764212111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stunning Bitcoin Price Prediction: Galaxy Digital CEO Forecasts $100K Recovery by Year-End,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-prediction-recovery/,"BitcoinWorld Stunning Bitcoin Price Prediction: Galaxy Digital CEO Forecasts $100K Recovery by Year-End Could Bitcoin really surge to $100,000 by the end of this year? According to Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction might become reality. In a recent interview that’s making waves across crypto circles, the veteran investor shared his optimistic outlook for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. What’s Driving This Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Mike Novogratz, speaking with SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, expressed strong confidence in Bitcoin’s recovery potential. His Bitcoin price prediction stems from several key market factors that could propel BTC to new heights. However, he also cautioned that significant selling pressure might emerge around the $100,000 level due to psychological factors from recent market liquidations. The market veteran explained that as cryptocurrency policies become clearer, we’ll see deeper market development and increased differentiation among digital assets. This evolution will naturally favor cryptocurrencies that demonstrate tangible value and utility. Why Institutional Participation Matters for Bitcoin Traditional financial firms are increasingly entering the crypto space, and this institutional adoption plays a crucial role in Novogratz’s Bitcoin price prediction. Here’s what’s changing: More regulated investment products are becoming available Major financial institutions are adding crypto services Corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin are growing Retirement funds and pensions are exploring crypto exposure This institutional participation creates stronger market foundations and reduces volatility over time. The Bitcoin price prediction of $100,000 reflects this maturing market structure. Understanding the Market Psychology Behind $100K Novogratz’s Bitcoin price prediction isn’t just about numbers—it’s deeply connected to market psychology. The $100,000 level represents a major psychological barrier that could trigger both excitement and caution among investors. Recent market liquidations created what he describes as ‘psychological shock’ among traders. This means that as Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 mark, we might see increased selling activity from investors looking to secure profits. However, the long-term trend remains positive according to this Bitcoin price prediction. How Market Restructuring Supports This Bitcoin Price Prediction The crypto market is undergoing significant restructuring that could validate Novogratz’s Bitcoin price prediction. As regulatory clarity improves, we’re seeing: Clearer separation between valuable projects and speculative tokens Increased focus on real-world utility and technological innovation Better risk management practices across the industry More sophisticated trading and investment strategies This market evolution creates a healthier environment for sustainable growth, making the $100,000 Bitcoin price prediction more plausible. What This Bitcoin Price Prediction Means for Investors Novogratz’s optimistic Bitcoin price prediction suggests several important considerations for market participants. While the potential for significant gains exists, investors should also remain aware of market dynamics and risk factors. The path to $100,000 likely won’t be smooth. Market corrections and volatility should be expected along the way. However, the fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong, supporting this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction. Conclusion: A Compelling Case for Bitcoin’s Future Mike Novogratz’s $100,000 Bitcoin price prediction represents more than just a number—it reflects growing confidence in cryptocurrency’s long-term trajectory. As institutional adoption increases and market structures mature, Bitcoin appears positioned for significant growth. While challenges remain, the combination of technical fundamentals, market psychology, and institutional interest creates a compelling case for Bitcoin’s potential recovery. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Mike Novogratz predict about Bitcoin? The Galaxy Digital CEO predicted that Bitcoin could recover to $100,000 by the end of this year, though he noted potential selling pressure at that level. Why does Novogratz believe Bitcoin can reach $100,000? He cites increasing institutional participation, clearer crypto policies, and market restructuring that favors valuable cryptocurrencies. What challenges could prevent Bitcoin from reaching $100,000? Psychological factors from recent liquidations and potential selling pressure around key price levels could create obstacles. How reliable are cryptocurrency price predictions? While experts like Novogratz provide valuable insights, all crypto predictions involve uncertainty and market risks. What should investors consider given this prediction? Investors should focus on long-term fundamentals, diversify their portfolios, and only invest what they can afford to lose. How does institutional adoption affect Bitcoin’s price? Institutional participation brings more capital, better market structure, and reduced volatility over time.

The effort is being run with help from the Stellar Development Foundation and consulting firm PwC, and it is being described as an experiment in how a mainstream bank might move dollars on a public ledger. Stablecoins: Pilot Includes PwC And Stellar Support According to the bank and project partners, the pilot examines features that matter to regulated finance, such as the ability to freeze an asset or unwind a transaction when needed. Mike Villano, who leads digital-assets work at US Bancorp, said these controls are a major reason the bank is testing Stellar rather than an alternative chain. Reports have disclosed that the work was discussed publicly during a Money 20/20 podcast featuring executives from US Bancorp , PwC and the Stellar Development Foundation. Stellar Offers Quick, Low-Cost Settlements Based on Stellar’s own technical notes , transactions on the network confirm in about three–five seconds on average. The network also advertises very small fees — the average cost per operation is listed as roughly $0.000005 — and built-in account controls that let issuers add KYC , freeze and clawback options. Those properties are exactly what US Bancorp says it wants to test for regulated payments and custody use cases. Bank Expands Its Digital-Assets Unit US Bancorp has already moved to put more resources behind crypto and token work . Last month the bank announced a dedicated unit focused on stablecoins and money movement, a signal that stablecoin trials are part of a broader push to build on-chain services. Reports tie some of the momentum in the sector to warmer political winds from US President Donald Trump and other developments that have made executives more willing to explore tokenized cash and securities. The bank has not named a rollout date or said whether the pilot is for institutional partners only or for a wider set of customers. Stablecoins: What This Means For Customers And Markets Based on reports and the technical detail published by Stellar, the pilot is set up more as a compliance-first test than a bet on speculative trading. US Bancorp is treating the stablecoins pilot as an extension of payments and custody services, not a retail crypto product for consumers right now. Market participants will watch whether the trial shows that a public blockchain can meet bank rules without losing the ability to correct mistakes or follow court orders.

With momentum building around XRP exchange-traded funds, one prominent analyst now believes the asset could be on the verge of a rally so large it may outperform Bitcoin’s own ETF-driven surge. Why Analysts Believe XRP Is Poised For A Larger Upside Than Bitcoin XRP is entering its ETF chapter, and the scale of what’s coming could make Bitcoin look small. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull mentioned on X that early players like Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin, and Canary Funds are already live with their XRP products. Meanwhile, the real power players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and the other giants haven’t even filed for an XRP spot ETF yet, which shows this is just a warm-up. Related Reading: Here’s Why A Supply Shock Could Be Imminent For XRP The heavyweights haven’t even stepped into the arena, and the initial institutional capital is already flowing. Spot ETFs were highly beneficial for BTC, which triggered a trillion-dollar shockwave that attracted Wall Street institutions and momentum traders who couldn’t ignore the access. According to Xfinancebull, XRP is a different beast, with functional utility, real-world adoption, and banking infrastructure already built out across Japan and Asia. The capital that will soon flood into XRP via ETFs won’t just speculate, but it will stay. When a fraction of over $80 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM) from these initial titans begins to rotate into XRP, the inflows could be significant. This is cold, hard math that is about to unlock high levels of liquidity and historically repeat the move on a larger scale. “The XRP spot ETF ignition is not coming, but it is already here. If you missed the Bitcoin momentum move, don’t miss this one,” Xfinancebull noted. An analyst known as RipBullWinkle has also highlighted that Bitcoin has leaked $151 million, while XRP led all inflows with $164 million. That’s not random, it’s institutions reallocating with intention into assets built for settlement and speed. When powerhouses like Franklin Templeton and Grayscale pull over $130 million into XRP on day one, it confirms where the institutional smart money is going. Market Stabilization Signals The Start Of A New Upward Leg Bitcoin and altcoins are reacting sharply to momentary declines after the brief pullback. TerraHaberTr has stated that BTC has reclaimed the $87,000 level, and if momentum continues at this pace, BTC will target $90,000 and $100,000 levels. On the altcoin side, the recovery is happening even faster, and altcoins that have experienced deep dips may start to gain strength.

The past 24 hours witnessed a staggering $217 million crypto futures liquidation that sent shockwaves through the trading community. This massive wipeout primarily affected short positions, revealing crucial insights about current market sentiment and risk management in cryptocurrency derivatives trading. What Triggered This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation? The cryptocurrency market experienced significant price movements that led to this substantial crypto futures liquidation event. When prices move sharply against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent further losses. This process, known as liquidation, protects both traders and the exchange platform from excessive risk exposure. The recent market activity clearly demonstrates how quickly conditions can change in the crypto space. Breaking Down the Crypto Futures Liquidation Numbers Let’s examine the specific assets that contributed to this massive crypto futures liquidation: Bitcoin (BTC) : $134 million liquidated, with shorts accounting for 85.34% Ethereum (ETH) : $53.54 million liquidated, with shorts accounting for 69.99% HYPE : $29.67 million liquidated, with shorts accounting for 99.53% This distribution shows that most traders were betting against these cryptocurrencies, expecting prices to fall. However, when prices moved in the opposite direction, their positions faced automatic closure through the crypto futures liquidation process. Why Were Short Positions Hit So Hard? The overwhelming dominance of short positions in this crypto futures liquidation event suggests several market dynamics at play. Many traders likely anticipated price declines, possibly due to recent market trends or external economic factors. However, when prices unexpectedly rallied, these bearish positions became vulnerable. The high percentage of short liquidations indicates that market momentum caught many traders by surprise, leading to this substantial crypto futures liquidation across major digital assets. How Can Traders Protect Against Future Crypto Futures Liquidation? Understanding risk management is crucial for avoiding similar crypto futures liquidation scenarios. Traders should consider several protective measures: Use appropriate leverage levels that match your risk tolerance Set stop-loss orders to automatically exit positions Diversify trading strategies across different timeframes Monitor market conditions and news developments regularly Implementing these strategies can help minimize exposure to sudden crypto futures liquidation events while maintaining profitable trading activities. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? This significant crypto futures liquidation event provides valuable insights into current market sentiment. The heavy skew toward short liquidations suggests that many traders were positioned for further price declines. However, the market’s upward movement triggered this massive crypto futures liquidation, potentially indicating underlying bullish momentum. Such events often lead to increased volatility as positions are rebalanced and new traders enter the market. Key Takeaways from the $217M Crypto Futures Liquidation The recent crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder about market dynamics and risk management. While derivatives trading offers significant profit potential, it also carries substantial risks, as demonstrated by this $217 million wipeout. Traders should approach cryptocurrency futures with careful planning and disciplined execution to navigate these volatile conditions successfully. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s position loses enough value that it can no longer cover the required margin. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent further losses. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, set stop-loss orders, maintain adequate margin, and monitor your positions regularly to avoid liquidation. Why were short positions mostly affected? Most traders were betting on price decreases, but when prices unexpectedly rose, their short positions faced automatic closure through liquidation. Is futures trading riskier than spot trading? Yes, futures trading involves leverage, which amplifies both potential profits and losses, making it riskier than spot trading. How often do large liquidations occur? Significant liquidation events typically happen during periods of high volatility and sharp price movements in the cryptocurrency market. Can liquidations affect market prices? Yes, large-scale liquidations can create cascading effects that amplify price movements in either direction. Found this analysis of the massive crypto futures liquidation helpful?

This consistent performance signals growing investor confidence in cryptocurrency investment vehicles. Why Are Bitcoin Spot ETFs Gaining Momentum? According to recent data from TraderT, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs attracted a net inflow of $21.25 million on November 26. This marks the second straight day of positive movement, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. The sustained interest in Bitcoin spot ETFs demonstrates how institutional investors are increasingly embracing cryptocurrency exposure through regulated channels. BlackRock’s Dominant Performance in Bitcoin ETFs BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led the charge with an impressive $42.95 million inflow, showcasing the asset management giant’s strong position in the Bitcoin spot ETFs space. This substantial investment highlights several key advantages: Institutional credibility and trust Proven track record in asset management Accessible investment vehicle for traditional investors How Did Other Major Players Perform? While BlackRock dominated, other significant Bitcoin spot ETFs also showed positive movement. Ark Invest’s ARKB recorded a $5.97 million inflow, and Grayscale’s GBTC saw $5.63 million in net inflows. However, Fidelity’s FBTC experienced a contrasting trend with a $33.30 million outflow. The remaining Bitcoin spot ETFs in the market reported no net changes, suggesting selective investor preference. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Spot ETFs Future? The consecutive days of positive flows for Bitcoin spot ETFs indicate several important market developments. First, institutional interest remains strong despite market volatility. Second, the variety of Bitcoin spot ETFs available provides investors with multiple options to gain cryptocurrency exposure. Finally, the consistent performance suggests that Bitcoin spot ETFs are becoming an established component of diversified investment portfolios. Key Takeaways for Investors Considering Bitcoin Spot ETFs For investors looking at Bitcoin spot ETFs, the current market activity offers valuable insights.

Why is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF performing so well? BlackRock’s strong reputation, extensive investor network, and proven asset management expertise have contributed to the impressive performance of their Bitcoin spot ETF. Are Bitcoin spot ETFs safe investments? While all investments carry risk, Bitcoin spot ETFs offer regulated exposure to cryptocurrency through established financial institutions, providing more security than direct cryptocurrency ownership. How can I invest in Bitcoin spot ETFs? You can invest in Bitcoin spot ETFs through traditional brokerage accounts, similar to how you would purchase any other exchange-traded fund. What makes Bitcoin spot ETFs different from Bitcoin futures ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs track the current price of Bitcoin, while futures ETFs track Bitcoin futures contracts, which can lead to different performance characteristics.

The crypto world just witnessed a staggering USDT whale transfer that’s got everyone talking. Whale Alert recently reported an enormous transaction where 214,520,904 USDT moved from an unknown wallet to OKX exchange. This massive transfer, valued at approximately $215 million, represents one of the most significant stablecoin movements we’ve seen recently. But what does this substantial USDT whale transfer really mean for the market? What Makes This USDT Whale Transfer So Significant? When we examine this particular USDT whale transfer, several factors stand out immediately. The sheer size of the transaction – over 214 million USDT – automatically captures attention. However, the destination matters just as much as the amount. OKX, being one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, often serves as a gateway for institutional and large-scale trading activities. This substantial USDT whale transfer could indicate several potential scenarios: Market preparation for major trading activities Institutional movement between cold and hot wallets Liquidity provisioning for upcoming market operations Strategic positioning ahead of anticipated market volatility How Do Whale Transfers Impact Crypto Markets? Understanding the ripple effects of a major USDT whale transfer requires looking at market dynamics. Large stablecoin movements often serve as leading indicators for market sentiment and potential price action. When substantial amounts of USDT move to exchanges, it typically suggests that holders are preparing to make significant purchases of other cryptocurrencies. This particular USDT whale transfer to OKX might signal that major players are positioning themselves for upcoming market movements. Moreover, such transactions can influence market psychology, often creating anticipation among retail investors who monitor whale activities closely. Why Should You Care About This USDT Movement? You might think whale watching is just for crypto enthusiasts, but these movements affect everyone in the ecosystem. This USDT whale transfer provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Large transfers often precede significant market movements, making them crucial indicators for both traders and long-term investors. Furthermore, monitoring these activities helps understand liquidity flows and market depth. The timing of this transfer, combined with its substantial size, suggests that sophisticated market participants might be anticipating important developments in the near future. What Challenges Do Large Transfers Present? While massive transfers like this USDT whale transfer demonstrate market maturity and liquidity, they also present certain challenges. Market surveillance becomes crucial to ensure these movements don’t manipulate prices or create artificial volatility. Additionally, such large transactions highlight the importance of robust security measures across exchanges and wallet providers. The anonymous nature of the sending wallet also raises questions about transparency in cryptocurrency movements, though this is balanced by the public nature of blockchain transparency. Key Takeaways From This Major Crypto Movement This substantial USDT whale transfer to OKX underscores several important market trends. First, it demonstrates the growing institutional presence in cryptocurrency markets. Second, it highlights the crucial role stablecoins play in facilitating large-scale transactions. Third, it shows how blockchain transparency allows market participants to monitor significant movements in real-time. Most importantly, this transaction reminds us that cryptocurrency markets continue to mature, with sophisticated players making strategic moves that shape market dynamics. The recent USDT whale transfer represents more than just numbers on a screen – it’s a window into the sophisticated strategies employed by major market participants. As cryptocurrency markets evolve, understanding these movements becomes increasingly important for all market participants. The transparency provided by blockchain technology allows us to witness these significant transactions, providing valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Frequently Asked Questions What is a USDT whale transfer? A USDT whale transfer refers to large-scale movements of Tether stablecoin, typically involving millions of dollars, usually executed by major investors or institutions. Why do whales transfer USDT to exchanges? Whales transfer USDT to exchanges primarily to facilitate large trades, provide liquidity, or position themselves for anticipated market movements. How does this affect cryptocurrency prices? Large USDT transfers to exchanges often signal potential buying pressure, which can influence market sentiment and potentially affect cryptocurrency prices. Can retail investors benefit from monitoring whale transfers? Yes, monitoring whale transfers provides valuable market insights, though retail investors should consider multiple factors before making investment decisions. Is this type of transfer common? While large transfers occur regularly, transactions of this magnitude (over $200 million) are less frequent and typically indicate significant market activity. What security measures protect such large transfers? Exchanges employ advanced security protocols including multi-signature wallets, cold storage integration, and real-time monitoring to secure large transfers.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin climbed back above $90,000 on Thursday as Asian markets opened in a broadly positive mood, with stocks firmer and the dollar softer on growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. Trading volumes stayed light in a holiday-shortened week, with US markets shut on Thursday for Thanksgiving and set for only a brief session on Friday. Even so, investors leaned into risk, taking their cue from Wall Street’s latest tech-driven rally and positioning ahead of the Fed’s final policy meeting of the year. Rate expectations are doing much of the work. Futures pricing now suggests that traders see about an 85% chance of a 25-basis-point cut next month, up sharply from around 30% a week earlier, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $91,229, up 4.3% Ether : $3,038, up 2.8% XRP : $2.21, up 1.1% Total crypto market cap: $3.19 trillion, up 4.1% Fed Comments Take Center Stage As Data Lags After Shutdown With most recent economic releases still dated after a 43-day government shutdown that ended in mid-November, markets are treating comments from Fed officials as the cleaner signal on the policy path. Remarks this week from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Fed Governor Christopher Waller nudged investors further toward the view that the central bank is ready to shift from holding to easing. At the same time, data on Wednesday showed new applications for unemployment benefits falling to a seven-month low, suggesting layoffs remain contained and helping to support a soft landing narrative. UPDATE: Just 7 days ago, markets priced a December rate cut at 30%. Today? 85% even @jpmorgan piling on – confirms the cut! What changed, you ask? NY Fed's Williams (Powell's right-hand) signaled openness to cuts Sep jobs report showed weakness (119K vs expected)… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) November 27, 2025 AI Momentum Helps US Markets Extend Their Winning Streak Wall Street extended its advance on Wednesday, as tech strength and rising confidence in a December cut pulled investors back into growth stocks. All three major US equity benchmarks logged a fourth straight day of gains, recovering from last week’s pullback that was driven by worries over stretched valuations in the sector. Those concerns eased after Nvidia delivered upbeat quarterly results and guidance, reinforcing the belief that demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure remains strong. AI server maker Dell Technologies then added to the momentum with a revenue outlook that topped forecasts, helping to stabilise sentiment around the broader AI trade. Crypto traders kept one eye on macro and the other on charts. Piyush Walke, derivatives research analyst at Delta Exchange, said Bitcoin still sits below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, with resistance near $93,000 holding for now. He noted that Ethereum recently bounced off a long-term ascending trendline that has acted as major support, and said a firm daily close above the $3,000 to $3,050 zone could open a move toward $3,200 to $3,300. Asian Stocks Rise As Regional Risk Appetite Improves Equity markets across Asia reflected the improved risk tone. MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 0.27%, on track to break a three-week losing streak, while Japan’s Nikkei and South Korea’s Kospi each gained more than 1% in early trade. China’s property sector remained a key regional risk point. Investors watched closely as major developer China Vanke sought approval from bondholders to delay repayment on a 2 billion yuan, or about $282.6m, onshore bond. For now, though, crypto and equity markets are feeding off the same story. With Bitcoin back above $90,000, tech stocks resurgent and an anticipated Fed rate cut drawing closer, Asia’s trading day opened with a firm, if cautious, appetite for risk.

U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs just recorded their fourth consecutive day of net inflows, signaling strong institutional interest. According to TraderT data from November 26, these funds attracted $60.99 million, demonstrating sustained momentum for Ethereum spot ETFs in the cryptocurrency market. Why Are Ethereum Spot ETFs Gaining Momentum? Ethereum spot ETFs represent a groundbreaking way for investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. The recent inflow streak suggests growing trust in these regulated investment vehicles. Moreover, this pattern indicates that both institutional and retail investors are increasingly comfortable with Ethereum spot ETFs as part of their portfolio strategy. Which Ethereum Spot ETFs Led the Charge? BlackRock’s ETHA dominated the inflows with an impressive $50.39 million contribution. Other notable performers included: Bitwise’s ETHW : $4.33 million in net inflows Grayscale’s Mini ETH : $6.27 million in net inflows The remaining Ethereum spot ETFs showed no net flows, highlighting how specific funds are capturing investor attention. This selective investment pattern reveals market preferences among available Ethereum spot ETFs. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? Continuous inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs suggest several positive developments. First, institutional confidence appears to be strengthening. Second, the regulatory environment for these products seems increasingly favorable. Third, the sustained interest could potentially influence Ethereum’s market dynamics and price stability. How Might This Impact Future Ethereum Adoption? The consistent performance of Ethereum spot ETFs could accelerate mainstream adoption. As more investors discover these accessible entry points, we might see increased liquidity and reduced volatility. However, investors should remain aware of market risks and conduct thorough research before committing to any Ethereum spot ETFs investment strategy. What Challenges Could Ethereum Spot ETFs Face? While the current trend for Ethereum spot ETFs appears positive, potential challenges include regulatory changes, market volatility, and competition from other investment products. Investors should monitor these factors closely when considering Ethereum spot ETFs for their portfolios. The fourth consecutive day of net inflows for U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency adoption. This sustained interest demonstrates growing confidence in regulated Ethereum investment vehicles and could signal broader market acceptance. As institutional players like BlackRock continue to lead the charge, Ethereum spot ETFs may become increasingly important bridges between traditional finance and digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What are Ethereum spot ETFs? Ethereum spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Ethereum and track its spot price, allowing investors to gain exposure without storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are net inflows important for Ethereum spot ETFs? Net inflows indicate more money entering than leaving the funds, suggesting growing investor confidence and potential price support for Ethereum. How do Ethereum spot ETFs differ from futures ETFs? Spot ETFs hold actual Ethereum, while futures ETFs track contracts based on future prices.

XRP Recently Found Support At The Lower Line Of A Parallel Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 3-day price of XRP. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel,” appearing whenever an asset’s price consolidates between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why The upper level of the channel provides resistance to the asset, making tops probable at it. Similarly, the lower line can facilitate bottom formations by acting as a source of support. A breakout of either of these bounds can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Parallel Channels, but the one of interest here is the most basic version: a channel that’s parallel to the time-axis. This type corresponds to a phase of true sideways movement in the price. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 3-day price of XRP has been stuck inside for the past year: As is visible in the above graph, XRP witnessed a failed breakout beyond the upper line of the Parallel Channel back in July. This kicked off a phase of downtrend for the cryptocurrency, which culminated in a retest of the channel’s lower line earlier in November. The coin has since observed a rebound, a potential sign that the support level of the Parallel Channel is holding up. The analyst thinks that the cryptocurrency may now be heading toward the midpoint of the pattern, located at $2.60. From the current price of the asset, a rally to this level would mean an increase of almost 20%. It now remains to be seen whether the coin’s surge will continue, or if it will retrace back to the support line again. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 7%, But Watch Out For Speculative Froth Something that could make the latter scenario more likely is profit-taking from the whales. As Martinez has highlighted in another X post, the large XRP holders carrying between 1 million and 10 million tokens participated in distribution during the asset’s latest recovery surge. As displayed in the chart, XRP whales reduced their supply by more than 180 million tokens (worth $391 million at the latest exchange rate) alongside its 17% price rally. This selloff was only a continuation of the trend from earlier in the month, and could be a potential sign that the sentiment among big-money traders hasn’t changed despite the rebound. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.17, down 1.5% over the last 24 hours.

54967131,634811,1764216033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54967131.jpeg,Has Bitcoin And Crypto Really Bottomed? On-Chain Firm Responds,https://bitcoinist.com/has-bitcoin-crypto-really-bottomed-on-chain-firm/,"Has Bitcoin genuinely carved out a cycle low or just staged another reflexive bounce? After briefly threatening to lose the $80,000 level and then rebounding toward $88,000, the “bottom” debate is back in full force. On-chain analytics firm Santiment has weighed in – and its answer is cautiously skeptical. Did Bitcoin Just Print Its Cycle Low? The firm begins by criticizing the way market labels are thrown around. “The terms ‘bull market’, ‘bear market’, ‘topped’, or ‘bottomed’ can truly mean whatever narrative a trader, investor, or community wants it to mean,” Santiment notes, pointing out that few commentators define a clear timeframe when they call a top or bottom. This opens the door to extreme confirmation bias “after the uptrend or downtrend of prices are already well established.” Still, the recent move off sub-$80,000 levels has been enough for some to argue that forced selling is behind us. Santiment acknowledges that “content that covers whether the ‘bottom’ has been established will always get some anxious traders excited again,” but stresses that price alone is not sufficient evidence. On sentiment, the data looks contrarian-constructive. Santiment highlights “how far traders’ optimism regarding Bitcoin (as an investment) can fall after monthly gains are no longer a guarantee.” Its social metrics show an uptick in declarations that crypto is in a bear market and a rise in bearish commentary. “The uptick in declaration of crypto being in a bear market, and rise of bearish sentiment are both clearly great signs,” the firm writes, reminding readers that “most major turnarounds occur when retail’s hope is mainly lost.” The open question: “Is the crowd’s hopes and dreams of getting their lambos really truly gone?” Bearish Arguments Still Predominant Derivatives positioning adds nuance. Aggregated funding rates show meaningful short exposure, but not yet at the extremes seen after the October 6 all-time high. “When we see many shorts like this it often stops the downtrend in its tracks,” Santiment explains, recalling how “many shorted about a week after the October 6th all-time high, and there was a temporary relief rally in late October as a result.” For now, though, “we’re not seeing quite the level of bets against the price of Bitcoin […] just yet anyways.” Profitability metrics paint a similar picture. Both 30-day and 365-day MVRV remain negative, indicating the average holder sits on unrealized losses. Santiment underlines that MVRV “shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of every token acquired,” and that as it rises, “more market participants become willing sellers.” With MVRV still depressed, the firm argues that “a rebound above $90K again soon wouldn’t be a major surprise at all.” The more concerning signals come from network fundamentals and holder structure. “If we look at the overall utility of Bitcoin, however, things look a bit dicey,” Santiment warns. Weekly new addresses have fallen from over 3.37 million at a mid-December 2023 peak to about 2.21 million now. Weekly active addresses are down from more than 963,900 to roughly 729,200. That underscores “declining utility” at a time when a durable bottom would typically coincide with stabilization or re-acceleration in network use. Even more problematic is the whale-to-retail shift. Santiment calls this “one other major elephant in the room that should bring you a bit of hesitance that ‘the bottom is in’.” Addresses holding 10–10,000 BTC “continue to shrink their collective supply held,” while wallets with less than 0.1 BTC “continue to grow theirs.” The firm is blunt: “This is the wrong combination to mark a bottom.” Since COVID-19, “ institutionals have driven up just about every bull rally,” and this 10–10,000 BTC cohort “had a lot to do with the October 6th all-time high.” Yet “by October 8th […] [they] began to flat-line their holdings, and have been shrinking them for about six weeks straight now,” while “small wallets […] are the ones scooping up dips in hopes that they ‘catch the falling knife’.” The verdict is split across timeframes. “Overall, data points to the most likely scenario being a short-term bounce,” backed by negative MVRV and vocal retail panic. But “Bitcoin clawing its way all the way to six figures looks like a stretch when […] whale bags are continuously appearing to be in ‘sell mode’.” Santiment concludes that “the long-term direction is still pointing to down” as long as “declining utility and declining whale and shark holdings” persist – while reminding investors that “crypto markets could be full of surprises” as the New Year approaches.

With price stabilizing near $91,100 after a sharp rebound from $80,542, markets are now watching whether Bitcoin can reclaim key Fibonacci levels and confirm a broader recovery phase. Bolivia Moves to Integrate Crypto Into Its Banking System Bolivia has reversed its long-standing ban on digital assets and is now preparing to integrate cryptocurrencies, starting with stablecoins, into its formal banking system. Finance Minister José Gabriel Espinoza confirmed that banks will soon be allowed to offer crypto-based services, including savings accounts, credit cards, and even loans linked to digital assets. BOLIVIA TO LET BANKS OFFER CRYPTO The government will begin integrating crypto beginning with stablecoins into the financial system, allowing banks to roll out crypto savings, credit cards, and loan products. pic.twitter.com/6AzIvfugVh — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) November 26, 2025 This shift began when the Bolivian Central Bank lifted restrictions on crypto transactions. Banco Bisa was the first major bank to act, launching USDT services to protect customers from local-currency depreciation and to simplify cross-border payments. Although the rollout starts with stablecoins, the policy marks a broader shift among emerging economies toward regulated digital-asset adoption. The move is expected to strengthen long-term confidence in Bitcoin as more countries integrate crypto into their financial infrastructure. Bitcoin Could Hit $89K as Short Squeeze Risk Builds Bitcoin traded around $87,950 on Wednesday as analysts warned that a sharp short squeeze could be forming. Large clusters of short positions are stacked between $88,000 and $89,000, levels where liquidation flows typically accelerate. If BTC pushes into that zone, short sellers may be forced to buy back aggressively, potentially driving price toward $90,000. Bitcoin price analysis suggests a potential short squeeze could propel BTC toward $89,000, coinciding with the S&P 500 approaching 2% below its all-time high. @Bitcoin #BitcoinPrice #DynamicNexus #DynamicNexusCrypto By Dynamic Nexus © pic.twitter.com/pQ3pqo5lzm — Dynamic Nexus Crypto (@DNexus_Crypto) November 26, 2025 However, if the price dips below $85,000 first, downside liquidity may be taken before any meaningful recovery attempt. Market positioning currently shows a near-even split between longs and shorts, hinting at a sizable directional move ahead. Rate-cut expectations for December have also improved sentiment across risk assets, helping lift the S&P 500 and potentially providing tailwinds for BTC. Strategy Unveils Credit Dashboard to Calm Market Fears Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, launched a credit-rating dashboard to reassure investors after the recent crypto drawdown. The company says it can sustain dividend payments for up to 70 years even if Bitcoin’s price remains stagnant. Strategy’s balance sheet remains strong, with assets still roughly six times larger than its debt even if BTC returns to its $74,000 average purchase price. LATEST: Strategy has introduced a new credit rating gauge to calm debt concerns after the Bitcoin crash! pic.twitter.com/d9gaPW3amC — Coinvo (@Coinvo) November 26, 2025 The firm’s long cash-flow runway reduces the risk of forced Bitcoin sales—especially important as several digital-asset treasury companies saw their stock values slump during the broader market correction. By continuing to hold BTC through volatility, Strategy may help stabilize supply and support institutional confidence. Bitcoin Technical Forecast: Buyers Test First Real Reversal Zone Bitcoin is stabilizing after a steep correction, currently trading near $91,100 following a decisive rebound from $80,542—its lowest level in months and the base of its descending channel. The move created the first notable higher low in weeks and brought BTC back toward the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $90,798. Price is testing the channel’s midline and the downward-sloping 20-EMA, both acting as short-term barriers. Early momentum improvement is visible as the RSI recovers from oversold conditions and starts forming mild bullish divergence. Candlesticks have shifted from heavy red bodies to spinning tops and smaller wicks, signaling fading sell pressure. A bullish engulfing close above $93,398 would strengthen the case for a reversal. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A breakout above $93,966 could open a path toward $97,135 and potentially $102,255, the next major resistance area. A long entry becomes compelling only if BTC closes above $91,800 with volume confirmation. Should buyers reclaim the 0.618 retracement, Bitcoin may transition into a broader recovery phase, setting a constructive backdrop ahead of upcoming presale cycles.

The trading firm identifies these key resistance factors: Weakening institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs Potential removal of Strategy from MSCI index Shrinking overall market liquidity AI sector momentum slowdown How Strong Is the Current Bitcoin Resistance? The mid-$90,000s represent a critical psychological and technical barrier that has proven difficult to breach. This Bitcoin resistance level isn’t just a random number – it’s where multiple technical indicators converge, creating a perfect storm of selling pressure. QCP Capital specifically highlights the $80,000 to $82,000 range as crucial support. If Bitcoin fails to break through the current Bitcoin resistance , we could see a retest of these support levels sooner than many investors expect. Why Are Institutions Losing Interest in Bitcoin? The weakening institutional appetite presents a major concern for overcoming current Bitcoin resistance . U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs haven’t seen significant net inflows recently, suggesting that large players might be taking profits rather than adding positions. Moreover, Strategy’s potential removal from the MSCI index could trigger substantial selling pressure. As the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, any negative development around Strategy creates additional Bitcoin resistance at higher price levels. Can Broader Market Trends Break This Bitcoin Resistance? The analysis reveals another worrying trend – the AI sector’s weakening momentum. Since risk assets often move together, trouble in the AI space could spill over into cryptocurrencies. Key indicators pointing to broader market pressure: Expanding credit risk across sectors Rising accounts receivable at NVIDIA Increasing inventory levels in tech companies Overall risk-asset correlation weakening These factors combine to create substantial Bitcoin resistance that even optimistic bulls must acknowledge. What Should Bitcoin Investors Watch For? Breaking through the current Bitcoin resistance requires either a fundamental catalyst or significant technical momentum. Investors should monitor these key indicators closely to gauge whether the resistance will hold or break. The battle at mid-$90,000s represents more than just a price level – it’s a test of Bitcoin’s underlying strength amid changing market conditions. The outcome will likely determine the cryptocurrency’s direction for weeks to come. Frequently Asked Questions What causes Bitcoin resistance at specific price levels? Bitcoin resistance forms where large sell orders accumulate, often at psychological price points or where previous buyers took profits. Technical indicators and market sentiment also contribute to these resistance zones. How long can Bitcoin resistance typically last? Resistance can last from hours to months, depending on market conditions. The current mid-$90,000s resistance appears strong due to multiple fundamental and technical factors aligning. What happens if Bitcoin breaks through resistance? A clean break above resistance with strong volume often leads to rapid price appreciation as shorts cover and new buyers enter, potentially creating a new support level. Should I buy Bitcoin when it hits resistance? Conservative traders typically wait for a confirmed break above resistance, while aggressive traders might scale in positions, understanding the risk of rejection at these levels. How does institutional demand affect Bitcoin resistance? Strong institutional buying can overwhelm resistance, while weak demand makes resistance levels harder to break, as we’re currently seeing with spot ETF flows. What support levels exist if Bitcoin fails to break resistance? QCP Capital identifies $80,000-$82,000 as key support, with additional levels around $75,000 and $70,000 providing stronger foundations if needed. Found this analysis helpful?

Oh Kyung-seok, CEO of Dunamu, which operates Upbit, said the platform moved quickly to halt activity once it detected abnormal withdrawals. “Upbit immediately suspended deposit/withdrawal services and conducted a comprehensive inspection, prioritizing the protection of member assets,” he said in a notice to users. It lands almost exactly six years after Upbit suffered another major breach. On the same date in 2019, the exchange lost 342,000 ETH, then worth about $41.5m, in a theft that South Korea later attributed to North Korean hackers . Authorities say the stolen Ether, now valued at more than $1b, remains one of the largest crypto heists linked to North Korea.

WE WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT THIS WILL NOT AFFECT MEMBER ASSETS"" SOURCE: https://t.co/LaGePSDOj4 pic.twitter.com/JRQzOFX2ot — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) November 27, 2025 Solana Tokens Moved To Unknown Wallet In Early-Morning Breach The exchange confirmed that around 4:42am on Nov. 27, a basket of Solana ecosystem assets, including SOL, USDC and a range of smaller tokens, was transferred to an unspecified external wallet. Upbit described the incident as “abnormal withdrawal activity” tied to the Solana network. According to the statement, Upbit has identified the full scale of the outflow and will absorb the loss itself. “We immediately identified the extent of the digital asset outflow caused by the abnormal withdrawals and will cover the entire amount with Upbit assets to ensure no damage to members’ assets,” Oh said. The company moved quickly to lock down its infrastructure. It shifted all assets to secure cold wallets to prevent further unauthorized transfers, and launched an emergency security review of the affected network and wallet systems. Deposit And Withdrawal Services To Resume After Systemwide Checks Upbit also started on-chain response measures. It said it is working to freeze the compromised funds where possible and has already frozen around 12 billion won worth of Solaire tokens. The exchange added that it is continuing to track the remaining assets and is coordinating with relevant projects and institutions to implement additional freezes. As the situation escalates, regulators and law enforcement are expected to be drawn in next. Further, the exchange is preparing to cooperate with investigative authorities as it pursues attempts to freeze and recover funds linked to the incident. At the same time, the security sweep may not be limited to Solana alone. Upbit said it is conducting a “comprehensive review of the stability and security of the entire digital asset deposit/withdrawal system, not just the Solana network,” and will resume deposits and withdrawals in stages once it is satisfied with the results. Throughout the notice, the company stressed that customer balances will not be touched. “To prevent any damage to member assets, the entire amount will be covered by Upbit’s holdings. We would like to reiterate that this will not affect member assets,” the exchange said. Finally, Upbit asked users to report any suspicious or verifiable information related to the withdrawals to its customer service team and repeated its apology for the disruption. Multibillion Dollar Deal Positions Upbit For Public Market Ambitions The attack comes at a sensitive moment for the company. Upbit is moving closer to a potential listing on Nasdaq after reports that Korean internet giant Naver is preparing to acquire its parent company, Dunamu, through a multibillion-dollar stock swap merger. The deal, which was expected to go before both companies’ boards on Nov. 26, would mark one of the largest corporate consolidations in Asia’s digital finance sector and could shape Upbit’s path toward a public-market debut.

Yat Siu emphasizes that altcoins collectively offer greater growth potential than Bitcoin alone. The upcoming IPO positions Animoca Brands to leverage its industry connections and expertise. This creates exceptional altcoin investment opportunities for shareholders who want diversified crypto exposure. Animoca’s strategy focuses on accessing promising projects before they become widely available. The company’s established presence in blockchain gaming provides insider access to innovative tokens.

Consider these key benefits for investors: Early access to promising blockchain projects Diversified exposure across multiple altcoins Professional vetting of emerging opportunities Favorable pricing through institutional relationships What Makes Altcoins Different From Bitcoin?

Animoca Brands recognizes that different blockchain ecosystems serve unique purposes. From gaming tokens to DeFi protocols, each category presents distinct altcoin investment opportunities. The company’s expertise in identifying promising projects gives shareholders a significant advantage. How Can Investors Prepare For These Opportunities? Understanding the altcoin landscape becomes crucial as Animoca Brands moves toward its IPO. Investors should research blockchain sectors that align with their investment goals. The company’s focus on gaming and metaverse projects represents just one segment of available altcoin investment opportunities. Successful investing in this space requires: Monitoring emerging blockchain trends Understanding token economics Diversifying across multiple projects Staying informed about market developments What Does This Mean For Crypto Market Growth?

54969898,634875,1764219622,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54969898.jpeg,DeFi Could Capture 50% Of The World With Better Regulation: Chainlink Co-Founder,https://bitcoinist.com/defi-could-capture-50-of-the-world-with-better-regulation-chainlink-co-founder/,"Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov says DeFi, or decentralized finance, is closer to the mainstream than many realize, but real hurdles remain before it can scale to match traditional finance. According to Nazarov, DeFi is about 30% of the way to broad adoption, and clearer rules could push that figure higher. Reports have disclosed the sector has already seen rapid growth in lending protocols this year, with cumulative total value locked rising from $53 billion at the start of 2025 to more than $127 billion. Nazarov Sees Progress, But Gaps Remain Nazarov said that DeFi could hit 50% global adoption once regulation and law explain why these systems can be trusted. That is a big if. Regulators still wrestle with questions about onchain features, the role of intermediaries, and how to apply long-standing rules like KYC and AML to permissionless systems. Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov has raised similar doubts, pointing to legal uncertainty, liquidity questions, and security risks in smart contracts. Michael Selig, chief counsel for the crypto task force at the SEC, urged a focus on the technical details of onchain apps rather than just the buzzword DeFi. Regulation In The US Could Trigger Others Nazarov argues that clarity will likely start in the US and then influence other countries because many governments want compatibility with US finance. According to analysts, that domino effect is the optimistic scenario. If US rules create a clear path for banks, funds, and custodians to place client capital into decentralized systems, institutional flows could accelerate. Nazarov predicts that adoption could reach 70% when institutions have efficient means to move client money into DeFi. He added that full parity—where pie charts show comparable shares of institutional capital in DeFi and TradFi—might be visible by 2030. Institutional Money Is Arriving There are early signs that institutions are testing these waters. Stablecoins and tokenized assets have grown in prominence, and DeFi lending protocols are showing strong gains, up 72% year-to-date according to Binance Research. That growth is helping build a capital base that proponents say will make comparisons with traditional markets more plausible. Still, mainstream use by pension funds, insurers, and global banks requires stronger custody solutions, clearer legal frameworks, and better safeguards against exploits. What To Watch Next For markets, the key indicators will be regulatory rulings in major jurisdictions and measurable inflows from institutional treasuries. For users, what matters most are security, transparency, and a clear chain of accountability when things go wrong. Nazarov’s forecasts are bold. They reflect a belief among some founders that momentum plus rules will push DeFi from niche to normal. Whether that belief becomes reality will hinge on actions taken by regulators, the pace at which institutions adopt tokenized strategies, and whether networks can prove they are safe at scale.

Related Reading: Fear Surges, But Real XRP Holders Aren’t Shaken—Analyst Muted Debut On NYSE Arca Reports have disclosed that the debut fell well short of some public forecasts. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had suggested the fund might see roughly $10–12 million in opening-day volume, a target that the actual figures did not meet. That gap has drawn quick commentary from traders and analysts, who say the launch exposure was smaller than expected for a high-profile first spot product. Grayscale’s paperwork shows the ETF began life with holdings of about 11 million DOGE and roughly 94,700 shares outstanding, with assets under management reported at roughly $1.7 million at the time the fund started trading. The sponsor set a management fee of 0.35%, but that charge is being waived — the fund will carry a 0% expense ratio either until it reaches $1 billion in assets or for the first three months, whichever happens first. $GDOG (first Doge ETF) saw $1.4m volume on Day One.. solid for an avg launch but low for a ‘first-ever spot’ product. Not too surprising tho, we actually made a rhyme a while ago predicting this: ‘The further away you get from BTC, the less asset there will be.’ pic.twitter.com/ermlOcID1J — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 25, 2025 Market Shifts To Other Altcoins Based on reports from market trackers, other recent altcoin ETFs saw stronger early demand, leaving GDOG’s debut looking muted by comparison. Some XRP and Solana vehicles drew faster inflows during their openings, and that contrast has been used to explain why meme-coin exposure did not attract as much fresh cash on day one. Traders say that where money goes now may reflect a preference for certain tokens over meme-style names in regulated wrappers. What Investors Are Watching Next Observers note a few things to watch: whether the fee waiver helps the fund gather assets in the coming weeks, how DOGE’s market price behaves as more products list, and whether competing Dogecoin ETFs — including a product from Bitwise — change the flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word Some analysts are watching short term creation and redemption activity and the order books around the ETF to judge real demand versus headline interest. Dogecoin’s spot market showed mild movement after the listing, trading near $0.15 as the ETF opened. That price action suggests traders reacted but did not rush in, and it leaves the question of long-term institutional appetite open. Based on the data so far, GDOG’s quiet first day is a clear signal that listing alone does not guarantee big capital flows. The next few weeks — when the fee waiver is still active and competing listings arrive — will be key to see whether the fund can widen its reach or remain a subdued debut in a busy ETF calendar.

The move aligns with similar efforts in the UK and Australia, and reflects a global trend toward regulating youth access to digital platforms. The resolution passed with strong support The resolution was approved on Wednesday by the European Parliament and had 483 votes in favor, 92 against, and 86 abstentions, highlighting the confluence of opinions on the subject. The non-binding resolution calls for a default minimum age of 16 to access social media and AI chatbots to ensure “age-appropriate online engagement”. Online platforms, which are regulated under the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA), are required to comply with national laws, so every country has the right to decide on minimum age requirements. A statement published on the European Parliament’s website claims lawmakers support age 16 as the minimum age required to access social media, video-sharing platforms, and AI companions. However, 13- to 16-year-olds can still access it with parental consent. They also demanded a harmonized European digital age limit of 13, under which no minor could access social media platforms, video-sharing services, and AI companions. For now, the resolution is non-binding, legally or otherwise, and is being treated as a political statement expressing Parliament’s position on the issue. For it to be binding in any way, legislation would require formal proposals from the European Commission, as well as negotiations between EU member states and Parliament in a process that could take years to finalize. The resolution also comes with measures like a ban on addictive features designed to keep children hooked to screens, manipulative advertising, and gambling-like elements. Websites and apps that refuse to follow the mandate can expect to be outrightly blocked. Countries are banning social media for minors Minors getting exploited on social media has been one of the most unpleasant effects of social media. However, some countries have taken a stand and are working on measures that will protect minors, like the EU’s recent proposal. Recent reports now claim some countries, including Malaysia and Australia, are moving at a faster pace as they move to protect their minors on social media. According to an announcement made on Sunday, November 23, by Fahmi Fadzil, Malaysia’s communications minister, as part of an effort to protect kids from online harm such as cyberbullying and sexual abuse, Malaysia will ban people 16 years and younger from using social media in 2026. “I believe that if the government, regulatory bodies, and parents all play their roles, we can ensure that the Internet in Malaysia is not only fast, widespread and affordable but most importantly, safe, especially for children and families,” Fadzil said . He also claims digital platforms are required to institute customer identity verification by next year. “We hope by next year that social media platforms will comply with the government’s decision to bar those under the age of 16 from opening user accounts,” Fadzil said, according to Reuters and The Star. The minister has also said that his government will keep an eye on Australia’s implementation of a similar age limit for social media users, which is expected to start this December. “Other countries may have their own approaches, and we will study them,” he said. In Australia, the legislation to regulate minors interacting with social media will be introduced in Parliament during its last two weeks in session this year, which began on November 18. However, the age limit will not come into effect until 12 months after the law is passed, and it will be reviewed following its commencement. “This one’s for the mums and dads,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as he announced the legislation. “Social media is doing harm to our kids. And I’m calling time on it. I’ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties, and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. And I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back. I want parents to be able to say, ‘Sorry mate, that’s against the law for me to get you to do this.’ “ The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

DOGE is now consolidating and might correct lower to $0.1480. DOGE price started a fresh increase above $0.1450 and $0.150. The price is trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1490 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1480. Dogecoin Price Holds Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1420, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.150 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.1550. A high was formed at $0.1565 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1490 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1565 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.160 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1620 level. A close above the $0.1620 resistance might send the price toward $0.1685. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.1740. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.180. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1565 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1510 level. The next major support is near the $0.1480 level and the trend line. The main support sits at $0.1450 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.1450 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1380 level or even $0.1330 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.

His remarks arrived during a period of active trading, rising institutional interest, and closer monitoring of exchange data. The remarks also prompt a closer look at how quickly new spot ETF products may impact available liquidity. Rising OTC Demand Sets the Stage Claver described a sharp drawdown in off-exchange supply during the first week of ETF activity. This follows a prolonged trend of shrinking supply on exchanges . He said his original estimate suggested between 1 and 2 billion XRP sat in OTC and dark pool channels before the recent wave of purchases.

He argued that this level of consumption leaves only a limited amount of accessible supply outside public exchanges. His assessment places concentrated pressure on sources that large buyers often use to avoid market disruption. He noted that this volume may represent “either half or almost all” of the available OTC and dark pool reserves. The speed of that drawdown frames the next phase of ETF development , which he expects to arrive soon. Expectation of Additional Filings Claver said new spot XRP ETF products remain likely. He also said the market has not yet seen what he called the “big dogs at the table.” The market is still in its early stages , and he listed BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity as firms that he expects to file their own products. He then said, “I think they’re all coming to the table in the very near future.” His view places the potential ETF count for XRP ahead of Bitcoin if those firms proceed. The possibility of new filings adds weight to his focus on supply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He argued that buyers will face a different environment once OTC and dark pool channels exhaust remaining reserves. His remarks rely on the idea that future ETF issuers will need to source XRP directly from exchanges if off-exchange supply tightens. Exchange Activity Shows Early Signals Claver pointed to a recent XRP high of $91 on Kraken . He believes that this offered a glimmer of what could happen when ETFs move from OTC channels to public exchanges. He argued that buyers will shift to open markets once the remaining OTC supply disappears. He added that observers may feel surprised if his views materialize, noting that his outlook aligns with what he has discussed for the past 18 months.

The South Korean won leads the charge with impressive gains following the Bank of Korea’s decision to maintain current interest rates, creating unprecedented opportunities for forex traders and investors seeking exposure to emerging market assets. Why Are Asian Currencies Rallying Against the Dollar? The current forex market dynamics reveal a dramatic shift in sentiment. Recent economic data from the United States has fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve may implement rate cuts sooner than anticipated. This development has triggered a domino effect across global currency markets, with Asian currencies positioned as primary beneficiaries. The weakening US dollar has created ideal conditions for regional currencies to appreciate, offering traders substantial profit potential. Federal Reserve Rate Cut Expectations: The Game Changer Market participants are closely monitoring every signal from Federal Reserve officials. The growing consensus around potential Fed rate cuts has fundamentally altered currency valuation models. Consider these critical factors driving the current trend: Softer inflation data reducing pressure on Fed to maintain restrictive policy Slowing economic growth indicators suggesting need for stimulus Changing composition of FOMC voting members in 2024 Global central bank policy divergence creating arbitrage opportunities Bank of Korea Holds Steady: Strategic Masterstroke The Bank of Korea maintained its benchmark interest rate at 3.5%, a decision that immediately propelled the South Korean won to significant gains. This strategic pause reflects careful calibration of domestic economic needs against global monetary policy trends. The central bank’s decision demonstrates confidence in controlling inflation while supporting economic growth, sending a strong bullish signal to currency markets. Currency Gain Against USD Key Driver South Korean Won +1.8% BoK Rate Hold Japanese Yen +0.9% Carry Trade Unwinding Chinese Yuan +0.7% PBOC Support Measures Indian Rupee +0.6% Strong FDI Inflows Monetary Policy Divergence Creates Forex Opportunities The current environment highlights significant monetary policy divergence between major central banks. While the Fed signals potential easing, Asian central banks are maintaining or considering their own policy adjustments. This creates compelling trading setups: Carry trade strategies becoming increasingly attractive Currency pair volatility offering enhanced profit potential Hedging opportunities for multinational corporations Portfolio diversification benefits for international investors Actionable Trading Insights for Forex Participants Successful navigation of current market conditions requires strategic positioning. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor Fed speaker comments for policy direction clues Track Asian economic data releases for local currency strength indicators Implement proper risk management given increased volatility Consider correlated asset movements for confirmation signals Frequently Asked Questions How long will this Asian currency rally last? The duration depends on Fed policy confirmation and regional economic performance. Current momentum suggests sustained strength through the next quarter. Which Asian currency offers the best risk-reward profile? The South Korean won demonstrates strong fundamentals combined with technical breakout patterns, making it particularly attractive. How does this affect cryptocurrency markets? Weaker dollar conditions typically benefit risk assets including cryptocurrencies, though correlation patterns remain dynamic. What are the key risk factors? Unexpected Fed policy shifts, geopolitical tensions, and sudden risk aversion could reverse current trends. Which companies benefit most from Asian currency strength? Multinational corporations with significant Asian revenue exposure like Samsung , Toyota , and TSMC typically benefit from local currency appreciation. Conclusion: Seizing the Momentum The convergence of Fed dovish signals and Asian central bank stability has created a perfect storm for currency appreciation. The impressive rally in Asian currencies , led by the South Korean won’s surge post- Bank of Korea decision, demonstrates the power of coordinated monetary policy movements. As Fed rate cut expectations continue to reshape the global forex market , strategic positioning in Asian currency pairs offers substantial potential for informed traders and investors. The current alignment of fundamental and technical factors suggests this trend has room to run, making timely action crucial for capitalizing on these exceptional market conditions.

Tether rejected the assessment as misleading, and explained that most of its reserves are in low-risk US Treasurys. At the same time, new data from Glassnode shows a strong inverse correlation between Bitcoin’s price and USDt exchange flows, with large USDT outflows historically aligning with BTC peaks and profit-taking phases. S&P Drops Hammer on Tether’s USDt S&P Global Ratings downgraded Tether’s USDt to the lowest rating on its stablecoin stability scale, which raises concerns about the token’s ability to consistently maintain its one-to-one peg with the US dollar. The agency pointed to what it considers an elevated level of “higher-risk” assets in Tether’s reserves, including Bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate debt instruments. S&P rating given to USDt According to S&P, Bitcoin alone accounts for 5.6% of all USDt in circulation, This allocation exceeds the 3.9% buffer implied by Tether’s reported 103.9% collateralization ratio. Because these assets are more volatile than cash or Treasurys, a sharp downturn could potentially weaken collateral coverage. Breakdown of reserves (Source: S&P Global ) S&P also mentioned regulatory leniency as a factor behind the downgrade. Tether is headquartered in El Salvador and supervised by the country’s National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD), which has far looser requirements for reserve composition compared to major financial jurisdictions. The ratings agency pointed to the ongoing absence of full audits or detailed, independently verified proof-of-reserve disclosures as another core weakness. Despite the negative rating, S&P acknowledged that roughly 75% of USDt’s backing consists of US Treasurys and short-term instruments viewed as low-risk. Tether disputes the downgrade, and called the report “misleading” by arguing that it ignores key data about the token’s long track record and widespread adoption. In a statement , the company explained that S&P’s analysis fails to account for the scale and macroeconomic importance of digitally native money. CEO Paolo Ardoino criticized traditional ratings frameworks, and argued that legacy methodologies have historically misjudged risk by giving investment-grade ratings to institutions that later collapsed. The downgrade comes during a transformative year for the stablecoin industry, remembered for new US regulations, growing political interest, and a sector-wide market cap that surged past $300 billion. Meanwhile, Tether’s expanding global footprint is also turning heads. The company is now the 17th-largest holder of US Treasurys, with more than $112 billion in short-term government securities, placing it ahead of countries like South Korea and Germany. Tether also amassed 116 tons of gold , a reserve size comparable to those maintained by several central banks. Glassnode Reveals BTC–USDt Split Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode also identified a sharp inverse relationship between Bitcoin’s price movements and the flow of USDt to and from exchanges. In an analysis that was shared on Wednesday, Glassnode compared Bitcoin’s price action with USDT exchange net flows dating back to December 2023. The data shows that periods of rising Bitcoin prices almost always align with net outflows of USDt from exchanges, This means that traders are pulling stablecoins off platforms to take profits or hold on-chain. Glassnode explained that during highly optimistic market phases, USDT outflows typically spike between $100 million and $200 million per day. This trend intensified in October, when Bitcoin briefly hit a peak of $126,000, pushing 30-day average USDT net outflows above $220 million — a level Glassnode described as a clear profit-taking signal. The analytics firm said these outflows have since cooled, which indicates that traders appear to be re-accumulating dry powder for potential new market moves. A separate analysis by Whale Alert earlier this year also revealed a recurring pattern: Tether tends to mint new USDt during Bitcoin bull phases and burn tokens during downturns. Bitcoin and USDt are the world’s first- and third-largest cryptocurrencies, with market caps of roughly $1.8 trillion and $184 billion. The regulatory environment in the United States is also shaping the dynamics between Bitcoin, stablecoins, and institutional participation. In July, the US government passed the GENIUS Act, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed USDt will comply with the new law but later announced plans for an additional stablecoin, USAT, that is designed specifically to meet GENIUS requirements. Meanwhile, US federal and state authorities have shown interest in accumulating Bitcoin for strategic purposes. President Donald Trump even signed an executive order in March calling for the creation of a national digital asset reserve, though reports indicate the government has yet to fully implement the plan.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-27 05:30:00

He pointed out that both messaging platforms are advancing features like open account creation, along with improved metadata privacy. He noted, “Session app and SimpleX Chat are two messaging apps pushing these directions forward. For this reason, I’ve donated 128 ETH to each.“ Apps like SimpleX and Session have gained prominence because they step outside standard end-to-end encryption to address “metadata privacy,” including who you interact with, when, and how often. SimpleX, for example, operates on one-way messaging queues with no global identifiers, while Session uses a decentralized network of service nodes, rather than a single server. This makes them attractive to security-conscious users and aligns with Vitalik’s long-standing advocacy for decentralization. Vitalik agrees that the messaging apps are not yet perfect Still, Vitalik stated that the messaging apps aren’t flawless and they have some distance to cover before they reach top-tier usability and security. Real metadata protection depends on decentralisation, which isn’t easy, and the demand for multi-device access only raises the difficulty. He added, “Sybil / DoS resistance, both in the message routing network and on the user side (without forcing phone number dependence), adds further difficulty. These problems need more eyes on them.” A user on X pointed out that the 128 ETH donation is very on-brand for Vitalik. He noted that although it’s not a convenient number for humans, it’s perfect in binary terms—almost like he’s saying this is a structural privacy investment, not performative giving. Other users also appreciated Vitalik’s contribution to metadata privacy and permissionless onboarding. A user explained , “Huge respect for supporting the parts of private messaging most people ignore. Encryption is easy; metadata privacy and permissionless onboarding are the real boss fight. Session & SimpleX are far from perfect, but they’re tackling the hardest problems in the stack.” The Signal app has already begun rolling out secure backups on iOS, allowing users to save their chats and restore them if their phone is lost or damaged. Android users got secure backups in September, with messages and media encrypted end-to-end. Each backup requires a 64-character key from your device, which Signal cannot recover if misplaced. However, according to Forbes, the app has been a target for hackers. ThreatFabric researchers confirmed a new, particularly aggressive banking trojan on Android that surpasses standard malware. The malware, which is still in development, can bypass encrypted messaging. So far, the hackers haven’t broken the encryption yet. Rather, they’ve built a complicated method that simply captures messages after you’ve decrypted them on your screen. State-affiliated actors and cyber mercenaries are abusing commercial spyware to infiltrate Signal and WhatsApp accounts, hijack devices, and quietly monitor key users. Vitalik says Ethereum will move to targeted, goal-driven optimisation next year Vitalik has lately also shared new thoughts on ETH, noting that Ethereum’s growth in the coming year will involve “more selective scaling.” He indicated that Ethereum will transition from broad-ranging scaling to targeted, goal-driven optimisation in the next phase. He explained that Ethereum’s expansion will continue overall, but different areas will scale at varying rates. One idea he floated was increasing the block gas limit fivefold and matching that with higher gas costs for low-efficiency transactions. The idea is to strengthen the network’s ability to scale and encourage better optimisation of its resources. Vitalik explained further that the proposal covers SSTORE when opening new storage slots, as well as several other SSTORE-related actions, precompiles other than elliptic-curve ones, large-contract calls, complex arithmetic operations, and calldata.

This technical development has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, with experts divided on what lies ahead for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. What Exactly is the Bitcoin Death Cross? A Bitcoin death cross occurs when the 200-day moving average drops below the 50-day moving average, signaling potential long-term bearish momentum. This technical pattern has historically preceded significant market downturns, making it a crucial indicator that traders and investors monitor closely. The current formation has sparked widespread discussion about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Bear Market Declarations: Why Some Experts Are Concerned Several prominent analysts are sounding alarm bells following this technical development. Crypto₿irb, with 700,000 followers on X, states unequivocally that the bull market has ended from a technical perspective. The analyst points to three key factors: Trend reversal in the 200-day moving average Surge in trading volume during price drops Above-average market volatility patterns Similarly, 10x Research analyst Markus Thielen confirms that Bitcoin is currently in a bear market, though he notes the possibility of temporary reversal rallies. Counterarguments: Why Some Experts Urge Caution Not all market observers are convinced that the Bitcoin death cross signals a prolonged downturn. Henrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Capital, argues that while buying pressure from digital asset treasuries has diminished, it’s premature to definitively declare a bear market. Analyst Skew offers a conditional outlook, suggesting that price movement from current levels will provide clearer signals about market direction. Key Levels to Watch in Bitcoin Price Action Technical analysts emphasize several critical price levels that could determine Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. The $88,000 level emerges as particularly significant, with a drop below this threshold potentially indicating a failed rebound. Conversely, sustained movement above this level could signal renewed upward momentum. Market participants should monitor these key technical levels closely. Historical Context of Bitcoin Death Cross Patterns Previous Bitcoin death cross formations provide valuable context for current market conditions. Historically, this pattern has sometimes preceded temporary corrections rather than extended bear markets. However, the combination of current technical factors makes this particular formation especially noteworthy for traders and long-term investors alike. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the current market uncertainty, investors should consider several strategic approaches: Diversify cryptocurrency holdings across different assets Implement disciplined risk management strategies Monitor key technical levels for entry and exit points Maintain a long-term perspective amid short-term volatility Conclusion: Navigating Market Uncertainty The Bitcoin death cross has undoubtedly created market uncertainty, but it also presents opportunities for informed investors. While technical indicators suggest caution, market conditions remain fluid. Successful navigation of this period requires careful analysis, risk management, and attention to both technical and fundamental factors. The coming weeks will likely provide clearer direction for Bitcoin’s medium-term trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin death cross? A Bitcoin death cross is a technical chart pattern that occurs when the 200-day moving average crosses below the 50-day moving average, typically indicating potential bearish momentum. How reliable is the death cross indicator? While historically significant, the death cross should be considered alongside other technical indicators and market fundamentals rather than in isolation. Should I sell my Bitcoin because of the death cross? Investment decisions should be based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall portfolio strategy rather than any single technical indicator. How long do bear markets typically last in cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency bear markets can vary significantly in duration, ranging from several months to over a year, depending on market conditions and external factors. What other indicators should I watch alongside the death cross? Important complementary indicators include trading volume, relative strength index (RSI), support and resistance levels, and broader market sentiment. Can the death cross signal be false? Yes, like all technical indicators, the death cross can produce false signals, which is why confirmation from other indicators is crucial. Found this analysis helpful?

54972837,635003,1764223212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54972837.jpeg,JPMorgan Launches Bitcoin Structured Note Offering 1.5x Returns With BlackRock’s IBIT,https://bitcoinist.com/jpmorgan-launches-bitcoin-structured-note/,"JPMorgan unveiled a new financial product—a leveraged structured note linked directly to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This announcement comes after intense scrutiny of the bank for allegedly targeting Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin proxy firm headed by Michael Saylor. New IBIT-Linked Notes From JPMorgan According to the bank’s filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), this structured note is strategically aligned with Bitcoin’s four-year Halving cycle, setting a maturity date for 2028. Investors who purchase these IBIT-linked notes can potentially realize returns through an auto-call process that activates after one year, or upon reaching the final maturity date in 2028, which coincides with the next Bitcoin Halving . Key features of this product include a guaranteed minimum fixed return of 16% if the IBIT exceeds certain price levels after a year. However, there is principal protection against declines of up to 30% in IBIT’s value, alongside capped maximum returns to maintain an appropriate risk-reward profile . Notably, if IBIT falls more than 30% from its initial levels, loss exposure is triggered. This product launch reflects a renewed perspective on Bitcoin and digital assets from JPMorgan, despite CEO Jamie Dimon’s consistent skepticism regarding the cryptocurrency. Earlier in the week, the bank commented on the nature of crypto, suggesting it is shifting away from a venture capital-like ecosystem towards a more tradable macro asset class, supported by institutional liquidity rather than merely retail speculation. One analyst suggested that Bitcoin could reach $240,000 over the long term. Expert Warns Of Risks In The Bank’s New Bitcoin Offering Market expert Simon Dixon took to social media to express concerns about JPMorgan’s new offering, criticizing the product as a complex, asymmetric bet that allows JPMorgan to benefit while exposing individual investors to significant risks. According to Dixon, if Bitcoin were to drop by 40%, individual investors would bear the consequences, while the bank retains the benefits of liquidity and fees, positioning itself favorably in the market. Amid these developments, reports from NewsBTC indicated that the bank had cautioned that Strategy might be removed from major equity indices, specifically the MSCI USA Index. Analysts at JPMorgan noted that the challenges facing Strategy extend beyond recent declines in cryptocurrency prices, which have seen Bitcoin fall over 30% from its all-time highs. If the anticipated MSCI decision takes place by January 15, it could trigger passive outflows estimated between $2.8 billion and $8.8 billion. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $87,247. It has been consolidating between this level and $85,000 for the past few days, following the latest correction that saw the cryptocurrency retrace all the way down to $80,000 last Friday.

Momentum has slowed, volatility is tightening, and attention is now locked on one key level that could determine whether BTC stages a recovery or slips further into the trap below $82,000. Key Resistance at $89,000 Remains Bitcoin’s Biggest Hurdle Analyst Lennaert Snyder highlighted in a recent update that BTC is currently locked in a critical fight for the key $89,000 resistance level. He acknowledged the recent price action, noting that Bitcoin had a “nice bounce” from the support box he posted yesterday, advising those who longed for the bottom to “enjoy the gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sudden Volatility Jump Signals Options Could Be Calling The Shots—Analyst Snyder confirmed that the $86,000 support box is still valid, but stressed that this level should now only be used for reversals. A return to this support would be interpreted as a weak sign, indicating that buyers are struggling to maintain the current altitude. The primary objective remains to break the immediate overhead barrier. Lennaert Snyder states that Bitcoin still needs to decisively reclaim the $89,000 resistance to trigger a meaningful rally and long entries to the next target at $93,000. Given the ongoing struggle at resistance, the analyst confirms that it is “totally understandable” if traders are looking for local short entries. Losing the crucial $86,000 support level would confirm a structural breakdown, triggering shorts to the next major target at the $82,200 rangelow. Finally, Lennaert Snyder warned about the potential for a deeper move, stating that if the market goes for the lows again, it should be treated as a reversal opportunity only. He notes a high probability that sellers will sweep the $80,600 low to “tank new fuel.” Smart Risk First: Analyst Stresses Discipline Over Aggression According to crypto expert and investor Ted Pillows, the current Bitcoin setup is a moment that demands strict risk management. He emphasized that BTC continues to face heavy rejection around the $88,000 resistance level, making this zone a decisive barrier for further upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Loses Strength, Traders Watch $90K as Last Line of Defense In response to the ongoing uncertainty, Ted noted that he has manually taken partial profits across all open trades. The move is meant to reduce exposure and protect capital until Bitcoin provides a clearer directional signal. With volatility tightening, he believes caution is the smarter play. Ted added that he intends to scale back into his positions only after Bitcoin successfully flips the resistance level into support and holds above the S/R zone.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is eager to build an institution-led digital finance ecosystem that distances itself from the volatility of the crypto market. It is preparing to issue tokenized government bills settled in wholesale CBDC next year in a move MAS said could help its digital market reach “lift off” after years of experimenting with tokenization. Dr Cheryl Wang from the Global Fintech Institute said Singapore is deliberately shifting its narrative away from its early open-door approach. “Singapore is attracting large financial institutions and serious Web3 and cryptocurrency firms, but not the smaller, highly speculative retail trading platforms it once did,” she said. “The ‘everyone-can-try-crypto’ era in Singapore has ended.” The scars from crypto collapses Singapore has been jolted by a string of global crypto-related failures, which have reshaped its regulatory position. Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings, suffered a $275 million loss in 2022 after the collapse of FTX, which was a blow to the city’s efforts to cultivate a regulated crypto hub. The damage coincided with the failure of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which invested in Luna tokens before its crash the same year. The hedge fund lost roughly $8 billion in client assets and deepened scrutiny of the sector. In 2022, then-managing director of MAS Ravi Menon labelled cryptocurrency “highly hazardous” and emphasized that MAS does not want Singapore to be a speculative crypto hub. Dr Wang said Singapore is now recasting itself as a steward of the industry. “In the last five years, Singapore has moved away from being an important stop for crypto testing. It now focuses on back-end systems, common rules, infrastructure, and building trust,” she said. Common standards for cross-border settlement Singapore is pushing for global coordination to build the infrastructure needed for tokenization. At Singapore Fintech Week 2025, MAS Deputy Managing Director Sing Chiong Leong said the digital asset ecosystem will only scale if financial networks operate like global aviation, which relies on standardized protocol, interoperable systems, and trust. “If you think of global aviation, planes can fly anywhere in the world because everyone follows the same standards…We need the same approach for cross border digital money and tokenized asset settlement.” He said this ecosystem would not “emerge by chance,” and requires “hard work, and heavy lifting” from public and private collaboration. MAS has warned that institutional risk creates fragmented “sub-scale walled gardens” unless common standards are adopted. Innovation in “trusted” tokenization Singapore is running one of the world’s most ambitious experiments in tokenization. It is in the process of turning traditional financial assets, such as government bonds or bank deposits into digital tokens that can move instantly on blockchain networks. Singapore is building its future financial system in layers, with the SGD Testnet serving as the glue that ties the government’s different tokenization pilots together. The SGD Testnet is the common blockchain network testing tokenized bonds settlements, money market funds and FX trades under Project Guardian, while also supporting digital Singapore dollar experiments under Project Orchid. Professor of Finance Ben Charoenwong from Insead business school explains that tokenization in Singapore is rooted in “trusted tokenization” – a version of blockchain where banks and regulators play a leading role. “Regulators understand that fully decentralized ‘trustless’ systems cannot meet basic anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements,” he said. “Turing complete blockchains simply can’t comply with the law.” A “turing complete blockchain” is a powerful smart contract system that can run any computable program, but regulators can’t guarantee that every path the code takes is compliant with the law. He said tokenization sandboxes focus on permissioned versions and testing whether they can still deliver efficiency gains once they are built in real-world governance, verified reserves, and proper oversight. The most recent project, BLOOM, which launched in October, is expanding payment options beyond CBDC to include stablecoins, tokenized bank deposits, and wholesale payments to enable faster, safer, and more efficient cross-border payments. Singapore is preparing to introduce stablecoin legislation next year, which will mandate high-quality liquid assets and redemption reliability. But Stablecoins are not Singapore’s top priority. MAS is placing much more strategic emphasis on wholesale CBDCs and tokenized deposits. Professor Charoenwong warns that the real risks lie in systemic contagion from stablecoins. “The real threat is not innovation,” he said. “It’s the spread of poorly regulated foreign stablecoins that can destabilize even well supervised markets.” Expanding partnerships with banks Singapore has struck new deals with a number of banks to test digital asset settlement across borders. On November 13, MAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Deutsche Bundesbank to develop common standards. It has also announced experiments with the Bank of England and the Bank of Thailand for real-time FX using interoperable systems. Singapore’s stock exchange is also preparing to launch exchange-cleared Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures for institutional investors, part of an effort to shift crypto exposure into regulated market infrastructure. Meanwhile, Swiss Investment bank UBS and Singapore-based digital payments company, Ant International, are testing tokenized bank deposits and real-time cross-border liquidity flows as a part of the MAS-led tokenization sandbox Project Guardian. Wealth management firms in Singapore are also reporting rising demand for tokenized gold, tokenized treasuries, and blockchain fund structures, describing tokenization as a structural upgrade that increases capital efficiency. As Dr Cheryl Wang from the Global Fintech Institute said, the coming era of tokenized finance and round-the-clock AI trading will test not just the resilience of new systems, but the values that underlie them. The challenge, she said, is to remember the underlying mission that drives digital finance. She said “responsible innovation” will broaden inclusion, improve cross border payments, and ultimately enhance human welfare. “Technology should empower people. It should never replace them.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Regulation|digital assets|MAS|Singapore|Stablecoins|tokenization,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-27 06:00:29

His certainty pushed many users to review the chart and question the short spike. The claim added tension to the ongoing discussion. He treated the event as a brief reveal of a true value before it vanished. His tone encouraged others to voice their own views with the same level of conviction. Was the $91 a Glitch? Time Traveler’s statements have contributed to renewed focus on XRP. The post framed the Kraken spike as a real event.

In the statement, the team described the move as one of its most ambitious yet, aiming to turn the overall gaming experience within its project into a core pillar and to signal to developers that the project is ready to support Web3 games at scale. CiDi Games will help expand Pi’s use cases, accelerate developer engagement, and create new ways for Pioneers to use the native token daily. Both parties want to create lightweight, accessible games and set the stage for a more interactive, utility-driven Web3 environment by merging Pi’s vast global community with CiDi Games’ expertise. Pi Network’s team believes games are the natural next step for its ecosystem developments as they are social, interactive, and built around virtual economies. All of these elements align with Pi’s large, verified human network and growing suite of developer tools, the team claimed. The partnership also creates a powerful feedback loop: Games attract Pioneers → driving engagement, usage, and daily activity Developers build more utility → strengthening Pi’s ecosystem with transactions, innovation, and production The team emphasized that this is not the first gaming-oriented move it has made over the past year or so, as it has supported the industry through hackathons, incubation programs, prebuilt tools, and monetization layers such as the Pi Ad Network. FruityPi is among the most popular Pi-native games, which has integrated Pi payments, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ads. Strategic Investment Aside from the partnership between the two, the Core Team also highlighted the growing role of Pi Network Ventures, a recently launched $100 million investment arm supporting various Pi-native projects. By backing CiDi Games, the investment branch signals confidence in the team’s experience and long-term vision. Lastly, the announcement states that the Core Team is focused on building an ecosystem where platform tools, engagement, deeper incentives, and app innovation grow together, rather than working on single products.

According to Bloomberg-sourced reporting, Hassett has “emerged as the frontrunner” for President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Federal Reserve, seen as the candidate most aligned with Trump’s preference for lower interest rates. Earlier disclosures showed Hassett previously served as an adviser to Coinbase and holds at least $1 million in Coinbase stock. How Will Hassett Impact The Crypto Market? For crypto allocators, that combination of macro dovishness and direct exposure to a major US exchange is the core of the bull case. Bitwise senior investment strategist Juan Leon put it bluntly on X: “If Kevin Hassett becomes Fed Chair, the implications for crypto are strongly bullish.” He calls Hassett an “aggressive ‘dove’ who has publicly criticized current rates for being too high and advocated for deeper, faster cuts,” highlighting that he “served on Coinbase’s advisory board and owns large stake in COIN,” and that he “led the White House digital asset working group to shape pro-crypto regulation.” Related Reading: Crypto Has Entered Late-Cycle Territory, Says Global Liquidity Veteran But the potential Hassett regime cannot be separated from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s emerging blueprint for the Fed. Bessent has been openly questioning the post-crisis operating framework. As Walter Bloomberg relayed from his CNBC appearance, “BESSENT ON FED: ‘AMPLE RESERVES REGIME’ MIGHT BE FRAYING.” Forward Guidance host Felix Jauvin summarized the direction of travel in a post: “Bessent wants a fed chair that gets us out of balance sheet shenanigans and simplifying things to how they were pre-ample regime. Dovish FFR, hawkish balance sheet.” He added: “I don’t know if I can emphasize enough just how far away we are from any sort of QE copium.” That framing matters for crypto. A Hassett Fed that cuts the policy rate faster in downturns is one thing; a return to full-blown quantitative easing is another. A “dovish FFR, hawkish balance sheet” mix would still be a friendlier macro environment than the post-2022 tightening cycle, but it is not a guaranteed repeat of the 2020–2021 liquidity wave that lifted every risk asset simultaneously. Rate cuts without large-scale asset purchases support risk appetite and lower discount rates, yet they do not automatically recreate the extreme “everything rally” conditions that many in crypto implicitly associate with Fed dovishness. The political logic behind Hassett’s rise has been described most clearly by macro commentator EndGame Macro (@onechancefreedm). In a thread, he argues that “Hassett isn’t leading because he’s the most academic or the most central bankerish. He’s leading because he checks the boxes Trump actually cares about.” Related Reading: Latest Crypto Crash Wipes $1 Billion Off Trump Family’s Wealth Trump, he writes, wants someone he already trusts, who has “spent years defending Trump publicly,” and who has been “openly critical of the Fed for being too slow, too cautious, and too political.” In that framework, “markets hear dovish. Trump hears I can deliver growth again. And crypto folks hear one of us.” Markets are starting to agree. On Polymarket, contracts tracking the Fed chair race show Hassett around 53% at press time, reinforcing that shift from speculation to probabilistic base case. Whether that translates into a genuine “explosion” in crypto will depend less on personalities than on the interaction of three forces: how aggressively a Hassett Fed actually cuts, how far Bessent is willing to go in shrinking or simplifying the balance sheet, and how markets reassess inflation, term premia and fiscal risk under a more overtly political central bank. The odds market is signaling that crypto is moving closer to the center of US monetary power. The scale of any move in 2026 will be determined by the cycle – and by how a Hassett-led Fed balances “dovish rates” with “hawkish balance sheet” in practice. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.96 trillion.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/november-29-is-a-big-day-for-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"XRP Update (@XrpUdate) highlighted a development that adds momentum to the rapidly growing market for XRP investment products. In a recent post, he revealed that the 21Shares spot XRP ETF will begin trading on November 29. This news arrived during a period of heightened attention on institutional products linked to XRP. Traders continue to watch inflow data , competitive filings, and new listings as large issuers move quickly to secure positions in this growing market. BREAKING: The 21Shares $XRP Spot ETF (ticker: TOXR) has received official approval and is set to begin trading on, November 29. This marks another major milestone in expanding institutional access to $XRP . pic.twitter.com/9PIvvFjxgV — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) November 26, 2025 A New Entry From 21Shares The 21Shares XRP ETF will trade under the ticker “TOXR.” It will join the list of recently approved spot XRP ETFs, further expanding the market. The product holds real XRP rather than futures or swaps. This structure gives investors the means to track XRP price movements without handling digital assets. 21Shares has experience with crypto ETFs and plans to expand its lineup through this new launch. Interest in XRP ETFs has grown in recent weeks. More investors want access to XRP without using cryptocurrency exchanges. Spot ETFs give them that option. The Growing ETF Market The approval enables the company to enter a fast-growing group of issuers. Firms like Franklin Templeton , Bitwise, Canary Capital , and more have seen very successful ETF launches. These show the sector is fast-growing. The competition between issuers also offers investors more choices, encouraging a competitive market. Inflows into these funds have been strong. Investors showed interest in these vehicles because they provide access without direct interaction with the crypto market. They offer clear reporting, third-party custody, and standard trading hours. These factors open the door for new classes of investors who may not join crypto exchanges but still want exposure to the asset. Many experts also believe these products could impact XRP’s price . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What TOXR Could Mean for XRP’s Price The inflow has caught the attention of analysts. Spot ETFs add demand for real XRP because issuers must buy tokens when they create new shares. If inflows remain high, supply on exchanges can tighten. That can affect price conditions when the buying continues for long periods. The launch of TOXR adds another source of demand. Investors familiar with 21Shares may choose this product because they already use the firm’s other offerings. Strong volumes following the debut could pull more capital into XRP. Analysts will watch how the market responds when TOXR begins trading on November 29. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The move occurred in the early Asian hours, which is believed to have been transferred to Coinbase Prime for custody. SpaceX( @SpaceX ) transferred out another 1,163 $BTC ($105.23M) 2 hours ago, possibly to Coinbase Prime for custody. https://t.co/zW62EKM2RD pic.twitter.com/vrbu6tPGR4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 27, 2025 Per Arkham data , the transfer comes a month after the space exploration company sent massive amounts of Bitcoin to a new address in October. The transactions involved 1,215 BTC sent to multiple new addresses, totalling $133.7 million. SpaceX’s wallet now holds a total of 6,095 Bitcoin worth almost $553 million, post the recent transfer. According to BitcoinTreasuries , SpaceX is placed fourth among privately held companies with Bitcoin treasuries. SpaceX BTC Flow – Custody Rather Than Selling The SpaceX wallet was dormant for 3 years before resuming activity in late July 2025. The company once held as much as 25,000 BTC in 2022, but later consolidated and reduced its on-chain balance to current levels. The reason for the latest transfers remains unclear. The company has not made any comments on whether the transfer indicates a sale, internal restructuring, or enhanced security measures for its crypto holdings. However, analysts believe that the shuffle signals improved custody plans, rather than for liquidation purposes. One user wrote that big transfers from companies like SpaceX denote they’re “positioning” for something. “Could be routine custody, but it still adds a layer of uncertainty you don’t want to ignore,” the user wrote on X . Further, the only certainty so far is that both receiving wallets remain untouched, no outgoing transfers, no exchange interaction, and no liquidation trails. “When institutions like SpaceX move Bitcoin, they don’t do it impulsively,” wrote another user. “The market may need time to understand the purpose, but the signal is already there. Quiet transfers sometimes speak louder than announcements.” For months, the SpaceX wallets sat perfectly still, no transfers, no experiments, no hints of intent. Then, just six hours ago, the silence broke. Without warning, 1,163 $BTC , over $105 million, was pushed out of storage and split between two completely fresh addresses.

This unexpected transaction has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, raising questions about market timing and whale behavior patterns. The dormant Bitcoin whale activity represents one of the most significant movements we’ve seen in recent months, offering valuable insights for both novice and experienced investors. What Does This Dormant Bitcoin Whale Activity Mean? The recent transaction involving this dormant Bitcoin whale provides crucial market signals that every crypto enthusiast should understand. According to Lookonchain data, the whale had previously withdrawn 400 BTC from OKX in April 2023 when Bitcoin was trading at $28,432. This means the investor held through significant market fluctuations before deciding to sell approximately half of their position. The timing of this dormant Bitcoin whale movement suggests careful strategic planning rather than panic selling. Why Should You Care About Whale Movements? Understanding dormant Bitcoin whale activity can significantly impact your investment decisions. These large holders often possess insider knowledge or sophisticated trading strategies that retail investors might miss. When a dormant Bitcoin whale awakens after years of inactivity, it typically indicates one of several scenarios: Profit-taking after substantial gains Portfolio rebalancing strategies Anticipation of market corrections Liquidity needs for other investments How Does This Affect Bitcoin’s Market Position? The sale by this dormant Bitcoin whale comes at a crucial time for cryptocurrency markets. While $18.35 million represents a substantial amount, it’s important to note that this represents only half of the whale’s original position. The remaining 200 BTC continues to be held, suggesting the investor maintains some confidence in Bitcoin’s future performance. This partial selling strategy often indicates balanced risk management rather than complete loss of faith in the asset. What Can We Learn From This Dormant Bitcoin Whale? This particular dormant Bitcoin whale provides valuable lessons for cryptocurrency investors. The investor demonstrated remarkable patience by holding through three years of market volatility before executing this strategic sale. Their approach highlights several key investment principles: Long-term perspective pays off in cryptocurrency markets Strategic timing matters more than constant trading Partial profit-taking can balance risk and reward Monitoring whale activity provides market intelligence What’s Next for Bitcoin After This Whale Movement? Following this dormant Bitcoin whale transaction, market analysts are closely watching for similar patterns among other large holders. The fact that this whale sold only half their position suggests they might be anticipating both short-term volatility and long-term growth potential. This balanced approach often signals sophisticated market understanding that retail investors can learn from when developing their own Bitcoin investment strategies. FAQs About Dormant Bitcoin Whale Activity What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds large amounts of cryptocurrency, typically enough to influence market prices through their trading activities. Why do whales go dormant? Whales often remain dormant to avoid affecting market prices, wait for optimal selling conditions, or simply because they believe in long-term holding strategies. How can I track whale movements? You can monitor whale activity through blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Whale Alert, and various cryptocurrency tracking tools that specialize in large transaction monitoring. Should I sell when whales sell? Not necessarily. Whale movements should be considered as one factor among many in your investment decisions, alongside fundamental analysis and market conditions. What does partial selling by whales indicate? Partial selling often suggests profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing rather than complete loss of confidence in the asset. How often do dormant whales become active? There’s no fixed pattern, but dormant periods can last from months to several years depending on market conditions and individual investment strategies.

Analysts caution that such a practice might drive prices down in the next few days. According to CryptoQuant, the highest inflows of exchanges were 9,000 BTC on November 21. On Coinbase, the cryptocurrency fell to $80,600 on the same day. This marked a seven-month low for the digital asset. Rising exchange deposits typically signal preparation for sales. When investors want to sell their holdings, they need to transfer coins to trading platforms. The converse trend implies accumulation. Statistics show that 45% of the total BTC sent to exchanges originated in large deposits. Transfers of 100 BTC or more reached 7,000 BTC in a single day. The large holders are selling in response to such movements. Large Deposits Drive Market Dynamics The whale cohort has been very active in terms of sales during the present drawdown. Values of average deposits increased to 1.23 BTC in November. This is the highest it has been in 12 months. This week, Binance stablecoin reserves increased to $51 billion. The figure represents an all-time high for the exchange. BTC and Ether inflows reached $40 billion across major platforms. High stablecoin reserves indicate a rotation out of cryptocurrencies. In the event of uncertainty, capital generally flows to dollar-pegged assets. Investors deposit funds in stablecoins until market conditions improve. Leverage Remains in System Analyst James Check identified the remaining leverage that needs to be cleared. Markets may see a move into the $70,000-$80,000 range. This would eliminate final pockets of excessive positioning. BitMine chairman Tom Lee adjusted his price target expectations. He had previously forecasted that Bitcoin would reach $250,000. Lee now considers even an all-time high by year's end uncertain. The selling pattern extends beyond Bitcoin alone. Ether experienced similar deposit increases to exchanges. Total inflows remained modest compared to the volumes of Bitcoin. Bitcoin reclaimed the $90,000 level after recent weakness. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $91,251, suggesting a 3.9% increase in the last 24 hours.

One such opportunity encompasses Solana (SOL), which is currently plummeting to critical levels not seen in several months. The other opportunity encompasses Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , whose presale transactions are gaining momentum towards completing a full sale. The unfolding events features MUTM as one of the best cryptos to invest in for those seeking to invest in high-growth returns amidst current market uncertainties. The swift progression of Mutuum Finance presale stages demonstrates relevant momentum to make it a viable choice amidst risks associated with SOL’s performance in the market. SOL Patterns Bearish Technical Pattern Solana faces increased sell momentum with current pricing around $127 and proximity to its $123 support level, which it has yet to test in over seven months. Technical analysis shows it may be seeing a Death Cross pattern formance occur where shorter-term exponential averages cross below longer-term amounts, typically acting as strong eminent signals of trend continuation via strong downtrends. Historically speaking, such events have shown to cause SOL to dump 59% from its highs potentially plummeting SOL to $98. Currently, Solana altcoin is down 47% from its last peak; realized gains/losses reached lows not seen since June 2023. Though conditions have decreased investor trust lately, there’s one reason to be optimistic about Solana’s continuance; if its Net Realized Profit & Loss Ratio test below 0.1 levelers have seen past breakouts result in market trend changes. MUTM Presale Close to Full Distribution Despite market fluctuations in Solana, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows considerable resilience as it reaches over 95% allocation in its Phase 6 presale stage and draws to completion. The community has registered $19,000,000 from more than 18,200 contributors for this new crypto market entry. The tokens sell for $0.035; however, this pricing tier will come to closure very soon; Phase 7 begins to apply a sharp 20% price surge to $0.040. The presale allows for early bird incentives; hence, buyers now have all odds favoring them for potentially reaping a 400% profit following market entry via its $0.06 pricing tier. The time to invest in MUTM begins to come to closure as tokens in Phase 6 sell out quickly. Being part of Mutuum Finance market entry means not just investing but carefully joining a market whose performance shows definite momentum to mature into MUTM as one of the top cryptos delivering optimum profits amidst market instability. Dual-Lending Architecture Increases Yield Potential The main novelty of Mutuum Finance revolves around its bi-market lending solution combining elements of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems to make it even more fluid and adaptable to different requirements pertaining to liquidity management. The P2C system allows lending participants to stake their best cryptocurrencies such as ETH and USDT in common pools where these tokens earn returns as other borrowers borrow and utilize these tokens. At the same time, it also allows borrowers to hold these less prominent cryptocurrencies like other lending platforms where they can make lending contracts. The result of all these efforts leads to creating passive income sources for users by allowing them to earn rewards in form of mtTokens that accrue value over time. Such complex systems make Mutuum Finance one of the prominent DeFi cryptocurrencies. Secure Your Position Before the Window Closes Before the window closes, the current trend in Solana emphasizes market volatility. Mutuum Finance represents a systematic way to potentially build wealth. The MUTM presale represents advancement in stage and demonstrates an attractive lending concept along with simplified purchase processes to present to buyers. The allocation to Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is running low. The sensible present moment to act would be to not miss out on a potentially profitable 400% gain and instead be a sideline observer as early birds reap rewards of this compelling investment.

Key Takeaways: Alt5 Sigma removed its CEO and COO shortly after entering a $1.5 billion deal tied to a Trump family crypto project. The WLFI token agreement gives a Trump-affiliated entity 75% of sales proceeds, potentially worth over $500 million. The shakeup comes amid legal scrutiny linked to a Rwanda money-laundering ruling involving a related subsidiary. Las Vegas-based Alt5 Sigma dismissed acting chief executive officer Jonathan Hugh and chief operating officer Ron Pitters, replacing both without providing an explanation for the changes, Bloomberg reported on Thursday , citing a legal filing. The filing reportedly said the departures were not tied to any specific misconduct. Alt5 Shakeup Follows $1.5B Crypto Deal With Trump-Linked Project The leadership shakeup comes after the firm struck a $1.5 billion agreement in August to acquire WLFI digital tokens issued by World Liberty Financial, a project co-founded by members of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s family. That transaction quickly turned Alt5 into one of several small public companies this year that shifted strategy toward accumulating crypto tokens rather than building operating businesses. Unlike many similar deals, Alt5’s arrangement carried unusually large implications for its political partners. Under the agreement, a Trump-affiliated entity is entitled to 75% of proceeds from WLFI token sales, a structure that could yield more than $500 million for the family if adoption materializes. $alts @ALT5_Sigma 53% of the float has been accumulated by institutions and insiders. Where do you think this sleeping giant is headed? $wlfi $btc #trump pic.twitter.com/H7G20COQ8m — Dirigo Dave (@DirigoDave) November 26, 2025 Alt5’s board was also reshaped when the deal was unveiled. Zachary Witkoff, a World Liberty Financial co-founder and son of US envoy Steve Witkoff, was appointed chairman. Eric Trump and World Liberty co-founder Zachary Folkman were named board observers, allowing them to attend meetings without voting authority. Eric’s brother, Donald Trump Jr., later joined executives at a Nasdaq bell-ringing ceremony to celebrate the partnership. World Liberty Financial has publicly downplayed the executive changes. “The filing speaks for itself,” said spokesperson David Wachsman, adding the group remains “excited about the future for Alt5.” World Liberty Financial Faces Legal Cloud After Rwanda Money Laundering Ruling Behind the scenes, however, World Liberty Financial has faced mounting legal headwinds. A subsidiary was ruled criminally liable for money laundering in Rwanda in May, months before the Trump-related deal was finalized, according to previous reports by The Information . The same case also found Alt5 principal Andre Beauchesne liable, with a court ordering his imprisonment. Alt5 has said both the subsidiary and Beauchesne appealed, arguing they were victims of fraud. Alt5 has claimed its board was not informed of the Rwandan case until late August. Shortly afterward, former CEO Peter Tassiopoulos was suspended in October without explanation. Alt5 President Tony Isaac has now taken over as acting CEO. His history with the firm spans multiple reinventions, from appliance recycling to opioid-response efforts, before its recent pivot into cryptocurrency. As reported, the approval rating of US President Donald Trump is now lower than it was during his first term in the Oval Office, a new YouGov poll this week shows. According to the poll published on November 25, Trump’s net approval rating stands at negative 19%.

According to the crypto project’s blog announcement, the two companies will integrate Pi into several games developed by CiDi to engage the millions in Pi’s global community of users, known as Pioneers, while supporting developers within the ecosystem. CiDi could help Pi network’s position in gaming by turning Pi into a medium for payments involving in-game purchases while scaling the blockchain’s gaming infrastructure. “Pi’s natural fit with, and ongoing development of, gaming serves as the foundation for the partnership and complements Pi’s broader, coordinated approach to ecosystem growth,” the blog read. Web3 games could add Pi coin use cases The Pi Core development team members explained that its partnership with CiDi will expand Pi token’s utility, clarify the roadmap for game creators, and encourage daily engagement from Pioneers. “Pi Network and CiDi Games is a two-way feedback loop, where developers can draw users from Pi’s large community while new gaming utilities enhance the ecosystem through innovation, content creation and user involvement,” the team said . Pi Network has spent the past several years investing in gaming-focused initiatives, including hackathons, incubation programs, pre-built integrations, and monetization services. The Pi Ad Network, a built-in advertising system, has revenue opportunities for creators, which is the foundation for token-based transactions inside games. In May, the blockchain project collaborated with Canadian studio The Article 19 Group to launch Fruity Pi, an augmented reality (AR) game where players shoot fruits with the correct answers to math questions. FruityPi has several features like Pi payments, the Pi Ad Network, and wallet-level integration, which the team mentioned is a “template” showing how sustainable and inclusive app development is inside the ecosystem. CiDi Games plans to expand on that foundation through a dedicated library of titles built specifically for the Pi ecosystem with a new H5 Game Platform, a lightweight HTML5 gaming hub that is fast, casual, and accessible. PI token builds momentum with Web3 game news and rumored update The partnership comes as Pi Network’s token posts another week of mixed market performance. The coin recorded a 2% gain over the past 24 hours, continuing its monthly upward trend by over 11% to trade at $0.25 at the time of this reporting. Pi was consolidating between $2.2 and $2.4 during Wednesday afternoon US trading sessions, before briefly closing in on $0.26 just after the CiDi Web3 gaming partnership news broke. A brief correction on Thursday morning pulled Pi’s price back and settled it slightly below that level, also flipping the weekly gains into the red zone with a 1.17% downturn. Pi’s market capitalization also went back above the $2 billion mark, overtaking meme token PEPE and Ethereum-based synthetic dollar protocol Ethena. According to market watchers, chatter on social media about an upcoming “update” to the network appears to be one of the forces behind the positive price movement. Pi community members have been discussing the rumor about the network changes for over a week now, claiming it may arrive on November 28. New multiplayer RPG launches alpha test on Epic Games store In other Web3 gaming news, transmedia sci-fi fantasy universe Cross The Ages has launched the alpha testing stage for Arise, its new multiplayer action RPG, now available on the Epic Games Store. Arise is the second title within the Cross The Ages ecosystem, which introduces real-time multiplayer action, dungeons, and player-versus-player battles. Cross The Ages partnered with Hong Kong-incorporated gaming software company Animoca Brands in 2021 to support Arise’s blockchain gaming, token design, and market ambitions. Developers said Arise is meant to build on the community created by Cross The Ages: Blast, the project’s collectible card game that has sold more than forty million digital cards.

Crypto industry author Adam Livingston called it “incredibly bullish news” for Bitcoin, adding: “This is the transition point from ‘ETF adoption phase’ to the derivatives market phase. And Bitcoin’s price discovery always goes vertical when derivatives scale.” Options contracts allow traders to speculate on prices without holding the asset; they do not offer direct exposure to the underlying asset as a spot ETF does. Bitcoin’s Mag 7 Moment Livingstone commented that the rule filing literally says they’re doing this because IBIT has reached the same level of market cap, liquidity, and trading frequency as the biggest stocks. This is the category reserved for Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, etc, he said before adding, “That’s the club Bitcoin is now in.” “The market is formally treating Bitcoin as a top-tier global asset class with no liquidity constraints.” The change would benefit institutional traders by enabling larger hedging positions and income strategies while improving market efficiency through deeper liquidity, tighter spreads, and better price discovery. Livingston explained that banks can run structured products on Bitcoin without blowing through risk caps, “which means BTC becomes collateral for an entirely new tier of financial engineering.” “Institutional volume is finally here,” remarked ProCap BTC chief investment officer Jeff Park. At last, IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves— Nasdaq just filed to increase options limit to 1 MILLION (from 25k a year ago) Institutional vol is finally here Happy Thanksgiving https://t.co/vqH75rUTSf pic.twitter.com/MpCHxHMW8q — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) November 26, 2025 While the move would massively improve liquidity, it would also potentially increase leverage and volatility in Bitcoin markets, which could cause these wild price swings. Bitcoin ETF Outlook BlackRock’s IBIT fund saw its second consecutive day of inflows on Wednesday, with $42.8 million, as BTC started to recover. However, this follows an epic outflow streak, during which more than $2 billion left the product in just two weeks. The aggregate flow for all US spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday was $21 million as Fidelity (FBTC) saw an outflow, according to Farside Investors. In related news, JPMorgan announced an offering for institutional clients for a structured Bitcoin product using IBIT that matures in 2028.

54978588,635051,1764230406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54978588.jpeg,Crypto Asset Reporting Framework Advances: US Treasury Aims For Global Compliance By 2027,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-us-treasury/,"Clinton Donnelly, expert in crypto taxation, recently revealed on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the US Treasury Department has dispatched the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) regulations to the White House for review. CARF is part of a comprehensive international standard developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which has already garnered support from nearly 90 countries that have committed to its implementation. New Crypto Reporting Standards The essence of CARF is straightforward: it requires all participating nations to mandate that crypto exchanges and service providers—referred to as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)—collect extensive data about their users. This includes full Know Your Customer (KYC) information, due diligence data, tax residency details, and tax identification numbers. Subsequently, each exchange must report this data to the users’ home countries at the end of every year. For US taxpayers utilizing platforms like Binance , Kraken, Bybit, Bitstamp, or OKX—entities operating within the boundaries of CARF—the implications are clear: these crypto exchanges will automatically relay users’ activity to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Donnelly described CARF as the crypto equivalent of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), a regulatory framework that governs how banks share account balances globally. While the US opted out of CRS, instead creating the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), the current initiative suggests a shift toward incorporating CARF into progressive US crypto regulations. IRS To Receive Direct CARF Reports According to Donnelly’s assessment, the significance of CARF lies not just in reporting sales, but in tracking all transactions, including exchanges and transfers. Notably, CARF mandates the reporting of both sending and receiving wallet addresses for transfers. This indicates a new oversight mechanism that ensures no transaction goes unnoticed. Donnelly emphasized a key difference in reporting: while 1099-DAs from US companies are directly sent to the taxpayer, CARF reports will not be shared with individuals. Instead, these reports go directly to the IRS, which will utilize advanced data analysis tools, such as those developed by Palantir, to compare reported activity against individual taxpayer submissions . As a result, individuals who fail to accurately disclose their crypto activities may very well find themselves facing audits. Full enforcement of the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework is set to commence in 2027, a timeline that Donnelly views as imminent. However, for many, this could be seen as an invasion of crypto investors’ privacy. It remains to be seen whether the review by White House officials could pass without any requirements from industry leaders. As of this writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has recaptured the $90,000 level following last week’s crash, which saw BTC fall all the way to $80,000 for the first time since April of this year.

Reports have disclosed that the account known as “1011short” converted 10 million USDC into Hyperliquid before opening a long position with a five-fold leverage, controlling around $44.15 million in ETH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Whale Opens A Massive Ethereum Bet The trade uses 15,000 ETH at an entry price of $2,945, while current market levels sit near $2,896. That puts the position about $38,000 in the red for now. Based on reports, the liquidation point is $2,326, giving the trader a sizable margin to withstand market swings. With leverage in play, profits and losses are both magnified, making the move high-risk but potentially high-reward. Market Momentum Shows Mixed Signals Bitcoin has bounced back to $89,000, gaining 1.37% in the last 24 hours, though it still remains over 20% below last month’s highs. Some altcoins followed the trend upward. These gains helped trigger a wave of liquidations, catching many traders off guard. This #BitcoinOG(1011short) is back!

About 112,021 accounts were wiped out in total. The majority of liquidations came from short trades ($233 million), while the total for long trades was ($104 million). One of the largest orders liquidated was on Hyperliquid at $8.61 million BTC-USD. At the end of the day, Bitcoin and Ethereum made up the majority of the liquidations: about $119 million in BTC and about $73.34 million in ETH. This indicates the continued high levels of leverage employed in trades on both of the two largest digital currencies by market capitalization, despite large price fluctuations that have been observed recently. The larger the move in either direction, the more uncertain the trader will be with respect to the timing and extent of their exposure, and thus the potential for loss exists for both bears and bulls. Institutional Accumulation Continues Meanwhle, Nasdaq-listed BitMine Immersion Technologies expanded its ETH holdings last week by 69,822 coins, bringing its total to 3.63 million ETH — about 3% of circulating supply. The company also reported 192 BTC, $38 million in Worldcoin, and $800 million in cash. CryptoQuant data indicate unrealized losses of roughly $3.4 billion on its ETH treasury, reflecting market dips.

In November, a key risk gauge tied to Oracle debt hit a three-year high, and Morgan Stanley says the real damage may land in 2026 if the company fails to calm fears tied to its massive artificial intelligence spending rush. The warning is blunt. The pressure is tied to how fast the balance sheet is growing, how wide the funding gap looks, and how fast parts of the business could turn outdated. The cost to insure Oracle debt against default for the next five years climbed to 1.25 percentage point per year on Tuesday, based on ICE Data Services. That move puts the company’s five-year credit default swap near levels last seen during past stress cycles. Analysts Lindsay Tyler and David Hamburger say the stockpile of debt, paired with limited clarity on how it will all be funded, is a core threat staring at investors right now. Banks stack hedges as AI loans explode The five-year CDS on Oracle now sits uncomfortably close to the record set in 2008, when it hit 1.98 percentage points, according to ICE Data Services. The analysts say the CDS could break 1.5 percentage point soon and may push toward 2 percentage points if the company keeps tight on details about how it plans to fund its buildout into the new year. That risk line is driven by one brutal fact. Oracle is now a front-line name in the AI spending race, and the credit market treats it as a direct barometer for AI risk. In September, Oracle raised $18 billion in the US investment-grade bond market. In early November, about 20 banks lined up to arrange a separate $18 billion project finance loan for a massive data center campus in New Mexico, where Oracle will take control as the future tenant. On top of that, another $38 billion loan package is in motion to fund data center projects in Texas and Wisconsin built by Vantage Data Centers, according to Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley says the banks tied to these construction loans are a major driver behind the recent surge in trading volume on Oracle CDS, and they do not expect that activity to cool off soon. The analysts wrote, “Over the past two months, it has become more apparent that reported construction loans in the works, for sites where Oracle is the future tenant, may be an even greater driver of hedging of late and going forward.” They also flagged a risk that some bank hedges could unwind if lenders sell down pieces of these loans to outside buyers. Even if that happens, they made clear that other players could step in later and add new hedges of their own. The funding needs tied to these sites do not stop with New Mexico or the Vantage builds. More construction spending still sits ahead. Traders ditch bonds and load up on CDS Last month, the same analysts said they expect near-term credit deterioration and rising uncertainty to keep pushing bondholders, lenders, and thematic traders deeper into hedging mode. They added, “The bondholder hedging dynamic and also the thematic hedging dynamic could both grow in importance down the road.” So far, that call is playing out in the data. Oracle CDS have underperformed the broader investment-grade CDX index. At the same time, Oracle corporate bonds have also lagged the Bloomberg high-grade bond index as hedging demand rises and market mood weakens. The pressure is no longer limited to credit. Oracle stock has started to feel the weight as well. The analysts say this rising strain could push management to lay out a clearer financing plan on the next earnings call, including updates tied to Stargate , data centers, and capital spending. Until now, Morgan Stanley had pushed a basis trade, telling investors to buy Oracle bonds and buy CDS protection at the same time. The idea was to profit from derivatives widening more than cash bonds. That play is now off. The firm says the setup has changed and the cleanest move is no longer split exposure. They wrote, “Therefore, we are closing the ‘buy bond’ part of the basis trade, and keeping the ‘buy CDS protection’ leg of it.” They added, “We think a trade in CDS outright is cleaner right now and will result in a greater spread move.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|Morgan Stanley|Oracle,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-27 08:00:38

Fragmented tooling forces users to juggle separate apps for swaps, staking, tracking and presales, creating friction that slows broader Web3 adoption. Best Wallet Token backs a non-custodial, multi-chain mobile wallet that integrates tracking, swaps, staking and curated presales within a single interface. By tying fee discounts, higher staking yields and presale access to $BEST, Best Wallet Token aims to turn the wallet into a full-stack Web3 opportunity hub. Crypto wallets are no longer just key-storage tools. As more users live on-chain (trading, staking, gaming and joining presales) the wallet has quietly become Web3’s most important interface. Yet most options still force you to juggle multiple apps, sacrifice control, or tolerate clunky UX that scares off newcomers. Centralized wallets can freeze accounts or become single points of failure. On the other hand, many non-custodial wallets feel designed only for power users, with confusing signing flows, limited or no presale access, and few real perks for loyal holders. You’re either giving up sovereignty or leaving obvious value on the table. Best Wallet is positioning itself as a direct answer to that gap: a non-custodial, multi-chain Web3 wallet that bundles tracking, staking, swaps and vetted presales into one mobile-first app. The thesis is simple: if the wallet is where you live, it should also be where you earn, discover and save on fees. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale ends tomorrow, giving a final chance to buy at presale price before listings and heavier marketing kick in. With $17.65M already raised at $0.026005 per token, there’s already strong demand for a wallet that aims to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026. Learn more about what is Best Wallet Token. Best Wallet Bundles Web3 Into One Mobile-First Experience Best Wallet Token is backing a non-custodial, no-KYC wallet that aims to be the ‘home screen’ for your entire Web3 life. Instead of bouncing between a swap app, staking dashboard, portfolio tracker and presale platform, you manage everything inside a single, mobile-first interface designed for everyday users, not just DeFi natives. Under the hood, Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks MPC-CMP security, multi-wallet portfolios, and a DEX aggregator powered by Rubic that connects to 50+ chains, 200+ DEXs and 20 cross-chain bridges. For you, that translates to better pricing on swaps, broader asset coverage (60+ chains in the future), and fewer blind spots when moving capital across ecosystems. The standout feature is the Upcoming Tokens portal, which curates the best crypto presales and streamlines presale participation. Instead of chasing links and worrying about fake sites, you can discover vetted opportunities directly inside the wallet and pay with assets you already hold. $BEST Price Potential & Whale Interest Signal Explosive Future On-chain signals are already flashing interest from larger players. Smart money is moving, with one whale buying $16K yesterday and another adding in $13.8K 5 days ago . That kind of conviction ahead of listings often reflects a longer-term view on utility, not just a quick flip narrative around launch. Our $BEST price prediction also estimates large gains in the future, with a 2026 prediction at $0.05106175/token. That’s a 96% from today’s price of $0.026005. The tokenomics also lean into long-term alignment. $BEST holders unlock reduced fees across the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher APY opportunities through the staking aggregator, and priority access to future presales inside the Upcoming Tokens portal. An 8% allocation, or 800M tokens, is reserved for staking rewards, with dynamic proportional yields and immediate staking available during presale. Best Wallet Token is trying to turn the wallet from passive infrastructure into your primary yield and access layer. By combining non-custodial security, multi-chain swaps, tracking, staking and curated presales in one app, it targets both crypto natives looking to consolidate tools and newcomers who want a simpler on-ramp with tangible perks. Here’s how to buy $BEST now. With the presale closing tomorrow and a current raise of $17.65M, the timing window is narrow for those looking to enter at the current valuation. If you believe the next wave of adoption will be won at the wallet layer, $BEST is positioned as a direct bet on that thesis. Join the $BEST presale before it ends tomorrow.
