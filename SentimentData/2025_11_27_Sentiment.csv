Gilbertie shared his perspective during a recent interview with analyst Paul Barron, where he emphasized Ripple’s disciplined approach and the scale of its ambitions. Ripple’s Structure and Vision Impress Teucrium CEO During the interview, Gilbertie described Ripple as an organization with strong internal coordination and a clear plan for expanding its blockchain-based payment solutions. He noted that the company’s operational structure and execution place it in a position to challenge established institutions. According to Gilbertie, the blockchain company is developing technology that aims to serve markets traditionally dominated by JPMorgan, a firm that manages more than $4.6 trillion in assets and plays a central role in global financial operations. JPMorgan processes approximately $10 trillion in transactions every day across more than 160 countries. Gilbertie pointed out that Ripple’s payment products are designed to target a share of this high-volume settlement activity. He added that Ripple has been moving in this direction methodically, and its ambitions will become more pronounced once it secures a banking license. Ripple applied for a U.S. banking charter through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in July. If granted, the license would permit the company to offer fiduciary services, including custody solutions for its RLUSD stablecoin. Gilbertie believes this development would significantly strengthen Ripple’s competitive position in the financial industry.

These concerns resurfaced after CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified that XRP remains central to Ripple’s roadmap, despite the firm’s expansion into other areas of financial technology. Gilbertie supported Garlinghouse’s stance, stating that Ripple has little incentive to dispose of its XRP reserves. He questioned the rationale behind selling large amounts of the token, arguing that maintaining its holdings aligns with the company’s broader objectives. However, he acknowledged that Ripple may sell limited quantities of XRP in the future, particularly if the asset’s value rises substantially. According to Gilbertie, Garlinghouse’s comments about XRP’s role in Ripple’s strategy were understated. He suggested that Ripple’s technology and services have a much larger potential impact than some observers recognize. This is not the first time Gilbertie has expressed confidence in Ripple’s direction. Earlier in the year, he stated that Ripple could one day serve as an alternative to SWIFT, the dominant messaging system used for international bank transfers. He also reiterated his view that XRP offers considerable utility and demand within the digital asset market.

BLOK's portfolio balances core blockchain companies with exposure to bitcoin miners, exchanges, fintech, and AI-adjacent large caps, reducing single-stock and bitcoin price risk. Compared to peers, BLOK delivers superior risk-reward, lower volatility, and thematic diversification, making it a standout choice for crypto ecosystem exposure. I rate BLOK as overweight in a crypto portfolio, emphasizing its structural advantages, empirical performance, and potential to benefit from broader blockchain adoption. There are many alternatives when it comes to investing in the crypto ecosystem, looking beyond just bitcoins and bitcoin mining companies. I recently wrote about an AI-powered Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF (STCE), and found it a decent Buy. The Amplify Blockchain Technology ETF ( BLOK ) is another name I recommend. It has been an outperformer, remaining with the top half of the crypto pack (say STCE, DAPP, BKCH) in most market conditions and has some structural advantages (that we will discuss in this article) that make it a long term Buy. The volatility of the crypto space is huge and investors need to have high growth high risk appetite to be able to ride this ETF. Also, to cut idiosyncratic risks, I particularly emphasize a basket of ETFs each having their own strengths. So, while STCE does find a place in that portfolio for its unbiased rules-based but active-like positioning (backed by performance data), BLOK's active strategy presents a decent balance of investments beyond mining and bitcoin prices, optional plays in AI and a well-diversified portfolio (low single-stock risks). Methodology and Portfolio BLOK's investment universe starts from companies meaningfully involved in blockchain development, usage, R&D or commercialization. Managers check for blockchain relevance (including profiting from blockchain based data). The portfolio of 40-60 stocks comprises a 70% core holding in companies who derive significant revenue from blockchain. The remaining portfolio (secondary ~30%) consists of companies having partnerships and investments in the space. Stocks are weighted equally within each group, although the active methodology means deviations over time (particularly given the portfolio size and idiosyncratic volatile moves between stocks). However, individual stock risk looks relatively muted compared to STCE (top weight ~11.3%), VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) (top weight ~8.64%) and Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) (~13.12%). The top 10 holdings account for a reasonable ~35% of the total portfolio — not too concentrated. For comparison here are the top 10 total weightings: for DAPP ~60%, BKCH ~71% and STCE~60%. The diversification is a real structural strength for a crypto-themed ETF and should help protect the portfolio from adverse movements in single stocks. Top 10 Holdings - BLOK (Seeking Alpha) Inferences from the Portfolio Based on a manual scan of the current holdings , I found ~22% investments in bitcoin miners and infrastructure, names like HUT 8 Corp (HUT), Cipher Mining, Inc. (CIFR) and TeraWulf, Inc. (WULF). This is the most correlated part of BLOK to crypto prices and is reasonably low exposure to that extent. Adding another ~8% exposure in bitcoin ETFs and Trusts like iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) or even Strategy Inc (MSTR), the total bitcoin correlated part of the portfolio adds up to only ~30%. The bulk of the portfolio benefits beyond simply bitcoin price moves, unlike a mining focused ETF like say CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF (WGMI). Exchanges and Brokerages account for a significant ~24% of the portfolio — companies like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD), Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) and CME Group, Inc. (CME). These companies generate revenues from trading and services fees. They need transaction volumes and not bitcoin price appreciation directly. They can benefit from greater bitcoin adoption and trading, so lower volatility over time in crypto prices is more important than a bull market alone (of course, a bull market helps). Then there is a ~17% exposure in payments and fintech to companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL), NU Holdings Ltd. (NU) and even MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI). This layer is very diversified on its own with companies like MercadoLibre's share prices having very low dependency on bitcoin prices. Even the more dependent names like Paypal and Nu Holdings will benefit from increased crypto adoption (i.e. if bitcoin becomes a more accepted currency globally) versus sheer price appreciation. BLOK also has ~15% in enterprise blockchain and AI-adjacent large caps — NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) are in this mix. They walk into the ETF on the basis of infrastructure support to mining and blockchain technology (from chips to cloud support). This is a very good diversification away from crypto prices and happens to have an AI optionality too in a lot of cases (like Nvidia and AMD). Performance Insights The diversification by theme and a breakaway from the crypto prices provide substantial alpha avenues for BLOK. BLOK could grow in many ways: AI compute, semis, fintech volumes, enterprise software spending or even tokenization. The bulk of BLOK doesn’t need Bitcoin prices to rise - it only needs Bitcoin to keep getting adopted. Adoption happens when volatility falls, not when prices spike alone. Even within the ~30% of the portfolio more directly linked with bitcoin prices, surprises happen. Some traditional miners are turning into AI compute and hosting, like TeraWulf and Core Scientific, Inc. (CORZ). These shares actually led to a significant surge in BLOK at a time when bitcoin prices did not rise at all. At some point in October, BLOK was up 50% while bitcoin was still flat. Data by YCharts This AI side story was of course very well captured in a bitcoin mining focused ETF like WGMI where IREN Limited (IREN) and Cipher Mining (both together account for over a third of the overall portfolio). WGMI tripled in October due to this evolving story, but has also fallen by 42% since. WGMI's volatility is actually what makes BLOK's diversification more risk aware, both in terms of single stock exposure as well as exposure to several agnostic themes. I have already charted the outperformance in BLOK versus IBIT (a proxy for bitcoin), illustrating its reward potential versus bitcoins. This comes at the cost of volatility that is lower than bitcoin's. In terms of standard deviations, BLOK shows 10% lower standard deviation than IBIT and less than half of WGMI. Both empirically, and in terms of how the portfolio is structured, expect BLOK to have a far superior risk-reward asymmetry than IBIT or WGMI like bitcoin focused bets. A comparison with other crypto-themed ETFs also show BLOK has been in the top 2 most of the time over the past 3 years (observe the trajectory and not only the end point outperformance). Here are the standard deviation numbers for the risk/volatility perspective - BLOK ~45, STCE ~63, BKCH ~77 and DAPP ~74. Overall, BLOK is consistently towards the higher end of the total return spectrum within the crypto pack, while its risks are far lower. That calls for overweighing BLOK in any crypto and blockchain portfolio. Data by YCharts Overweight BLOK I rate BLOK a Buy backed by several empirical evidences and structural advantages. First, its single stock diversification is best-in-class. Secondly, thematic diversification means lower volatility. Third, empirical performance shows these expectations actually translate to real life performance. BLOK outperforms most of the crypto pack most of the time and keeps volatility levels low. Overall, I am bullish this ETF segment, that invests on a crypto ecosystem rather than just bitcoins and mining. This positions it to gain from simply better adoption over bitcoin appreciation. With regulatory supports coming in , in the US as well as elsewhere, as bitcoin adoption grows, this theme will likely keep growing. Crypto investing cannot be defensive given its volatility, so investors should have the risk appetite to wade through 50% MTM losses at some point. A systematic accumulation over time works. At least the wider crypto plays makes for lower volatility levels - but still may require similar levels of risk appetite. The overall crypto ecosystem bet looks bullish otherwise, with BLOK a material overweight in that portfolio.",STCE|BKCH|DAPP|BLOK,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-26 23:38:12

Whales have started moving large volumes of PEPE to exchanges, a classic red flag that a sell-off could be near. According to Nansen, exchange-held PEPE has jumped from 250 trillion on November 6 to 258 trillion today, marking a 30-day high. This comes as open interest in PEPE futures sinks to just $165 million, far below its $1 billion peak in July. With sentiment crumbling and traders pulling back, the risk of a deeper drop is growing fast. Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Could Bounce Back Strongly If It Drops to This Key Area Since the year started, Pepe has lost over 77% of its value. As a result, it is one of the worst-performing tokens in the market and the biggest loser of the top 5 in the meme coin category. The weekly chart shows that Pepe just hit a key support area at $0.0000040. This level lies right above a weekly fair value gap (FVG). These FVGs are price imbalances caused by a strong surge in the demand for an asset. This FVG dates back to February 2024, back when Pepe’s popularity was surging. If the price dips to this level in the next few days, the odds of a strong rebound will increase. In the mean time, a new mine-to-earn (M2E) game inspired in the Pepe the Frog meme called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has received millions from investors. This early presale gamifies crypto mining and could outperform the OG Pepe this year. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Turns Mining Into an Interactive Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is reimagining how crypto mining works by introducing a fun game where players can launch virtual servers and rigs to earn meme coins and compete for rewards. No expensive hardware is needed to run your mining operation. Simply invest $PEPENODE tokens to get your virtual server up and fire up as many rigs as you want. Top miners who make it to the leaderboard will receive airdrops of top tokens like Bonk ($BONK) and Pepe ($PEPE). In addition, the game incorporates referral boosts, anti-bot protection, and a token burn program. This last feature removes up to 70% of the $PEPENODE used for upgrading rigs from circulation, increasing scarcity of the token. To buy $PEPENODE and start mining right away, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet. You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead.

The body representing exchanges voicing its concerns comes as the SEC considers whether to issue a form of “innovation exemption” that would allow crypto companies to offer blockchain-based tokens representing exposure to listed stocks, instruments that would be sold to US retail investors without the platforms registering as broker-dealers. This proposal, which is supported by several crypto platforms, is being considered by SEC chair Paul Atkins, highlighting the agency’s recalibrated approach to digital assets under the Trump administration . The tokenization debate divides traditional and crypto finance This is not the first time the WFE has raised concerns about tokenized equities. In August, it wrote to regulators in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, urging a crackdown on unlicensed platforms offering tokenized stocks, warning of investor-protection issues and reputational risks for listed companies whose names are used without consent. It went further to ask that regulators apply the same rules used on securities to tokenized assets. Despite the body’s concerns, interest in tokenization continues to grow across the financial sector. Large banks, asset managers, and trading venues have begun exploring blockchain-based settlement and token-form assets as part of efforts to modernize financial infrastructure. The trend has gained more traction this year as crypto-native platforms seek direct access to the US equities market, while traditional exchanges experiment with on-chain settlement models. Nasdaq’s push for regulated tokenized securities. Nasdaq, one of the WFE’s most prominent members, has simultaneously been pushing for a regulated path toward tokenization. In September, it submitted a formal rule-change proposal that would allow the exchange to list and trade stocks in tokenized form, assigning the digital instruments the same regulatory treatment, including rights and CUSIP identification, as conventional shares. However, Ondo Finance, a blockchain startup offering financial market solutions, called for delays until Nasdaq provides further details on how trades in tokenized form would be processed through the Depository Trust Company, which operates the core plumbing of US securities settlement. Within the WFE itself, members acknowledge tokenization’s potential. The letter describes blockchain-based equity instruments as a “natural evolution in capital markets.” However, many exchanges argue that innovation must occur within the existing regulatory framework rather than through exemptions granted to unlicensed crypto platforms. James Auliffe, head of the WFE’s technology working group, said equity markets are already “very, very efficient,” and that proponents of moving trading onto blockchains still need to prove the benefits outweigh the costs. High stakes for regulators and markets The SEC’s decision on the matter will shape the future of how equities are traded and accessed in the US. Allowing tokenized stocks to be offered without conventional broker-dealer oversight could potentially enable firms outside the traditional financial system to compete directly with exchanges and brokers that face far stricter compliance obligations. Investor advocates fear that retail traders may not understand the difference between owning a token linked to a stock and holding the real equity itself. Earlier this year, companies including OpenAI warned that tokenized versions of their shares circulating on trading apps did not represent actual ownership. Don’t just read crypto news.

In a move that highlights the critical importance of metadata privacy , Buterin donated 128 ETH each to two decentralized messaging platforms – Session and SimpleX. This substantial contribution underscores his commitment to solving one of the most pressing challenges in modern technology. Why Is Metadata Privacy So Crucial Today? When we think about privacy, we often focus on message content. However, metadata privacy protects the information about our communications – who we talk to, when we communicate, and for how long. This data can reveal sensitive patterns about our lives, relationships, and activities. Buterin recognizes that true digital freedom requires protecting both message content and communication patterns. What Makes Session and SimpleX Special for Metadata Protection? Both platforms approach metadata privacy from different but complementary angles. Session uses a decentralized network of service nodes that don’t require phone numbers or personal information. Meanwhile, SimpleX employs a unique architecture where users control their own servers. Here are their key advantages: No phone number or email required for registration Decentralized infrastructure prevents single points of failure Advanced encryption protects both content and connection data Open-source code allows community verification How Will These Donations Advance Metadata Privacy Technology? The 256 ETH total donation (approximately $800,000 at current prices) provides significant resources for both projects to accelerate development. This funding will help them tackle the core challenges Buterin identified: Permissionless account creation without personal identifiers Enhanced protection against metadata analysis Improved user experience while maintaining security Broader adoption through better documentation and tools What Does This Mean for the Future of Private Communication? Buterin’s endorsement signals a major shift in priorities for the cryptocurrency community. By supporting these projects, he’s encouraging developers and users to prioritize metadata privacy as a fundamental right. This move could inspire similar investments and innovations across the decentralized technology space. How Can You Support Metadata Privacy Initiatives? Buterin explicitly encouraged the community to participate in both projects. Here are practical ways you can contribute: Download and use Session or SimpleX for your daily communications Contribute to their open-source code repositories Help with documentation and user education Spread awareness about the importance of metadata privacy Vitalik Buterin’s strategic donations represent more than just financial support – they’re a clear statement about the future direction of private communication. By backing Session and SimpleX, he’s helping build a world where true metadata privacy becomes accessible to everyone, not just technical experts. This investment in foundational technology could ultimately benefit millions of users seeking genuine digital privacy. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is metadata in messaging? Metadata refers to information about your communications rather than the content itself. This includes who you’re talking to, when messages are sent, message frequency, and device information. Why did Vitalik choose 128 ETH specifically? While Buterin didn’t specify why 128 ETH, the number holds significance in computer science as a power of two, potentially symbolizing his technical background and the binary nature of digital systems. Are Session and SimpleX completely anonymous? While they offer strong privacy protections, no system provides perfect anonymity. Both platforms significantly reduce metadata exposure compared to traditional messaging apps. Can I use these apps alongside my current messaging services? Yes, both Session and SimpleX can be installed alongside other messaging apps, allowing you to gradually transition sensitive conversations to more private platforms. How do these donations impact Ethereum’s price? While the donations show confidence in Ethereum’s utility, the amount represents a small fraction of daily trading volume and isn’t likely to significantly impact price movements. What makes these platforms different from Signal or Telegram? Unlike Signal and Telegram, Session and SimpleX don’t require phone numbers and use decentralized architectures that provide stronger protection against metadata collection.

Then every post tied to the rollout quietly disappeared from his social media platforms without explanation, That disappearance was enough rocket fuel for McGregor. “There is just no way good guy Khabib used his late father’s name, as well as Dagestan’s culture, to scam his fans,” McGregor wrote on X. “Fire selling digital NFTs online and then deleting all the content after they were sold, he added. “what a shame and a stain on his father’s name,” he wrote further. Khabib denies NFT scam He didn’t stop there and stated that “Father’s plan has now become Father’s scam. Very sad.” McGregor’s timing wasn’t accidental, as he recently insisted on preparing for a 2025 comeback. However, recently re-entered the drug-testing pool. The former champ has been teasing a return ever since the UFC confirmed plans for a blockbuster White House event in 2026. Khabib did respond to the allegations and denied the accusations. He went on to call McGregor “an absolute liar” while defending both the project and his family’s reputation. Sources close to the launch say the NFT collection was framed as a tribute to his late father, Abdulmanap. It was supposed to be a digital keepsake rather than a speculative cash-grab. Source: Conor McGregor’s X post (Now deleted) The situation took a hit within hours when On-chain investigator ZachXBT stepped into the conversation. He didn’t defend Khabib, but turned McGregor’s own words against him. He reposted McGregor’s accusations with receipts from the fighter’s own 2022 NFT project, “McGregor Realm.” It was rolled out with celebrity fanfare and then quietly vanished from his feeds in a similar fashion. “Sound familiar?” the investigator asked. The back-and-forth instantly revived one of MMA’s most bitter rivalries. NFTPRICEFLOOR data shows that the global NFT market cap hovers around $3,3 billion. It jumped by around a 4% change over the last 24 hours. The global crypto turned up for the recovery rally as its total market cap regained the $3.1 trillion mark. Its 24 hour trading volume clicked $140 million. Bitcoin price surge above $90,000 has given bulls some hope. Their feud has stayed alive for six years, even though one retired as the undefeated lightweight champion and the other has been recovering from a career-halting leg break. As of now, McGregor is signaling a comeback and Khabib is returning fire publicly for the first time in a while.

Market data across multiple timeframes indicates that ADA continues to face an uncertain short-term outlook despite minor intraday improvements. Overview of Recent ADA Performance The asset experienced a sharp retracement late in November, declining from approximately $0.47 on Nov. 20 to around $0.39 the next day. Over the last 24 hours, ADA has traded within a relatively narrow range between $0.4065 and $0.4274, reflecting efforts by buyers to stabilize the market while still encountering selling pressure near the upper band of the range. On broader time horizons, bearish sentiment remains dominant. Cardano has recorded a 6.4% decline over the past week and a 38.52% drop across the past month. The token’s market capitalization has also fallen to $15.06 billion, reinforcing market concerns about sustained weakness. With these indicators, analysts are watching to see whether buyers can regain influence or whether ADA may extend its corrective structure. Technical Assessment: Resistance Levels Remain Firm Analysis of Cardano’s weekly chart shows that the asset is still positioned beneath several influential resistance zones. The Ichimoku Cloud framework continues to identify a negative trend, with ADA trading well below the cloud. This structure confirms ongoing weakness and reinforces the challenge ahead for any bullish reversal. The Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen lines are also aligned in a bearish configuration, currently positioned at $0.59 and $0.65. These levels represent immediate barriers that ADA must reclaim before attempting any broader recovery. For a shift in market structure toward a more favorable trajectory, Cardano must close decisively above the cloud, with the region around $0.75 serving as the central threshold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If sellers maintain their hold, ADA could revisit lower supports, particularly near $0.29. The Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) provides additional insight, currently registering at -75.33. Although some signs of stabilization exist, the indicator reflects continued difficulty in generating sustained upward momentum. The lack of a firm close above key resistance, combined with depressed momentum readings, supports a cautious outlook for the near term. Beyond technical indicators, Cardano’s social activity offers a contrasting data point. A recent snapshot from Mintern shows that ADA holds a 9.6% share of social media discussions among major chains. This significantly exceeds the engagement levels of networks such as XRP at 2.9%, Solana at 1.55%, and USDC at 1.55%. High social visibility suggests that Cardano maintains a notably active and involved community. While social dominance does not guarantee immediate price appreciation, it often reflects resilience in market interest, which can influence sentiment-driven trading activity.

Related Reading: Hoskinson Claims Cardano Revival Starts Now: Here’s What’s Coming The fifth-largest U.S. bank is piloting a dollar-backed stablecoin on Stellar, an initiative that could accelerate institutional adoption and strengthen market confidence in XLM heading into year-end. U.S. Bancorp Selects Stellar for Bank-Grade Stablecoin Infrastructure The Minneapolis-based banking giant has partnered with PwC and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) to test programmable deposits and stablecoin payments on Stellar’s public blockchain. What sets Stellar apart, according to U.S. Bank’s digital assets head Mike Villano, is its built-in ability to freeze assets, unwind transactions, and enforce compliance at the protocol level. These capabilities are essential for regulated banks that must adhere to KYC, AML, and consumer protection standards. Unlike traditional “business logic” solutions, Stellar offers these controls directly at the blockchain layer, giving banks the confidence needed to explore tokenized finance. The pilot arrives amid a resurgence of institutional interest. Banks, including Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, have begun designing stablecoin frameworks. U.S. Bank recently relaunched its digital assets division to tap into opportunities in custody, tokenisation, and blockchain-based payments. Institutional Momentum Could Drive Mainstream Stablecoin Adoption If successful, U.S. Bancorp’s trial could pave the way for fully regulated, deposit-backed stablecoins issued directly by banks, unlocking new efficiencies for cross-border transfers, treasury operations, and global settlements. With projections suggesting that stablecoin payments could reach $1 trillion annually by 2030, banks are racing to claim their share of the digital payments market. Stellar’s high uptime, low-cost settlement, and remittance-focused architecture make it an appealing choice for real-world financial applications. As institutions embrace public blockchains, Stellar stands positioned as one of the few networks offering both decentralization and the regulatory controls banks require. XLM Price Outlook: Analyst Targets Signal 24–36% Upside The U.S. Bancorp announcement has arrived at a pivotal time for Stellar’s native token, XLM . Trading near $0.25, the asset is showing early signs of bullish momentum, supported by: MACD bullish divergence Neutral RSI at 42, offering room to climb Price sitting on 20-EMA support Breakout potential above $0.28–$0.31 Analysts expect XLM to target the $0.31–$0.34 range within the next 2–4 weeks, a potential 24–36% upside, if volume expands and the broader crypto market remains stable. A break below $0.22 would invalidate the bullish thesis. Related Reading: South Korea Risks Stablecoin Legislation Delay As Financial Authorities Clash With BOK As Wall Street experiments with Stellar’s blockchain, institutional utility could become a significant driver for XLM’s long-term valuation.

With price momentum weakening and long-term trend indicators flashing bearish warning signals, the possibility of a price crash to $38,000 is becoming hard to ignore. 50-MA Breakdown To Trigger $38,000 Bitcoin Price Crash The Bitcoin price action took a decisive turn this week as the market slipped below the 50 MA for the first time in this four-year cycle. Severino noted in his technical analysis shared on X this Monday that the 50 MA has historically marked the beginning of extended downturns. He stated that following Bitcoin’s launch over 14 years ago, every time it has closed below the 50 MA, a prolonged bear market has followed. Related Reading: Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days Severino’s price chart highlights BTC’s price performance from 2017 to date. In the past three Bitcoin bear markets, after the price fell below the 50-week MA, BTC continued to drop an additional 61%, 59%, and 67%. On average, the cryptocurrency has lost 62% from the break point. Applying the 62% drawdown to this cycle’s 50 MA level, the analyst predicts Bitcoin could soon experience a price crash to $38,000. From the cryptocurrency’s current price of above $87,000, this represents a staggering 60% decline. Additionally, it would imply a roughly 70% decline from its all-time high of more than $126,000. Severino warns that traders calling for a price bottom may be ignoring how far Bitcoin has historically fallen once this long-term trend fails. He indicated that the 50-week MA has repeatedly served as a dividing line between bullish and bearish phases, and that price slipping below it has more often led to extended periods of weakness and capitulation. Bitcoin Momentum Indicator Falls To Historic Lows A second analysis presented by Severino focuses on Bitcoin’s daily LMACD, which is now near levels not seen in more than 1,250 days. The oscillator has only pushed below this level six times since BTC’s 2017 macro peak. These past instances correspond to periods of heavy downside momentum where the cryptocurrency had yet to complete its bottoming process. Related Reading: One Of The Most Popular Bitcoin Advocates Dumps Millions In BTC, Here’s Why Looking at Severino’s price chart, the extended period without revisiting this lower bound suggests Bitcoin may be overdue for a momentum reset. The LMACD indicator’s current reading is also unusually weak historically, signaling that market momentum has not yet reached extreme pessimism. The readings further indicate that, although BTC remains in a downtrend, price corrections remain possible before a true bottom is established. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is trading below $87,000 amid volatile, choppy conditions that have contributed to its 24% decline over the past month.

This approval positions Securitize as the only available company possessing licensed tokenisation infrastructure in both the European Union and the US. This news was made public after Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) reportedly permitted the company to run its system throughout the bloc. Notably, this government agency is the country’s securities regulator responsible for supervising and regulating Spain’s securities markets and financial sector. With this go-ahead in place, Securitize outlined its intentions to make use of its European trading and settlement system on Avalanche . When reporters asked the firm why it chose this network, it acknowledged that the network has fast settlement times and an adaptable setup that meets the needs of institutions. In the meantime, sources hinted that the first issuance under this new approval is expected to take place in early 2026. Securitize secures approval to run its system throughout the EU Apart from securing approval to run a regulated trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime, an earlier report dated December 2024 also noted that Securitize acquired a separate Investment Firm license from CNMV. This license played a significant role in the firm’s operations, as it enabled its team to execute orders, secure assets, and serve as a digital transfer agent for tokenised securities. Since then, Securitize has solidified its position as a leader in the financial services and fintech sectors. It achieved this major success after the license began to be recognised in key countries in the EU, such as the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany, and Luxembourg. Interestingly, the new approval takes a step further by permitting Securitize to manage the market infrastructure directly. This means that the company can freely establish a regulated setting primarily for issuing, trading, and settling tokenised securities across the EU. Moreover, the new authorisation links smoothly with Securitize’s existing US operations, where the firm acts as a registered broker-dealer, digital transfer agent, fund administrator and alternative trading system. To further illustrate its commitment to solidify its position as a leader in the industry, Securitize recently made clear its plan to go public via a $1.25 billion SPAC deal backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. Following the announcement of this intention, sources revealed that the company has become a significant provider of tokenisation infrastructure for key institutions, including Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, and VanEck. To support this claim, it was discovered that Securitize is responsible for BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which is the first on-chain Treasurys product to surpass a record of $1 billion in assets and has now surged to over $4 billion. Securitize made clear its intentions to go public Last month, reports highlighted that Securitize was the latest crypto-focused firm to reveal its intentions to go public. At the time, the company had valued itself at $1.25 billion before any investments were made. The tokenisation leader is planning to list in the US. Once the necessary steps for going public are finalized, sources close to the situation pointed out that the new entity will go by the name Securitize Corp. and be listed on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol SECZ. Securitize also plans to tokenise its own shares. In a statement, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo commented that this is a crucial moment for Securitize and for the future of finance. “We started this company to make capital markets more open, clear, and efficient through tokenisation. This marks an important step toward making financial markets as fast as the internet and advancing our mission to bring the next generation of finance on-chain and tokenize everything.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This sudden maintenance action, which began at 11:55 p.m. UTC on November 26, affects millions of users worldwide. The Upbit emergency inspection represents a crucial security measure, but it also raises important questions about what prompted this urgent action and when normal operations will resume. What Triggered This Upbit Emergency Inspection? The cryptocurrency community was taken by surprise when Upbit announced its emergency maintenance. While the exchange hasn’t revealed specific details about what prompted this urgent Upbit emergency inspection, such measures typically occur for several reasons. Exchange platforms often conduct emergency inspections to address potential security vulnerabilities, update system protocols, or investigate suspicious activities. This proactive approach demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to user asset protection, though it does cause temporary inconvenience. Regular maintenance helps prevent larger issues down the line. However, emergency inspections like this Upbit emergency inspection usually indicate the platform has identified something requiring immediate attention. The timing suggests the exchange prioritizes security over convenience, even if it means disrupting trading activities during peak hours. How Does This Upbit Emergency Inspection Affect Your Trading? During this Upbit emergency inspection period, users face specific limitations that impact their trading strategies. Understanding these restrictions helps you plan accordingly and avoid frustration. All digital asset deposits are temporarily suspended Withdrawal requests cannot be processed Existing balances remain secure and unaffected Trading between cryptocurrencies may continue normally Fiat currency transactions are also paused This comprehensive Upbit emergency inspection means you cannot move funds onto or off the exchange until maintenance completes. However, your stored assets remain safe, and the inspection doesn’t affect your ability to trade between different cryptocurrencies already in your Upbit wallet. When Will Normal Services Resume After This Upbit Emergency Inspection? Upbit has not provided a specific timeline for when the Upbit emergency inspection will conclude. Historically, similar emergency maintenance periods on major exchanges have lasted anywhere from a few hours to several days. The duration typically depends on the complexity of the issues being addressed and the thoroughness required to ensure complete system security. Users should monitor Upbit’s official communication channels for updates. The exchange will likely provide progress reports through their website, social media accounts, and email notifications. Patience is crucial during these security measures, as rushing the process could compromise the effectiveness of the Upbit emergency inspection. Why Should You Support This Upbit Emergency Inspection? While temporary service suspensions are inconvenient, this Upbit emergency inspection ultimately benefits all users. Security measures protect your investments from potential threats that could cause far greater damage than temporary access restrictions. The cryptocurrency space has seen numerous exchange hacks resulting in massive losses, making proactive security essential. This Upbit emergency inspection demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to maintaining robust security standards. By addressing potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, Upbit protects both individual users and the broader ecosystem. Such responsible practices help build trust in cryptocurrency platforms and contribute to mainstream adoption. What Can You Do During the Upbit Emergency Inspection? While waiting for the Upbit emergency inspection to conclude, savvy traders can use this time productively. You can research new investment opportunities, analyze market trends, or educate yourself about security best practices. This unexpected pause provides an opportunity to review your trading strategy and ensure you’re prepared when services resume. Remember that other exchanges continue operating normally, though transferring assets between platforms isn’t possible during the Upbit emergency inspection. Use this time to diversify your knowledge rather than worrying about temporary access limitations. Final Thoughts on the Upbit Emergency Inspection The Upbit emergency inspection, while inconvenient, represents the exchange’s strong commitment to security and user protection. In the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, such proactive measures are essential for maintaining trust and preventing catastrophic security breaches. While the temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals disrupts trading activities, the long-term benefits of enhanced security far outweigh the short-term inconveniences. As we await further updates from Upbit regarding their emergency inspection, remember that security should always take priority over convenience in the digital asset space. This incident serves as a reminder that even major exchanges must remain vigilant against emerging threats in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is happening with Upbit? Upbit is conducting an emergency inspection of its digital asset deposit and withdrawal systems, temporarily suspending these services to ensure platform security. Can I still trade cryptocurrencies on Upbit during the inspection? Yes, trading between different cryptocurrencies already in your Upbit wallet should continue normally.

Emergency maintenance typically lasts from several hours to a few days, depending on the issues being addressed. Is my money safe during this inspection? Yes, your existing balances remain secure and unaffected. The inspection is a preventive measure to enhance security, not a response to lost funds. Will I be notified when services resume? Upbit will likely announce when services resume through their official website, social media channels, and email notifications to registered users.

This crucial market sentiment indicator has climbed seven points from yesterday’s reading, yet remains firmly in the danger zone. But what does this actually mean for your cryptocurrency holdings and future investments? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Should You Care? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional thermometer, measuring investor sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100. When the index reads 0, it indicates maximum fear, while 100 represents extreme greed. Currently sitting at 22, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests that market participants are overwhelmingly pessimistic. This emotional gauge combines multiple data points to provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. The index calculation incorporates six key factors: Volatility (25% weighting) Market volume (25% weighting) Social media sentiment (15% weighting) Survey results (15% weighting) Bitcoin dominance (10% weighting) Google search trends (10% weighting) How Does Extreme Fear Impact Cryptocurrency Prices? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index drops into extreme fear territory, several market dynamics typically emerge. First, selling pressure often increases as nervous investors exit positions. Second, buying opportunities may appear for contrarian investors who recognize that extreme fear often precedes market rebounds. Historical data shows that when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaches these levels, it frequently marks potential turning points in market cycles. However, extreme fear can also create self-fulfilling prophecies. As more investors react to the low Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading, their fearful actions can drive prices even lower. This creates a challenging environment where emotional decisions often override rational analysis. Strategic Moves During Extreme Fear Periods Navigating markets when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicates extreme fear requires careful strategy. Consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into quality projects Setting clear stop-losses to manage risk Diversifying across different cryptocurrency sectors Maintaining cash reserves for potential opportunities Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures current sentiment, not future performance. Many successful investors have used periods of extreme fear to accumulate positions at discounted prices. Historical Patterns of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has proven remarkably accurate at identifying market extremes throughout cryptocurrency history. Previous instances where the index reached similar levels often preceded significant price movements. However, timing these turns remains challenging even with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a guide. Market veterans often watch for divergence between price action and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. When prices make new lows while the index begins improving, it can signal potential trend changes. This makes monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index essential for informed decision-making. FAQs: Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 22 mean? A reading of 22 indicates extreme fear in cryptocurrency markets. This suggests most investors are pessimistic and selling pressure dominates trading activity. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing regular snapshots of market sentiment as conditions evolve throughout trading sessions. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price bottoms? While not a perfect timing tool, extreme fear readings often coincide with market bottoms, making it valuable for identifying potential buying zones. Should I sell when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear? Extreme fear often presents buying opportunities rather than selling signals, though individual circumstances and risk tolerance should guide decisions. How accurate is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index historically? The index has reliably identified emotional extremes in past market cycles, though it works best when combined with other analysis tools. Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index work for altcoins? While heavily weighted toward Bitcoin, the index reflects overall cryptocurrency sentiment that typically affects altcoins as well.

The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) is raising alarms about unregulated crypto firms selling these digital assets. In a bold move, they’ve urged the SEC to step in and protect investors from potential market risks. This clash between innovation and regulation could determine the future of digital finance. Why Are Tokenized Stocks Causing Regulatory Concerns? The WFE recently sent a crucial letter to the SEC expressing deep concerns. They warned that allowing crypto companies to sell tokenized stocks without proper oversight could harm investor interests. This comes after the SEC considered exempting these firms from broker-dealer registration requirements. The federation argues this creates an uneven playing field where traditional exchanges follow strict rules while crypto platforms operate with more freedom. What Risks Do Unregulated Tokenized Stocks Pose? Tokenized stocks represent real company shares but exist as digital tokens on blockchain networks. However, without regulation: Investors might lack proper protection against fraud Market manipulation could become easier Price discrepancies between real and tokenized stocks may occur Legal recourse for investors could be limited The WFE emphasizes that exemptions shouldn’t let companies bypass fundamental regulatory principles that protect markets. How Does Fair Competition Affect Tokenized Stocks? The federation insists that all market participants must compete under the same rules. Traditional stock exchanges undergo rigorous oversight, while crypto platforms might operate with less scrutiny. This imbalance could: Undermine market integrity Create unfair advantages Weaken investor confidence in tokenized stocks Potentially destabilize financial markets Therefore, the WFE advocates for consistent regulation across all platforms offering tokenized stocks. What’s Next for Tokenized Stocks Regulation? The SEC now faces pressure to balance innovation with investor protection. Their decision could set a precedent for how tokenized stocks are treated globally. Market participants are watching closely as this could determine whether digital assets can safely coexist with traditional financial instruments. The outcome will likely influence how quickly tokenized stocks gain mainstream adoption. Conclusion: Striking the Right Balance for Tokenized Stocks The WFE’s intervention highlights the critical need for thoughtful regulation of tokenized stocks. While innovation drives progress, investor protection must remain paramount. As digital assets continue evolving, regulatory frameworks must adapt to ensure markets remain fair, transparent, and secure for all participants. The future of tokenized stocks depends on getting this balance right. Frequently Asked Questions What are tokenized stocks? Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional company shares that exist on blockchain networks, allowing for easier trading and transfer. Why is the WFE concerned about tokenized stocks? The WFE worries that unregulated trading of tokenized stocks could expose investors to unnecessary risks and create unfair market conditions. What does the SEC’s proposed exemption mean? The SEC considered allowing crypto firms to sell tokenized stocks without registering as broker-dealers, which would reduce regulatory oversight. How could unregulated tokenized stocks harm investors? Investors might face higher fraud risks, limited legal protection, and potential market manipulation without proper regulation. What solution does the WFE propose? The WFE wants all platforms, whether traditional or crypto, to follow the same regulatory rules when offering tokenized stocks. Will this affect cryptocurrency regulation broadly? Yes, the SEC’s decision on tokenized stocks could influence how other digital assets are regulated in the future.

This decision, made public on Wednesday, stems from what the agency describes as “persistent gaps in disclosure” and a growing allocation of “high-risk assets” within Tether’s reserves. The assets highlighted include Bitcoin (BTC), gold, corporate bonds, secured loans, and other investments, all of which entail various risks, including credit, market, interest rate, and foreign exchange vulnerabilities. Tether CEO Responds To S&P Downgrade In a recent research note, S&P Global detailed that this upgrade came as part of a new assessment scale implemented in 2023, ranging from 1 to 5. This scale evaluates the risk associated with different stablecoins. Following the assessment, S&P rated Tether’s USDT stablecoin as “5 (weak),” marking it as the lowest possible score and down from its previous rating of “4 (constrained).” S&P expressed concerns regarding the limited insight Tether provides into the creditworthiness of its custodians and counterparties. Related Reading: Has The Bitcoin Price Hit Its Bottom? Key On-Chain Data Signals Potential Rebound Ahead Despite this, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) stating, “We wear your loathing with pride.” He argued that traditional credit rating methods used by agencies like S&P arose from a system that has faltered, leading regulators to challenge these legacy models. Ardoino contended that Tether stands out as a “overcapitalized” organization within the financial sector, claiming it does not harbor “toxic reserves.” He further suggested that S&P’s methods are better suited for conventional banks and insurers with opaque financial histories, rather than being applicable to digital asset issuers who operate under different reserve structures. Ardoino’s remarks indicate a belief that the agency’s downgrade indicates discomfort within traditional finance toward entities like Tether that aim to transcend a “broken financial system.” The firm’s CEO noted: The traditional finance propaganda machine is growing worried when any company tries to defy the force of gravity of the broken financial system. No company should dare to decouple itself from it. Largest Independent Gold Holder In the aftermath of the downgrade, Tether strongly rejected S&P’s characterizations, emphasizing its resilience through various financial crises, including banking collapses, exchange failures, liquidity challenges, and extreme market fluctuations—all while maintaining full stability and the ability to redeem USDT. Tether also pointed to its issuance of approximately $184 billion worth of USDT, assuring stakeholders that it holds sufficient reserves, including US Treasuries and other assets, to satisfy redemptions. Related Reading: Monad (MON) Price Skyrockets 80%, Emerges As Best Performer Among Top 100 Cryptos Notably, recent reports from the Financial Times reveal that Tether has emerged as the largest independent holder of gold globally, highlighting the firm’s increasing exposure to non-traditional reserve assets. According to the report, the stablecoin issuer bought more gold in the last quarter of the year than any central bank in the world. The figures show that the firm bought 26 tons of gold, adding to its substantial gold reserve of nearly 120 tons.

This massive movement, tracked by Onchain Lens, has sent ripples through the crypto community and raised important questions about institutional cryptocurrency strategies. What Does This SpaceX Bitcoin Transfer Mean? The recent SpaceX Bitcoin transaction represents one of the largest institutional crypto movements this month. According to blockchain analysts, the transfer occurred in a single transaction, moving the funds to a completely new address. This type of large-scale movement typically indicates either portfolio rebalancing, security upgrades, or strategic repositioning. SpaceX has been quietly accumulating Bitcoin since 2021, when Elon Musk first revealed the company’s cryptocurrency holdings. However, this particular SpaceX Bitcoin transfer stands out due to its timing and scale. Market observers are closely watching whether this signals a broader trend in corporate cryptocurrency management. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Moves So Important? When major companies like SpaceX make significant Bitcoin transactions, the entire market pays attention. Here’s why these moves matter: Market confidence indicators – Large transfers can signal institutional sentiment Price impact potential – Movements of this size can affect liquidity Adoption trends – Shows how corporations are integrating crypto into treasury management Regulatory implications – Demonstrates compliance with financial regulations The SpaceX Bitcoin transaction comes at a crucial time when institutional adoption is accelerating. Many corporations are following Tesla’s lead in adding cryptocurrency to their balance sheets, making movements like this SpaceX Bitcoin transfer particularly significant for market analysts. How Do We Know It’s Really SpaceX? Blockchain analytics firms like Onchain Lens use sophisticated tracking methods to identify wallet ownership. While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, several factors help identify the SpaceX Bitcoin address: Previous transaction patterns matching known corporate movements Connection to other verified institutional wallets Timing correlations with public company announcements Amount consistency with reported corporate holdings However, it’s important to note that absolute certainty in wallet attribution remains challenging. The identification of this as a SpaceX Bitcoin address relies on probabilistic analysis rather than definitive proof. What Could This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? This substantial SpaceX Bitcoin movement highlights several key trends in cryptocurrency adoption. First, it demonstrates that major corporations continue to actively manage their crypto assets rather than simply holding them statically. Second, the transaction size shows confidence in Bitcoin’s liquidity and market depth. Moreover, the SpaceX Bitcoin transfer occurs against a backdrop of increasing institutional interest. As more companies follow similar strategies, we can expect to see: More sophisticated corporate crypto management tools Increased regulatory clarity around institutional holdings Greater market stability from diversified ownership Enhanced security protocols for large-scale transfers Key Takeaways from the $105 Million Move The SpaceX Bitcoin transaction reminds us that institutional players are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their cryptocurrency strategies. This isn’t just about holding digital assets—it’s about active portfolio management and strategic positioning. For individual investors, movements like this SpaceX Bitcoin transfer serve as valuable learning opportunities. They demonstrate how large institutions approach risk management, security, and strategic allocation in the volatile crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions How was the SpaceX Bitcoin address identified? Blockchain analytics firms use pattern recognition, transaction history analysis, and correlation with public information to identify likely corporate wallets, though absolute certainty is difficult. Why would SpaceX move such a large amount of Bitcoin? Possible reasons include security upgrades, wallet management, portfolio rebalancing, or preparing for specific corporate actions. Does this affect Bitcoin’s price? While single transactions rarely directly impact price, large movements can signal institutional sentiment that influences market psychology. How common are corporate Bitcoin transfers? As more companies hold cryptocurrency, institutional transfers are becoming increasingly common as part of normal treasury management. Is my Bitcoin safe if large holders move funds? Yes, individual holdings are separate from corporate wallets. The Bitcoin network is designed to handle transactions of all sizes securely. What should I watch for after this SpaceX Bitcoin move? Monitor for follow-up transactions, official company statements, and whether similar movements occur with other corporate holders.

The latest data reveals the Altcoin Season Index remains firmly at 25, indicating Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency landscape. This crucial metric gives traders valuable insights into market cycles and investment opportunities. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital thermometer for cryptocurrency markets. Created by CoinMarketCap, this innovative tool measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period. When the index approaches 100, we enter altcoin season – that exciting period when alternative cryptocurrencies surge against Bitcoin. Currently sitting at 25, the index clearly signals we’re in Bitcoin season. This means most altcoins are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. Understanding this metric helps investors make informed decisions about portfolio allocation and timing. Why Does the Altcoin Season Index Matter for Your Portfolio? The Altcoin Season Index provides more than just market trivia – it offers actionable intelligence for crypto investors. Here’s why this metric deserves your attention: Market cycle identification – Helps recognize transitions between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance Risk assessment – Indicates when altcoin investments carry higher potential returns Timing strategy – Assists in determining optimal entry points for different cryptocurrency categories Portfolio rebalancing – Guides decisions about when to shift between Bitcoin and altcoins Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index regularly can significantly improve your investment timing and risk management. What Current Market Conditions Tell Us The persistent low reading on the Altcoin Season Index reflects several market realities. Bitcoin continues to attract institutional investment and mainstream attention, while many altcoins face regulatory uncertainty and reduced retail interest. However, experienced traders know that market conditions can change rapidly. Historical patterns show that extended Bitcoin dominance often precedes strong altcoin rallies. When the Altcoin Season Index eventually climbs, it typically signals increased risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller cryptocurrencies. Therefore, watching this index closely could help you catch the next major trend shift. How to Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy Successful cryptocurrency investing requires both patience and preparation. While the current Altcoin Season Index reading favors Bitcoin, smart investors use this time to research promising altcoin projects. Consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into selected altcoins during Bitcoin dominance periods Setting price alerts for when the Altcoin Season Index crosses key thresholds Diversifying across different cryptocurrency sectors and use cases Monitoring fundamental developments in altcoin projects you believe in Remember that the Altcoin Season Index is just one tool in your analytical toolkit, but it provides valuable context for broader market movements. When Might We See the Next Altcoin Season? Predicting exact timing for market shifts remains challenging, but several factors could trigger the next altcoin season. Increased regulatory clarity, breakthrough technological developments, or renewed retail interest could all contribute to a rising Altcoin Season Index. Many analysts watch for Bitcoin dominance to peak before expecting significant altcoin rotations. The current Altcoin Season Index at 25 suggests we might need to wait for broader market catalysts. However, cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile and can change direction quickly. Staying informed about this metric helps position you to capitalize on opportunities when they emerge. Final Thoughts on Navigating Crypto Seasons The Altcoin Season Index provides crucial insights for navigating cryptocurrency market cycles. While Bitcoin currently dominates, understanding these patterns helps prepare for future opportunities. Successful investors combine metric analysis with fundamental research and risk management. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to cryptocurrency, monitoring the Altcoin Season Index can enhance your market awareness and timing decisions. The current reading reminds us that patience often rewards investors who understand market cycles and maintain disciplined strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The Altcoin Season Index tracks whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. What reading indicates altcoin season? When the index approaches 100, it signals altcoin season. Readings closer to zero indicate Bitcoin dominance in the market. How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index updates daily, providing current insights into market performance and cryptocurrency rotations. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict exact price movements? While it indicates market trends, the index cannot predict exact prices. It serves best as one of several analytical tools for market assessment. Should I only invest during altcoin season? Different investment strategies work during various market phases. Many successful investors build positions during Bitcoin dominance periods in anticipation of future altcoin seasons. Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? You can find the Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap’s website along with other valuable cryptocurrency metrics and data. Found this analysis helpful?

After hitting its all-time high near $126,000 in early October, BTC has now lost more than 35% of its value, shaking investor confidence and fueling growing calls that the current bull cycle has ended. Market sentiment has shifted rapidly, with traders, analysts, and long-term participants reassessing expectations as price volatility intensifies and liquidity thins across major exchanges. What makes the current phase even more concerning is the behavior of short-term holders, who historically act as the most reactive segment of the market. According to key data shared by On-Chain Mind, short-term holders are now locking in the biggest realized losses in Bitcoin’s entire history. This level of loss realization surpasses the capitulation seen during the China mining ban, the FTX collapse, and even the COVID crash, marking an extreme phase of market distress. This unprecedented level of capitulation suggests that panic has taken control, with newer entrants exiting positions at steep losses. While some analysts argue that such events have historically preceded major reversals, others believe it signals the beginning of a prolonged downtrend. The coming days may determine which narrative takes hold. Short-Term Holders Face Record Losses as Market Capitulates On-Chain Mind reports that short-term holders are locking in more than $900 million in losses per day. This extreme level of loss realization reflects a phase of true capitulation. Short-term holders are historically the most sensitive to sharp price swings, and when they begin exiting at such magnitude, it often signals a breaking point in market sentiment. The data suggests that panic selling has reached levels never seen before, even when compared to major historical shock events. During the COVID crash, the China mining ban, and the FTX implosion, realized losses spiked sharply, yet none of those events reached the current scale. This places the present correction in a category of its own and raises questions about the structural stability of the market over the coming weeks. Some analysts argue that this marks the definitive beginning of a bear cycle, where confidence erodes and capital rotates out of risk assets. However, there remains a smaller group of optimistic voices who note that extreme capitulation has often preceded powerful recoveries. If Bitcoin stabilizes and buyers return, this could form a major macro bottom. The next move will likely define the market’s trajectory. BTC Tests Weekly Support After Sharp Reversal Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a steep reversal from the all-time high near $126,000, with price now trading around $86,900 after a rapid decline. The drawdown has positioned BTC back toward the key 100-week moving average, which is currently sitting just above $83,000 and acting as an important structural support level. Historically, this moving average has defined the boundary between bull-phase retracements and full macro trend breakdowns. A clean weekly close below it would strengthen the bear-market narrative that many analysts are now beginning to promote. Despite the severity of the decline, price is beginning to stabilize, forming a small reaction wick suggesting early attempts at demand absorption around the $80,000–$85,000 zone. This region coincides with prior consolidation from early in the cycle, making it a logical area for buyers to defend. However, momentum indicators remain pointed downward, and the distance from the 50-week moving average highlights the loss of trend strength. For the bullish case to re-emerge, Bitcoin would need to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 band, where broken support now acts as resistance. Until then, uncertainty remains elevated, and the weekly structure leans cautiously bearish.

The Pump.fun team just deposited $75 million to Kraken, adding fuel to growing cash-out concerns. This latest move brings their total withdrawals to a staggering $480 million, creating waves across the cryptocurrency community. What’s driving the Pump.fun cash-out speculation? According to blockchain analytics firm AmberCN, a wallet linked to the Pump.fun team transferred 75 million USDC to Kraken just eight hours ago. This follows a massive $400 million deposit on November 24th. The pattern suggests systematic withdrawal activity, though the team maintains these transfers aren’t cash-outs. However, the evidence tells a different story. Shortly after arriving at Kraken, 69.26 million USDC from today’s transfer moved directly to Circle. This movement to the stablecoin issuer typically indicates conversion to traditional currency, strengthening the cash-out theory. Why should investors care about this Pump.fun cash-out pattern? Large-scale withdrawals by project teams often signal important market shifts. When founders move significant amounts to exchanges, it can indicate: Profit-taking after substantial token appreciation Liquidity needs for operational expenses Portfolio rebalancing across different assets Market timing decisions based on price outlook The cumulative $480 million Pump.fun cash-out activity represents one of the largest DeFi team withdrawals this year. This scale naturally raises questions about the project’s treasury management and future plans. How does this affect the broader cryptocurrency market? Major movements like this Pump.fun cash-out activity create ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. Other DeFi projects may face increased scrutiny from investors watching for similar patterns. Exchange liquidity can also be impacted when large amounts enter the market simultaneously. Moreover, the timing of these transactions matters. The crypto market remains sensitive to large sell pressure, especially when it comes from prominent project teams. The continued denial from Pump.fun while evidence mounts creates uncertainty that can affect investor confidence. What’s next for Pump.fun amid cash-out concerns? The team’s previous clarification that deposits were unrelated to cashing out now faces serious challenges. The movement to Circle specifically contradicts their earlier statements. Investors will be watching closely for: Official statements addressing the latest transactions Treasury reports showing remaining project funds Development updates confirming ongoing commitment Market response to PUMP token price This situation highlights the importance of transparency in DeFi projects. When teams make large financial moves, clear communication helps maintain trust with their community. Key takeaways from the Pump.fun cash-out situation The pattern of large exchange deposits combined with transfers to Circle strongly suggests this is indeed a Pump.fun cash-out operation. The $480 million total represents significant selling pressure that could impact the token’s price stability. Investors should monitor these developments closely and consider what they might mean for their own positions in similar projects. While teams have every right to realize gains from their work, the manner and communication around these activities matter greatly for market confidence. The ongoing Pump.fun cash-out speculation serves as a reminder that in cryptocurrency, actions often speak louder than words. Frequently Asked Questions How much has Pump.fun withdrawn total? The total estimated amount cashed out now reaches approximately $480 million, including the latest $75 million deposit and previous $400 million transaction. Why are people calling this a cash-out? The movement of funds to Kraken followed by transfer to Circle typically indicates conversion to traditional currency, which is why analysts classify this as cash-out activity. What has Pump.fun said about these transactions? The team previously stated that deposits were unrelated to cashing out, but the evidence from recent transactions contradicts this explanation. How does this affect PUMP token holders? Large sell pressure from team members can impact token price and market confidence, making this important news for all PUMP holders. Should investors be worried about this activity? While concerning, investors should monitor official communications and project development updates to assess the long-term implications. What signs should investors watch for next? Key indicators include further large transactions, official team statements, treasury transparency, and development progress updates.

Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why With Federal Reserve rate-cut odds now above 80%, traders are positioning for a potential shift in risk appetite that could benefit major cryptocurrencies, especially ETH. ETH's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Fed Pivot Hopes and Institutional Demand Bolster Ethereum Ethereum has traded between $2,700 and $3,300 in recent weeks, but fresh catalysts are helping the asset stabilize above $2,900. The biggest driver is macroeconomic. CME FedWatch data shows the probability of a December interest-rate cut has surged from 30% to more than 80%. Lower interest rates typically encourage investment in risk-on assets such as crypto. Institutional flows reflect that shift. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $96.67 million in inflows on November 24, with BlackRock alone contributing $92.6 million, its first inflow in two weeks Treasury giant BitMine continues to accumulate aggressively, adding 69,822 ETH (over $200 million) last week and bringing its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, around 3% of the circulating supply. At the same time, whale wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH amassed 440,000 ETH in one week, signaling renewed confidence despite broader market caution. Ethereum (ETH) Poised for a Breakout Toward $3,400 Despite trading under the 20-day SMA at $3,132, Ethereum is showing early signs of bullish momentum. The MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory, and the RSI is sitting near the neutral 50 line, with room to move higher before hitting overbought levels. Other indicators strengthen the bullish case: Bollinger Bands: ETH’s position near 0.32 suggests price is closer to the lower band, a common rebound zone. Volume: Binance 24-hour trading volume around $1.27 billion indicates enough liquidity to support a breakout. ATR: With daily ATR at $201.62, volatility remains elevated, favoring sharp upside moves if momentum builds. The first major test remains $3,132. A clean breakout and two consecutive daily closes above this level would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push ETH toward the $3,400 target within 5–7 days. Beyond that, resistance at $3,658 becomes the next upside objective. Market Risks and Short-Term Outlook While bullish momentum is building, Ethereum still trades in a broad descending channel, and market structure remains fragile. Failure to reclaim $3,132 soon could send ETH back toward $2,750, with deeper support at $2,623 and the cycle low of $2,659. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November Broader crypto weakness, negative spot flows, or delays in network upgrades could delay a breakout. However, with rising institutional demand, whale accumulation, and rate-cut optimism, Ethereum’s probability of retesting $3,400 is steadily improving. Confidence Level medium is at Medium (65%), as ETH’s path to $3,400 remains viable but requires confirmation through key resistance levels.
