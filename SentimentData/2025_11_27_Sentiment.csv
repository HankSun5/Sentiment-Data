Gilbertie shared his perspective during a recent interview with analyst Paul Barron, where he emphasized Ripple’s disciplined approach and the scale of its ambitions. Ripple’s Structure and Vision Impress Teucrium CEO During the interview, Gilbertie described Ripple as an organization with strong internal coordination and a clear plan for expanding its blockchain-based payment solutions. He noted that the company’s operational structure and execution place it in a position to challenge established institutions. According to Gilbertie, the blockchain company is developing technology that aims to serve markets traditionally dominated by JPMorgan, a firm that manages more than $4.6 trillion in assets and plays a central role in global financial operations. JPMorgan processes approximately $10 trillion in transactions every day across more than 160 countries. Gilbertie pointed out that Ripple’s payment products are designed to target a share of this high-volume settlement activity. He added that Ripple has been moving in this direction methodically, and its ambitions will become more pronounced once it secures a banking license. Ripple applied for a U.S. banking charter through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in July. If granted, the license would permit the company to offer fiduciary services, including custody solutions for its RLUSD stablecoin. Gilbertie believes this development would significantly strengthen Ripple’s competitive position in the financial industry.

These concerns resurfaced after CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified that XRP remains central to Ripple’s roadmap, despite the firm’s expansion into other areas of financial technology. Gilbertie supported Garlinghouse’s stance, stating that Ripple has little incentive to dispose of its XRP reserves. He questioned the rationale behind selling large amounts of the token, arguing that maintaining its holdings aligns with the company’s broader objectives. However, he acknowledged that Ripple may sell limited quantities of XRP in the future, particularly if the asset’s value rises substantially. According to Gilbertie, Garlinghouse’s comments about XRP’s role in Ripple’s strategy were understated. He suggested that Ripple’s technology and services have a much larger potential impact than some observers recognize. This is not the first time Gilbertie has expressed confidence in Ripple’s direction. Earlier in the year, he stated that Ripple could one day serve as an alternative to SWIFT, the dominant messaging system used for international bank transfers. He also reiterated his view that XRP offers considerable utility and demand within the digital asset market.

BLOK's portfolio balances core blockchain companies with exposure to bitcoin miners, exchanges, fintech, and AI-adjacent large caps, reducing single-stock and bitcoin price risk. Compared to peers, BLOK delivers superior risk-reward, lower volatility, and thematic diversification, making it a standout choice for crypto ecosystem exposure. I rate BLOK as overweight in a crypto portfolio, emphasizing its structural advantages, empirical performance, and potential to benefit from broader blockchain adoption. There are many alternatives when it comes to investing in the crypto ecosystem, looking beyond just bitcoins and bitcoin mining companies. I recently wrote about an AI-powered Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF (STCE), and found it a decent Buy. The Amplify Blockchain Technology ETF ( BLOK ) is another name I recommend. It has been an outperformer, remaining with the top half of the crypto pack (say STCE, DAPP, BKCH) in most market conditions and has some structural advantages (that we will discuss in this article) that make it a long term Buy. The volatility of the crypto space is huge and investors need to have high growth high risk appetite to be able to ride this ETF. Also, to cut idiosyncratic risks, I particularly emphasize a basket of ETFs each having their own strengths. So, while STCE does find a place in that portfolio for its unbiased rules-based but active-like positioning (backed by performance data), BLOK's active strategy presents a decent balance of investments beyond mining and bitcoin prices, optional plays in AI and a well-diversified portfolio (low single-stock risks). Methodology and Portfolio BLOK's investment universe starts from companies meaningfully involved in blockchain development, usage, R&D or commercialization. Managers check for blockchain relevance (including profiting from blockchain based data). The portfolio of 40-60 stocks comprises a 70% core holding in companies who derive significant revenue from blockchain. The remaining portfolio (secondary ~30%) consists of companies having partnerships and investments in the space. Stocks are weighted equally within each group, although the active methodology means deviations over time (particularly given the portfolio size and idiosyncratic volatile moves between stocks). However, individual stock risk looks relatively muted compared to STCE (top weight ~11.3%), VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) (top weight ~8.64%) and Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) (~13.12%). The top 10 holdings account for a reasonable ~35% of the total portfolio — not too concentrated. For comparison here are the top 10 total weightings: for DAPP ~60%, BKCH ~71% and STCE~60%. The diversification is a real structural strength for a crypto-themed ETF and should help protect the portfolio from adverse movements in single stocks. Top 10 Holdings - BLOK (Seeking Alpha) Inferences from the Portfolio Based on a manual scan of the current holdings , I found ~22% investments in bitcoin miners and infrastructure, names like HUT 8 Corp (HUT), Cipher Mining, Inc. (CIFR) and TeraWulf, Inc. (WULF). This is the most correlated part of BLOK to crypto prices and is reasonably low exposure to that extent. Adding another ~8% exposure in bitcoin ETFs and Trusts like iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) or even Strategy Inc (MSTR), the total bitcoin correlated part of the portfolio adds up to only ~30%. The bulk of the portfolio benefits beyond simply bitcoin price moves, unlike a mining focused ETF like say CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF (WGMI). Exchanges and Brokerages account for a significant ~24% of the portfolio — companies like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD), Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) and CME Group, Inc. (CME). These companies generate revenues from trading and services fees. They need transaction volumes and not bitcoin price appreciation directly. They can benefit from greater bitcoin adoption and trading, so lower volatility over time in crypto prices is more important than a bull market alone (of course, a bull market helps). Then there is a ~17% exposure in payments and fintech to companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL), NU Holdings Ltd. (NU) and even MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI). This layer is very diversified on its own with companies like MercadoLibre's share prices having very low dependency on bitcoin prices. Even the more dependent names like Paypal and Nu Holdings will benefit from increased crypto adoption (i.e. if bitcoin becomes a more accepted currency globally) versus sheer price appreciation. BLOK also has ~15% in enterprise blockchain and AI-adjacent large caps — NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) are in this mix. They walk into the ETF on the basis of infrastructure support to mining and blockchain technology (from chips to cloud support). This is a very good diversification away from crypto prices and happens to have an AI optionality too in a lot of cases (like Nvidia and AMD). Performance Insights The diversification by theme and a breakaway from the crypto prices provide substantial alpha avenues for BLOK. BLOK could grow in many ways: AI compute, semis, fintech volumes, enterprise software spending or even tokenization. The bulk of BLOK doesn’t need Bitcoin prices to rise - it only needs Bitcoin to keep getting adopted. Adoption happens when volatility falls, not when prices spike alone. Even within the ~30% of the portfolio more directly linked with bitcoin prices, surprises happen. Some traditional miners are turning into AI compute and hosting, like TeraWulf and Core Scientific, Inc. (CORZ). These shares actually led to a significant surge in BLOK at a time when bitcoin prices did not rise at all. At some point in October, BLOK was up 50% while bitcoin was still flat. Data by YCharts This AI side story was of course very well captured in a bitcoin mining focused ETF like WGMI where IREN Limited (IREN) and Cipher Mining (both together account for over a third of the overall portfolio). WGMI tripled in October due to this evolving story, but has also fallen by 42% since. WGMI's volatility is actually what makes BLOK's diversification more risk aware, both in terms of single stock exposure as well as exposure to several agnostic themes. I have already charted the outperformance in BLOK versus IBIT (a proxy for bitcoin), illustrating its reward potential versus bitcoins. This comes at the cost of volatility that is lower than bitcoin's. In terms of standard deviations, BLOK shows 10% lower standard deviation than IBIT and less than half of WGMI. Both empirically, and in terms of how the portfolio is structured, expect BLOK to have a far superior risk-reward asymmetry than IBIT or WGMI like bitcoin focused bets. A comparison with other crypto-themed ETFs also show BLOK has been in the top 2 most of the time over the past 3 years (observe the trajectory and not only the end point outperformance). Here are the standard deviation numbers for the risk/volatility perspective - BLOK ~45, STCE ~63, BKCH ~77 and DAPP ~74. Overall, BLOK is consistently towards the higher end of the total return spectrum within the crypto pack, while its risks are far lower. That calls for overweighing BLOK in any crypto and blockchain portfolio. Data by YCharts Overweight BLOK I rate BLOK a Buy backed by several empirical evidences and structural advantages. First, its single stock diversification is best-in-class. Secondly, thematic diversification means lower volatility. Third, empirical performance shows these expectations actually translate to real life performance. BLOK outperforms most of the crypto pack most of the time and keeps volatility levels low. Overall, I am bullish this ETF segment, that invests on a crypto ecosystem rather than just bitcoins and mining. This positions it to gain from simply better adoption over bitcoin appreciation. With regulatory supports coming in , in the US as well as elsewhere, as bitcoin adoption grows, this theme will likely keep growing. Crypto investing cannot be defensive given its volatility, so investors should have the risk appetite to wade through 50% MTM losses at some point. A systematic accumulation over time works. At least the wider crypto plays makes for lower volatility levels - but still may require similar levels of risk appetite. The overall crypto ecosystem bet looks bullish otherwise, with BLOK a material overweight in that portfolio.",STCE|BKCH|DAPP|BLOK,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-26 23:38:12

Whales have started moving large volumes of PEPE to exchanges, a classic red flag that a sell-off could be near. According to Nansen, exchange-held PEPE has jumped from 250 trillion on November 6 to 258 trillion today, marking a 30-day high. This comes as open interest in PEPE futures sinks to just $165 million, far below its $1 billion peak in July. With sentiment crumbling and traders pulling back, the risk of a deeper drop is growing fast. Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Could Bounce Back Strongly If It Drops to This Key Area Since the year started, Pepe has lost over 77% of its value. As a result, it is one of the worst-performing tokens in the market and the biggest loser of the top 5 in the meme coin category. The weekly chart shows that Pepe just hit a key support area at $0.0000040. This level lies right above a weekly fair value gap (FVG). These FVGs are price imbalances caused by a strong surge in the demand for an asset. This FVG dates back to February 2024, back when Pepe’s popularity was surging. If the price dips to this level in the next few days, the odds of a strong rebound will increase. In the mean time, a new mine-to-earn (M2E) game inspired in the Pepe the Frog meme called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has received millions from investors. This early presale gamifies crypto mining and could outperform the OG Pepe this year. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Turns Mining Into an Interactive Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is reimagining how crypto mining works by introducing a fun game where players can launch virtual servers and rigs to earn meme coins and compete for rewards. No expensive hardware is needed to run your mining operation. Simply invest $PEPENODE tokens to get your virtual server up and fire up as many rigs as you want. Top miners who make it to the leaderboard will receive airdrops of top tokens like Bonk ($BONK) and Pepe ($PEPE). In addition, the game incorporates referral boosts, anti-bot protection, and a token burn program. This last feature removes up to 70% of the $PEPENODE used for upgrading rigs from circulation, increasing scarcity of the token. To buy $PEPENODE and start mining right away, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet. You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead.

The body representing exchanges voicing its concerns comes as the SEC considers whether to issue a form of “innovation exemption” that would allow crypto companies to offer blockchain-based tokens representing exposure to listed stocks, instruments that would be sold to US retail investors without the platforms registering as broker-dealers. This proposal, which is supported by several crypto platforms, is being considered by SEC chair Paul Atkins, highlighting the agency’s recalibrated approach to digital assets under the Trump administration . The tokenization debate divides traditional and crypto finance This is not the first time the WFE has raised concerns about tokenized equities. In August, it wrote to regulators in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, urging a crackdown on unlicensed platforms offering tokenized stocks, warning of investor-protection issues and reputational risks for listed companies whose names are used without consent. It went further to ask that regulators apply the same rules used on securities to tokenized assets. Despite the body’s concerns, interest in tokenization continues to grow across the financial sector. Large banks, asset managers, and trading venues have begun exploring blockchain-based settlement and token-form assets as part of efforts to modernize financial infrastructure. The trend has gained more traction this year as crypto-native platforms seek direct access to the US equities market, while traditional exchanges experiment with on-chain settlement models. Nasdaq’s push for regulated tokenized securities. Nasdaq, one of the WFE’s most prominent members, has simultaneously been pushing for a regulated path toward tokenization. In September, it submitted a formal rule-change proposal that would allow the exchange to list and trade stocks in tokenized form, assigning the digital instruments the same regulatory treatment, including rights and CUSIP identification, as conventional shares. However, Ondo Finance, a blockchain startup offering financial market solutions, called for delays until Nasdaq provides further details on how trades in tokenized form would be processed through the Depository Trust Company, which operates the core plumbing of US securities settlement. Within the WFE itself, members acknowledge tokenization’s potential. The letter describes blockchain-based equity instruments as a “natural evolution in capital markets.” However, many exchanges argue that innovation must occur within the existing regulatory framework rather than through exemptions granted to unlicensed crypto platforms. James Auliffe, head of the WFE’s technology working group, said equity markets are already “very, very efficient,” and that proponents of moving trading onto blockchains still need to prove the benefits outweigh the costs. High stakes for regulators and markets The SEC’s decision on the matter will shape the future of how equities are traded and accessed in the US. Allowing tokenized stocks to be offered without conventional broker-dealer oversight could potentially enable firms outside the traditional financial system to compete directly with exchanges and brokers that face far stricter compliance obligations. Investor advocates fear that retail traders may not understand the difference between owning a token linked to a stock and holding the real equity itself. Earlier this year, companies including OpenAI warned that tokenized versions of their shares circulating on trading apps did not represent actual ownership. Don’t just read crypto news.

In a move that highlights the critical importance of metadata privacy , Buterin donated 128 ETH each to two decentralized messaging platforms – Session and SimpleX. This substantial contribution underscores his commitment to solving one of the most pressing challenges in modern technology. Why Is Metadata Privacy So Crucial Today? When we think about privacy, we often focus on message content. However, metadata privacy protects the information about our communications – who we talk to, when we communicate, and for how long. This data can reveal sensitive patterns about our lives, relationships, and activities. Buterin recognizes that true digital freedom requires protecting both message content and communication patterns. What Makes Session and SimpleX Special for Metadata Protection? Both platforms approach metadata privacy from different but complementary angles. Session uses a decentralized network of service nodes that don’t require phone numbers or personal information. Meanwhile, SimpleX employs a unique architecture where users control their own servers. Here are their key advantages: No phone number or email required for registration Decentralized infrastructure prevents single points of failure Advanced encryption protects both content and connection data Open-source code allows community verification How Will These Donations Advance Metadata Privacy Technology? The 256 ETH total donation (approximately $800,000 at current prices) provides significant resources for both projects to accelerate development. This funding will help them tackle the core challenges Buterin identified: Permissionless account creation without personal identifiers Enhanced protection against metadata analysis Improved user experience while maintaining security Broader adoption through better documentation and tools What Does This Mean for the Future of Private Communication? Buterin’s endorsement signals a major shift in priorities for the cryptocurrency community. By supporting these projects, he’s encouraging developers and users to prioritize metadata privacy as a fundamental right. This move could inspire similar investments and innovations across the decentralized technology space. How Can You Support Metadata Privacy Initiatives? Buterin explicitly encouraged the community to participate in both projects. Here are practical ways you can contribute: Download and use Session or SimpleX for your daily communications Contribute to their open-source code repositories Help with documentation and user education Spread awareness about the importance of metadata privacy Vitalik Buterin’s strategic donations represent more than just financial support – they’re a clear statement about the future direction of private communication. By backing Session and SimpleX, he’s helping build a world where true metadata privacy becomes accessible to everyone, not just technical experts. This investment in foundational technology could ultimately benefit millions of users seeking genuine digital privacy. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is metadata in messaging? Metadata refers to information about your communications rather than the content itself. This includes who you’re talking to, when messages are sent, message frequency, and device information. Why did Vitalik choose 128 ETH specifically? While Buterin didn’t specify why 128 ETH, the number holds significance in computer science as a power of two, potentially symbolizing his technical background and the binary nature of digital systems. Are Session and SimpleX completely anonymous? While they offer strong privacy protections, no system provides perfect anonymity. Both platforms significantly reduce metadata exposure compared to traditional messaging apps. Can I use these apps alongside my current messaging services? Yes, both Session and SimpleX can be installed alongside other messaging apps, allowing you to gradually transition sensitive conversations to more private platforms. How do these donations impact Ethereum’s price? While the donations show confidence in Ethereum’s utility, the amount represents a small fraction of daily trading volume and isn’t likely to significantly impact price movements. What makes these platforms different from Signal or Telegram? Unlike Signal and Telegram, Session and SimpleX don’t require phone numbers and use decentralized architectures that provide stronger protection against metadata collection.

Then every post tied to the rollout quietly disappeared from his social media platforms without explanation, That disappearance was enough rocket fuel for McGregor. “There is just no way good guy Khabib used his late father’s name, as well as Dagestan’s culture, to scam his fans,” McGregor wrote on X. “Fire selling digital NFTs online and then deleting all the content after they were sold, he added. “what a shame and a stain on his father’s name,” he wrote further. Khabib denies NFT scam He didn’t stop there and stated that “Father’s plan has now become Father’s scam. Very sad.” McGregor’s timing wasn’t accidental, as he recently insisted on preparing for a 2025 comeback. However, recently re-entered the drug-testing pool. The former champ has been teasing a return ever since the UFC confirmed plans for a blockbuster White House event in 2026. Khabib did respond to the allegations and denied the accusations. He went on to call McGregor “an absolute liar” while defending both the project and his family’s reputation. Sources close to the launch say the NFT collection was framed as a tribute to his late father, Abdulmanap. It was supposed to be a digital keepsake rather than a speculative cash-grab. Source: Conor McGregor’s X post (Now deleted) The situation took a hit within hours when On-chain investigator ZachXBT stepped into the conversation. He didn’t defend Khabib, but turned McGregor’s own words against him. He reposted McGregor’s accusations with receipts from the fighter’s own 2022 NFT project, “McGregor Realm.” It was rolled out with celebrity fanfare and then quietly vanished from his feeds in a similar fashion. “Sound familiar?” the investigator asked. The back-and-forth instantly revived one of MMA’s most bitter rivalries. NFTPRICEFLOOR data shows that the global NFT market cap hovers around $3,3 billion. It jumped by around a 4% change over the last 24 hours. The global crypto turned up for the recovery rally as its total market cap regained the $3.1 trillion mark. Its 24 hour trading volume clicked $140 million. Bitcoin price surge above $90,000 has given bulls some hope. Their feud has stayed alive for six years, even though one retired as the undefeated lightweight champion and the other has been recovering from a career-halting leg break. As of now, McGregor is signaling a comeback and Khabib is returning fire publicly for the first time in a while.

Market data across multiple timeframes indicates that ADA continues to face an uncertain short-term outlook despite minor intraday improvements. Overview of Recent ADA Performance The asset experienced a sharp retracement late in November, declining from approximately $0.47 on Nov. 20 to around $0.39 the next day. Over the last 24 hours, ADA has traded within a relatively narrow range between $0.4065 and $0.4274, reflecting efforts by buyers to stabilize the market while still encountering selling pressure near the upper band of the range. On broader time horizons, bearish sentiment remains dominant. Cardano has recorded a 6.4% decline over the past week and a 38.52% drop across the past month. The token’s market capitalization has also fallen to $15.06 billion, reinforcing market concerns about sustained weakness. With these indicators, analysts are watching to see whether buyers can regain influence or whether ADA may extend its corrective structure. Technical Assessment: Resistance Levels Remain Firm Analysis of Cardano’s weekly chart shows that the asset is still positioned beneath several influential resistance zones. The Ichimoku Cloud framework continues to identify a negative trend, with ADA trading well below the cloud. This structure confirms ongoing weakness and reinforces the challenge ahead for any bullish reversal. The Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen lines are also aligned in a bearish configuration, currently positioned at $0.59 and $0.65. These levels represent immediate barriers that ADA must reclaim before attempting any broader recovery. For a shift in market structure toward a more favorable trajectory, Cardano must close decisively above the cloud, with the region around $0.75 serving as the central threshold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If sellers maintain their hold, ADA could revisit lower supports, particularly near $0.29. The Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) provides additional insight, currently registering at -75.33. Although some signs of stabilization exist, the indicator reflects continued difficulty in generating sustained upward momentum. The lack of a firm close above key resistance, combined with depressed momentum readings, supports a cautious outlook for the near term. Beyond technical indicators, Cardano’s social activity offers a contrasting data point. A recent snapshot from Mintern shows that ADA holds a 9.6% share of social media discussions among major chains. This significantly exceeds the engagement levels of networks such as XRP at 2.9%, Solana at 1.55%, and USDC at 1.55%. High social visibility suggests that Cardano maintains a notably active and involved community. While social dominance does not guarantee immediate price appreciation, it often reflects resilience in market interest, which can influence sentiment-driven trading activity.

Related Reading: Hoskinson Claims Cardano Revival Starts Now: Here’s What’s Coming The fifth-largest U.S. bank is piloting a dollar-backed stablecoin on Stellar, an initiative that could accelerate institutional adoption and strengthen market confidence in XLM heading into year-end. U.S. Bancorp Selects Stellar for Bank-Grade Stablecoin Infrastructure The Minneapolis-based banking giant has partnered with PwC and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) to test programmable deposits and stablecoin payments on Stellar’s public blockchain. What sets Stellar apart, according to U.S. Bank’s digital assets head Mike Villano, is its built-in ability to freeze assets, unwind transactions, and enforce compliance at the protocol level. These capabilities are essential for regulated banks that must adhere to KYC, AML, and consumer protection standards. Unlike traditional “business logic” solutions, Stellar offers these controls directly at the blockchain layer, giving banks the confidence needed to explore tokenized finance. The pilot arrives amid a resurgence of institutional interest. Banks, including Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, have begun designing stablecoin frameworks. U.S. Bank recently relaunched its digital assets division to tap into opportunities in custody, tokenisation, and blockchain-based payments. Institutional Momentum Could Drive Mainstream Stablecoin Adoption If successful, U.S. Bancorp’s trial could pave the way for fully regulated, deposit-backed stablecoins issued directly by banks, unlocking new efficiencies for cross-border transfers, treasury operations, and global settlements. With projections suggesting that stablecoin payments could reach $1 trillion annually by 2030, banks are racing to claim their share of the digital payments market. Stellar’s high uptime, low-cost settlement, and remittance-focused architecture make it an appealing choice for real-world financial applications. As institutions embrace public blockchains, Stellar stands positioned as one of the few networks offering both decentralization and the regulatory controls banks require. XLM Price Outlook: Analyst Targets Signal 24–36% Upside The U.S. Bancorp announcement has arrived at a pivotal time for Stellar’s native token, XLM . Trading near $0.25, the asset is showing early signs of bullish momentum, supported by: MACD bullish divergence Neutral RSI at 42, offering room to climb Price sitting on 20-EMA support Breakout potential above $0.28–$0.31 Analysts expect XLM to target the $0.31–$0.34 range within the next 2–4 weeks, a potential 24–36% upside, if volume expands and the broader crypto market remains stable. A break below $0.22 would invalidate the bullish thesis. Related Reading: South Korea Risks Stablecoin Legislation Delay As Financial Authorities Clash With BOK As Wall Street experiments with Stellar’s blockchain, institutional utility could become a significant driver for XLM’s long-term valuation.

With price momentum weakening and long-term trend indicators flashing bearish warning signals, the possibility of a price crash to $38,000 is becoming hard to ignore. 50-MA Breakdown To Trigger $38,000 Bitcoin Price Crash The Bitcoin price action took a decisive turn this week as the market slipped below the 50 MA for the first time in this four-year cycle. Severino noted in his technical analysis shared on X this Monday that the 50 MA has historically marked the beginning of extended downturns. He stated that following Bitcoin’s launch over 14 years ago, every time it has closed below the 50 MA, a prolonged bear market has followed. Related Reading: Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days Severino’s price chart highlights BTC’s price performance from 2017 to date. In the past three Bitcoin bear markets, after the price fell below the 50-week MA, BTC continued to drop an additional 61%, 59%, and 67%. On average, the cryptocurrency has lost 62% from the break point. Applying the 62% drawdown to this cycle’s 50 MA level, the analyst predicts Bitcoin could soon experience a price crash to $38,000. From the cryptocurrency’s current price of above $87,000, this represents a staggering 60% decline. Additionally, it would imply a roughly 70% decline from its all-time high of more than $126,000. Severino warns that traders calling for a price bottom may be ignoring how far Bitcoin has historically fallen once this long-term trend fails. He indicated that the 50-week MA has repeatedly served as a dividing line between bullish and bearish phases, and that price slipping below it has more often led to extended periods of weakness and capitulation. Bitcoin Momentum Indicator Falls To Historic Lows A second analysis presented by Severino focuses on Bitcoin’s daily LMACD, which is now near levels not seen in more than 1,250 days. The oscillator has only pushed below this level six times since BTC’s 2017 macro peak. These past instances correspond to periods of heavy downside momentum where the cryptocurrency had yet to complete its bottoming process. Related Reading: One Of The Most Popular Bitcoin Advocates Dumps Millions In BTC, Here’s Why Looking at Severino’s price chart, the extended period without revisiting this lower bound suggests Bitcoin may be overdue for a momentum reset. The LMACD indicator’s current reading is also unusually weak historically, signaling that market momentum has not yet reached extreme pessimism. The readings further indicate that, although BTC remains in a downtrend, price corrections remain possible before a true bottom is established. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is trading below $87,000 amid volatile, choppy conditions that have contributed to its 24% decline over the past month.

This approval positions Securitize as the only available company possessing licensed tokenisation infrastructure in both the European Union and the US. This news was made public after Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) reportedly permitted the company to run its system throughout the bloc. Notably, this government agency is the country’s securities regulator responsible for supervising and regulating Spain’s securities markets and financial sector. With this go-ahead in place, Securitize outlined its intentions to make use of its European trading and settlement system on Avalanche . When reporters asked the firm why it chose this network, it acknowledged that the network has fast settlement times and an adaptable setup that meets the needs of institutions. In the meantime, sources hinted that the first issuance under this new approval is expected to take place in early 2026. Securitize secures approval to run its system throughout the EU Apart from securing approval to run a regulated trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime, an earlier report dated December 2024 also noted that Securitize acquired a separate Investment Firm license from CNMV. This license played a significant role in the firm’s operations, as it enabled its team to execute orders, secure assets, and serve as a digital transfer agent for tokenised securities. Since then, Securitize has solidified its position as a leader in the financial services and fintech sectors. It achieved this major success after the license began to be recognised in key countries in the EU, such as the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany, and Luxembourg. Interestingly, the new approval takes a step further by permitting Securitize to manage the market infrastructure directly. This means that the company can freely establish a regulated setting primarily for issuing, trading, and settling tokenised securities across the EU. Moreover, the new authorisation links smoothly with Securitize’s existing US operations, where the firm acts as a registered broker-dealer, digital transfer agent, fund administrator and alternative trading system. To further illustrate its commitment to solidify its position as a leader in the industry, Securitize recently made clear its plan to go public via a $1.25 billion SPAC deal backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. Following the announcement of this intention, sources revealed that the company has become a significant provider of tokenisation infrastructure for key institutions, including Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, and VanEck. To support this claim, it was discovered that Securitize is responsible for BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which is the first on-chain Treasurys product to surpass a record of $1 billion in assets and has now surged to over $4 billion. Securitize made clear its intentions to go public Last month, reports highlighted that Securitize was the latest crypto-focused firm to reveal its intentions to go public. At the time, the company had valued itself at $1.25 billion before any investments were made. The tokenisation leader is planning to list in the US. Once the necessary steps for going public are finalized, sources close to the situation pointed out that the new entity will go by the name Securitize Corp. and be listed on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol SECZ. Securitize also plans to tokenise its own shares. In a statement, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo commented that this is a crucial moment for Securitize and for the future of finance. “We started this company to make capital markets more open, clear, and efficient through tokenisation. This marks an important step toward making financial markets as fast as the internet and advancing our mission to bring the next generation of finance on-chain and tokenize everything.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This sudden maintenance action, which began at 11:55 p.m. UTC on November 26, affects millions of users worldwide. The Upbit emergency inspection represents a crucial security measure, but it also raises important questions about what prompted this urgent action and when normal operations will resume. What Triggered This Upbit Emergency Inspection? The cryptocurrency community was taken by surprise when Upbit announced its emergency maintenance. While the exchange hasn’t revealed specific details about what prompted this urgent Upbit emergency inspection, such measures typically occur for several reasons. Exchange platforms often conduct emergency inspections to address potential security vulnerabilities, update system protocols, or investigate suspicious activities. This proactive approach demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to user asset protection, though it does cause temporary inconvenience. Regular maintenance helps prevent larger issues down the line. However, emergency inspections like this Upbit emergency inspection usually indicate the platform has identified something requiring immediate attention. The timing suggests the exchange prioritizes security over convenience, even if it means disrupting trading activities during peak hours. How Does This Upbit Emergency Inspection Affect Your Trading? During this Upbit emergency inspection period, users face specific limitations that impact their trading strategies. Understanding these restrictions helps you plan accordingly and avoid frustration. All digital asset deposits are temporarily suspended Withdrawal requests cannot be processed Existing balances remain secure and unaffected Trading between cryptocurrencies may continue normally Fiat currency transactions are also paused This comprehensive Upbit emergency inspection means you cannot move funds onto or off the exchange until maintenance completes. However, your stored assets remain safe, and the inspection doesn’t affect your ability to trade between different cryptocurrencies already in your Upbit wallet. When Will Normal Services Resume After This Upbit Emergency Inspection? Upbit has not provided a specific timeline for when the Upbit emergency inspection will conclude. Historically, similar emergency maintenance periods on major exchanges have lasted anywhere from a few hours to several days. The duration typically depends on the complexity of the issues being addressed and the thoroughness required to ensure complete system security. Users should monitor Upbit’s official communication channels for updates. The exchange will likely provide progress reports through their website, social media accounts, and email notifications. Patience is crucial during these security measures, as rushing the process could compromise the effectiveness of the Upbit emergency inspection. Why Should You Support This Upbit Emergency Inspection? While temporary service suspensions are inconvenient, this Upbit emergency inspection ultimately benefits all users. Security measures protect your investments from potential threats that could cause far greater damage than temporary access restrictions. The cryptocurrency space has seen numerous exchange hacks resulting in massive losses, making proactive security essential. This Upbit emergency inspection demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to maintaining robust security standards. By addressing potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, Upbit protects both individual users and the broader ecosystem. Such responsible practices help build trust in cryptocurrency platforms and contribute to mainstream adoption. What Can You Do During the Upbit Emergency Inspection? While waiting for the Upbit emergency inspection to conclude, savvy traders can use this time productively. You can research new investment opportunities, analyze market trends, or educate yourself about security best practices. This unexpected pause provides an opportunity to review your trading strategy and ensure you’re prepared when services resume. Remember that other exchanges continue operating normally, though transferring assets between platforms isn’t possible during the Upbit emergency inspection. Use this time to diversify your knowledge rather than worrying about temporary access limitations. Final Thoughts on the Upbit Emergency Inspection The Upbit emergency inspection, while inconvenient, represents the exchange’s strong commitment to security and user protection. In the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, such proactive measures are essential for maintaining trust and preventing catastrophic security breaches. While the temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals disrupts trading activities, the long-term benefits of enhanced security far outweigh the short-term inconveniences. As we await further updates from Upbit regarding their emergency inspection, remember that security should always take priority over convenience in the digital asset space. This incident serves as a reminder that even major exchanges must remain vigilant against emerging threats in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is happening with Upbit? Upbit is conducting an emergency inspection of its digital asset deposit and withdrawal systems, temporarily suspending these services to ensure platform security. Can I still trade cryptocurrencies on Upbit during the inspection? Yes, trading between different cryptocurrencies already in your Upbit wallet should continue normally.

Emergency maintenance typically lasts from several hours to a few days, depending on the issues being addressed. Is my money safe during this inspection? Yes, your existing balances remain secure and unaffected. The inspection is a preventive measure to enhance security, not a response to lost funds. Will I be notified when services resume? Upbit will likely announce when services resume through their official website, social media channels, and email notifications to registered users.

This crucial market sentiment indicator has climbed seven points from yesterday’s reading, yet remains firmly in the danger zone. But what does this actually mean for your cryptocurrency holdings and future investments? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Should You Care? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional thermometer, measuring investor sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100. When the index reads 0, it indicates maximum fear, while 100 represents extreme greed. Currently sitting at 22, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests that market participants are overwhelmingly pessimistic. This emotional gauge combines multiple data points to provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. The index calculation incorporates six key factors: Volatility (25% weighting) Market volume (25% weighting) Social media sentiment (15% weighting) Survey results (15% weighting) Bitcoin dominance (10% weighting) Google search trends (10% weighting) How Does Extreme Fear Impact Cryptocurrency Prices? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index drops into extreme fear territory, several market dynamics typically emerge. First, selling pressure often increases as nervous investors exit positions. Second, buying opportunities may appear for contrarian investors who recognize that extreme fear often precedes market rebounds. Historical data shows that when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaches these levels, it frequently marks potential turning points in market cycles. However, extreme fear can also create self-fulfilling prophecies. As more investors react to the low Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading, their fearful actions can drive prices even lower. This creates a challenging environment where emotional decisions often override rational analysis. Strategic Moves During Extreme Fear Periods Navigating markets when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicates extreme fear requires careful strategy. Consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into quality projects Setting clear stop-losses to manage risk Diversifying across different cryptocurrency sectors Maintaining cash reserves for potential opportunities Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures current sentiment, not future performance. Many successful investors have used periods of extreme fear to accumulate positions at discounted prices. Historical Patterns of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has proven remarkably accurate at identifying market extremes throughout cryptocurrency history. Previous instances where the index reached similar levels often preceded significant price movements. However, timing these turns remains challenging even with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a guide. Market veterans often watch for divergence between price action and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. When prices make new lows while the index begins improving, it can signal potential trend changes. This makes monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index essential for informed decision-making. FAQs: Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 22 mean? A reading of 22 indicates extreme fear in cryptocurrency markets. This suggests most investors are pessimistic and selling pressure dominates trading activity. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing regular snapshots of market sentiment as conditions evolve throughout trading sessions. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price bottoms? While not a perfect timing tool, extreme fear readings often coincide with market bottoms, making it valuable for identifying potential buying zones. Should I sell when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear? Extreme fear often presents buying opportunities rather than selling signals, though individual circumstances and risk tolerance should guide decisions. How accurate is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index historically? The index has reliably identified emotional extremes in past market cycles, though it works best when combined with other analysis tools. Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index work for altcoins? While heavily weighted toward Bitcoin, the index reflects overall cryptocurrency sentiment that typically affects altcoins as well.

The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) is raising alarms about unregulated crypto firms selling these digital assets. In a bold move, they’ve urged the SEC to step in and protect investors from potential market risks. This clash between innovation and regulation could determine the future of digital finance. Why Are Tokenized Stocks Causing Regulatory Concerns? The WFE recently sent a crucial letter to the SEC expressing deep concerns. They warned that allowing crypto companies to sell tokenized stocks without proper oversight could harm investor interests. This comes after the SEC considered exempting these firms from broker-dealer registration requirements. The federation argues this creates an uneven playing field where traditional exchanges follow strict rules while crypto platforms operate with more freedom. What Risks Do Unregulated Tokenized Stocks Pose? Tokenized stocks represent real company shares but exist as digital tokens on blockchain networks. However, without regulation: Investors might lack proper protection against fraud Market manipulation could become easier Price discrepancies between real and tokenized stocks may occur Legal recourse for investors could be limited The WFE emphasizes that exemptions shouldn’t let companies bypass fundamental regulatory principles that protect markets. How Does Fair Competition Affect Tokenized Stocks? The federation insists that all market participants must compete under the same rules. Traditional stock exchanges undergo rigorous oversight, while crypto platforms might operate with less scrutiny. This imbalance could: Undermine market integrity Create unfair advantages Weaken investor confidence in tokenized stocks Potentially destabilize financial markets Therefore, the WFE advocates for consistent regulation across all platforms offering tokenized stocks. What’s Next for Tokenized Stocks Regulation? The SEC now faces pressure to balance innovation with investor protection. Their decision could set a precedent for how tokenized stocks are treated globally. Market participants are watching closely as this could determine whether digital assets can safely coexist with traditional financial instruments. The outcome will likely influence how quickly tokenized stocks gain mainstream adoption. Conclusion: Striking the Right Balance for Tokenized Stocks The WFE’s intervention highlights the critical need for thoughtful regulation of tokenized stocks. While innovation drives progress, investor protection must remain paramount. As digital assets continue evolving, regulatory frameworks must adapt to ensure markets remain fair, transparent, and secure for all participants. The future of tokenized stocks depends on getting this balance right. Frequently Asked Questions What are tokenized stocks? Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional company shares that exist on blockchain networks, allowing for easier trading and transfer. Why is the WFE concerned about tokenized stocks? The WFE worries that unregulated trading of tokenized stocks could expose investors to unnecessary risks and create unfair market conditions. What does the SEC’s proposed exemption mean? The SEC considered allowing crypto firms to sell tokenized stocks without registering as broker-dealers, which would reduce regulatory oversight. How could unregulated tokenized stocks harm investors? Investors might face higher fraud risks, limited legal protection, and potential market manipulation without proper regulation. What solution does the WFE propose? The WFE wants all platforms, whether traditional or crypto, to follow the same regulatory rules when offering tokenized stocks. Will this affect cryptocurrency regulation broadly? Yes, the SEC’s decision on tokenized stocks could influence how other digital assets are regulated in the future.

This decision, made public on Wednesday, stems from what the agency describes as “persistent gaps in disclosure” and a growing allocation of “high-risk assets” within Tether’s reserves. The assets highlighted include Bitcoin (BTC), gold, corporate bonds, secured loans, and other investments, all of which entail various risks, including credit, market, interest rate, and foreign exchange vulnerabilities. Tether CEO Responds To S&P Downgrade In a recent research note, S&P Global detailed that this upgrade came as part of a new assessment scale implemented in 2023, ranging from 1 to 5. This scale evaluates the risk associated with different stablecoins. Following the assessment, S&P rated Tether’s USDT stablecoin as “5 (weak),” marking it as the lowest possible score and down from its previous rating of “4 (constrained).” S&P expressed concerns regarding the limited insight Tether provides into the creditworthiness of its custodians and counterparties. Related Reading: Has The Bitcoin Price Hit Its Bottom? Key On-Chain Data Signals Potential Rebound Ahead Despite this, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) stating, “We wear your loathing with pride.” He argued that traditional credit rating methods used by agencies like S&P arose from a system that has faltered, leading regulators to challenge these legacy models. Ardoino contended that Tether stands out as a “overcapitalized” organization within the financial sector, claiming it does not harbor “toxic reserves.” He further suggested that S&P’s methods are better suited for conventional banks and insurers with opaque financial histories, rather than being applicable to digital asset issuers who operate under different reserve structures. Ardoino’s remarks indicate a belief that the agency’s downgrade indicates discomfort within traditional finance toward entities like Tether that aim to transcend a “broken financial system.” The firm’s CEO noted: The traditional finance propaganda machine is growing worried when any company tries to defy the force of gravity of the broken financial system. No company should dare to decouple itself from it. Largest Independent Gold Holder In the aftermath of the downgrade, Tether strongly rejected S&P’s characterizations, emphasizing its resilience through various financial crises, including banking collapses, exchange failures, liquidity challenges, and extreme market fluctuations—all while maintaining full stability and the ability to redeem USDT. Tether also pointed to its issuance of approximately $184 billion worth of USDT, assuring stakeholders that it holds sufficient reserves, including US Treasuries and other assets, to satisfy redemptions. Related Reading: Monad (MON) Price Skyrockets 80%, Emerges As Best Performer Among Top 100 Cryptos Notably, recent reports from the Financial Times reveal that Tether has emerged as the largest independent holder of gold globally, highlighting the firm’s increasing exposure to non-traditional reserve assets. According to the report, the stablecoin issuer bought more gold in the last quarter of the year than any central bank in the world. The figures show that the firm bought 26 tons of gold, adding to its substantial gold reserve of nearly 120 tons.

This massive movement, tracked by Onchain Lens, has sent ripples through the crypto community and raised important questions about institutional cryptocurrency strategies. What Does This SpaceX Bitcoin Transfer Mean? The recent SpaceX Bitcoin transaction represents one of the largest institutional crypto movements this month. According to blockchain analysts, the transfer occurred in a single transaction, moving the funds to a completely new address. This type of large-scale movement typically indicates either portfolio rebalancing, security upgrades, or strategic repositioning. SpaceX has been quietly accumulating Bitcoin since 2021, when Elon Musk first revealed the company’s cryptocurrency holdings. However, this particular SpaceX Bitcoin transfer stands out due to its timing and scale. Market observers are closely watching whether this signals a broader trend in corporate cryptocurrency management. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Moves So Important? When major companies like SpaceX make significant Bitcoin transactions, the entire market pays attention. Here’s why these moves matter: Market confidence indicators – Large transfers can signal institutional sentiment Price impact potential – Movements of this size can affect liquidity Adoption trends – Shows how corporations are integrating crypto into treasury management Regulatory implications – Demonstrates compliance with financial regulations The SpaceX Bitcoin transaction comes at a crucial time when institutional adoption is accelerating. Many corporations are following Tesla’s lead in adding cryptocurrency to their balance sheets, making movements like this SpaceX Bitcoin transfer particularly significant for market analysts. How Do We Know It’s Really SpaceX? Blockchain analytics firms like Onchain Lens use sophisticated tracking methods to identify wallet ownership. While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, several factors help identify the SpaceX Bitcoin address: Previous transaction patterns matching known corporate movements Connection to other verified institutional wallets Timing correlations with public company announcements Amount consistency with reported corporate holdings However, it’s important to note that absolute certainty in wallet attribution remains challenging. The identification of this as a SpaceX Bitcoin address relies on probabilistic analysis rather than definitive proof. What Could This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? This substantial SpaceX Bitcoin movement highlights several key trends in cryptocurrency adoption. First, it demonstrates that major corporations continue to actively manage their crypto assets rather than simply holding them statically. Second, the transaction size shows confidence in Bitcoin’s liquidity and market depth. Moreover, the SpaceX Bitcoin transfer occurs against a backdrop of increasing institutional interest. As more companies follow similar strategies, we can expect to see: More sophisticated corporate crypto management tools Increased regulatory clarity around institutional holdings Greater market stability from diversified ownership Enhanced security protocols for large-scale transfers Key Takeaways from the $105 Million Move The SpaceX Bitcoin transaction reminds us that institutional players are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their cryptocurrency strategies. This isn’t just about holding digital assets—it’s about active portfolio management and strategic positioning. For individual investors, movements like this SpaceX Bitcoin transfer serve as valuable learning opportunities. They demonstrate how large institutions approach risk management, security, and strategic allocation in the volatile crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions How was the SpaceX Bitcoin address identified? Blockchain analytics firms use pattern recognition, transaction history analysis, and correlation with public information to identify likely corporate wallets, though absolute certainty is difficult. Why would SpaceX move such a large amount of Bitcoin? Possible reasons include security upgrades, wallet management, portfolio rebalancing, or preparing for specific corporate actions. Does this affect Bitcoin’s price? While single transactions rarely directly impact price, large movements can signal institutional sentiment that influences market psychology. How common are corporate Bitcoin transfers? As more companies hold cryptocurrency, institutional transfers are becoming increasingly common as part of normal treasury management. Is my Bitcoin safe if large holders move funds? Yes, individual holdings are separate from corporate wallets. The Bitcoin network is designed to handle transactions of all sizes securely. What should I watch for after this SpaceX Bitcoin move? Monitor for follow-up transactions, official company statements, and whether similar movements occur with other corporate holders.

The latest data reveals the Altcoin Season Index remains firmly at 25, indicating Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency landscape. This crucial metric gives traders valuable insights into market cycles and investment opportunities. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital thermometer for cryptocurrency markets. Created by CoinMarketCap, this innovative tool measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period. When the index approaches 100, we enter altcoin season – that exciting period when alternative cryptocurrencies surge against Bitcoin. Currently sitting at 25, the index clearly signals we’re in Bitcoin season. This means most altcoins are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. Understanding this metric helps investors make informed decisions about portfolio allocation and timing. Why Does the Altcoin Season Index Matter for Your Portfolio? The Altcoin Season Index provides more than just market trivia – it offers actionable intelligence for crypto investors. Here’s why this metric deserves your attention: Market cycle identification – Helps recognize transitions between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance Risk assessment – Indicates when altcoin investments carry higher potential returns Timing strategy – Assists in determining optimal entry points for different cryptocurrency categories Portfolio rebalancing – Guides decisions about when to shift between Bitcoin and altcoins Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index regularly can significantly improve your investment timing and risk management. What Current Market Conditions Tell Us The persistent low reading on the Altcoin Season Index reflects several market realities. Bitcoin continues to attract institutional investment and mainstream attention, while many altcoins face regulatory uncertainty and reduced retail interest. However, experienced traders know that market conditions can change rapidly. Historical patterns show that extended Bitcoin dominance often precedes strong altcoin rallies. When the Altcoin Season Index eventually climbs, it typically signals increased risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller cryptocurrencies. Therefore, watching this index closely could help you catch the next major trend shift. How to Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy Successful cryptocurrency investing requires both patience and preparation. While the current Altcoin Season Index reading favors Bitcoin, smart investors use this time to research promising altcoin projects. Consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into selected altcoins during Bitcoin dominance periods Setting price alerts for when the Altcoin Season Index crosses key thresholds Diversifying across different cryptocurrency sectors and use cases Monitoring fundamental developments in altcoin projects you believe in Remember that the Altcoin Season Index is just one tool in your analytical toolkit, but it provides valuable context for broader market movements. When Might We See the Next Altcoin Season? Predicting exact timing for market shifts remains challenging, but several factors could trigger the next altcoin season. Increased regulatory clarity, breakthrough technological developments, or renewed retail interest could all contribute to a rising Altcoin Season Index. Many analysts watch for Bitcoin dominance to peak before expecting significant altcoin rotations. The current Altcoin Season Index at 25 suggests we might need to wait for broader market catalysts. However, cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile and can change direction quickly. Staying informed about this metric helps position you to capitalize on opportunities when they emerge. Final Thoughts on Navigating Crypto Seasons The Altcoin Season Index provides crucial insights for navigating cryptocurrency market cycles. While Bitcoin currently dominates, understanding these patterns helps prepare for future opportunities. Successful investors combine metric analysis with fundamental research and risk management. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to cryptocurrency, monitoring the Altcoin Season Index can enhance your market awareness and timing decisions. The current reading reminds us that patience often rewards investors who understand market cycles and maintain disciplined strategies.

What reading indicates altcoin season? When the index approaches 100, it signals altcoin season. Readings closer to zero indicate Bitcoin dominance in the market.

A new crypto that is priced below $0.04, is surging towards a complete allocation and investors are responding rapidly. As the demand is growing every hour, they believe that it may be one of the last opportunities to enter before the next big crypto price step. The Presale of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving towards a full Phase 6 sellout. The current price of the token is $0.035 and the final allotment is diminishing rapidly. The sale began early 2025 at $0.01, and since then MUTM has been increasing by 250%. The initial offer price will be pegged at $0.06, and this will provide the initial participants with a clear direction of potential upside. The presale has already secured a good momentum. The project has raised approximately $19 million. The holder numbers are constantly on the rise and they have already surpassed 18,200 participants. The number of sold tokens is 805 million. Phase 6 currently stands over the 95% mark and hence, it comes as a last chance to numerous investors to grab it before Phase 7 forces the price to go up. The high growth rate exhibits the extent of the intense demand in the new cryptocurrency. A variety of users seek the most appropriate crypto to purchase at the moment, which is below $0.04 and MUTM is one of the most favorable options. What Mutuum Finance Is Developing Mutuum Finance is developing a two-sided lending environment that is made to be useful and not hyped. It aims to provide a clean and predictable means by which users can lend, get yield and liquidity by utilizing automated smart contracts. Users are given mtTokens when they ever deposit assets. The value of these tokens increases due to the re- entry of interest into the pool. The increasing price of the mt Token allows users to have a stable APY without taking advantage of overvalued token issues. This is among the things that make MUTM stand out in the DeFi crypto industry. A buy and distribute model is also used in Mutuum Finance. Availing revenue in the lending platform is utilized to purchase MUTM in the open market. The acquired tokens are then delivered to the users that stake the mtTokens on the safety module. This generates continuous buying pressure and assists in rewarding long term owners. Security is a major focus. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK audit with a score of 90 out of 100 on the Token Scan. The team also introduced a bug bounty worth $50,000 to find and fix the possible code risks before the protocol is launched. Secured Coin and Oracle Plans In later phases of the roadmap, Mutuum Finance will roll out its own USD pegged stablecoin. This stablecoin will go through minting and burning overcollateralized positions within the platform. The team will utilize Chainlink oracles with fallback feeds in order to be accurate of price. Sound oracles are important in sound liquidation and secure borrowing. Such characteristics should ensure that the protocol is more resilient in the current volatile crypto prices. According to some analysts, such upgrades will enable MUTM to go way beyond what it was selling earlier. Early estimates suggest that there could be a 4x to 6x growth of the current positions following listings. According to other models, in a better case, MUTM might hope to increase by 700% by the time the stablecoin and oracle system becomes online. V1 Launch Timing The official X account of Mutuum Finance stated that V1 would appear in Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial iteration will consist of a liquidity pool, mtTokens, a debt token and a liquidation bot, and the initial assets will be ETH and USDT. It is already coded and is currently being vetted by Halborn Security. Frequent updates should follow up to the time the launch window is assured. The sale out of this fast in phase 6 has been considered a very good sign. The positions by early holders are also expanding, some of which are whale buyers prior to the increase step. This is regarded by many as one of the best crypto opportunities under $0.04 owing to the fact that allocation is nearly depleted. Also, the 24 hour leader board makes it more active. Every single day, the highest contributor would be awarded with $500 worth of MUTM which further propels more interaction and maintains high demand.

54959483,634685,1764205201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54959483.jpeg,Short-Term Holders Log Biggest Realised Losses in Bitcoin History – Over $900M per Day,https://bitcoinist.com/short-term-holders-biggest-losses-bitcoin-history/,"Bitcoin is struggling to find support as selling pressure accelerates and uncertainty spreads across the crypto market. After hitting its all-time high near $126,000 in early October, BTC has now lost more than 35% of its value, shaking investor confidence and fueling growing calls that the current bull cycle has ended. Market sentiment has shifted rapidly, with traders, analysts, and long-term participants reassessing expectations as price volatility intensifies and liquidity thins across major exchanges. What makes the current phase even more concerning is the behavior of short-term holders, who historically act as the most reactive segment of the market. According to key data shared by On-Chain Mind, short-term holders are now locking in the biggest realized losses in Bitcoin’s entire history. This level of loss realization surpasses the capitulation seen during the China mining ban, the FTX collapse, and even the COVID crash, marking an extreme phase of market distress. This unprecedented level of capitulation suggests that panic has taken control, with newer entrants exiting positions at steep losses. While some analysts argue that such events have historically preceded major reversals, others believe it signals the beginning of a prolonged downtrend. The coming days may determine which narrative takes hold. Short-Term Holders Face Record Losses as Market Capitulates On-Chain Mind reports that short-term holders are locking in more than $900 million in losses per day. This extreme level of loss realization reflects a phase of true capitulation. Short-term holders are historically the most sensitive to sharp price swings, and when they begin exiting at such magnitude, it often signals a breaking point in market sentiment. The data suggests that panic selling has reached levels never seen before, even when compared to major historical shock events. During the COVID crash, the China mining ban, and the FTX implosion, realized losses spiked sharply, yet none of those events reached the current scale. This places the present correction in a category of its own and raises questions about the structural stability of the market over the coming weeks. Some analysts argue that this marks the definitive beginning of a bear cycle, where confidence erodes and capital rotates out of risk assets. However, there remains a smaller group of optimistic voices who note that extreme capitulation has often preceded powerful recoveries. If Bitcoin stabilizes and buyers return, this could form a major macro bottom. The next move will likely define the market’s trajectory. BTC Tests Weekly Support After Sharp Reversal Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a steep reversal from the all-time high near $126,000, with price now trading around $86,900 after a rapid decline. The drawdown has positioned BTC back toward the key 100-week moving average, which is currently sitting just above $83,000 and acting as an important structural support level. Historically, this moving average has defined the boundary between bull-phase retracements and full macro trend breakdowns. A clean weekly close below it would strengthen the bear-market narrative that many analysts are now beginning to promote. Despite the severity of the decline, price is beginning to stabilize, forming a small reaction wick suggesting early attempts at demand absorption around the $80,000–$85,000 zone. This region coincides with prior consolidation from early in the cycle, making it a logical area for buyers to defend. However, momentum indicators remain pointed downward, and the distance from the 50-week moving average highlights the loss of trend strength. For the bullish case to re-emerge, Bitcoin would need to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 band, where broken support now acts as resistance. Until then, uncertainty remains elevated, and the weekly structure leans cautiously bearish.

The Pump.fun team just deposited $75 million to Kraken, adding fuel to growing cash-out concerns. This latest move brings their total withdrawals to a staggering $480 million, creating waves across the cryptocurrency community. What’s driving the Pump.fun cash-out speculation? According to blockchain analytics firm AmberCN, a wallet linked to the Pump.fun team transferred 75 million USDC to Kraken just eight hours ago. This follows a massive $400 million deposit on November 24th. The pattern suggests systematic withdrawal activity, though the team maintains these transfers aren’t cash-outs. However, the evidence tells a different story. Shortly after arriving at Kraken, 69.26 million USDC from today’s transfer moved directly to Circle. This movement to the stablecoin issuer typically indicates conversion to traditional currency, strengthening the cash-out theory. Why should investors care about this Pump.fun cash-out pattern? Large-scale withdrawals by project teams often signal important market shifts. When founders move significant amounts to exchanges, it can indicate: Profit-taking after substantial token appreciation Liquidity needs for operational expenses Portfolio rebalancing across different assets Market timing decisions based on price outlook The cumulative $480 million Pump.fun cash-out activity represents one of the largest DeFi team withdrawals this year. This scale naturally raises questions about the project’s treasury management and future plans. How does this affect the broader cryptocurrency market? Major movements like this Pump.fun cash-out activity create ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. Other DeFi projects may face increased scrutiny from investors watching for similar patterns. Exchange liquidity can also be impacted when large amounts enter the market simultaneously. Moreover, the timing of these transactions matters. The crypto market remains sensitive to large sell pressure, especially when it comes from prominent project teams. The continued denial from Pump.fun while evidence mounts creates uncertainty that can affect investor confidence. What’s next for Pump.fun amid cash-out concerns? The team’s previous clarification that deposits were unrelated to cashing out now faces serious challenges. The movement to Circle specifically contradicts their earlier statements. Investors will be watching closely for: Official statements addressing the latest transactions Treasury reports showing remaining project funds Development updates confirming ongoing commitment Market response to PUMP token price This situation highlights the importance of transparency in DeFi projects. When teams make large financial moves, clear communication helps maintain trust with their community. Key takeaways from the Pump.fun cash-out situation The pattern of large exchange deposits combined with transfers to Circle strongly suggests this is indeed a Pump.fun cash-out operation. The $480 million total represents significant selling pressure that could impact the token’s price stability. Investors should monitor these developments closely and consider what they might mean for their own positions in similar projects. While teams have every right to realize gains from their work, the manner and communication around these activities matter greatly for market confidence. The ongoing Pump.fun cash-out speculation serves as a reminder that in cryptocurrency, actions often speak louder than words. Frequently Asked Questions How much has Pump.fun withdrawn total? The total estimated amount cashed out now reaches approximately $480 million, including the latest $75 million deposit and previous $400 million transaction. Why are people calling this a cash-out? The movement of funds to Kraken followed by transfer to Circle typically indicates conversion to traditional currency, which is why analysts classify this as cash-out activity. What has Pump.fun said about these transactions? The team previously stated that deposits were unrelated to cashing out, but the evidence from recent transactions contradicts this explanation. How does this affect PUMP token holders? Large sell pressure from team members can impact token price and market confidence, making this important news for all PUMP holders. Should investors be worried about this activity? While concerning, investors should monitor official communications and project development updates to assess the long-term implications. What signs should investors watch for next? Key indicators include further large transactions, official team statements, treasury transparency, and development progress updates.

Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why With Federal Reserve rate-cut odds now above 80%, traders are positioning for a potential shift in risk appetite that could benefit major cryptocurrencies, especially ETH. ETH's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Fed Pivot Hopes and Institutional Demand Bolster Ethereum Ethereum has traded between $2,700 and $3,300 in recent weeks, but fresh catalysts are helping the asset stabilize above $2,900. The biggest driver is macroeconomic. CME FedWatch data shows the probability of a December interest-rate cut has surged from 30% to more than 80%. Lower interest rates typically encourage investment in risk-on assets such as crypto. Institutional flows reflect that shift. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $96.67 million in inflows on November 24, with BlackRock alone contributing $92.6 million, its first inflow in two weeks Treasury giant BitMine continues to accumulate aggressively, adding 69,822 ETH (over $200 million) last week and bringing its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, around 3% of the circulating supply. At the same time, whale wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH amassed 440,000 ETH in one week, signaling renewed confidence despite broader market caution. Ethereum (ETH) Poised for a Breakout Toward $3,400 Despite trading under the 20-day SMA at $3,132, Ethereum is showing early signs of bullish momentum. The MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory, and the RSI is sitting near the neutral 50 line, with room to move higher before hitting overbought levels. Other indicators strengthen the bullish case: Bollinger Bands: ETH’s position near 0.32 suggests price is closer to the lower band, a common rebound zone. Volume: Binance 24-hour trading volume around $1.27 billion indicates enough liquidity to support a breakout. ATR: With daily ATR at $201.62, volatility remains elevated, favoring sharp upside moves if momentum builds. The first major test remains $3,132. A clean breakout and two consecutive daily closes above this level would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push ETH toward the $3,400 target within 5–7 days. Beyond that, resistance at $3,658 becomes the next upside objective. Market Risks and Short-Term Outlook While bullish momentum is building, Ethereum still trades in a broad descending channel, and market structure remains fragile. Failure to reclaim $3,132 soon could send ETH back toward $2,750, with deeper support at $2,623 and the cycle low of $2,659. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November Broader crypto weakness, negative spot flows, or delays in network upgrades could delay a breakout. However, with rising institutional demand, whale accumulation, and rate-cut optimism, Ethereum’s probability of retesting $3,400 is steadily improving. Confidence Level medium is at Medium (65%), as ETH’s path to $3,400 remains viable but requires confirmation through key resistance levels.

Naver, Dunamu, and Naver Financial have announced an astonishing $7.25 billion AI and Web3 investment that could reshape the entire Asian tech ecosystem. This colossal commitment signals a new era of technological advancement that promises to position South Korea at the forefront of global innovation. Why This Massive AI and Web3 Investment Matters Now The timing of this strategic move couldn’t be more crucial. As global competition in artificial intelligence and blockchain technology intensifies, South Korean companies recognize the urgent need to secure their position. Naver CEO Choi Soo-yeon emphasized that creating and vitalizing a foundational ecosystem is essential for domestic companies to maintain competitive advantage. This substantial AI and Web3 investment represents more than just financial commitment—it’s a strategic positioning for future technological leadership. The partnership brings together unique strengths from each company: Naver’s expertise in search technology and platform development Dunamu’s dominance in cryptocurrency exchange through Upbit Naver Financial’s experience in fintech and digital payments What Does This Mean for the Broader Tech Ecosystem? This collaborative effort between established tech corporations and crypto industry leaders creates unprecedented synergy. The AI and Web3 investment will flow into multiple areas including research infrastructure, talent development, and startup incubation. Over the next five years, we can expect to see significant advancements in: AI-powered blockchain solutions Decentralized finance applications Smart contract optimization Cross-platform interoperability The ripple effects will extend beyond the immediate participants, creating opportunities for smaller developers and startups throughout the region. This massive injection of capital and resources will likely accelerate adoption rates and drive innovation across multiple sectors. How Will This Investment Impact Global Competition? South Korea’s strategic AI and Web3 investment positions the country as a serious contender in the global technology race. While Silicon Valley has traditionally dominated AI development and various regions have emerged as blockchain hubs, this move creates a powerful Asian counterweight. The combination of Naver’s established user base and Dunamu’s crypto expertise creates a unique advantage that could challenge existing market leaders. Key competitive advantages include: Established user trust and brand recognition Proven technical capabilities at scale Regulatory familiarity in Asian markets Existing infrastructure and partnerships What Challenges Might This Partnership Face? Despite the exciting prospects, this ambitious AI and Web3 investment faces several potential hurdles.

The central bank’s decision to maintain the Bank of Korea benchmark rate at 2.50% marks the fourth consecutive hold, creating significant implications for digital asset investors worldwide. Why Does the Bank of Korea Benchmark Rate Matter for Crypto? The Bank of Korea benchmark rate serves as a crucial indicator for global financial markets. When central banks maintain stable rates, it typically signals economic caution that can influence cryptocurrency prices. Moreover, this stability often drives investors toward alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum seeking better returns. Here’s what the current rate environment means for crypto investors: Reduced traditional banking returns push capital toward cryptocurrencies Stable rates decrease market volatility fears Long-term investment strategies become more attractive Institutional crypto adoption may accelerate How Will This Bank of Korea Decision Impact Your Portfolio? The consistent Bank of Korea benchmark rate policy creates a predictable environment for cryptocurrency trading. However, understanding the broader implications requires looking at several key factors that affect your investment decisions. First, consider the global context. Other major central banks are also pausing rate hikes, creating a synchronized environment that benefits risk assets like cryptocurrencies. This coordinated approach reduces currency fluctuation risks and provides clearer signals for international investors. What Should Crypto Investors Watch Next? While the current Bank of Korea benchmark rate remains stable, smart investors should monitor several upcoming indicators. The bank’s future guidance, inflation data, and global economic trends will all influence when policy might change. Key monitoring points include: Upcoming economic growth projections Inflation trend analysis Employment data releases Global central bank coordination Actionable Crypto Strategies in This Rate Environment The maintained Bank of Korea benchmark rate presents unique opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. With traditional returns remaining limited, digital assets offer compelling alternatives for portfolio diversification and growth. Consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into established cryptocurrencies Exploring DeFi opportunities for enhanced yields Monitoring regulatory developments closely Balancing portfolio risk across different asset classes Frequently Asked Questions How does the Bank of Korea benchmark rate affect Bitcoin prices? When the Bank of Korea maintains stable rates, it often reduces traditional investment returns, making Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. Will this rate decision impact cryptocurrency regulations? While not directly linked, stable monetary policy often provides regulatory clarity that can benefit cryptocurrency markets and encourage institutional adoption. Should I adjust my crypto investment strategy based on this news? The rate hold suggests continued economic stability, which typically supports risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, always consider your personal risk tolerance and investment goals. How often does the Bank of Korea review its benchmark rate? The Bank of Korea typically reviews its benchmark rate eight times per year, with decisions announced after monetary policy board meetings. What other factors should crypto investors watch alongside interest rates? Monitor inflation data, employment figures, global economic trends, and specific cryptocurrency regulatory developments for comprehensive market understanding. Could this rate decision affect cryptocurrency mining profitability? Indirectly yes, as stable interest rates influence energy costs and equipment financing, which are crucial factors in mining operations. Found this analysis helpful?

According to groundbreaking analysis from Hashed CEO Simon Seojoon Kim, that’s exactly what’s happening with Ethereum right now. The blockchain investment expert reveals that Ethereum is significantly Ethereum undervalued , presenting what could be one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the crypto space today. Why Is Ethereum Undervalued According to Experts? Simon Seojoon Kim, CEO of South Korean blockchain investment firm Hashed, has dropped a bombshell revelation. His firm’s comprehensive analysis shows Ethereum’s fair value sits at $4,747, meaning the current market price represents a staggering 57% discount. This isn’t just speculation – it’s based on sophisticated financial modeling that traditional investors would recognize immediately. The Hashed team developed a unique dashboard that integrates eight different valuation models. This multi-faceted approach ensures the analysis isn’t relying on just one methodology. Instead, it combines multiple perspectives to create a robust fair value assessment that accounts for Ethereum’s diverse utility and revenue streams. What Makes This Ethereum Undervalued Analysis Different? Traditional crypto analysis often focuses on simple metrics, but Hashed’s approach is remarkably comprehensive. Their eight-model dashboard includes: Discounted Cash Flow analysis based on staking yields 25x Price-to-Earnings ratio assessment Total Value Locked multiples evaluation Staking scarcity valuation models Layer 2 ecosystem growth metrics This integrated approach means the conclusion that Ethereum is Ethereum undervalued comes from multiple angles of verification. Each model tells part of the story, and together they paint a compelling picture of significant upside potential. How Do These Models Prove Ethereum’s True Value? The Discounted Cash Flow analysis alone provides fascinating insights. By treating staking yields as Ethereum’s “cash flow,” the model applies traditional financial valuation techniques to the crypto world. Meanwhile, the Price-to-Earnings ratio comparison shows how Ethereum stacks up against traditional tech companies. Perhaps most importantly, the Layer 2 ecosystem valuation captures Ethereum’s network effects. As more applications build on Ethereum and its scaling solutions, the fundamental value of the network increases exponentially. This creates a powerful growth engine that the current market price doesn’t fully reflect, making Ethereum clearly Ethereum undervalued according to these metrics. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For investors watching the crypto markets, this analysis provides concrete numbers to support what many have suspected. The gap between current prices and fair value represents significant potential upside. However, it’s crucial to remember that market sentiment and short-term volatility can keep assets Ethereum undervalued for extended periods. The key takeaway is that fundamental analysis supports a much higher valuation for Ethereum. As the crypto market matures and more institutional investors apply traditional valuation methods, we may see prices move closer to these calculated fair values. Could This Ethereum Undervalued Situation Change Soon? Market conditions evolve rapidly, and several factors could accelerate Ethereum’s price discovery. Increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological upgrades could all contribute to closing the valuation gap. The current situation where Ethereum remains Ethereum undervalued might not last forever as these fundamental strengths become more widely recognized. Moreover, the growing ecosystem of decentralized applications and the continued expansion of Layer 2 solutions create natural demand drivers. As more value flows through the Ethereum network, the economic case for higher valuation strengthens. Final Verdict: Time to Pay Attention to Ethereum’s True Worth The comprehensive analysis from Hashed provides a data-driven case for Ethereum’s substantial upside potential. While markets can remain irrational longer than investors can remain solvent, the fundamental metrics suggest we’re looking at a significant opportunity. The evidence strongly indicates that Ethereum is profoundly Ethereum undervalued at current levels. As with any investment, due diligence and risk management remain essential. However, for those who believe in Ethereum’s long-term vision and technological capabilities, the current valuation disconnect might represent a rare window of opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly does ‘Ethereum undervalued’ mean? It means that according to Hashed’s analysis, Ethereum’s current market price is 57% below its calculated fair value of $4,747 based on eight different financial models. How reliable is this Ethereum undervalued analysis? The analysis uses multiple validated financial models including DCF, P/E ratios, and ecosystem metrics, making it more robust than single-method approaches. What time frame does this Ethereum undervalued assessment consider? While not explicitly stated, valuation models typically consider long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements. Could Ethereum remain undervalued for long? Yes, markets can stay irrational for extended periods, but fundamental analysis suggests the gap should close over time. What are the main drivers making Ethereum undervalued? Staking yields, Layer 2 growth, network adoption, and Total Value Locked all contribute to the fair value calculation. How does this affect my investment strategy? This analysis provides fundamental support for long-term Ethereum investment, but always combine with your own research and risk tolerance.

Federal Decree Law No. 6 of 2025, signed in September and made public this week, allows the UAE Central Bank (CBUAE) to license all crypto and blockchain entities operating in or from the country, regardless of the technology they use. Unlicensed operations could be fined up to 1 billion dirhams, equivalent to approximately $272 million. New licensing rules redefine compliance for Web3 and blockchain players Replacing the existing central bank framework of the UAE, the law expands its oversight beyond just direct issuance to cover virtual assets, DeFi protocols, stablecoins, tokenized real-world assets, decentralized exchanges, wallets, bridges, and blockchain infrastructure. Marina D’Angelo, head of Europe at DLT Law, an international regulatory and legal blockchain advisory firm, suggested that it is still too soon to speculate on how the new law will benefit the Gulf nation’s position as a global crypto hub. “With the new federal law now in force the UAE has effectively redrawn the regulatory perimeter around digital assets,” D’Angelo told Coindesk. “How this ultimately plays out concerning DeFi remains to be seen.” Such regulations of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 in the UAE are revolutionized by the new UAE central bank law. Federal Decree Law No. 6 of 2025 requires all entities involved in providing financial services via digital assets (e.g., traditional banks, crypto exchanges, or blockchain protocols) to obtain a license. This comprises decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing platforms, wallets, tokenized RWA platforms, stablecoins, bridges and other blockchain infrastructure. And law experts recently underscored that the “code is not a shield” principle now applies: just a protocol running open-source software or in some decentralized manner is not exempt from licensing requirements. Even middleware and infrastructure suppliers that allow payments, custody, or tokenization might come under the jurisdiction of the UAE Central Bank. There is also a one-year window for existing players to be compliant, until September 2026, with new license applications stretching over a certain period, of 60 days. Nonetheless, unlicensed activities are subject to heavy penalties and administrative fines, while others may be subject to criminal sanction. mBridge launch signals UAE’s leap into cross-border digital payments The United Arab Emirates’ new central bank law, enacted recently, follows the UAE’s official launch of the mBridge cross-border CBDC platform, which included a payment to China. The event was attended by the UAE’s Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister, His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who oversaw the transaction. HH Sheikh Mansour also chairs the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), with both the Governors of the CBUAE and the People’s Bank of China in attendance in person. mBridge enables direct cross-border payments between banks, bypassing the need for correspondent banking and facilitating near-instant international transfers. In June last year, mBridge entered the minimum viable product (MVP) phase , with this announcement signalling it is now live. The “Jisr” platform, also known as MBridge, for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), was developed by the BIS in collaboration with a group of UAE and Chinese banks. It aims to facilitate cross-border payments, significantly reduce transaction costs, and provide instant payment settlement. According to the announcement , the platform is expected to undergo further expansion in 2026, with the addition of more central banks.

The tech giant’s CEO just dropped a major update that will surprise many investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. In a recent statement, Naver CEO Choi Soo-yeon clarified the company’s position on this highly anticipated Nasdaq listing move. What’s the Current Status of Naver’s Nasdaq Listing? According to TechM reports, Naver CEO Choi Soo-yeon made it clear that no decisions have been finalized regarding a potential Nasdaq listing for either Naver Financial or Dunamu. This announcement comes amid growing speculation about the company’s international expansion plans. The CEO emphasized that the company understands the significance of such a move and is proceeding cautiously. Choi acknowledged the public controversy surrounding dual listings and stressed the importance of national consensus on this matter. The company recognizes that a Nasdaq listing represents a major strategic decision that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Why is the Nasdaq Listing Generating So Much Attention? The potential Nasdaq listing has captured investor interest for several key reasons: Global market access – A Nasdaq listing would provide international exposure Increased liquidity – Access to deeper capital markets Enhanced credibility – Meeting stringent U.S. listing requirements Competitive positioning – Joining other tech giants on the exchange However, the CEO noted that while Naver Financial operates as a Naver subsidiary, it has already merged with a larger company. This existing corporate structure adds complexity to any potential Nasdaq listing decision. What About the Merger Possibilities? In her statement, CEO Choi provided crucial insights about potential mergers. She specifically mentioned that the likelihood of a merger between a combined Naver Financial-Dunamu entity and Naver appears low. This clarification helps investors understand the company’s strategic direction and eliminates some speculation about corporate restructuring. The company’s approach reflects a thoughtful consideration of both domestic and international market conditions. A Nasdaq listing decision would need to align with the company’s long-term vision and stakeholder interests. How Will This Nasdaq Listing Decision Impact Investors? For current and potential investors, this update provides important clarity. The uncertainty around the Nasdaq listing timeline means investors should focus on the company’s fundamental performance rather than speculative listing gains. The CEO’s transparent communication helps set realistic expectations about the company’s international expansion plans. Moreover, the emphasis on national consensus suggests that regulatory and public sentiment factors will play significant roles in any future Nasdaq listing decision. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the company’s commitment to responsible corporate governance. What’s Next for Naver’s International Strategy? While the Nasdaq listing remains undecided, the company continues to evaluate all strategic options. The CEO’s comments indicate that any future Nasdaq listing would be part of a broader international strategy rather than an isolated move. Investors should watch for further announcements about the company’s global expansion plans and how they might incorporate potential Nasdaq listing opportunities. The company’s cautious approach to the Nasdaq listing decision reflects its understanding of the significant implications for shareholders, employees, and the broader tech ecosystem. This measured strategy may ultimately serve the company better than rushing into a premature Nasdaq listing. Final Thoughts on the Nasdaq Listing Uncertainty The clarity provided by Naver’s CEO brings valuable transparency to the market. While the lack of a definitive Nasdaq listing decision may disappoint some investors, the honest assessment of the situation helps everyone make more informed decisions. The company’s commitment to seeking national consensus before proceeding with any Nasdaq listing demonstrates responsible leadership. As the situation evolves, the potential Nasdaq listing will remain a key topic of discussion. However, investors now have a clearer understanding of the current status and the factors influencing this important decision. Frequently Asked Questions Has Naver completely ruled out a Nasdaq listing? No, the CEO stated that no decision has been made yet, meaning all options remain open for future consideration. What is the main reason for delaying the Nasdaq listing decision? The company recognizes the need for national consensus on dual listings and wants to ensure any decision aligns with broader stakeholder interests. How does Dunamu factor into the potential Nasdaq listing? Dunamu is part of the consideration for any potential Nasdaq listing, but no separate or combined listing decisions have been finalized. What would a Nasdaq listing mean for Naver Financial? A Nasdaq listing would provide international exposure and access to deeper capital markets, but the company is weighing all implications carefully. When can we expect a final decision on the Nasdaq listing? The company hasn’t provided a timeline, as they’re focused on achieving necessary consensus before making any definitive moves. How are investors reacting to this news? While some may be disappointed by the uncertainty, others appreciate the transparency and careful approach to such a significant decision.

The sharp downturn from the recent cycle high has left bullish traders on the defensive, with confidence weakening across spot and derivatives markets. Analysts who just weeks ago projected continuation toward new all-time highs are now shifting their tone, with many calling for the beginning of a bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze Flushes Out Late Longers as Funding Turns Negative: Classic Capitulation Signal The broader market environment has amplified these concerns. Momentum has flipped downward, liquidity has thinned, and buyers have been unable to reclaim key resistance levels that would signal strength. As Bitcoin searches for support, investors are now watching reactions around the high-$80K region to determine whether this decline is part of a deeper structural reversal or a temporary correction within the larger trend. According to top analyst Axel Adler, Long-Term Holders have played a pivotal role in the current downturn. He reports that this cohort conducted the largest profit-taking event of the entire cycle, reducing positions by 1.57 million BTC over the quarter as prices fell toward $80,000. This scale of distribution historically aligns with exhaustion phases and late-cycle tops, intensifying speculation that Bitcoin may be entering a more prolonged period of weakness. Long-Term Holder Distribution Signals Major Cycle Shift Axel Adler highlights that Long-Term Holders (LTH) are conducting massive profit-taking, pushing supply levels back to early 2023 lows. According to his data, the 30-day Net Position Change now reflects one of the deepest sell-offs seen in the entire bull cycle. LTH supply has fallen sharply from the peak of 15.75 million BTC to the current 13.6 million BTC—marking the lowest reading since the beginning of the cycle. Adler notes that this pattern aligns with a classic smart-money distribution phase often observed near major market tops. Over just the past two weeks (November 11–25), LTH sold 803,399 BTC, representing a drop of 5.54% and averaging 53,560 BTC per day. Historically, such compression in supply has only occurred during major inflection periods. Adler compares the current reading to previous extremes—March 2024, following the $73,000 all-time high sell-off, and October 2024, when Bitcoin corrected from the ATH toward $85,000. The present phase demonstrates aggressive coin dumping, with deeply negative red bars on the Net Position Change while price simultaneously declined from the October peak. This combination of rapid supply reduction and falling price suggests that LTH distribution is exerting meaningful pressure on the market. The data implies that the cycle may be transitioning toward a structurally weaker phase unless new demand re-enters to absorb the sell-side volume.

The current trading level around $86,800 reflects an attempted relief bounce, yet the broader trend remains clearly bearish. Price is positioned below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, all of which are now sloping downward—a structure that typically signals sustained downside momentum. The rejection from the mid-November breakdown zone reinforces the idea that former support has flipped into resistance. Related Reading: 63K Bitcoin Exits Long-Term Wallets: A Surge of Speculative Short-Term Buying Volume spikes during the selloff indicate forced liquidation and capitulation-driven selling rather than orderly distribution, while the recent bounce has occurred on noticeably lighter volume, suggesting weak conviction from buyers.

Losing this level could expose further downside toward $78K and potentially $72K.

Here’s how Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum compare. Bitcoin, XRP, And Ethereum Are Currently Far Below Solana In Loss Supply In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how some of the top assets in the cryptocurrency sector compare in terms of the Percent Supply in Loss . This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the percentage of a given asset’s circulating supply that’s currently being held at a loss. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If the last transfer price was more than the current spot price for any token, then that particular token is considered to be in a state of net unrealized loss. The Percent Supply in Loss adds up all coins of this type and determines what part of the supply they make up. Like this indicator, there also exists the Percent Supply in Profit , which tracks the supply of the opposite type. Since the total supply should add up to 100%, only one of these metrics needs to be known; the other can simply be found by subtracting it from 100. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows how the Percent Supply in Profit has changed for Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, and Solana over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Percent Supply in Profit has plummeted for all of these cryptocurrencies recently. In other words, the Percent Supply in Loss has shot up. This shift in investor profitability has come as a result of the bearish momentum that the various assets have faced. It’s visible in the chart, however, that the change hasn’t been proportionate for all of the coins. While XRP, Ethereum, and Bitcoin have shown similar trajectories, Solana has broken away with a much steeper decline in the indicator. Today, the Percent Supply in Profit is sitting at a value of 25.16%. This means that almost 75% of the cryptocurrency’s supply is underwater now. In contrast, the Percent Supply in Loss remains at 34.91%, 38.37%, and 36.70% for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, respectively. Thus, despite the market downturn, a majority of the supply is still in the green for the three largest coins in the sector (excluding stablecoins ). Typically, a high value on the Percent Supply in Loss corresponds to market conditions where not many profit-sellers are left anymore. Considering this, Solana having most of its supply underwater could, in theory, imply that it’s closer to seller exhaustion than Bitcoin and company.

A new bill targeting VASP shareholders with criminal records is making its way through the National Assembly, and the implications for crypto businesses are massive. This legislation represents one of the most significant regulatory moves in the Asian crypto market this year. What Does the VASP Shareholders Bill Actually Propose? The proposed legislation gives financial authorities unprecedented power to reject Virtual Asset Service Provider registrations. The key change focuses on VASP shareholders who have domestic or international criminal records. Under the new rules, major stakeholders in cryptocurrency companies must pass rigorous background checks before operations can proceed. Major shareholders include not just the largest stakeholders but all key investors with significant influence. The bill requires complete transparency about these VASP shareholders during the application process. This represents a major shift from current regulations that only examine the company itself. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About VASP Shareholders Screening? The implications extend far beyond new applicants. Existing VASP operators face re-evaluation based on their major shareholders’ backgrounds. This means established companies might suddenly find their licenses at risk if their investors don’t meet the new standards. Here’s what makes this legislation particularly impactful: Existing operators must undergo re-screening Future applications face stricter scrutiny Criminal records from any country can disqualify VASP shareholders The definition of ‘major shareholders’ includes all key stakeholders When Will These VASP Shareholders Changes Take Effect? The bill is scheduled for review at a plenary session of the South Korean National Assembly’s National Policy Committee on November 27. If passed, the implementation could happen rapidly, giving VASP shareholders little time to prepare for the new requirements. This timing is crucial because it coincides with South Korea’s broader efforts to clean up its cryptocurrency industry. The government appears determined to create a safer environment for investors while maintaining the country’s position as a crypto hub. How Will This Impact South Korea’s Crypto Ecosystem? The legislation could lead to significant consolidation in the market. Smaller VASPs with complex shareholder structures might struggle to comply, while larger, well-established companies could benefit from increased credibility. Key challenges for VASP shareholders include: Proving clean criminal records across all jurisdictions Restructuring ownership if key stakeholders don’t qualify Managing the compliance costs of ongoing screenings Maintaining investor confidence during transitions What’s the Global Significance of Targeting VASP Shareholders? South Korea’s move could set a precedent for other nations considering similar regulations. As one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets, its regulatory decisions often influence global standards. Other countries might follow suit with their own versions of VASP shareholders screening requirements. The international aspect is particularly noteworthy. The bill considers criminal records from any country, meaning VASP shareholders with legal issues anywhere in the world could face exclusion from South Korea’s crypto market. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Regulation South Korea’s proposed legislation marks a turning point in cryptocurrency regulation. By focusing on VASP shareholders’ backgrounds, authorities aim to build a more trustworthy and secure digital asset ecosystem. While this creates immediate challenges for some businesses, it could ultimately strengthen the industry by weeding out bad actors and boosting public confidence. The success of this approach will depend on balanced implementation that protects investors without stifling innovation. As the November 27 review approaches, all eyes are on how this will reshape South Korea’s position in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are VASP shareholders? VASP shareholders are individuals or entities that hold significant ownership stakes in Virtual Asset Service Providers. The new bill defines them as major stakeholders who can influence company decisions. When will the new rules take effect? The bill goes for review on November 27. If approved, implementation could begin shortly after, though exact timelines depend on the legislative process. Do existing VASPs need to re-apply? Yes, existing operators will face re-evaluation based on their major shareholders’ eligibility under the new standards. What types of criminal records disqualify shareholders? The bill doesn’t specify particular crimes, meaning any domestic or international criminal record could potentially disqualify VASP shareholders. How does this affect foreign VASP shareholders? Foreign VASP shareholders are subject to the same requirements, including disclosure of criminal records from their home countries or any other jurisdiction. Can VASPs replace disqualified shareholders? Yes, companies can restructure their ownership to comply, though this may involve significant operational changes and time constraints.

This sudden shutdown sends shockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry and raises serious questions about the sustainability of large-scale crypto mining operations in regions facing energy challenges. Why Did Tether’s Crypto Mining Venture Fail? Tether launched this ambitious crypto mining project in November 2023 with high expectations. The company invested half a billion dollars to establish one of South America’s largest cryptocurrency mining facilities. However, the operation faced immediate challenges that ultimately proved insurmountable. Local media outlet El Observador broke the story, revealing that Tether is completely shutting down its Uruguayan crypto mining operations. The decision comes after months of struggling with operational costs that made the venture economically unviable. What Were the Main Challenges for This Crypto Mining Operation? The primary factors behind Tether’s decision to halt crypto mining in Uruguay include: Sky-high energy costs that made operations financially unsustainable Lack of competitive tariff structures from local energy providers Increasing operational expenses that eroded profit margins Unfavorable economic conditions for large-scale crypto mining These challenges highlight the delicate balance required for successful crypto mining operations. Energy consumption remains the single biggest expense for any crypto mining venture, and when costs spiral out of control, even well-funded projects can collapse. How Did Tether Handle the Crypto Mining Shutdown Rumors? Interestingly, Tether had previously denied rumors about shutting down its Uruguayan crypto mining facility. As recently as September 2024, company representatives dismissed speculation about the operation’s closure. This makes the current announcement particularly surprising for industry observers. The company’s reversal demonstrates how quickly circumstances can change in the volatile world of crypto mining. What seemed like a viable operation just months ago has now become economically unsustainable due to shifting energy market conditions. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto Mining Projects? Tether’s experience in Uruguay serves as a cautionary tale for other companies considering large-scale crypto mining investments. The shutdown underscores several critical lessons: Energy cost stability is crucial for crypto mining profitability Long-term tariff agreements are essential before committing major investments Regional economic conditions can dramatically impact crypto mining viability Due diligence must include comprehensive energy market analysis This development may cause other crypto mining companies to reconsider their expansion plans in regions with unstable energy pricing. The focus may shift toward locations with more predictable energy costs and supportive regulatory environments. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Tether stop crypto mining in Uruguay? Tether halted operations due to prohibitively high energy costs and the lack of competitive electricity tariffs that made the $500 million crypto mining venture economically unviable. How much did Tether invest in Uruguayan crypto mining? Tether invested approximately $500 million in the crypto mining operation when it launched in November 2023. When did Tether start crypto mining in Uruguay? The company began its crypto mining operations in Uruguay in November 2023 with substantial financial backing and high expectations. Are there other crypto mining operations in Uruguay? While Uruguay has attracted some crypto mining interest due to its renewable energy resources, Tether’s departure may discourage similar large-scale investments until energy pricing issues are resolved. Could Tether restart crypto mining in Uruguay later? While possible, restarting would require significant changes in energy pricing structures and economic conditions that currently make crypto mining unprofitable in the region. What does this mean for cryptocurrency prices? While one crypto mining operation closure typically doesn’t significantly impact broader cryptocurrency markets, it does highlight the operational challenges facing the mining industry.

This significant adjustment occurred at 1:16 a.m. UTC on November 27, creating new opportunities for mining operations worldwide. But what does this Bitcoin mining difficulty change actually mean for you? What Is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty and Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin mining difficulty represents how challenging it is to find a new block on the blockchain. Think of it as the network’s built-in thermostat that adjusts every 2016 blocks to maintain consistent block times. When the Bitcoin mining difficulty decreases, miners can solve blocks more easily using the same computational power. This recent 1.95% drop means mining operations suddenly became more profitable. The adjustment helps balance the network after periods of reduced mining activity or when older equipment comes offline. Currently, the network’s seven-day average hashrate stands at 1.02 ZH/s with the actual rate at 1.07 ZH/s. How Does This Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Adjustment Benefit Miners? The immediate effects of this Bitcoin mining difficulty reduction are substantial for mining operations: Increased profitability for existing mining setups Lower operational costs per Bitcoin mined Extended lifespan for older mining equipment Improved margins for all mining operations This adjustment comes at a crucial time when energy costs and operational expenses have been challenging for many miners. The reduced Bitcoin mining difficulty means the same hardware now generates more Bitcoin rewards, providing much-needed relief to the mining community. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Mining Difficulty? The next Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment is expected in approximately 14 days. This gives miners a valuable window to optimize their operations and maximize returns. However, the long-term trend of Bitcoin mining difficulty typically moves upward as more participants join the network and technology improves. Network health remains strong with current hashrate levels indicating robust participation. The slight decrease in Bitcoin mining difficulty suggests some miners may have temporarily scaled back operations, possibly due to seasonal factors or equipment upgrades. Key Takeaways from This Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Change This 1.95% reduction in Bitcoin mining difficulty to 149.30T represents a positive development for the mining ecosystem. It demonstrates the network’s ability to self-regulate and maintain stability while providing temporary relief to mining operations. The adjustment ensures Bitcoin remains decentralized and accessible to miners of all sizes. Looking ahead, miners should monitor the next Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment closely. Strategic planning around these regular changes can significantly impact long-term profitability and operational efficiency in the competitive world of cryptocurrency mining. Frequently Asked Questions What causes Bitcoin mining difficulty to change? Bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts automatically every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to mine those blocks. If blocks were mined too quickly, difficulty increases; if too slowly, it decreases. How often does Bitcoin mining difficulty adjust? Approximately every two weeks, or more precisely, every 2016 blocks. The exact timing depends on block discovery rates. Does lower mining difficulty mean less network security? Not necessarily. The network automatically adjusts to maintain security. Lower difficulty typically indicates temporary changes in mining participation rather than security concerns. How can miners benefit from difficulty drops? Miners can mine more Bitcoin with the same equipment, improve profitability margins, and potentially bring older hardware back online. What was the previous Bitcoin mining difficulty? Before this adjustment, Bitcoin mining difficulty stood at approximately 152.27T before dropping to the current 149.30T. How does difficulty affect Bitcoin’s price? While not directly correlated, significant difficulty changes can influence market sentiment and mining economics, which may indirectly affect price movements. Found this analysis helpful?

Market sentiment has been shifting positively, institutional adoption continues growing, and macroeconomic conditions appear favorable for cryptocurrency investments. Moreover, his track record of previous accurate forecasts adds credibility to this latest projection. What’s Driving This Bullish Bitcoin Outlook? Several fundamental factors support Lee’s confident Bitcoin price prediction. First, institutional investment has been steadily increasing throughout 2024. Major corporations continue adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Second, regulatory clarity has improved in several key markets.

Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout 2024, maintaining strong support levels despite periodic volatility. The cryptocurrency has already shown it can recover quickly from corrections, suggesting underlying strength that could propel it toward Lee’s targets. What About Lee’s Previous Bitcoin Forecasts? It’s worth noting this isn’t Lee’s first bold Bitcoin price prediction. Earlier this year, he projected Bitcoin could reach $250,000. While that might seem ambitious, his revised $100,000 forecast appears more grounded in current market realities. His adjustment demonstrates careful analysis of evolving market conditions rather than blind optimism. This pragmatic approach strengthens the credibility of his current Bitcoin price prediction. Key Takeaways From This Bitcoin Analysis Lee’s Bitcoin price prediction rests on solid fundamental analysis. The combination of increasing institutional participation, improving regulatory frameworks, and growing mainstream acceptance creates a perfect storm for potential price appreciation. While cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, the underlying trends suggest sustained upward momentum could push Bitcoin toward and possibly beyond Lee’s targets.

Let’s explore why this dip might actually be good news for long-term holders. What Defines a Bitcoin Bull Market Correction?

According to Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction might become reality. In a recent interview that’s making waves across crypto circles, the veteran investor shared his optimistic outlook for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. What’s Driving This Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Mike Novogratz, speaking with SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, expressed strong confidence in Bitcoin’s recovery potential. His Bitcoin price prediction stems from several key market factors that could propel BTC to new heights. However, he also cautioned that significant selling pressure might emerge around the $100,000 level due to psychological factors from recent market liquidations. The market veteran explained that as cryptocurrency policies become clearer, we’ll see deeper market development and increased differentiation among digital assets. This evolution will naturally favor cryptocurrencies that demonstrate tangible value and utility. Why Institutional Participation Matters for Bitcoin Traditional financial firms are increasingly entering the crypto space, and this institutional adoption plays a crucial role in Novogratz’s Bitcoin price prediction. Here’s what’s changing: More regulated investment products are becoming available Major financial institutions are adding crypto services Corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin are growing Retirement funds and pensions are exploring crypto exposure This institutional participation creates stronger market foundations and reduces volatility over time. The Bitcoin price prediction of $100,000 reflects this maturing market structure. Understanding the Market Psychology Behind $100K Novogratz’s Bitcoin price prediction isn’t just about numbers—it’s deeply connected to market psychology. The $100,000 level represents a major psychological barrier that could trigger both excitement and caution among investors. Recent market liquidations created what he describes as ‘psychological shock’ among traders. This means that as Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 mark, we might see increased selling activity from investors looking to secure profits. However, the long-term trend remains positive according to this Bitcoin price prediction. How Market Restructuring Supports This Bitcoin Price Prediction The crypto market is undergoing significant restructuring that could validate Novogratz’s Bitcoin price prediction. As regulatory clarity improves, we’re seeing: Clearer separation between valuable projects and speculative tokens Increased focus on real-world utility and technological innovation Better risk management practices across the industry More sophisticated trading and investment strategies This market evolution creates a healthier environment for sustainable growth, making the $100,000 Bitcoin price prediction more plausible. What This Bitcoin Price Prediction Means for Investors Novogratz’s optimistic Bitcoin price prediction suggests several important considerations for market participants. While the potential for significant gains exists, investors should also remain aware of market dynamics and risk factors. The path to $100,000 likely won’t be smooth. Market corrections and volatility should be expected along the way. However, the fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong, supporting this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction. Conclusion: A Compelling Case for Bitcoin’s Future Mike Novogratz’s $100,000 Bitcoin price prediction represents more than just a number—it reflects growing confidence in cryptocurrency’s long-term trajectory. As institutional adoption increases and market structures mature, Bitcoin appears positioned for significant growth. While challenges remain, the combination of technical fundamentals, market psychology, and institutional interest creates a compelling case for Bitcoin’s potential recovery. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Mike Novogratz predict about Bitcoin? The Galaxy Digital CEO predicted that Bitcoin could recover to $100,000 by the end of this year, though he noted potential selling pressure at that level. Why does Novogratz believe Bitcoin can reach $100,000? He cites increasing institutional participation, clearer crypto policies, and market restructuring that favors valuable cryptocurrencies. What challenges could prevent Bitcoin from reaching $100,000? Psychological factors from recent liquidations and potential selling pressure around key price levels could create obstacles. How reliable are cryptocurrency price predictions? While experts like Novogratz provide valuable insights, all crypto predictions involve uncertainty and market risks. What should investors consider given this prediction? Investors should focus on long-term fundamentals, diversify their portfolios, and only invest what they can afford to lose. How does institutional adoption affect Bitcoin’s price? Institutional participation brings more capital, better market structure, and reduced volatility over time.

The effort is being run with help from the Stellar Development Foundation and consulting firm PwC, and it is being described as an experiment in how a mainstream bank might move dollars on a public ledger. Stablecoins: Pilot Includes PwC And Stellar Support According to the bank and project partners, the pilot examines features that matter to regulated finance, such as the ability to freeze an asset or unwind a transaction when needed. Mike Villano, who leads digital-assets work at US Bancorp, said these controls are a major reason the bank is testing Stellar rather than an alternative chain. Reports have disclosed that the work was discussed publicly during a Money 20/20 podcast featuring executives from US Bancorp , PwC and the Stellar Development Foundation. Stellar Offers Quick, Low-Cost Settlements Based on Stellar’s own technical notes , transactions on the network confirm in about three–five seconds on average. The network also advertises very small fees — the average cost per operation is listed as roughly $0.000005 — and built-in account controls that let issuers add KYC , freeze and clawback options. Those properties are exactly what US Bancorp says it wants to test for regulated payments and custody use cases. Bank Expands Its Digital-Assets Unit US Bancorp has already moved to put more resources behind crypto and token work . Last month the bank announced a dedicated unit focused on stablecoins and money movement, a signal that stablecoin trials are part of a broader push to build on-chain services. Reports tie some of the momentum in the sector to warmer political winds from US President Donald Trump and other developments that have made executives more willing to explore tokenized cash and securities. The bank has not named a rollout date or said whether the pilot is for institutional partners only or for a wider set of customers. Stablecoins: What This Means For Customers And Markets Based on reports and the technical detail published by Stellar, the pilot is set up more as a compliance-first test than a bet on speculative trading. US Bancorp is treating the stablecoins pilot as an extension of payments and custody services, not a retail crypto product for consumers right now. Market participants will watch whether the trial shows that a public blockchain can meet bank rules without losing the ability to correct mistakes or follow court orders.

With momentum building around XRP exchange-traded funds, one prominent analyst now believes the asset could be on the verge of a rally so large it may outperform Bitcoin’s own ETF-driven surge. Why Analysts Believe XRP Is Poised For A Larger Upside Than Bitcoin XRP is entering its ETF chapter, and the scale of what’s coming could make Bitcoin look small. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull mentioned on X that early players like Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin, and Canary Funds are already live with their XRP products. Meanwhile, the real power players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and the other giants haven’t even filed for an XRP spot ETF yet, which shows this is just a warm-up. Related Reading: Here’s Why A Supply Shock Could Be Imminent For XRP The heavyweights haven’t even stepped into the arena, and the initial institutional capital is already flowing. Spot ETFs were highly beneficial for BTC, which triggered a trillion-dollar shockwave that attracted Wall Street institutions and momentum traders who couldn’t ignore the access. According to Xfinancebull, XRP is a different beast, with functional utility, real-world adoption, and banking infrastructure already built out across Japan and Asia. The capital that will soon flood into XRP via ETFs won’t just speculate, but it will stay. When a fraction of over $80 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM) from these initial titans begins to rotate into XRP, the inflows could be significant. This is cold, hard math that is about to unlock high levels of liquidity and historically repeat the move on a larger scale. “The XRP spot ETF ignition is not coming, but it is already here. If you missed the Bitcoin momentum move, don’t miss this one,” Xfinancebull noted. An analyst known as RipBullWinkle has also highlighted that Bitcoin has leaked $151 million, while XRP led all inflows with $164 million. That’s not random, it’s institutions reallocating with intention into assets built for settlement and speed. When powerhouses like Franklin Templeton and Grayscale pull over $130 million into XRP on day one, it confirms where the institutional smart money is going. Market Stabilization Signals The Start Of A New Upward Leg Bitcoin and altcoins are reacting sharply to momentary declines after the brief pullback. TerraHaberTr has stated that BTC has reclaimed the $87,000 level, and if momentum continues at this pace, BTC will target $90,000 and $100,000 levels. On the altcoin side, the recovery is happening even faster, and altcoins that have experienced deep dips may start to gain strength.

The past 24 hours witnessed a staggering $217 million crypto futures liquidation that sent shockwaves through the trading community. This massive wipeout primarily affected short positions, revealing crucial insights about current market sentiment and risk management in cryptocurrency derivatives trading. What Triggered This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation? The cryptocurrency market experienced significant price movements that led to this substantial crypto futures liquidation event. When prices move sharply against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent further losses. This process, known as liquidation, protects both traders and the exchange platform from excessive risk exposure. The recent market activity clearly demonstrates how quickly conditions can change in the crypto space. Breaking Down the Crypto Futures Liquidation Numbers Let’s examine the specific assets that contributed to this massive crypto futures liquidation: Bitcoin (BTC) : $134 million liquidated, with shorts accounting for 85.34% Ethereum (ETH) : $53.54 million liquidated, with shorts accounting for 69.99% HYPE : $29.67 million liquidated, with shorts accounting for 99.53% This distribution shows that most traders were betting against these cryptocurrencies, expecting prices to fall. However, when prices moved in the opposite direction, their positions faced automatic closure through the crypto futures liquidation process. Why Were Short Positions Hit So Hard? The overwhelming dominance of short positions in this crypto futures liquidation event suggests several market dynamics at play. Many traders likely anticipated price declines, possibly due to recent market trends or external economic factors. However, when prices unexpectedly rallied, these bearish positions became vulnerable. The high percentage of short liquidations indicates that market momentum caught many traders by surprise, leading to this substantial crypto futures liquidation across major digital assets. How Can Traders Protect Against Future Crypto Futures Liquidation? Understanding risk management is crucial for avoiding similar crypto futures liquidation scenarios. Traders should consider several protective measures: Use appropriate leverage levels that match your risk tolerance Set stop-loss orders to automatically exit positions Diversify trading strategies across different timeframes Monitor market conditions and news developments regularly Implementing these strategies can help minimize exposure to sudden crypto futures liquidation events while maintaining profitable trading activities. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? This significant crypto futures liquidation event provides valuable insights into current market sentiment. The heavy skew toward short liquidations suggests that many traders were positioned for further price declines. However, the market’s upward movement triggered this massive crypto futures liquidation, potentially indicating underlying bullish momentum. Such events often lead to increased volatility as positions are rebalanced and new traders enter the market. Key Takeaways from the $217M Crypto Futures Liquidation The recent crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder about market dynamics and risk management. While derivatives trading offers significant profit potential, it also carries substantial risks, as demonstrated by this $217 million wipeout. Traders should approach cryptocurrency futures with careful planning and disciplined execution to navigate these volatile conditions successfully. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s position loses enough value that it can no longer cover the required margin. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent further losses. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, set stop-loss orders, maintain adequate margin, and monitor your positions regularly to avoid liquidation. Why were short positions mostly affected? Most traders were betting on price decreases, but when prices unexpectedly rose, their short positions faced automatic closure through liquidation. Is futures trading riskier than spot trading? Yes, futures trading involves leverage, which amplifies both potential profits and losses, making it riskier than spot trading. How often do large liquidations occur? Significant liquidation events typically happen during periods of high volatility and sharp price movements in the cryptocurrency market. Can liquidations affect market prices? Yes, large-scale liquidations can create cascading effects that amplify price movements in either direction. Found this analysis of the massive crypto futures liquidation helpful?

The crypto world just witnessed a staggering USDT whale transfer that’s got everyone talking. Whale Alert recently reported an enormous transaction where 214,520,904 USDT moved from an unknown wallet to OKX exchange. This massive transfer, valued at approximately $215 million, represents one of the most significant stablecoin movements we’ve seen recently. But what does this substantial USDT whale transfer really mean for the market? What Makes This USDT Whale Transfer So Significant? When we examine this particular USDT whale transfer, several factors stand out immediately. The sheer size of the transaction – over 214 million USDT – automatically captures attention. However, the destination matters just as much as the amount. OKX, being one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, often serves as a gateway for institutional and large-scale trading activities. This substantial USDT whale transfer could indicate several potential scenarios: Market preparation for major trading activities Institutional movement between cold and hot wallets Liquidity provisioning for upcoming market operations Strategic positioning ahead of anticipated market volatility How Do Whale Transfers Impact Crypto Markets? Understanding the ripple effects of a major USDT whale transfer requires looking at market dynamics. Large stablecoin movements often serve as leading indicators for market sentiment and potential price action. When substantial amounts of USDT move to exchanges, it typically suggests that holders are preparing to make significant purchases of other cryptocurrencies. This particular USDT whale transfer to OKX might signal that major players are positioning themselves for upcoming market movements. Moreover, such transactions can influence market psychology, often creating anticipation among retail investors who monitor whale activities closely. Why Should You Care About This USDT Movement? You might think whale watching is just for crypto enthusiasts, but these movements affect everyone in the ecosystem. This USDT whale transfer provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Large transfers often precede significant market movements, making them crucial indicators for both traders and long-term investors. Furthermore, monitoring these activities helps understand liquidity flows and market depth. The timing of this transfer, combined with its substantial size, suggests that sophisticated market participants might be anticipating important developments in the near future. What Challenges Do Large Transfers Present? While massive transfers like this USDT whale transfer demonstrate market maturity and liquidity, they also present certain challenges. Market surveillance becomes crucial to ensure these movements don’t manipulate prices or create artificial volatility. Additionally, such large transactions highlight the importance of robust security measures across exchanges and wallet providers. The anonymous nature of the sending wallet also raises questions about transparency in cryptocurrency movements, though this is balanced by the public nature of blockchain transparency. Key Takeaways From This Major Crypto Movement This substantial USDT whale transfer to OKX underscores several important market trends. First, it demonstrates the growing institutional presence in cryptocurrency markets. Second, it highlights the crucial role stablecoins play in facilitating large-scale transactions. Third, it shows how blockchain transparency allows market participants to monitor significant movements in real-time.

The recent USDT whale transfer represents more than just numbers on a screen – it’s a window into the sophisticated strategies employed by major market participants. As cryptocurrency markets evolve, understanding these movements becomes increasingly important for all market participants. The transparency provided by blockchain technology allows us to witness these significant transactions, providing valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Frequently Asked Questions What is a USDT whale transfer? A USDT whale transfer refers to large-scale movements of Tether stablecoin, typically involving millions of dollars, usually executed by major investors or institutions. Why do whales transfer USDT to exchanges? Whales transfer USDT to exchanges primarily to facilitate large trades, provide liquidity, or position themselves for anticipated market movements. How does this affect cryptocurrency prices? Large USDT transfers to exchanges often signal potential buying pressure, which can influence market sentiment and potentially affect cryptocurrency prices. Can retail investors benefit from monitoring whale transfers? Yes, monitoring whale transfers provides valuable market insights, though retail investors should consider multiple factors before making investment decisions. Is this type of transfer common? While large transfers occur regularly, transactions of this magnitude (over $200 million) are less frequent and typically indicate significant market activity.

Exchanges employ advanced security protocols including multi-signature wallets, cold storage integration, and real-time monitoring to secure large transfers.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin climbed back above $90,000 on Thursday as Asian markets opened in a broadly positive mood, with stocks firmer and the dollar softer on growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. Trading volumes stayed light in a holiday-shortened week, with US markets shut on Thursday for Thanksgiving and set for only a brief session on Friday. Even so, investors leaned into risk, taking their cue from Wall Street’s latest tech-driven rally and positioning ahead of the Fed’s final policy meeting of the year. Rate expectations are doing much of the work. Futures pricing now suggests that traders see about an 85% chance of a 25-basis-point cut next month, up sharply from around 30% a week earlier, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $91,229, up 4.3% Ether : $3,038, up 2.8% XRP : $2.21, up 1.1% Total crypto market cap: $3.19 trillion, up 4.1% Fed Comments Take Center Stage As Data Lags After Shutdown With most recent economic releases still dated after a 43-day government shutdown that ended in mid-November, markets are treating comments from Fed officials as the cleaner signal on the policy path. Remarks this week from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Fed Governor Christopher Waller nudged investors further toward the view that the central bank is ready to shift from holding to easing. At the same time, data on Wednesday showed new applications for unemployment benefits falling to a seven-month low, suggesting layoffs remain contained and helping to support a soft landing narrative. UPDATE: Just 7 days ago, markets priced a December rate cut at 30%. Today? 85% even @jpmorgan piling on – confirms the cut! What changed, you ask? NY Fed's Williams (Powell's right-hand) signaled openness to cuts Sep jobs report showed weakness (119K vs expected)… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) November 27, 2025 AI Momentum Helps US Markets Extend Their Winning Streak Wall Street extended its advance on Wednesday, as tech strength and rising confidence in a December cut pulled investors back into growth stocks. All three major US equity benchmarks logged a fourth straight day of gains, recovering from last week’s pullback that was driven by worries over stretched valuations in the sector. Those concerns eased after Nvidia delivered upbeat quarterly results and guidance, reinforcing the belief that demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure remains strong. AI server maker Dell Technologies then added to the momentum with a revenue outlook that topped forecasts, helping to stabilise sentiment around the broader AI trade. Crypto traders kept one eye on macro and the other on charts. Piyush Walke, derivatives research analyst at Delta Exchange, said Bitcoin still sits below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, with resistance near $93,000 holding for now. He noted that Ethereum recently bounced off a long-term ascending trendline that has acted as major support, and said a firm daily close above the $3,000 to $3,050 zone could open a move toward $3,200 to $3,300. Asian Stocks Rise As Regional Risk Appetite Improves Equity markets across Asia reflected the improved risk tone. MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 0.27%, on track to break a three-week losing streak, while Japan’s Nikkei and South Korea’s Kospi each gained more than 1% in early trade. China’s property sector remained a key regional risk point. Investors watched closely as major developer China Vanke sought approval from bondholders to delay repayment on a 2 billion yuan, or about $282.6m, onshore bond. For now, though, crypto and equity markets are feeding off the same story. With Bitcoin back above $90,000, tech stocks resurgent and an anticipated Fed rate cut drawing closer, Asia’s trading day opened with a firm, if cautious, appetite for risk.

U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs just recorded their fourth consecutive day of net inflows, signaling strong institutional interest. According to TraderT data from November 26, these funds attracted $60.99 million, demonstrating sustained momentum for Ethereum spot ETFs in the cryptocurrency market. Why Are Ethereum Spot ETFs Gaining Momentum? Ethereum spot ETFs represent a groundbreaking way for investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. The recent inflow streak suggests growing trust in these regulated investment vehicles. Moreover, this pattern indicates that both institutional and retail investors are increasingly comfortable with Ethereum spot ETFs as part of their portfolio strategy. Which Ethereum Spot ETFs Led the Charge? BlackRock’s ETHA dominated the inflows with an impressive $50.39 million contribution. Other notable performers included: Bitwise’s ETHW : $4.33 million in net inflows Grayscale’s Mini ETH : $6.27 million in net inflows The remaining Ethereum spot ETFs showed no net flows, highlighting how specific funds are capturing investor attention. This selective investment pattern reveals market preferences among available Ethereum spot ETFs. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? Continuous inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs suggest several positive developments. First, institutional confidence appears to be strengthening. Second, the regulatory environment for these products seems increasingly favorable. Third, the sustained interest could potentially influence Ethereum’s market dynamics and price stability. How Might This Impact Future Ethereum Adoption? The consistent performance of Ethereum spot ETFs could accelerate mainstream adoption. As more investors discover these accessible entry points, we might see increased liquidity and reduced volatility. However, investors should remain aware of market risks and conduct thorough research before committing to any Ethereum spot ETFs investment strategy. What Challenges Could Ethereum Spot ETFs Face? While the current trend for Ethereum spot ETFs appears positive, potential challenges include regulatory changes, market volatility, and competition from other investment products. Investors should monitor these factors closely when considering Ethereum spot ETFs for their portfolios. The fourth consecutive day of net inflows for U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency adoption. This sustained interest demonstrates growing confidence in regulated Ethereum investment vehicles and could signal broader market acceptance.

Why are net inflows important for Ethereum spot ETFs? Net inflows indicate more money entering than leaving the funds, suggesting growing investor confidence and potential price support for Ethereum.

Spot ETFs provide direct exposure to current market prices. What risks should I consider with Ethereum spot ETFs? Risks include regulatory changes, market volatility, tracking errors, and the inherent uncertainties of cryptocurrency markets. Can international investors access U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs? This depends on their country’s regulations and the specific ETF’s availability. Investors should consult with financial advisors regarding cross-border investment rules.

XRP Recently Found Support At The Lower Line Of A Parallel Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 3-day price of XRP. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel,” appearing whenever an asset’s price consolidates between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why The upper level of the channel provides resistance to the asset, making tops probable at it. Similarly, the lower line can facilitate bottom formations by acting as a source of support. A breakout of either of these bounds can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Parallel Channels, but the one of interest here is the most basic version: a channel that’s parallel to the time-axis. This type corresponds to a phase of true sideways movement in the price. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 3-day price of XRP has been stuck inside for the past year: As is visible in the above graph, XRP witnessed a failed breakout beyond the upper line of the Parallel Channel back in July. This kicked off a phase of downtrend for the cryptocurrency, which culminated in a retest of the channel’s lower line earlier in November. The coin has since observed a rebound, a potential sign that the support level of the Parallel Channel is holding up. The analyst thinks that the cryptocurrency may now be heading toward the midpoint of the pattern, located at $2.60. From the current price of the asset, a rally to this level would mean an increase of almost 20%. It now remains to be seen whether the coin’s surge will continue, or if it will retrace back to the support line again. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 7%, But Watch Out For Speculative Froth Something that could make the latter scenario more likely is profit-taking from the whales. As Martinez has highlighted in another X post, the large XRP holders carrying between 1 million and 10 million tokens participated in distribution during the asset’s latest recovery surge. As displayed in the chart, XRP whales reduced their supply by more than 180 million tokens (worth $391 million at the latest exchange rate) alongside its 17% price rally. This selloff was only a continuation of the trend from earlier in the month, and could be a potential sign that the sentiment among big-money traders hasn’t changed despite the rebound. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.17, down 1.5% over the last 24 hours.

54967131,634811,1764216033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54967131.jpeg,Has Bitcoin And Crypto Really Bottomed? On-Chain Firm Responds,https://bitcoinist.com/has-bitcoin-crypto-really-bottomed-on-chain-firm/,"Has Bitcoin genuinely carved out a cycle low or just staged another reflexive bounce? After briefly threatening to lose the $80,000 level and then rebounding toward $88,000, the “bottom” debate is back in full force. On-chain analytics firm Santiment has weighed in – and its answer is cautiously skeptical. Did Bitcoin Just Print Its Cycle Low? The firm begins by criticizing the way market labels are thrown around. “The terms ‘bull market’, ‘bear market’, ‘topped’, or ‘bottomed’ can truly mean whatever narrative a trader, investor, or community wants it to mean,” Santiment notes, pointing out that few commentators define a clear timeframe when they call a top or bottom. This opens the door to extreme confirmation bias “after the uptrend or downtrend of prices are already well established.” Still, the recent move off sub-$80,000 levels has been enough for some to argue that forced selling is behind us. Santiment acknowledges that “content that covers whether the ‘bottom’ has been established will always get some anxious traders excited again,” but stresses that price alone is not sufficient evidence. On sentiment, the data looks contrarian-constructive. Santiment highlights “how far traders’ optimism regarding Bitcoin (as an investment) can fall after monthly gains are no longer a guarantee.” Its social metrics show an uptick in declarations that crypto is in a bear market and a rise in bearish commentary. “The uptick in declaration of crypto being in a bear market, and rise of bearish sentiment are both clearly great signs,” the firm writes, reminding readers that “most major turnarounds occur when retail’s hope is mainly lost.” The open question: “Is the crowd’s hopes and dreams of getting their lambos really truly gone?” Bearish Arguments Still Predominant Derivatives positioning adds nuance. Aggregated funding rates show meaningful short exposure, but not yet at the extremes seen after the October 6 all-time high. “When we see many shorts like this it often stops the downtrend in its tracks,” Santiment explains, recalling how “many shorted about a week after the October 6th all-time high, and there was a temporary relief rally in late October as a result.” For now, though, “we’re not seeing quite the level of bets against the price of Bitcoin […] just yet anyways.” Profitability metrics paint a similar picture. Both 30-day and 365-day MVRV remain negative, indicating the average holder sits on unrealized losses. Santiment underlines that MVRV “shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of every token acquired,” and that as it rises, “more market participants become willing sellers.” With MVRV still depressed, the firm argues that “a rebound above $90K again soon wouldn’t be a major surprise at all.” The more concerning signals come from network fundamentals and holder structure. “If we look at the overall utility of Bitcoin, however, things look a bit dicey,” Santiment warns. Weekly new addresses have fallen from over 3.37 million at a mid-December 2023 peak to about 2.21 million now. Weekly active addresses are down from more than 963,900 to roughly 729,200. That underscores “declining utility” at a time when a durable bottom would typically coincide with stabilization or re-acceleration in network use. Even more problematic is the whale-to-retail shift. Santiment calls this “one other major elephant in the room that should bring you a bit of hesitance that ‘the bottom is in’.” Addresses holding 10–10,000 BTC “continue to shrink their collective supply held,” while wallets with less than 0.1 BTC “continue to grow theirs.” The firm is blunt: “This is the wrong combination to mark a bottom.” Since COVID-19, “ institutionals have driven up just about every bull rally,” and this 10–10,000 BTC cohort “had a lot to do with the October 6th all-time high.” Yet “by October 8th […] [they] began to flat-line their holdings, and have been shrinking them for about six weeks straight now,” while “small wallets […] are the ones scooping up dips in hopes that they ‘catch the falling knife’.” The verdict is split across timeframes. “Overall, data points to the most likely scenario being a short-term bounce,” backed by negative MVRV and vocal retail panic. But “Bitcoin clawing its way all the way to six figures looks like a stretch when […] whale bags are continuously appearing to be in ‘sell mode’.” Santiment concludes that “the long-term direction is still pointing to down” as long as “declining utility and declining whale and shark holdings” persist – while reminding investors that “crypto markets could be full of surprises” as the New Year approaches.

With price stabilizing near $91,100 after a sharp rebound from $80,542, markets are now watching whether Bitcoin can reclaim key Fibonacci levels and confirm a broader recovery phase. Bolivia Moves to Integrate Crypto Into Its Banking System Bolivia has reversed its long-standing ban on digital assets and is now preparing to integrate cryptocurrencies, starting with stablecoins, into its formal banking system. Finance Minister José Gabriel Espinoza confirmed that banks will soon be allowed to offer crypto-based services, including savings accounts, credit cards, and even loans linked to digital assets. BOLIVIA TO LET BANKS OFFER CRYPTO The government will begin integrating crypto beginning with stablecoins into the financial system, allowing banks to roll out crypto savings, credit cards, and loan products. pic.twitter.com/6AzIvfugVh — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) November 26, 2025 This shift began when the Bolivian Central Bank lifted restrictions on crypto transactions. Banco Bisa was the first major bank to act, launching USDT services to protect customers from local-currency depreciation and to simplify cross-border payments. Although the rollout starts with stablecoins, the policy marks a broader shift among emerging economies toward regulated digital-asset adoption. The move is expected to strengthen long-term confidence in Bitcoin as more countries integrate crypto into their financial infrastructure. Bitcoin Could Hit $89K as Short Squeeze Risk Builds Bitcoin traded around $87,950 on Wednesday as analysts warned that a sharp short squeeze could be forming. Large clusters of short positions are stacked between $88,000 and $89,000, levels where liquidation flows typically accelerate. If BTC pushes into that zone, short sellers may be forced to buy back aggressively, potentially driving price toward $90,000. Bitcoin price analysis suggests a potential short squeeze could propel BTC toward $89,000, coinciding with the S&P 500 approaching 2% below its all-time high. @Bitcoin #BitcoinPrice #DynamicNexus #DynamicNexusCrypto By Dynamic Nexus © pic.twitter.com/pQ3pqo5lzm — Dynamic Nexus Crypto (@DNexus_Crypto) November 26, 2025 However, if the price dips below $85,000 first, downside liquidity may be taken before any meaningful recovery attempt. Market positioning currently shows a near-even split between longs and shorts, hinting at a sizable directional move ahead. Rate-cut expectations for December have also improved sentiment across risk assets, helping lift the S&P 500 and potentially providing tailwinds for BTC. Strategy Unveils Credit Dashboard to Calm Market Fears Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, launched a credit-rating dashboard to reassure investors after the recent crypto drawdown. The company says it can sustain dividend payments for up to 70 years even if Bitcoin’s price remains stagnant. Strategy’s balance sheet remains strong, with assets still roughly six times larger than its debt even if BTC returns to its $74,000 average purchase price. LATEST: Strategy has introduced a new credit rating gauge to calm debt concerns after the Bitcoin crash! pic.twitter.com/d9gaPW3amC — Coinvo (@Coinvo) November 26, 2025 The firm’s long cash-flow runway reduces the risk of forced Bitcoin sales—especially important as several digital-asset treasury companies saw their stock values slump during the broader market correction. By continuing to hold BTC through volatility, Strategy may help stabilize supply and support institutional confidence. Bitcoin Technical Forecast: Buyers Test First Real Reversal Zone Bitcoin is stabilizing after a steep correction, currently trading near $91,100 following a decisive rebound from $80,542—its lowest level in months and the base of its descending channel. The move created the first notable higher low in weeks and brought BTC back toward the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $90,798. Price is testing the channel’s midline and the downward-sloping 20-EMA, both acting as short-term barriers. Early momentum improvement is visible as the RSI recovers from oversold conditions and starts forming mild bullish divergence. Candlesticks have shifted from heavy red bodies to spinning tops and smaller wicks, signaling fading sell pressure. A bullish engulfing close above $93,398 would strengthen the case for a reversal. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A breakout above $93,966 could open a path toward $97,135 and potentially $102,255, the next major resistance area. A long entry becomes compelling only if BTC closes above $91,800 with volume confirmation. Should buyers reclaim the 0.618 retracement, Bitcoin may transition into a broader recovery phase, setting a constructive backdrop ahead of upcoming presale cycles.

The digital asset now faces its toughest challenge yet – strong Bitcoin resistance in the mid-$90,000s that could determine the next major market move. What’s Creating This Bitcoin Resistance Wall? According to QCP Capital’s latest analysis, the current rally represents a technical rebound occurring amid shrinking market liquidity. While interest rate cut expectations provided the initial boost, several fundamental factors are now creating significant Bitcoin resistance at higher price levels. The trading firm identifies these key resistance factors: Weakening institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs Potential removal of Strategy from MSCI index Shrinking overall market liquidity AI sector momentum slowdown How Strong Is the Current Bitcoin Resistance? The mid-$90,000s represent a critical psychological and technical barrier that has proven difficult to breach. This Bitcoin resistance level isn’t just a random number – it’s where multiple technical indicators converge, creating a perfect storm of selling pressure. QCP Capital specifically highlights the $80,000 to $82,000 range as crucial support. If Bitcoin fails to break through the current Bitcoin resistance , we could see a retest of these support levels sooner than many investors expect. Why Are Institutions Losing Interest in Bitcoin? The weakening institutional appetite presents a major concern for overcoming current Bitcoin resistance . U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs haven’t seen significant net inflows recently, suggesting that large players might be taking profits rather than adding positions. Moreover, Strategy’s potential removal from the MSCI index could trigger substantial selling pressure. As the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, any negative development around Strategy creates additional Bitcoin resistance at higher price levels. Can Broader Market Trends Break This Bitcoin Resistance? The analysis reveals another worrying trend – the AI sector’s weakening momentum. Since risk assets often move together, trouble in the AI space could spill over into cryptocurrencies. Key indicators pointing to broader market pressure: Expanding credit risk across sectors Rising accounts receivable at NVIDIA Increasing inventory levels in tech companies Overall risk-asset correlation weakening These factors combine to create substantial Bitcoin resistance that even optimistic bulls must acknowledge. What Should Bitcoin Investors Watch For? Breaking through the current Bitcoin resistance requires either a fundamental catalyst or significant technical momentum. Investors should monitor these key indicators closely to gauge whether the resistance will hold or break. The battle at mid-$90,000s represents more than just a price level – it’s a test of Bitcoin’s underlying strength amid changing market conditions. The outcome will likely determine the cryptocurrency’s direction for weeks to come. Frequently Asked Questions What causes Bitcoin resistance at specific price levels? Bitcoin resistance forms where large sell orders accumulate, often at psychological price points or where previous buyers took profits. Technical indicators and market sentiment also contribute to these resistance zones. How long can Bitcoin resistance typically last? Resistance can last from hours to months, depending on market conditions. The current mid-$90,000s resistance appears strong due to multiple fundamental and technical factors aligning. What happens if Bitcoin breaks through resistance? A clean break above resistance with strong volume often leads to rapid price appreciation as shorts cover and new buyers enter, potentially creating a new support level. Should I buy Bitcoin when it hits resistance? Conservative traders typically wait for a confirmed break above resistance, while aggressive traders might scale in positions, understanding the risk of rejection at these levels. How does institutional demand affect Bitcoin resistance? Strong institutional buying can overwhelm resistance, while weak demand makes resistance levels harder to break, as we’re currently seeing with spot ETF flows. What support levels exist if Bitcoin fails to break resistance? QCP Capital identifies $80,000-$82,000 as key support, with additional levels around $75,000 and $70,000 providing stronger foundations if needed. Found this analysis helpful?

Oh Kyung-seok, CEO of Dunamu, which operates Upbit, said the platform moved quickly to halt activity once it detected abnormal withdrawals. “Upbit immediately suspended deposit/withdrawal services and conducted a comprehensive inspection, prioritizing the protection of member assets,” he said in a notice to users. It lands almost exactly six years after Upbit suffered another major breach. On the same date in 2019, the exchange lost 342,000 ETH, then worth about $41.5m, in a theft that South Korea later attributed to North Korean hackers . Authorities say the stolen Ether, now valued at more than $1b, remains one of the largest crypto heists linked to North Korea.

WE WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT THIS WILL NOT AFFECT MEMBER ASSETS"" SOURCE: https://t.co/LaGePSDOj4 pic.twitter.com/JRQzOFX2ot — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) November 27, 2025 Solana Tokens Moved To Unknown Wallet In Early-Morning Breach The exchange confirmed that around 4:42am on Nov. 27, a basket of Solana ecosystem assets, including SOL, USDC and a range of smaller tokens, was transferred to an unspecified external wallet. Upbit described the incident as “abnormal withdrawal activity” tied to the Solana network. According to the statement, Upbit has identified the full scale of the outflow and will absorb the loss itself. “We immediately identified the extent of the digital asset outflow caused by the abnormal withdrawals and will cover the entire amount with Upbit assets to ensure no damage to members’ assets,” Oh said. The company moved quickly to lock down its infrastructure. It shifted all assets to secure cold wallets to prevent further unauthorized transfers, and launched an emergency security review of the affected network and wallet systems. Deposit And Withdrawal Services To Resume After Systemwide Checks Upbit also started on-chain response measures. It said it is working to freeze the compromised funds where possible and has already frozen around 12 billion won worth of Solaire tokens. The exchange added that it is continuing to track the remaining assets and is coordinating with relevant projects and institutions to implement additional freezes. As the situation escalates, regulators and law enforcement are expected to be drawn in next. Further, the exchange is preparing to cooperate with investigative authorities as it pursues attempts to freeze and recover funds linked to the incident. At the same time, the security sweep may not be limited to Solana alone. Upbit said it is conducting a “comprehensive review of the stability and security of the entire digital asset deposit/withdrawal system, not just the Solana network,” and will resume deposits and withdrawals in stages once it is satisfied with the results. Throughout the notice, the company stressed that customer balances will not be touched. “To prevent any damage to member assets, the entire amount will be covered by Upbit’s holdings. We would like to reiterate that this will not affect member assets,” the exchange said. Finally, Upbit asked users to report any suspicious or verifiable information related to the withdrawals to its customer service team and repeated its apology for the disruption. Multibillion Dollar Deal Positions Upbit For Public Market Ambitions The attack comes at a sensitive moment for the company. Upbit is moving closer to a potential listing on Nasdaq after reports that Korean internet giant Naver is preparing to acquire its parent company, Dunamu, through a multibillion-dollar stock swap merger. The deal, which was expected to go before both companies’ boards on Nov. 26, would mark one of the largest corporate consolidations in Asia’s digital finance sector and could shape Upbit’s path toward a public-market debut.

This creates exceptional altcoin investment opportunities for shareholders who want diversified crypto exposure. Animoca’s strategy focuses on accessing promising projects before they become widely available. The company’s established presence in blockchain gaming provides insider access to innovative tokens.

This approach democratizes access to premium altcoin investment opportunities that were previously inaccessible. Consider these key benefits for investors: Early access to promising blockchain projects Diversified exposure across multiple altcoins Professional vetting of emerging opportunities Favorable pricing through institutional relationships What Makes Altcoins Different From Bitcoin?

Animoca Brands recognizes that different blockchain ecosystems serve unique purposes. From gaming tokens to DeFi protocols, each category presents distinct altcoin investment opportunities. The company’s expertise in identifying promising projects gives shareholders a significant advantage. How Can Investors Prepare For These Opportunities? Understanding the altcoin landscape becomes crucial as Animoca Brands moves toward its IPO. Investors should research blockchain sectors that align with their investment goals. The company’s focus on gaming and metaverse projects represents just one segment of available altcoin investment opportunities. Successful investing in this space requires: Monitoring emerging blockchain trends Understanding token economics Diversifying across multiple projects Staying informed about market developments What Does This Mean For Crypto Market Growth? The Animoca Brands IPO signals growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency investments. As major companies embrace blockchain technology, altcoin investment opportunities will continue expanding. This trend validates the entire digital asset ecosystem and encourages further innovation.

54969898,634875,1764219622,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54969898.jpeg,DeFi Could Capture 50% Of The World With Better Regulation: Chainlink Co-Founder,https://bitcoinist.com/defi-could-capture-50-of-the-world-with-better-regulation-chainlink-co-founder/,"Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov says DeFi, or decentralized finance, is closer to the mainstream than many realize, but real hurdles remain before it can scale to match traditional finance. According to Nazarov, DeFi is about 30% of the way to broad adoption, and clearer rules could push that figure higher. Reports have disclosed the sector has already seen rapid growth in lending protocols this year, with cumulative total value locked rising from $53 billion at the start of 2025 to more than $127 billion. Nazarov Sees Progress, But Gaps Remain Nazarov said that DeFi could hit 50% global adoption once regulation and law explain why these systems can be trusted. That is a big if. Regulators still wrestle with questions about onchain features, the role of intermediaries, and how to apply long-standing rules like KYC and AML to permissionless systems. Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov has raised similar doubts, pointing to legal uncertainty, liquidity questions, and security risks in smart contracts. Michael Selig, chief counsel for the crypto task force at the SEC, urged a focus on the technical details of onchain apps rather than just the buzzword DeFi. Regulation In The US Could Trigger Others Nazarov argues that clarity will likely start in the US and then influence other countries because many governments want compatibility with US finance. According to analysts, that domino effect is the optimistic scenario. If US rules create a clear path for banks, funds, and custodians to place client capital into decentralized systems, institutional flows could accelerate. Nazarov predicts that adoption could reach 70% when institutions have efficient means to move client money into DeFi. He added that full parity—where pie charts show comparable shares of institutional capital in DeFi and TradFi—might be visible by 2030. Institutional Money Is Arriving There are early signs that institutions are testing these waters. Stablecoins and tokenized assets have grown in prominence, and DeFi lending protocols are showing strong gains, up 72% year-to-date according to Binance Research. That growth is helping build a capital base that proponents say will make comparisons with traditional markets more plausible. Still, mainstream use by pension funds, insurers, and global banks requires stronger custody solutions, clearer legal frameworks, and better safeguards against exploits. What To Watch Next For markets, the key indicators will be regulatory rulings in major jurisdictions and measurable inflows from institutional treasuries. For users, what matters most are security, transparency, and a clear chain of accountability when things go wrong. Nazarov’s forecasts are bold. They reflect a belief among some founders that momentum plus rules will push DeFi from niche to normal. Whether that belief becomes reality will hinge on actions taken by regulators, the pace at which institutions adopt tokenized strategies, and whether networks can prove they are safe at scale.

Related Reading: Fear Surges, But Real XRP Holders Aren’t Shaken—Analyst Muted Debut On NYSE Arca Reports have disclosed that the debut fell well short of some public forecasts. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had suggested the fund might see roughly $10–12 million in opening-day volume, a target that the actual figures did not meet. That gap has drawn quick commentary from traders and analysts, who say the launch exposure was smaller than expected for a high-profile first spot product. Grayscale’s paperwork shows the ETF began life with holdings of about 11 million DOGE and roughly 94,700 shares outstanding, with assets under management reported at roughly $1.7 million at the time the fund started trading. The sponsor set a management fee of 0.35%, but that charge is being waived — the fund will carry a 0% expense ratio either until it reaches $1 billion in assets or for the first three months, whichever happens first. $GDOG (first Doge ETF) saw $1.4m volume on Day One.. solid for an avg launch but low for a ‘first-ever spot’ product. Not too surprising tho, we actually made a rhyme a while ago predicting this: ‘The further away you get from BTC, the less asset there will be.’ pic.twitter.com/ermlOcID1J — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 25, 2025 Market Shifts To Other Altcoins Based on reports from market trackers, other recent altcoin ETFs saw stronger early demand, leaving GDOG’s debut looking muted by comparison. Some XRP and Solana vehicles drew faster inflows during their openings, and that contrast has been used to explain why meme-coin exposure did not attract as much fresh cash on day one. Traders say that where money goes now may reflect a preference for certain tokens over meme-style names in regulated wrappers. What Investors Are Watching Next Observers note a few things to watch: whether the fee waiver helps the fund gather assets in the coming weeks, how DOGE’s market price behaves as more products list, and whether competing Dogecoin ETFs — including a product from Bitwise — change the flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word Some analysts are watching short term creation and redemption activity and the order books around the ETF to judge real demand versus headline interest. Dogecoin’s spot market showed mild movement after the listing, trading near $0.15 as the ETF opened. That price action suggests traders reacted but did not rush in, and it leaves the question of long-term institutional appetite open. Based on the data so far, GDOG’s quiet first day is a clear signal that listing alone does not guarantee big capital flows. The next few weeks — when the fee waiver is still active and competing listings arrive — will be key to see whether the fund can widen its reach or remain a subdued debut in a busy ETF calendar.

The move aligns with similar efforts in the UK and Australia, and reflects a global trend toward regulating youth access to digital platforms. The resolution passed with strong support The resolution was approved on Wednesday by the European Parliament and had 483 votes in favor, 92 against, and 86 abstentions, highlighting the confluence of opinions on the subject. The non-binding resolution calls for a default minimum age of 16 to access social media and AI chatbots to ensure “age-appropriate online engagement”. Online platforms, which are regulated under the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA), are required to comply with national laws, so every country has the right to decide on minimum age requirements. A statement published on the European Parliament’s website claims lawmakers support age 16 as the minimum age required to access social media, video-sharing platforms, and AI companions. However, 13- to 16-year-olds can still access it with parental consent. They also demanded a harmonized European digital age limit of 13, under which no minor could access social media platforms, video-sharing services, and AI companions. For now, the resolution is non-binding, legally or otherwise, and is being treated as a political statement expressing Parliament’s position on the issue. For it to be binding in any way, legislation would require formal proposals from the European Commission, as well as negotiations between EU member states and Parliament in a process that could take years to finalize. The resolution also comes with measures like a ban on addictive features designed to keep children hooked to screens, manipulative advertising, and gambling-like elements. Websites and apps that refuse to follow the mandate can expect to be outrightly blocked. Countries are banning social media for minors Minors getting exploited on social media has been one of the most unpleasant effects of social media. However, some countries have taken a stand and are working on measures that will protect minors, like the EU’s recent proposal. Recent reports now claim some countries, including Malaysia and Australia, are moving at a faster pace as they move to protect their minors on social media. According to an announcement made on Sunday, November 23, by Fahmi Fadzil, Malaysia’s communications minister, as part of an effort to protect kids from online harm such as cyberbullying and sexual abuse, Malaysia will ban people 16 years and younger from using social media in 2026. “I believe that if the government, regulatory bodies, and parents all play their roles, we can ensure that the Internet in Malaysia is not only fast, widespread and affordable but most importantly, safe, especially for children and families,” Fadzil said . He also claims digital platforms are required to institute customer identity verification by next year. “We hope by next year that social media platforms will comply with the government’s decision to bar those under the age of 16 from opening user accounts,” Fadzil said, according to Reuters and The Star. The minister has also said that his government will keep an eye on Australia’s implementation of a similar age limit for social media users, which is expected to start this December. “Other countries may have their own approaches, and we will study them,” he said. In Australia, the legislation to regulate minors interacting with social media will be introduced in Parliament during its last two weeks in session this year, which began on November 18. However, the age limit will not come into effect until 12 months after the law is passed, and it will be reviewed following its commencement. “This one’s for the mums and dads,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as he announced the legislation. “Social media is doing harm to our kids. And I’m calling time on it. I’ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties, and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. And I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back. I want parents to be able to say, ‘Sorry mate, that’s against the law for me to get you to do this.’ “ The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Dogecoin Price Holds Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1420, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.150 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.1550. A high was formed at $0.1565 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1490 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1565 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.160 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1620 level. A close above the $0.1620 resistance might send the price toward $0.1685. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.1740. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.180. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1565 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1510 level. The next major support is near the $0.1480 level and the trend line. The main support sits at $0.1450 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.1450 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1380 level or even $0.1330 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1510 and $0.1480.

His remarks arrived during a period of active trading, rising institutional interest, and closer monitoring of exchange data. The remarks also prompt a closer look at how quickly new spot ETF products may impact available liquidity. Rising OTC Demand Sets the Stage Claver described a sharp drawdown in off-exchange supply during the first week of ETF activity. This follows a prolonged trend of shrinking supply on exchanges . He said his original estimate suggested between 1 and 2 billion XRP sat in OTC and dark pool channels before the recent wave of purchases.

He argued that this level of consumption leaves only a limited amount of accessible supply outside public exchanges. His assessment places concentrated pressure on sources that large buyers often use to avoid market disruption. He noted that this volume may represent “either half or almost all” of the available OTC and dark pool reserves. The speed of that drawdown frames the next phase of ETF development , which he expects to arrive soon. Expectation of Additional Filings Claver said new spot XRP ETF products remain likely. He also said the market has not yet seen what he called the “big dogs at the table.” The market is still in its early stages , and he listed BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity as firms that he expects to file their own products. He then said, “I think they’re all coming to the table in the very near future.” His view places the potential ETF count for XRP ahead of Bitcoin if those firms proceed. The possibility of new filings adds weight to his focus on supply.

His remarks rely on the idea that future ETF issuers will need to source XRP directly from exchanges if off-exchange supply tightens. Exchange Activity Shows Early Signals Claver pointed to a recent XRP high of $91 on Kraken . He believes that this offered a glimmer of what could happen when ETFs move from OTC channels to public exchanges. He argued that buyers will shift to open markets once the remaining OTC supply disappears. He added that observers may feel surprised if his views materialize, noting that his outlook aligns with what he has discussed for the past 18 months.

The South Korean won leads the charge with impressive gains following the Bank of Korea’s decision to maintain current interest rates, creating unprecedented opportunities for forex traders and investors seeking exposure to emerging market assets. Why Are Asian Currencies Rallying Against the Dollar? The current forex market dynamics reveal a dramatic shift in sentiment. Recent economic data from the United States has fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve may implement rate cuts sooner than anticipated. This development has triggered a domino effect across global currency markets, with Asian currencies positioned as primary beneficiaries. The weakening US dollar has created ideal conditions for regional currencies to appreciate, offering traders substantial profit potential. Federal Reserve Rate Cut Expectations: The Game Changer Market participants are closely monitoring every signal from Federal Reserve officials. The growing consensus around potential Fed rate cuts has fundamentally altered currency valuation models. Consider these critical factors driving the current trend: Softer inflation data reducing pressure on Fed to maintain restrictive policy Slowing economic growth indicators suggesting need for stimulus Changing composition of FOMC voting members in 2024 Global central bank policy divergence creating arbitrage opportunities Bank of Korea Holds Steady: Strategic Masterstroke The Bank of Korea maintained its benchmark interest rate at 3.5%, a decision that immediately propelled the South Korean won to significant gains. This strategic pause reflects careful calibration of domestic economic needs against global monetary policy trends. The central bank’s decision demonstrates confidence in controlling inflation while supporting economic growth, sending a strong bullish signal to currency markets. Currency Gain Against USD Key Driver South Korean Won +1.8% BoK Rate Hold Japanese Yen +0.9% Carry Trade Unwinding Chinese Yuan +0.7% PBOC Support Measures Indian Rupee +0.6% Strong FDI Inflows Monetary Policy Divergence Creates Forex Opportunities The current environment highlights significant monetary policy divergence between major central banks. While the Fed signals potential easing, Asian central banks are maintaining or considering their own policy adjustments. This creates compelling trading setups: Carry trade strategies becoming increasingly attractive Currency pair volatility offering enhanced profit potential Hedging opportunities for multinational corporations Portfolio diversification benefits for international investors Actionable Trading Insights for Forex Participants Successful navigation of current market conditions requires strategic positioning. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor Fed speaker comments for policy direction clues Track Asian economic data releases for local currency strength indicators Implement proper risk management given increased volatility Consider correlated asset movements for confirmation signals Frequently Asked Questions How long will this Asian currency rally last? The duration depends on Fed policy confirmation and regional economic performance. Current momentum suggests sustained strength through the next quarter. Which Asian currency offers the best risk-reward profile? The South Korean won demonstrates strong fundamentals combined with technical breakout patterns, making it particularly attractive. How does this affect cryptocurrency markets? Weaker dollar conditions typically benefit risk assets including cryptocurrencies, though correlation patterns remain dynamic. What are the key risk factors? Unexpected Fed policy shifts, geopolitical tensions, and sudden risk aversion could reverse current trends. Which companies benefit most from Asian currency strength? Multinational corporations with significant Asian revenue exposure like Samsung , Toyota , and TSMC typically benefit from local currency appreciation. Conclusion: Seizing the Momentum The convergence of Fed dovish signals and Asian central bank stability has created a perfect storm for currency appreciation. The impressive rally in Asian currencies , led by the South Korean won’s surge post- Bank of Korea decision, demonstrates the power of coordinated monetary policy movements. As Fed rate cut expectations continue to reshape the global forex market , strategic positioning in Asian currency pairs offers substantial potential for informed traders and investors. The current alignment of fundamental and technical factors suggests this trend has room to run, making timely action crucial for capitalizing on these exceptional market conditions.

Tether rejected the assessment as misleading, and explained that most of its reserves are in low-risk US Treasurys. At the same time, new data from Glassnode shows a strong inverse correlation between Bitcoin’s price and USDt exchange flows, with large USDT outflows historically aligning with BTC peaks and profit-taking phases. S&P Drops Hammer on Tether’s USDt S&P Global Ratings downgraded Tether’s USDt to the lowest rating on its stablecoin stability scale, which raises concerns about the token’s ability to consistently maintain its one-to-one peg with the US dollar. The agency pointed to what it considers an elevated level of “higher-risk” assets in Tether’s reserves, including Bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate debt instruments. S&P rating given to USDt According to S&P, Bitcoin alone accounts for 5.6% of all USDt in circulation, This allocation exceeds the 3.9% buffer implied by Tether’s reported 103.9% collateralization ratio. Because these assets are more volatile than cash or Treasurys, a sharp downturn could potentially weaken collateral coverage. Breakdown of reserves (Source: S&P Global ) S&P also mentioned regulatory leniency as a factor behind the downgrade. Tether is headquartered in El Salvador and supervised by the country’s National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD), which has far looser requirements for reserve composition compared to major financial jurisdictions. The ratings agency pointed to the ongoing absence of full audits or detailed, independently verified proof-of-reserve disclosures as another core weakness. Despite the negative rating, S&P acknowledged that roughly 75% of USDt’s backing consists of US Treasurys and short-term instruments viewed as low-risk. Tether disputes the downgrade, and called the report “misleading” by arguing that it ignores key data about the token’s long track record and widespread adoption. In a statement , the company explained that S&P’s analysis fails to account for the scale and macroeconomic importance of digitally native money. CEO Paolo Ardoino criticized traditional ratings frameworks, and argued that legacy methodologies have historically misjudged risk by giving investment-grade ratings to institutions that later collapsed. The downgrade comes during a transformative year for the stablecoin industry, remembered for new US regulations, growing political interest, and a sector-wide market cap that surged past $300 billion. Meanwhile, Tether’s expanding global footprint is also turning heads. The company is now the 17th-largest holder of US Treasurys, with more than $112 billion in short-term government securities, placing it ahead of countries like South Korea and Germany. Tether also amassed 116 tons of gold , a reserve size comparable to those maintained by several central banks. Glassnode Reveals BTC–USDt Split Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode also identified a sharp inverse relationship between Bitcoin’s price movements and the flow of USDt to and from exchanges. In an analysis that was shared on Wednesday, Glassnode compared Bitcoin’s price action with USDT exchange net flows dating back to December 2023. The data shows that periods of rising Bitcoin prices almost always align with net outflows of USDt from exchanges, This means that traders are pulling stablecoins off platforms to take profits or hold on-chain. Glassnode explained that during highly optimistic market phases, USDT outflows typically spike between $100 million and $200 million per day. This trend intensified in October, when Bitcoin briefly hit a peak of $126,000, pushing 30-day average USDT net outflows above $220 million — a level Glassnode described as a clear profit-taking signal. The analytics firm said these outflows have since cooled, which indicates that traders appear to be re-accumulating dry powder for potential new market moves. A separate analysis by Whale Alert earlier this year also revealed a recurring pattern: Tether tends to mint new USDt during Bitcoin bull phases and burn tokens during downturns. Bitcoin and USDt are the world’s first- and third-largest cryptocurrencies, with market caps of roughly $1.8 trillion and $184 billion. The regulatory environment in the United States is also shaping the dynamics between Bitcoin, stablecoins, and institutional participation. In July, the US government passed the GENIUS Act, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed USDt will comply with the new law but later announced plans for an additional stablecoin, USAT, that is designed specifically to meet GENIUS requirements. Meanwhile, US federal and state authorities have shown interest in accumulating Bitcoin for strategic purposes. President Donald Trump even signed an executive order in March calling for the creation of a national digital asset reserve, though reports indicate the government has yet to fully implement the plan.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-27 05:30:00

He pointed out that both messaging platforms are advancing features like open account creation, along with improved metadata privacy. He noted, “Session app and SimpleX Chat are two messaging apps pushing these directions forward. For this reason, I’ve donated 128 ETH to each.“ Apps like SimpleX and Session have gained prominence because they step outside standard end-to-end encryption to address “metadata privacy,” including who you interact with, when, and how often. SimpleX, for example, operates on one-way messaging queues with no global identifiers, while Session uses a decentralized network of service nodes, rather than a single server. This makes them attractive to security-conscious users and aligns with Vitalik’s long-standing advocacy for decentralization. Vitalik agrees that the messaging apps are not yet perfect Still, Vitalik stated that the messaging apps aren’t flawless and they have some distance to cover before they reach top-tier usability and security. Real metadata protection depends on decentralisation, which isn’t easy, and the demand for multi-device access only raises the difficulty. He added, “Sybil / DoS resistance, both in the message routing network and on the user side (without forcing phone number dependence), adds further difficulty. These problems need more eyes on them.” A user on X pointed out that the 128 ETH donation is very on-brand for Vitalik. He noted that although it’s not a convenient number for humans, it’s perfect in binary terms—almost like he’s saying this is a structural privacy investment, not performative giving. Other users also appreciated Vitalik’s contribution to metadata privacy and permissionless onboarding. A user explained , “Huge respect for supporting the parts of private messaging most people ignore. Encryption is easy; metadata privacy and permissionless onboarding are the real boss fight. Session & SimpleX are far from perfect, but they’re tackling the hardest problems in the stack.” The Signal app has already begun rolling out secure backups on iOS, allowing users to save their chats and restore them if their phone is lost or damaged. Android users got secure backups in September, with messages and media encrypted end-to-end. Each backup requires a 64-character key from your device, which Signal cannot recover if misplaced. However, according to Forbes, the app has been a target for hackers. ThreatFabric researchers confirmed a new, particularly aggressive banking trojan on Android that surpasses standard malware. The malware, which is still in development, can bypass encrypted messaging. So far, the hackers haven’t broken the encryption yet. Rather, they’ve built a complicated method that simply captures messages after you’ve decrypted them on your screen. State-affiliated actors and cyber mercenaries are abusing commercial spyware to infiltrate Signal and WhatsApp accounts, hijack devices, and quietly monitor key users. Vitalik says Ethereum will move to targeted, goal-driven optimisation next year Vitalik has lately also shared new thoughts on ETH, noting that Ethereum’s growth in the coming year will involve “more selective scaling.” He indicated that Ethereum will transition from broad-ranging scaling to targeted, goal-driven optimisation in the next phase. He explained that Ethereum’s expansion will continue overall, but different areas will scale at varying rates. One idea he floated was increasing the block gas limit fivefold and matching that with higher gas costs for low-efficiency transactions. The idea is to strengthen the network’s ability to scale and encourage better optimisation of its resources. Vitalik explained further that the proposal covers SSTORE when opening new storage slots, as well as several other SSTORE-related actions, precompiles other than elliptic-curve ones, large-contract calls, complex arithmetic operations, and calldata.

This technical development has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, with experts divided on what lies ahead for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. What Exactly is the Bitcoin Death Cross? A Bitcoin death cross occurs when the 200-day moving average drops below the 50-day moving average, signaling potential long-term bearish momentum. This technical pattern has historically preceded significant market downturns, making it a crucial indicator that traders and investors monitor closely. The current formation has sparked widespread discussion about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Bear Market Declarations: Why Some Experts Are Concerned Several prominent analysts are sounding alarm bells following this technical development. Crypto₿irb, with 700,000 followers on X, states unequivocally that the bull market has ended from a technical perspective. The analyst points to three key factors: Trend reversal in the 200-day moving average Surge in trading volume during price drops Above-average market volatility patterns Similarly, 10x Research analyst Markus Thielen confirms that Bitcoin is currently in a bear market, though he notes the possibility of temporary reversal rallies. Counterarguments: Why Some Experts Urge Caution Not all market observers are convinced that the Bitcoin death cross signals a prolonged downturn. Henrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Capital, argues that while buying pressure from digital asset treasuries has diminished, it’s premature to definitively declare a bear market. Analyst Skew offers a conditional outlook, suggesting that price movement from current levels will provide clearer signals about market direction. Key Levels to Watch in Bitcoin Price Action Technical analysts emphasize several critical price levels that could determine Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. The $88,000 level emerges as particularly significant, with a drop below this threshold potentially indicating a failed rebound. Conversely, sustained movement above this level could signal renewed upward momentum. Market participants should monitor these key technical levels closely. Historical Context of Bitcoin Death Cross Patterns Previous Bitcoin death cross formations provide valuable context for current market conditions. Historically, this pattern has sometimes preceded temporary corrections rather than extended bear markets. However, the combination of current technical factors makes this particular formation especially noteworthy for traders and long-term investors alike. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the current market uncertainty, investors should consider several strategic approaches: Diversify cryptocurrency holdings across different assets Implement disciplined risk management strategies Monitor key technical levels for entry and exit points Maintain a long-term perspective amid short-term volatility Conclusion: Navigating Market Uncertainty The Bitcoin death cross has undoubtedly created market uncertainty, but it also presents opportunities for informed investors. While technical indicators suggest caution, market conditions remain fluid. Successful navigation of this period requires careful analysis, risk management, and attention to both technical and fundamental factors. The coming weeks will likely provide clearer direction for Bitcoin’s medium-term trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin death cross? A Bitcoin death cross is a technical chart pattern that occurs when the 200-day moving average crosses below the 50-day moving average, typically indicating potential bearish momentum. How reliable is the death cross indicator? While historically significant, the death cross should be considered alongside other technical indicators and market fundamentals rather than in isolation. Should I sell my Bitcoin because of the death cross? Investment decisions should be based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall portfolio strategy rather than any single technical indicator. How long do bear markets typically last in cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency bear markets can vary significantly in duration, ranging from several months to over a year, depending on market conditions and external factors. What other indicators should I watch alongside the death cross? Important complementary indicators include trading volume, relative strength index (RSI), support and resistance levels, and broader market sentiment. Can the death cross signal be false? Yes, like all technical indicators, the death cross can produce false signals, which is why confirmation from other indicators is crucial. Found this analysis helpful?

54972837,635003,1764223212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54972837.jpeg,JPMorgan Launches Bitcoin Structured Note Offering 1.5x Returns With BlackRock’s IBIT,https://bitcoinist.com/jpmorgan-launches-bitcoin-structured-note/,"JPMorgan unveiled a new financial product—a leveraged structured note linked directly to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This announcement comes after intense scrutiny of the bank for allegedly targeting Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin proxy firm headed by Michael Saylor. New IBIT-Linked Notes From JPMorgan According to the bank’s filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), this structured note is strategically aligned with Bitcoin’s four-year Halving cycle, setting a maturity date for 2028. Investors who purchase these IBIT-linked notes can potentially realize returns through an auto-call process that activates after one year, or upon reaching the final maturity date in 2028, which coincides with the next Bitcoin Halving . Key features of this product include a guaranteed minimum fixed return of 16% if the IBIT exceeds certain price levels after a year. However, there is principal protection against declines of up to 30% in IBIT’s value, alongside capped maximum returns to maintain an appropriate risk-reward profile . Notably, if IBIT falls more than 30% from its initial levels, loss exposure is triggered. This product launch reflects a renewed perspective on Bitcoin and digital assets from JPMorgan, despite CEO Jamie Dimon’s consistent skepticism regarding the cryptocurrency. Earlier in the week, the bank commented on the nature of crypto, suggesting it is shifting away from a venture capital-like ecosystem towards a more tradable macro asset class, supported by institutional liquidity rather than merely retail speculation. One analyst suggested that Bitcoin could reach $240,000 over the long term. Expert Warns Of Risks In The Bank’s New Bitcoin Offering Market expert Simon Dixon took to social media to express concerns about JPMorgan’s new offering, criticizing the product as a complex, asymmetric bet that allows JPMorgan to benefit while exposing individual investors to significant risks. According to Dixon, if Bitcoin were to drop by 40%, individual investors would bear the consequences, while the bank retains the benefits of liquidity and fees, positioning itself favorably in the market. Amid these developments, reports from NewsBTC indicated that the bank had cautioned that Strategy might be removed from major equity indices, specifically the MSCI USA Index. Analysts at JPMorgan noted that the challenges facing Strategy extend beyond recent declines in cryptocurrency prices, which have seen Bitcoin fall over 30% from its all-time highs. If the anticipated MSCI decision takes place by January 15, it could trigger passive outflows estimated between $2.8 billion and $8.8 billion. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $87,247. It has been consolidating between this level and $85,000 for the past few days, following the latest correction that saw the cryptocurrency retrace all the way down to $80,000 last Friday.

Momentum has slowed, volatility is tightening, and attention is now locked on one key level that could determine whether BTC stages a recovery or slips further into the trap below $82,000. Key Resistance at $89,000 Remains Bitcoin’s Biggest Hurdle Analyst Lennaert Snyder highlighted in a recent update that BTC is currently locked in a critical fight for the key $89,000 resistance level. He acknowledged the recent price action, noting that Bitcoin had a “nice bounce” from the support box he posted yesterday, advising those who longed for the bottom to “enjoy the gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sudden Volatility Jump Signals Options Could Be Calling The Shots—Analyst Snyder confirmed that the $86,000 support box is still valid, but stressed that this level should now only be used for reversals. A return to this support would be interpreted as a weak sign, indicating that buyers are struggling to maintain the current altitude. The primary objective remains to break the immediate overhead barrier. Lennaert Snyder states that Bitcoin still needs to decisively reclaim the $89,000 resistance to trigger a meaningful rally and long entries to the next target at $93,000. Given the ongoing struggle at resistance, the analyst confirms that it is “totally understandable” if traders are looking for local short entries. Losing the crucial $86,000 support level would confirm a structural breakdown, triggering shorts to the next major target at the $82,200 rangelow. Finally, Lennaert Snyder warned about the potential for a deeper move, stating that if the market goes for the lows again, it should be treated as a reversal opportunity only. He notes a high probability that sellers will sweep the $80,600 low to “tank new fuel.” Smart Risk First: Analyst Stresses Discipline Over Aggression According to crypto expert and investor Ted Pillows, the current Bitcoin setup is a moment that demands strict risk management. He emphasized that BTC continues to face heavy rejection around the $88,000 resistance level, making this zone a decisive barrier for further upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Loses Strength, Traders Watch $90K as Last Line of Defense In response to the ongoing uncertainty, Ted noted that he has manually taken partial profits across all open trades. The move is meant to reduce exposure and protect capital until Bitcoin provides a clearer directional signal. With volatility tightening, he believes caution is the smarter play. Ted added that he intends to scale back into his positions only after Bitcoin successfully flips the resistance level into support and holds above the S/R zone.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is eager to build an institution-led digital finance ecosystem that distances itself from the volatility of the crypto market. It is preparing to issue tokenized government bills settled in wholesale CBDC next year in a move MAS said could help its digital market reach “lift off” after years of experimenting with tokenization. Dr Cheryl Wang from the Global Fintech Institute said Singapore is deliberately shifting its narrative away from its early open-door approach. “Singapore is attracting large financial institutions and serious Web3 and cryptocurrency firms, but not the smaller, highly speculative retail trading platforms it once did,” she said. “The ‘everyone-can-try-crypto’ era in Singapore has ended.” The scars from crypto collapses Singapore has been jolted by a string of global crypto-related failures, which have reshaped its regulatory position. Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings, suffered a $275 million loss in 2022 after the collapse of FTX, which was a blow to the city’s efforts to cultivate a regulated crypto hub. The damage coincided with the failure of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which invested in Luna tokens before its crash the same year. The hedge fund lost roughly $8 billion in client assets and deepened scrutiny of the sector. In 2022, then-managing director of MAS Ravi Menon labelled cryptocurrency “highly hazardous” and emphasized that MAS does not want Singapore to be a speculative crypto hub. Dr Wang said Singapore is now recasting itself as a steward of the industry. “In the last five years, Singapore has moved away from being an important stop for crypto testing. It now focuses on back-end systems, common rules, infrastructure, and building trust,” she said. Common standards for cross-border settlement Singapore is pushing for global coordination to build the infrastructure needed for tokenization. At Singapore Fintech Week 2025, MAS Deputy Managing Director Sing Chiong Leong said the digital asset ecosystem will only scale if financial networks operate like global aviation, which relies on standardized protocol, interoperable systems, and trust. “If you think of global aviation, planes can fly anywhere in the world because everyone follows the same standards…We need the same approach for cross border digital money and tokenized asset settlement.” He said this ecosystem would not “emerge by chance,” and requires “hard work, and heavy lifting” from public and private collaboration. MAS has warned that institutional risk creates fragmented “sub-scale walled gardens” unless common standards are adopted. Innovation in “trusted” tokenization Singapore is running one of the world’s most ambitious experiments in tokenization. It is in the process of turning traditional financial assets, such as government bonds or bank deposits into digital tokens that can move instantly on blockchain networks. Singapore is building its future financial system in layers, with the SGD Testnet serving as the glue that ties the government’s different tokenization pilots together. The SGD Testnet is the common blockchain network testing tokenized bonds settlements, money market funds and FX trades under Project Guardian, while also supporting digital Singapore dollar experiments under Project Orchid. Professor of Finance Ben Charoenwong from Insead business school explains that tokenization in Singapore is rooted in “trusted tokenization” – a version of blockchain where banks and regulators play a leading role. “Regulators understand that fully decentralized ‘trustless’ systems cannot meet basic anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements,” he said. “Turing complete blockchains simply can’t comply with the law.” A “turing complete blockchain” is a powerful smart contract system that can run any computable program, but regulators can’t guarantee that every path the code takes is compliant with the law. He said tokenization sandboxes focus on permissioned versions and testing whether they can still deliver efficiency gains once they are built in real-world governance, verified reserves, and proper oversight. The most recent project, BLOOM, which launched in October, is expanding payment options beyond CBDC to include stablecoins, tokenized bank deposits, and wholesale payments to enable faster, safer, and more efficient cross-border payments. Singapore is preparing to introduce stablecoin legislation next year, which will mandate high-quality liquid assets and redemption reliability. But Stablecoins are not Singapore’s top priority. MAS is placing much more strategic emphasis on wholesale CBDCs and tokenized deposits. Professor Charoenwong warns that the real risks lie in systemic contagion from stablecoins. “The real threat is not innovation,” he said. “It’s the spread of poorly regulated foreign stablecoins that can destabilize even well supervised markets.” Expanding partnerships with banks Singapore has struck new deals with a number of banks to test digital asset settlement across borders. On November 13, MAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Deutsche Bundesbank to develop common standards. It has also announced experiments with the Bank of England and the Bank of Thailand for real-time FX using interoperable systems. Singapore’s stock exchange is also preparing to launch exchange-cleared Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures for institutional investors, part of an effort to shift crypto exposure into regulated market infrastructure. Meanwhile, Swiss Investment bank UBS and Singapore-based digital payments company, Ant International, are testing tokenized bank deposits and real-time cross-border liquidity flows as a part of the MAS-led tokenization sandbox Project Guardian. Wealth management firms in Singapore are also reporting rising demand for tokenized gold, tokenized treasuries, and blockchain fund structures, describing tokenization as a structural upgrade that increases capital efficiency. As Dr Cheryl Wang from the Global Fintech Institute said, the coming era of tokenized finance and round-the-clock AI trading will test not just the resilience of new systems, but the values that underlie them. The challenge, she said, is to remember the underlying mission that drives digital finance. She said “responsible innovation” will broaden inclusion, improve cross border payments, and ultimately enhance human welfare. “Technology should empower people. It should never replace them.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Regulation|digital assets|MAS|Singapore|Stablecoins|tokenization,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-27 06:00:29

His certainty pushed many users to review the chart and question the short spike. The claim added tension to the ongoing discussion. He treated the event as a brief reveal of a true value before it vanished. His tone encouraged others to voice their own views with the same level of conviction. Was the $91 a Glitch?

The latter is a gaming platform focused on building Pi-integrated titles for tens of millions of Pi Network users, often referred to as Pioneers. Gaming Experience to Grow? In the statement, the team described the move as one of its most ambitious yet, aiming to turn the overall gaming experience within its project into a core pillar and to signal to developers that the project is ready to support Web3 games at scale. CiDi Games will help expand Pi’s use cases, accelerate developer engagement, and create new ways for Pioneers to use the native token daily. Both parties want to create lightweight, accessible games and set the stage for a more interactive, utility-driven Web3 environment by merging Pi’s vast global community with CiDi Games’ expertise. Pi Network’s team believes games are the natural next step for its ecosystem developments as they are social, interactive, and built around virtual economies. All of these elements align with Pi’s large, verified human network and growing suite of developer tools, the team claimed. The partnership also creates a powerful feedback loop: Games attract Pioneers → driving engagement, usage, and daily activity Developers build more utility → strengthening Pi’s ecosystem with transactions, innovation, and production The team emphasized that this is not the first gaming-oriented move it has made over the past year or so, as it has supported the industry through hackathons, incubation programs, prebuilt tools, and monetization layers such as the Pi Ad Network. FruityPi is among the most popular Pi-native games, which has integrated Pi payments, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ads. Strategic Investment Aside from the partnership between the two, the Core Team also highlighted the growing role of Pi Network Ventures, a recently launched $100 million investment arm supporting various Pi-native projects. By backing CiDi Games, the investment branch signals confidence in the team’s experience and long-term vision. Lastly, the announcement states that the Core Team is focused on building an ecosystem where platform tools, engagement, deeper incentives, and app innovation grow together, rather than working on single products.

According to Bloomberg-sourced reporting, Hassett has “emerged as the frontrunner” for President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Federal Reserve, seen as the candidate most aligned with Trump’s preference for lower interest rates. Earlier disclosures showed Hassett previously served as an adviser to Coinbase and holds at least $1 million in Coinbase stock. How Will Hassett Impact The Crypto Market? For crypto allocators, that combination of macro dovishness and direct exposure to a major US exchange is the core of the bull case. Bitwise senior investment strategist Juan Leon put it bluntly on X: “If Kevin Hassett becomes Fed Chair, the implications for crypto are strongly bullish.” He calls Hassett an “aggressive ‘dove’ who has publicly criticized current rates for being too high and advocated for deeper, faster cuts,” highlighting that he “served on Coinbase’s advisory board and owns large stake in COIN,” and that he “led the White House digital asset working group to shape pro-crypto regulation.” Related Reading: Crypto Has Entered Late-Cycle Territory, Says Global Liquidity Veteran But the potential Hassett regime cannot be separated from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s emerging blueprint for the Fed. Bessent has been openly questioning the post-crisis operating framework. As Walter Bloomberg relayed from his CNBC appearance, “BESSENT ON FED: ‘AMPLE RESERVES REGIME’ MIGHT BE FRAYING.” Forward Guidance host Felix Jauvin summarized the direction of travel in a post: “Bessent wants a fed chair that gets us out of balance sheet shenanigans and simplifying things to how they were pre-ample regime. Dovish FFR, hawkish balance sheet.” He added: “I don’t know if I can emphasize enough just how far away we are from any sort of QE copium.” That framing matters for crypto. A Hassett Fed that cuts the policy rate faster in downturns is one thing; a return to full-blown quantitative easing is another. A “dovish FFR, hawkish balance sheet” mix would still be a friendlier macro environment than the post-2022 tightening cycle, but it is not a guaranteed repeat of the 2020–2021 liquidity wave that lifted every risk asset simultaneously. Rate cuts without large-scale asset purchases support risk appetite and lower discount rates, yet they do not automatically recreate the extreme “everything rally” conditions that many in crypto implicitly associate with Fed dovishness. The political logic behind Hassett’s rise has been described most clearly by macro commentator EndGame Macro (@onechancefreedm). In a thread, he argues that “Hassett isn’t leading because he’s the most academic or the most central bankerish. He’s leading because he checks the boxes Trump actually cares about.” Related Reading: Latest Crypto Crash Wipes $1 Billion Off Trump Family’s Wealth Trump, he writes, wants someone he already trusts, who has “spent years defending Trump publicly,” and who has been “openly critical of the Fed for being too slow, too cautious, and too political.” In that framework, “markets hear dovish. Trump hears I can deliver growth again. And crypto folks hear one of us.” Markets are starting to agree. On Polymarket, contracts tracking the Fed chair race show Hassett around 53% at press time, reinforcing that shift from speculation to probabilistic base case. Whether that translates into a genuine “explosion” in crypto will depend less on personalities than on the interaction of three forces: how aggressively a Hassett Fed actually cuts, how far Bessent is willing to go in shrinking or simplifying the balance sheet, and how markets reassess inflation, term premia and fiscal risk under a more overtly political central bank. The odds market is signaling that crypto is moving closer to the center of US monetary power. The scale of any move in 2026 will be determined by the cycle – and by how a Hassett-led Fed balances “dovish rates” with “hawkish balance sheet” in practice. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.96 trillion.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/november-29-is-a-big-day-for-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"XRP Update (@XrpUdate) highlighted a development that adds momentum to the rapidly growing market for XRP investment products. In a recent post, he revealed that the 21Shares spot XRP ETF will begin trading on November 29. This news arrived during a period of heightened attention on institutional products linked to XRP. Traders continue to watch inflow data , competitive filings, and new listings as large issuers move quickly to secure positions in this growing market. BREAKING: The 21Shares $XRP Spot ETF (ticker: TOXR) has received official approval and is set to begin trading on, November 29. This marks another major milestone in expanding institutional access to $XRP . pic.twitter.com/9PIvvFjxgV — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) November 26, 2025 A New Entry From 21Shares The 21Shares XRP ETF will trade under the ticker “TOXR.” It will join the list of recently approved spot XRP ETFs, further expanding the market. The product holds real XRP rather than futures or swaps. This structure gives investors the means to track XRP price movements without handling digital assets. 21Shares has experience with crypto ETFs and plans to expand its lineup through this new launch. Interest in XRP ETFs has grown in recent weeks. More investors want access to XRP without using cryptocurrency exchanges. Spot ETFs give them that option. The Growing ETF Market The approval enables the company to enter a fast-growing group of issuers. Firms like Franklin Templeton , Bitwise, Canary Capital , and more have seen very successful ETF launches. These show the sector is fast-growing. The competition between issuers also offers investors more choices, encouraging a competitive market. Inflows into these funds have been strong. Investors showed interest in these vehicles because they provide access without direct interaction with the crypto market. They offer clear reporting, third-party custody, and standard trading hours. These factors open the door for new classes of investors who may not join crypto exchanges but still want exposure to the asset. Many experts also believe these products could impact XRP’s price . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What TOXR Could Mean for XRP’s Price The inflow has caught the attention of analysts. Spot ETFs add demand for real XRP because issuers must buy tokens when they create new shares. If inflows remain high, supply on exchanges can tighten. That can affect price conditions when the buying continues for long periods. The launch of TOXR adds another source of demand. Investors familiar with 21Shares may choose this product because they already use the firm’s other offerings. Strong volumes following the debut could pull more capital into XRP. Analysts will watch how the market responds when TOXR begins trading on November 29. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The move occurred in the early Asian hours, which is believed to have been transferred to Coinbase Prime for custody. SpaceX( @SpaceX ) transferred out another 1,163 $BTC ($105.23M) 2 hours ago, possibly to Coinbase Prime for custody. https://t.co/zW62EKM2RD pic.twitter.com/vrbu6tPGR4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 27, 2025 Per Arkham data , the transfer comes a month after the space exploration company sent massive amounts of Bitcoin to a new address in October. The transactions involved 1,215 BTC sent to multiple new addresses, totalling $133.7 million. SpaceX’s wallet now holds a total of 6,095 Bitcoin worth almost $553 million, post the recent transfer. According to BitcoinTreasuries , SpaceX is placed fourth among privately held companies with Bitcoin treasuries. SpaceX BTC Flow – Custody Rather Than Selling The SpaceX wallet was dormant for 3 years before resuming activity in late July 2025. The company once held as much as 25,000 BTC in 2022, but later consolidated and reduced its on-chain balance to current levels. The reason for the latest transfers remains unclear. The company has not made any comments on whether the transfer indicates a sale, internal restructuring, or enhanced security measures for its crypto holdings. However, analysts believe that the shuffle signals improved custody plans, rather than for liquidation purposes. One user wrote that big transfers from companies like SpaceX denote they’re “positioning” for something. “Could be routine custody, but it still adds a layer of uncertainty you don’t want to ignore,” the user wrote on X . Further, the only certainty so far is that both receiving wallets remain untouched, no outgoing transfers, no exchange interaction, and no liquidation trails. “When institutions like SpaceX move Bitcoin, they don’t do it impulsively,” wrote another user. “The market may need time to understand the purpose, but the signal is already there. Quiet transfers sometimes speak louder than announcements.” For months, the SpaceX wallets sat perfectly still, no transfers, no experiments, no hints of intent. Then, just six hours ago, the silence broke. Without warning, 1,163 $BTC , over $105 million, was pushed out of storage and split between two completely fresh addresses.

This unexpected transaction has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, raising questions about market timing and whale behavior patterns. The dormant Bitcoin whale activity represents one of the most significant movements we’ve seen in recent months, offering valuable insights for both novice and experienced investors. What Does This Dormant Bitcoin Whale Activity Mean? The recent transaction involving this dormant Bitcoin whale provides crucial market signals that every crypto enthusiast should understand. According to Lookonchain data, the whale had previously withdrawn 400 BTC from OKX in April 2023 when Bitcoin was trading at $28,432. This means the investor held through significant market fluctuations before deciding to sell approximately half of their position. The timing of this dormant Bitcoin whale movement suggests careful strategic planning rather than panic selling. Why Should You Care About Whale Movements? Understanding dormant Bitcoin whale activity can significantly impact your investment decisions. These large holders often possess insider knowledge or sophisticated trading strategies that retail investors might miss. When a dormant Bitcoin whale awakens after years of inactivity, it typically indicates one of several scenarios: Profit-taking after substantial gains Portfolio rebalancing strategies Anticipation of market corrections Liquidity needs for other investments How Does This Affect Bitcoin’s Market Position? The sale by this dormant Bitcoin whale comes at a crucial time for cryptocurrency markets. While $18.35 million represents a substantial amount, it’s important to note that this represents only half of the whale’s original position. The remaining 200 BTC continues to be held, suggesting the investor maintains some confidence in Bitcoin’s future performance. This partial selling strategy often indicates balanced risk management rather than complete loss of faith in the asset. What Can We Learn From This Dormant Bitcoin Whale? This particular dormant Bitcoin whale provides valuable lessons for cryptocurrency investors. The investor demonstrated remarkable patience by holding through three years of market volatility before executing this strategic sale. Their approach highlights several key investment principles: Long-term perspective pays off in cryptocurrency markets Strategic timing matters more than constant trading Partial profit-taking can balance risk and reward Monitoring whale activity provides market intelligence What’s Next for Bitcoin After This Whale Movement? Following this dormant Bitcoin whale transaction, market analysts are closely watching for similar patterns among other large holders. The fact that this whale sold only half their position suggests they might be anticipating both short-term volatility and long-term growth potential. This balanced approach often signals sophisticated market understanding that retail investors can learn from when developing their own Bitcoin investment strategies. FAQs About Dormant Bitcoin Whale Activity What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds large amounts of cryptocurrency, typically enough to influence market prices through their trading activities. Why do whales go dormant? Whales often remain dormant to avoid affecting market prices, wait for optimal selling conditions, or simply because they believe in long-term holding strategies. How can I track whale movements? You can monitor whale activity through blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Whale Alert, and various cryptocurrency tracking tools that specialize in large transaction monitoring. Should I sell when whales sell? Not necessarily. Whale movements should be considered as one factor among many in your investment decisions, alongside fundamental analysis and market conditions. What does partial selling by whales indicate? Partial selling often suggests profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing rather than complete loss of confidence in the asset. How often do dormant whales become active? There’s no fixed pattern, but dormant periods can last from months to several years depending on market conditions and individual investment strategies.

Analysts caution that such a practice might drive prices down in the next few days. According to CryptoQuant, the highest inflows of exchanges were 9,000 BTC on November 21. On Coinbase, the cryptocurrency fell to $80,600 on the same day. This marked a seven-month low for the digital asset. Rising exchange deposits typically signal preparation for sales. When investors want to sell their holdings, they need to transfer coins to trading platforms. The converse trend implies accumulation. Statistics show that 45% of the total BTC sent to exchanges originated in large deposits. Transfers of 100 BTC or more reached 7,000 BTC in a single day. The large holders are selling in response to such movements. Large Deposits Drive Market Dynamics The whale cohort has been very active in terms of sales during the present drawdown. Values of average deposits increased to 1.23 BTC in November. This is the highest it has been in 12 months. This week, Binance stablecoin reserves increased to $51 billion. The figure represents an all-time high for the exchange. BTC and Ether inflows reached $40 billion across major platforms. High stablecoin reserves indicate a rotation out of cryptocurrencies. In the event of uncertainty, capital generally flows to dollar-pegged assets. Investors deposit funds in stablecoins until market conditions improve. Leverage Remains in System Analyst James Check identified the remaining leverage that needs to be cleared. Markets may see a move into the $70,000-$80,000 range. This would eliminate final pockets of excessive positioning. BitMine chairman Tom Lee adjusted his price target expectations. He had previously forecasted that Bitcoin would reach $250,000. Lee now considers even an all-time high by year's end uncertain. The selling pattern extends beyond Bitcoin alone. Ether experienced similar deposit increases to exchanges. Total inflows remained modest compared to the volumes of Bitcoin. Bitcoin reclaimed the $90,000 level after recent weakness. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $91,251, suggesting a 3.9% increase in the last 24 hours.

One such opportunity encompasses Solana (SOL), which is currently plummeting to critical levels not seen in several months. The other opportunity encompasses Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , whose presale transactions are gaining momentum towards completing a full sale. The unfolding events features MUTM as one of the best cryptos to invest in for those seeking to invest in high-growth returns amidst current market uncertainties. The swift progression of Mutuum Finance presale stages demonstrates relevant momentum to make it a viable choice amidst risks associated with SOL’s performance in the market. SOL Patterns Bearish Technical Pattern Solana faces increased sell momentum with current pricing around $127 and proximity to its $123 support level, which it has yet to test in over seven months. Technical analysis shows it may be seeing a Death Cross pattern formance occur where shorter-term exponential averages cross below longer-term amounts, typically acting as strong eminent signals of trend continuation via strong downtrends. Historically speaking, such events have shown to cause SOL to dump 59% from its highs potentially plummeting SOL to $98. Currently, Solana altcoin is down 47% from its last peak; realized gains/losses reached lows not seen since June 2023. Though conditions have decreased investor trust lately, there’s one reason to be optimistic about Solana’s continuance; if its Net Realized Profit & Loss Ratio test below 0.1 levelers have seen past breakouts result in market trend changes. MUTM Presale Close to Full Distribution Despite market fluctuations in Solana, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows considerable resilience as it reaches over 95% allocation in its Phase 6 presale stage and draws to completion. The community has registered $19,000,000 from more than 18,200 contributors for this new crypto market entry. The tokens sell for $0.035; however, this pricing tier will come to closure very soon; Phase 7 begins to apply a sharp 20% price surge to $0.040. The presale allows for early bird incentives; hence, buyers now have all odds favoring them for potentially reaping a 400% profit following market entry via its $0.06 pricing tier. The time to invest in MUTM begins to come to closure as tokens in Phase 6 sell out quickly. Being part of Mutuum Finance market entry means not just investing but carefully joining a market whose performance shows definite momentum to mature into MUTM as one of the top cryptos delivering optimum profits amidst market instability. Dual-Lending Architecture Increases Yield Potential The main novelty of Mutuum Finance revolves around its bi-market lending solution combining elements of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems to make it even more fluid and adaptable to different requirements pertaining to liquidity management. The P2C system allows lending participants to stake their best cryptocurrencies such as ETH and USDT in common pools where these tokens earn returns as other borrowers borrow and utilize these tokens. At the same time, it also allows borrowers to hold these less prominent cryptocurrencies like other lending platforms where they can make lending contracts. The result of all these efforts leads to creating passive income sources for users by allowing them to earn rewards in form of mtTokens that accrue value over time. Such complex systems make Mutuum Finance one of the prominent DeFi cryptocurrencies. Secure Your Position Before the Window Closes Before the window closes, the current trend in Solana emphasizes market volatility. Mutuum Finance represents a systematic way to potentially build wealth. The MUTM presale represents advancement in stage and demonstrates an attractive lending concept along with simplified purchase processes to present to buyers. The allocation to Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is running low. The sensible present moment to act would be to not miss out on a potentially profitable 400% gain and instead be a sideline observer as early birds reap rewards of this compelling investment.

Key Takeaways: Alt5 Sigma removed its CEO and COO shortly after entering a $1.5 billion deal tied to a Trump family crypto project. The WLFI token agreement gives a Trump-affiliated entity 75% of sales proceeds, potentially worth over $500 million. The shakeup comes amid legal scrutiny linked to a Rwanda money-laundering ruling involving a related subsidiary. Las Vegas-based Alt5 Sigma dismissed acting chief executive officer Jonathan Hugh and chief operating officer Ron Pitters, replacing both without providing an explanation for the changes, Bloomberg reported on Thursday , citing a legal filing. The filing reportedly said the departures were not tied to any specific misconduct. Alt5 Shakeup Follows $1.5B Crypto Deal With Trump-Linked Project The leadership shakeup comes after the firm struck a $1.5 billion agreement in August to acquire WLFI digital tokens issued by World Liberty Financial, a project co-founded by members of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s family. That transaction quickly turned Alt5 into one of several small public companies this year that shifted strategy toward accumulating crypto tokens rather than building operating businesses. Unlike many similar deals, Alt5’s arrangement carried unusually large implications for its political partners. Under the agreement, a Trump-affiliated entity is entitled to 75% of proceeds from WLFI token sales, a structure that could yield more than $500 million for the family if adoption materializes. $alts @ALT5_Sigma 53% of the float has been accumulated by institutions and insiders. Where do you think this sleeping giant is headed? $wlfi $btc #trump pic.twitter.com/H7G20COQ8m — Dirigo Dave (@DirigoDave) November 26, 2025 Alt5’s board was also reshaped when the deal was unveiled. Zachary Witkoff, a World Liberty Financial co-founder and son of US envoy Steve Witkoff, was appointed chairman. Eric Trump and World Liberty co-founder Zachary Folkman were named board observers, allowing them to attend meetings without voting authority. Eric’s brother, Donald Trump Jr., later joined executives at a Nasdaq bell-ringing ceremony to celebrate the partnership. World Liberty Financial has publicly downplayed the executive changes. “The filing speaks for itself,” said spokesperson David Wachsman, adding the group remains “excited about the future for Alt5.” World Liberty Financial Faces Legal Cloud After Rwanda Money Laundering Ruling Behind the scenes, however, World Liberty Financial has faced mounting legal headwinds. A subsidiary was ruled criminally liable for money laundering in Rwanda in May, months before the Trump-related deal was finalized, according to previous reports by The Information . The same case also found Alt5 principal Andre Beauchesne liable, with a court ordering his imprisonment. Alt5 has said both the subsidiary and Beauchesne appealed, arguing they were victims of fraud. Alt5 has claimed its board was not informed of the Rwandan case until late August. Shortly afterward, former CEO Peter Tassiopoulos was suspended in October without explanation. Alt5 President Tony Isaac has now taken over as acting CEO. His history with the firm spans multiple reinventions, from appliance recycling to opioid-response efforts, before its recent pivot into cryptocurrency. As reported, the approval rating of US President Donald Trump is now lower than it was during his first term in the Oval Office, a new YouGov poll this week shows. According to the poll published on November 25, Trump’s net approval rating stands at negative 19%.

According to the crypto project’s blog announcement, the two companies will integrate Pi into several games developed by CiDi to engage the millions in Pi’s global community of users, known as Pioneers, while supporting developers within the ecosystem. CiDi could help Pi network’s position in gaming by turning Pi into a medium for payments involving in-game purchases while scaling the blockchain’s gaming infrastructure. “Pi’s natural fit with, and ongoing development of, gaming serves as the foundation for the partnership and complements Pi’s broader, coordinated approach to ecosystem growth,” the blog read. Web3 games could add Pi coin use cases The Pi Core development team members explained that its partnership with CiDi will expand Pi token’s utility, clarify the roadmap for game creators, and encourage daily engagement from Pioneers. “Pi Network and CiDi Games is a two-way feedback loop, where developers can draw users from Pi’s large community while new gaming utilities enhance the ecosystem through innovation, content creation and user involvement,” the team said . Pi Network has spent the past several years investing in gaming-focused initiatives, including hackathons, incubation programs, pre-built integrations, and monetization services. The Pi Ad Network, a built-in advertising system, has revenue opportunities for creators, which is the foundation for token-based transactions inside games. In May, the blockchain project collaborated with Canadian studio The Article 19 Group to launch Fruity Pi, an augmented reality (AR) game where players shoot fruits with the correct answers to math questions. FruityPi has several features like Pi payments, the Pi Ad Network, and wallet-level integration, which the team mentioned is a “template” showing how sustainable and inclusive app development is inside the ecosystem. CiDi Games plans to expand on that foundation through a dedicated library of titles built specifically for the Pi ecosystem with a new H5 Game Platform, a lightweight HTML5 gaming hub that is fast, casual, and accessible. PI token builds momentum with Web3 game news and rumored update The partnership comes as Pi Network’s token posts another week of mixed market performance. The coin recorded a 2% gain over the past 24 hours, continuing its monthly upward trend by over 11% to trade at $0.25 at the time of this reporting. Pi was consolidating between $2.2 and $2.4 during Wednesday afternoon US trading sessions, before briefly closing in on $0.26 just after the CiDi Web3 gaming partnership news broke. A brief correction on Thursday morning pulled Pi’s price back and settled it slightly below that level, also flipping the weekly gains into the red zone with a 1.17% downturn. Pi’s market capitalization also went back above the $2 billion mark, overtaking meme token PEPE and Ethereum-based synthetic dollar protocol Ethena. According to market watchers, chatter on social media about an upcoming “update” to the network appears to be one of the forces behind the positive price movement. Pi community members have been discussing the rumor about the network changes for over a week now, claiming it may arrive on November 28. New multiplayer RPG launches alpha test on Epic Games store In other Web3 gaming news, transmedia sci-fi fantasy universe Cross The Ages has launched the alpha testing stage for Arise, its new multiplayer action RPG, now available on the Epic Games Store. Arise is the second title within the Cross The Ages ecosystem, which introduces real-time multiplayer action, dungeons, and player-versus-player battles. Cross The Ages partnered with Hong Kong-incorporated gaming software company Animoca Brands in 2021 to support Arise’s blockchain gaming, token design, and market ambitions. Developers said Arise is meant to build on the community created by Cross The Ages: Blast, the project’s collectible card game that has sold more than forty million digital cards. Players can add Arise to their wishlist on Steam, but the current test phase is available only through the Epic Games Store.

Crypto industry author Adam Livingston called it “incredibly bullish news” for Bitcoin, adding: “This is the transition point from ‘ETF adoption phase’ to the derivatives market phase. And Bitcoin’s price discovery always goes vertical when derivatives scale.” Options contracts allow traders to speculate on prices without holding the asset; they do not offer direct exposure to the underlying asset as a spot ETF does. Bitcoin’s Mag 7 Moment Livingstone commented that the rule filing literally says they’re doing this because IBIT has reached the same level of market cap, liquidity, and trading frequency as the biggest stocks. This is the category reserved for Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, etc, he said before adding, “That’s the club Bitcoin is now in.” “The market is formally treating Bitcoin as a top-tier global asset class with no liquidity constraints.” The change would benefit institutional traders by enabling larger hedging positions and income strategies while improving market efficiency through deeper liquidity, tighter spreads, and better price discovery. Livingston explained that banks can run structured products on Bitcoin without blowing through risk caps, “which means BTC becomes collateral for an entirely new tier of financial engineering.” “Institutional volume is finally here,” remarked ProCap BTC chief investment officer Jeff Park. At last, IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves— Nasdaq just filed to increase options limit to 1 MILLION (from 25k a year ago) Institutional vol is finally here Happy Thanksgiving https://t.co/vqH75rUTSf pic.twitter.com/MpCHxHMW8q — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) November 26, 2025 While the move would massively improve liquidity, it would also potentially increase leverage and volatility in Bitcoin markets, which could cause these wild price swings. Bitcoin ETF Outlook BlackRock’s IBIT fund saw its second consecutive day of inflows on Wednesday, with $42.8 million, as BTC started to recover. However, this follows an epic outflow streak, during which more than $2 billion left the product in just two weeks. The aggregate flow for all US spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday was $21 million as Fidelity (FBTC) saw an outflow, according to Farside Investors. In related news, JPMorgan announced an offering for institutional clients for a structured Bitcoin product using IBIT that matures in 2028.

54978588,635051,1764230406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54978588.jpeg,Crypto Asset Reporting Framework Advances: US Treasury Aims For Global Compliance By 2027,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-us-treasury/,"Clinton Donnelly, expert in crypto taxation, recently revealed on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the US Treasury Department has dispatched the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) regulations to the White House for review. CARF is part of a comprehensive international standard developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which has already garnered support from nearly 90 countries that have committed to its implementation. New Crypto Reporting Standards The essence of CARF is straightforward: it requires all participating nations to mandate that crypto exchanges and service providers—referred to as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)—collect extensive data about their users. This includes full Know Your Customer (KYC) information, due diligence data, tax residency details, and tax identification numbers. Subsequently, each exchange must report this data to the users’ home countries at the end of every year. For US taxpayers utilizing platforms like Binance , Kraken, Bybit, Bitstamp, or OKX—entities operating within the boundaries of CARF—the implications are clear: these crypto exchanges will automatically relay users’ activity to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Donnelly described CARF as the crypto equivalent of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), a regulatory framework that governs how banks share account balances globally. While the US opted out of CRS, instead creating the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), the current initiative suggests a shift toward incorporating CARF into progressive US crypto regulations. IRS To Receive Direct CARF Reports According to Donnelly’s assessment, the significance of CARF lies not just in reporting sales, but in tracking all transactions, including exchanges and transfers. Notably, CARF mandates the reporting of both sending and receiving wallet addresses for transfers. This indicates a new oversight mechanism that ensures no transaction goes unnoticed. Donnelly emphasized a key difference in reporting: while 1099-DAs from US companies are directly sent to the taxpayer, CARF reports will not be shared with individuals. Instead, these reports go directly to the IRS, which will utilize advanced data analysis tools, such as those developed by Palantir, to compare reported activity against individual taxpayer submissions . As a result, individuals who fail to accurately disclose their crypto activities may very well find themselves facing audits. Full enforcement of the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework is set to commence in 2027, a timeline that Donnelly views as imminent. However, for many, this could be seen as an invasion of crypto investors’ privacy. It remains to be seen whether the review by White House officials could pass without any requirements from industry leaders. As of this writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has recaptured the $90,000 level following last week’s crash, which saw BTC fall all the way to $80,000 for the first time since April of this year.

Reports have disclosed that the account known as “1011short” converted 10 million USDC into Hyperliquid before opening a long position with a five-fold leverage, controlling around $44.15 million in ETH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Whale Opens A Massive Ethereum Bet The trade uses 15,000 ETH at an entry price of $2,945, while current market levels sit near $2,896. That puts the position about $38,000 in the red for now. Based on reports, the liquidation point is $2,326, giving the trader a sizable margin to withstand market swings. With leverage in play, profits and losses are both magnified, making the move high-risk but potentially high-reward. Market Momentum Shows Mixed Signals Bitcoin has bounced back to $89,000, gaining 1.37% in the last 24 hours, though it still remains over 20% below last month’s highs. Some altcoins followed the trend upward. These gains helped trigger a wave of liquidations, catching many traders off guard. This #BitcoinOG(1011short) is back!

About 112,021 accounts were wiped out in total. The majority of liquidations came from short trades ($233 million), while the total for long trades was ($104 million). One of the largest orders liquidated was on Hyperliquid at $8.61 million BTC-USD. At the end of the day, Bitcoin and Ethereum made up the majority of the liquidations: about $119 million in BTC and about $73.34 million in ETH. This indicates the continued high levels of leverage employed in trades on both of the two largest digital currencies by market capitalization, despite large price fluctuations that have been observed recently. The larger the move in either direction, the more uncertain the trader will be with respect to the timing and extent of their exposure, and thus the potential for loss exists for both bears and bulls. Institutional Accumulation Continues Meanwhle, Nasdaq-listed BitMine Immersion Technologies expanded its ETH holdings last week by 69,822 coins, bringing its total to 3.63 million ETH — about 3% of circulating supply. The company also reported 192 BTC, $38 million in Worldcoin, and $800 million in cash. CryptoQuant data indicate unrealized losses of roughly $3.4 billion on its ETH treasury, reflecting market dips.

In November, a key risk gauge tied to Oracle debt hit a three-year high, and Morgan Stanley says the real damage may land in 2026 if the company fails to calm fears tied to its massive artificial intelligence spending rush. The warning is blunt. The pressure is tied to how fast the balance sheet is growing, how wide the funding gap looks, and how fast parts of the business could turn outdated. The cost to insure Oracle debt against default for the next five years climbed to 1.25 percentage point per year on Tuesday, based on ICE Data Services. That move puts the company’s five-year credit default swap near levels last seen during past stress cycles. Analysts Lindsay Tyler and David Hamburger say the stockpile of debt, paired with limited clarity on how it will all be funded, is a core threat staring at investors right now. Banks stack hedges as AI loans explode The five-year CDS on Oracle now sits uncomfortably close to the record set in 2008, when it hit 1.98 percentage points, according to ICE Data Services. The analysts say the CDS could break 1.5 percentage point soon and may push toward 2 percentage points if the company keeps tight on details about how it plans to fund its buildout into the new year. That risk line is driven by one brutal fact. Oracle is now a front-line name in the AI spending race, and the credit market treats it as a direct barometer for AI risk. In September, Oracle raised $18 billion in the US investment-grade bond market. In early November, about 20 banks lined up to arrange a separate $18 billion project finance loan for a massive data center campus in New Mexico, where Oracle will take control as the future tenant. On top of that, another $38 billion loan package is in motion to fund data center projects in Texas and Wisconsin built by Vantage Data Centers, according to Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley says the banks tied to these construction loans are a major driver behind the recent surge in trading volume on Oracle CDS, and they do not expect that activity to cool off soon. The analysts wrote, “Over the past two months, it has become more apparent that reported construction loans in the works, for sites where Oracle is the future tenant, may be an even greater driver of hedging of late and going forward.” They also flagged a risk that some bank hedges could unwind if lenders sell down pieces of these loans to outside buyers. Even if that happens, they made clear that other players could step in later and add new hedges of their own. The funding needs tied to these sites do not stop with New Mexico or the Vantage builds. More construction spending still sits ahead. Traders ditch bonds and load up on CDS Last month, the same analysts said they expect near-term credit deterioration and rising uncertainty to keep pushing bondholders, lenders, and thematic traders deeper into hedging mode. They added, “The bondholder hedging dynamic and also the thematic hedging dynamic could both grow in importance down the road.” So far, that call is playing out in the data. Oracle CDS have underperformed the broader investment-grade CDX index. At the same time, Oracle corporate bonds have also lagged the Bloomberg high-grade bond index as hedging demand rises and market mood weakens. The pressure is no longer limited to credit. Oracle stock has started to feel the weight as well. The analysts say this rising strain could push management to lay out a clearer financing plan on the next earnings call, including updates tied to Stargate , data centers, and capital spending. Until now, Morgan Stanley had pushed a basis trade, telling investors to buy Oracle bonds and buy CDS protection at the same time. The idea was to profit from derivatives widening more than cash bonds. That play is now off. The firm says the setup has changed and the cleanest move is no longer split exposure. They wrote, “Therefore, we are closing the ‘buy bond’ part of the basis trade, and keeping the ‘buy CDS protection’ leg of it.” They added, “We think a trade in CDS outright is cleaner right now and will result in a greater spread move.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|Morgan Stanley|Oracle,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-27 08:00:38

Fragmented tooling forces users to juggle separate apps for swaps, staking, tracking and presales, creating friction that slows broader Web3 adoption. Best Wallet Token backs a non-custodial, multi-chain mobile wallet that integrates tracking, swaps, staking and curated presales within a single interface. By tying fee discounts, higher staking yields and presale access to $BEST, Best Wallet Token aims to turn the wallet into a full-stack Web3 opportunity hub. Crypto wallets are no longer just key-storage tools. As more users live on-chain (trading, staking, gaming and joining presales) the wallet has quietly become Web3’s most important interface. Yet most options still force you to juggle multiple apps, sacrifice control, or tolerate clunky UX that scares off newcomers. Centralized wallets can freeze accounts or become single points of failure. On the other hand, many non-custodial wallets feel designed only for power users, with confusing signing flows, limited or no presale access, and few real perks for loyal holders. You’re either giving up sovereignty or leaving obvious value on the table. Best Wallet is positioning itself as a direct answer to that gap: a non-custodial, multi-chain Web3 wallet that bundles tracking, staking, swaps and vetted presales into one mobile-first app. The thesis is simple: if the wallet is where you live, it should also be where you earn, discover and save on fees. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale ends tomorrow, giving a final chance to buy at presale price before listings and heavier marketing kick in. With $17.65M already raised at $0.026005 per token, there’s already strong demand for a wallet that aims to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026. Learn more about what is Best Wallet Token. Best Wallet Bundles Web3 Into One Mobile-First Experience Best Wallet Token is backing a non-custodial, no-KYC wallet that aims to be the ‘home screen’ for your entire Web3 life. Instead of bouncing between a swap app, staking dashboard, portfolio tracker and presale platform, you manage everything inside a single, mobile-first interface designed for everyday users, not just DeFi natives. Under the hood, Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks MPC-CMP security, multi-wallet portfolios, and a DEX aggregator powered by Rubic that connects to 50+ chains, 200+ DEXs and 20 cross-chain bridges. For you, that translates to better pricing on swaps, broader asset coverage (60+ chains in the future), and fewer blind spots when moving capital across ecosystems. The standout feature is the Upcoming Tokens portal, which curates the best crypto presales and streamlines presale participation. Instead of chasing links and worrying about fake sites, you can discover vetted opportunities directly inside the wallet and pay with assets you already hold. $BEST Price Potential & Whale Interest Signal Explosive Future On-chain signals are already flashing interest from larger players. Smart money is moving, with one whale buying $16K yesterday and another adding in $13.8K 5 days ago . That kind of conviction ahead of listings often reflects a longer-term view on utility, not just a quick flip narrative around launch. Our $BEST price prediction also estimates large gains in the future, with a 2026 prediction at $0.05106175/token. That’s a 96% from today’s price of $0.026005. The tokenomics also lean into long-term alignment. $BEST holders unlock reduced fees across the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher APY opportunities through the staking aggregator, and priority access to future presales inside the Upcoming Tokens portal. An 8% allocation, or 800M tokens, is reserved for staking rewards, with dynamic proportional yields and immediate staking available during presale. Best Wallet Token is trying to turn the wallet from passive infrastructure into your primary yield and access layer. By combining non-custodial security, multi-chain swaps, tracking, staking and curated presales in one app, it targets both crypto natives looking to consolidate tools and newcomers who want a simpler on-ramp with tangible perks. Here’s how to buy $BEST now. With the presale closing tomorrow and a current raise of $17.65M, the timing window is narrow for those looking to enter at the current valuation. If you believe the next wave of adoption will be won at the wallet layer, $BEST is positioned as a direct bet on that thesis. Join the $BEST presale before it ends tomorrow.

Her firm continues aggressively buying crypto equities during the downturn, deploying over $93 million in a single day this week across beaten-down digital asset stocks. Wood’s prediction comes as Bitcoin trades below $88,000 after falling from its October peak of $126,000, while crypto-linked equities are facing their sharpest monthly declines since early 2024. Speaking during ARK’s November market webinar , she identified three temporary liquidity constraints she expects to ease rapidly through Federal Reserve action and reopened government spending. In this recent webinar, I discuss why the liquidity squeeze that has hit #AI and #crypto will reverse in the next few weeks, something the markets seemed to buy, and why AI is not in a bubble. The 123% increase noted below was in Palantir’s US commercial business last qtr. Watch… https://t.co/GdBZtEQcxM — Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) November 26, 2025 December Relief: Fed Policy and Inflation Data Wood expects the Federal Reserve to end quantitative tightening at its December 10 meeting, immediately easing one pressure point. The government shutdown that caused the Treasury General Account cash buildup has concluded, returning funds to circulation. “ We think that source of a liquidity squeeze is behind us, ” Wood stated during the webinar. Interest rates remain the third constraint, but Wood anticipates another December cut as economic data weakens. “ We think we will get another cut in December, and that the Fed will shift from what seems to be a hawkish tone right now back into a more dovish tone as we approach that date, ” she explained. Ten-year Treasury yield inflation expectations fell to approximately 2.5% over recent months, while Trueflation’s real-time monitoring shows similar levels. Oil prices breaking below $60 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate adds deflationary pressure. New home prices have declined for about 1 year, while existing home price inflation has dropped to 1.5%. “ We would not be surprised to see a real break in inflation once the tariffs have passed through in the next year, ” Wood predicted. Crypto Markets Lead Liquidity Downturn as ARK Buys Aggressively Crypto markets demonstrated their sensitivity to liquidity conditions throughout November, with Bitcoin plunging below $90,000 for the first time since April. The 30% drawdown from October’s $125,100 record triggered $254 million in single-day outflows from US Bitcoin funds on November 17. Average spot ETF investors are now underwater, with a flow-weighted cost basis of around $89,600. Wood emphasized crypto’s role as a liquidity barometer during the webinar. “ It is interesting watching the crypto ecosystem really be a leading indicator when liquidity is ebbing and flowing, ” she noted. ARK Invest responded by accelerating purchases across crypto-linked equities, adding $42 million in Bullish, Circle Internet Group, and BitMine Immersion Technologies on November 20 alone. The firm’s combined crypto exposure through its flagship ETFs surpassed $2.15 billion as of early November, spanning Coinbase, Robinhood, Circle, and Bullish holdings. ARK Invest crypto stocks purchases hit $42M across @circle , @Bullish , & @BitMNR —despite sharp declines. #CryptoStocks #ARKInvest #CathieWood https://t.co/HKrg6Ey5I5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 20, 2025 ARK maintains its highest crypto allocation in ARKF at 29%, followed by ARKW at 25.7% and ARKK at 17.7%. Wood’s dip-buying strategy extends her conviction that “ the restructuring of the financial ecosystem is also in the first inning. “ AI Bubble Concerns Dismissed Wood firmly rejected suggestions that artificial intelligence investments have entered bubble territory, contrasting current conditions with the tech and telecom bubble two decades ago. “ In the tech and telecom bubble, sure, you had some value investors saying this doesn’t make sense. No one was listening to them, ” she recalled. Enterprise productivity gains remain elusive despite MIT research questioning corporate returns, but Wood emphasized that transformation “ is hard work and it will take time. ” Palantir’s 123% growth in the US commercial business last quarter demonstrates a strategic imperative. “ There is a strategic imperative now, and it will take time, ” Wood stated. Brett Swift, ARK’s director of research, explained how AI exposure fits total portfolio approaches increasingly adopted by institutional allocators. “ If you don’t have a meaningful exposure there, you’re missing that idiosyncratic risk, ” Swift argued. Bitcoin Target Revised but Bull Case Remains Strong Notably, Wood recently adjusted her 2030 Bitcoin price target downward from $1.5 million to $1.2 million after reassessing stablecoin competition in emerging markets. “ Stablecoins are usurping part of the role that we thought Bitcoin would play, ” she explained on CNBC on November 6, referencing their rapid scaling to nearly $300 billion. However, Strategy founder Michael Saylor disputed Wood’s competitive framing, arguing Bitcoin functions as “digital capital” while stablecoins operate as “digital finance” serving distinct purposes. Michael Saylor defends Bitcoin's trajectory against Cathie Wood's stablecoin concerns, maintaining that the assets serve fundamentally different purposes in digital markets. #Saylor #Bitcoin https://t.co/73cr7noxAQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 22, 2025 “ No rich person wants to buy the currency instead of an equity or a real estate or a capital asset, ” Saylor countered during a November 14 CNBC appearance. ARK analyst David Bujnicki detailed the model revision, explaining that emerging-market safe-haven assumptions dropped to 20% of their original levels based on Chainalysis data. Gold’s market capitalization surged from $17 trillion to $28 trillion, offsetting the downward revision, leaving Wood’s bull case at 1,100% upside from current levels.

The alert did not list any owners or links to known platforms. Once the sender and receiver details became visible, the move took a clearer shape. Details of the Transaction Whale Alert is a whale tracker that gives quick updates on large transactions. Whale activity is common in the XRP ecosystem, but Whale Alert did not provide any other facts about the wallets. The alert shows the size and direction of the transfer. The details came from the wallet pages. The sender’s account name shows as BTC Markets (1). The account history goes back to June 14, 2017. It shows a Next sequence of 161, which means the wallet has been used many times. While the alert says the sender was unknown, the displayed label suggests that an exchange environment may control this wallet. 110,193,345 #XRP (244,826,940 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/IwbG4SzAKc — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 27, 2025 The Receiver’s Account Structure The receiving wallet has a different setup. The account came online on November 6, 2025. It was activated by BitGo Initialization Wallet (Self-custody). The Next sequence number sits at 100,032,694, which shows heavy activity. After the transfer, the wallet holds 110,193,351.599957 XRP. The account also uses multisig, keeps its master key disabled, and requires a destination tag. These settings are common in controlled systems where access and approval must remain tight. Its structure suggests that a group or institution controls it, not a casual user. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What the Profiles Suggest The information from both accounts gives context that the original alert did not show. The sender appears tied to a known exchange. The receiver shows signs of a secure, self-custody setup. ButGo’s involvement is also intriguing, as the exchange recently ran out of XRP . However, this mix points to internal movement, liquidity actions, or a shift between custody layers. There is no proof of the intent behind the transfer, but the account features reduce the list of possible reasons. Large XRP transfers happen often, but the size of this one stands out. The value at the time of the alert reached $244 million. This places it among the biggest moves of the week. However, this activity is more likely exchange-related and not part of the regular whale activity in the ecosystem.

This means that Bitcoin is certainly not out of the woods yet, and may even be about to make a lower low. Traders proceed with caution. $BTC rejection about to take place? Source: TradingView In the 4-hour time frame it can clearly be seen that the $BTC price is moving within a bear flag. After breaking out of the downtrend (faint dotted line) the price found support at the $87,000 horizontal level and travelled along it until retesting the bottom of the flag. From there it was more or less straight up to the current position, where the price has tested the top of the flag + the $91,450 resistance level. A rejection from here is likely. Given that the 4-hour, 8-hour, 12-hour time frames, and soon the daily time frame, are all overbought, it looks as though the next corrective impulse is about to begin. If this doesn’t happen, and the price does break through the horizontal resistance, the next resistance at $94,400, and the top of the flag, would probably ensure that gravity reasserts itself. $BTC comes back to confirm breakdown? Source: TradingView The daily time frame reveals that the $BTC price has also found resistance at a descending trendline that began back in July. The convergence of this trendline, horizontal resistance, and the top of the bear flag, together with topped-out short-term Stochastic RSIs, say that a reversal is about to take place. At the bottom of the chart, one positive is that the RSI indicator has broken through a downtrend. Expect the indicator line to come back to retest the breakout. Upside still the favourite outcome longer term Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that the current green candle is wedged between the major ascending trendline below, and the shorter descending trendline above. With a potential corrective wave inbound, it may mean that a further candle gets wedged into this tightening gap. This battle between the two trendlines is likely to decide whether the price explodes to the upside, or whether it plummets to the downside. If the Fed cuts rates in December, which is looking likely , and there are no black swans in the economy, the upside move is still favourite.

At the critical juncture of AI and DePIN, or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, lies a project to build a scalable framework wherein AI agents, automation toolkits, and decentralized compute power meet in one ecosystem. As the interest in AI-powered tokens grows across the sector, investors have turned toward Ozak AI's rapid progress during its presale and expanding utility, with many speculating the token could witness significant appreciation once listings begin. Phase-7 Presale Progress Shows Rapid Demand Ozak AI’s presale is now in Phase-7, priced at $0.014 per token. More than 1,006,831,376.62 $OZ have been purchased so far, bringing total funds raised to $4,495,677.20. The steady increase across phases has been a major talking point in crypto communities, particularly among early-stage buyers who view the progression as a reflection of market confidence. The project targets a future listing price of $1.00, which would place Ozak AI among the top-performing AI presales of recent years if long-term adoption continues to grow. Interest has been driven not only by the token price but also by the structural utility of the $OZ token itself. Within the ecosystem, it is intended to support governance decisions, staking rewards, predictive AI automation features, and participation across interconnected DePIN networks. The framework is designed so that as demand for the tools increases, the underlying token may gain deeper functional relevance. AI-Powered Utility and DePIN Expansion Unlike meme-based or single-use tokens, Ozak AI will be a multi-tiered architecture underpinned by predictive analytics, decentralized infrastructure, and cross-chain compatibility. Autonomous agents will enable smart data analytics to optimize transactions and interact with blockchain systems in real time. Because this is combined with a decentralized physical node layer, the system does not rely on centralized servers but instead reduces bottlenecks and provides scalability. The combination of AI-driven functionality and distributed compute power is a major reason analysts categorize Ozak AI alongside the next generation of Web3 infrastructure tokens rather than short-cycle speculative assets. Partnerships Strengthen Ecosystem Growth A series of new partnerships has added momentum to Ozak AI’s expansion. The integration with Hive Intel enables access to multi-chain on-chain data APIs, giving Ozak AI’s predictive agents wider datasets across DeFi activity, NFT behavior, wallet tracking, and token analytics. By enhancing data inputs, the system can produce faster and more precise predictions. Through its collaboration with Weblume, Ozak AI’s real-time signals are now embedded into a no-code Web3 development platform. This allows creators and startups, even those without technical backgrounds to build dashboards and decentralized applications using actionable AI analytics. The partnership with SINT introduces one-click AI upgrades, cross-chain functionality, and voice-enabled agents, broadening the range of automated execution tools connected to Ozak AI signals. In addition, Ozak AI has also partnered with Meganet , a rapidly growing decentralized bandwidth-sharing network with millions of active nodes worldwide. By combining distributed compute power with AI processing, the alliance is expected to reduce the operational cost and increase speed across the system. Security has also been formally validated. Ozak AI completed an audit with @sherlockdefi, which reported no unresolved vulnerabilities in its presale smart contracts, adding a layer of assurance for early participants. Conclusion The title of the article reflects why Ozak AI has captured attention: a fast-moving presale, expanding partnerships, and growing real-world integrations have put the project on the radar of analysts and crypto communities who are watching to see how it performs once major exchange listings begin. While no future valuation is guaranteed, the combination of AI utility and DePIN architecture places Ozak AI in a distinctive position within the 2025 Web3 landscape. For many early participants, the project represents a long-term ecosystem play, one built on infrastructure, not hype.

When the exchange suspended withdrawals, automated trading systems designed to profit from price differences across platforms stopped functioning. This created a unique situation where traditional market mechanisms temporarily disappeared. Ju Ki-young explains that these bots typically maintain price equilibrium across exchanges. However, their sudden absence has opened the door for retail traders to influence prices more directly. The result? Significant price pumping in various altcoins that would normally be kept in check by automated systems. How Are Retail Investors Capitalizing on This Situation? With the arbitrage bot halt in effect, retail investors are stepping into territory usually dominated by sophisticated algorithms. Here’s what’s happening: Retail traders are coordinating buying activities Price disparities are lasting longer than usual Traditional arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited Market volatility has increased significantly This shift represents a rare moment where individual traders can directly impact market movements. The absence of competing arbitrage bots means price differences between exchanges persist, allowing strategic traders to profit from these imbalances. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Stability? The current arbitrage bot halt situation raises important questions about market efficiency. Normally, arbitrage bots help maintain price consistency across different trading platforms. Their absence creates temporary market inefficiencies that can benefit alert traders but may concern long-term investors. Market experts are watching this development closely. The prolonged arbitrage bot halt could indicate broader issues in exchange security and market infrastructure. However, it also demonstrates how resilient cryptocurrency markets can be when facing technical challenges. Key Takeaways for Crypto Traders This unusual market condition offers both opportunities and risks. The arbitrage bot halt teaches us several valuable lessons: Market mechanisms are more fragile than they appear Retail investors can significantly influence prices under certain conditions Exchange security issues have far-reaching market consequences Being adaptable to changing market conditions is crucial The current situation highlights the importance of understanding market microstructure and being prepared for unexpected changes in trading dynamics. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Crypto Markets? As Upbit works to resolve its security issues and restore normal operations, market participants wonder when the arbitrage bot halt will end. The return of these automated systems will likely bring more stability to altcoin prices, but the recent events have shown that retail investors can play a more significant role than previously thought. This episode serves as a powerful reminder that cryptocurrency markets are still evolving. The interplay between automated systems and human traders continues to shape market outcomes in unexpected ways. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are arbitrage bots? Arbitrage bots are automated trading programs that profit from price differences of the same asset across different exchanges. They help maintain price consistency in normal market conditions. How long has the arbitrage bot halt been affecting Upbit? The halt began when Upbit suspended withdrawals following security concerns. The exact duration depends on when the exchange fully restores its normal operations. Are other exchanges experiencing similar issues? While the specific arbitrage bot halt is unique to Upbit’s situation, security incidents at major exchanges often have ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Should retail investors try to profit from this situation? While opportunities exist, traders should approach this volatile situation with caution and proper risk management strategies. When will normal arbitrage activity resume? Normal arbitrage activity will likely resume once Upbit fully restores withdrawal capabilities and confidence in the exchange’s security returns. Could this happen on other exchanges? Yes, any exchange experiencing security issues that require suspension of key functions could face similar arbitrage disruptions.

DWF Labs plans to support teams developing enhanced yield, credit, and liquidity systems as institutional demand drives DeFi into its next phase. According to DWF Labs, the $75 million fund will focus on blockchain projects that create dark pool perpetual DEXs. The fund will also concentrate on decentralized money markets, and fixed-income or yield-bearing asset products across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and Base. The firm believes that blockchain projects are poised for significant growth. DWF Labs targets builders solving core DeFi problems We are launching the $75M DWF Labs DeFi Fund, focused on perp DEXs, money markets, and yield protocols across @ethereum , @BNBCHAIN , @solana , and @base . Capital + liquidity + ecosystem support for teams ready to scale. pic.twitter.com/d6n0CWHHKA — DWF Labs (@DWFLabs) November 26, 2025 DWF Labs said that the fund will focus on teams with a working MVP, a distinct and creative value proposition, and the capacity to ship, adapt, and scale their technology to meet growing market and institutional demands. DWF Labs emphasized that it is seeking founders who can solve actual structural issues in liquidity, settlement, lending, and on-chain risk management rather than focusing on minor tweaks to current web3 protocols. According to DWF Labs, the goal is to identify high-conviction teams early on and support them in achieving technological and commercial maturity quickly. In the announcement, Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of DWF Labs , stressed the importance of developing DeFi infrastructure “with real utility” that can meet institutional demand. “DeFi is entering its institutional phase. We’re seeing real demand for infrastructure that can handle size, protect order flow, and generate sustainable yield. This fund is designed to support founders who are building the systems that will define the next decade of open financial markets.” – Andrei Grachev , Managing Partner of DWF Labs. The Web3 investment firm guarantees practical ecosystem support in addition to funding. According to DWF Labs, portfolio teams will have access to active TVL and liquidity provisioning, a useful go-to-market strategy, and execution assistance. The portfolio teams will also gain connections to market makers, infrastructure suppliers, and institutional partners. DWF Labs stated that it will utilize its global communications and marketing capabilities to help the teams increase visibility and accelerate user acquisition. Grachev explained that the deployment of global communications and marketing capabilities will give entrepreneurs “an unfair advantage in a market where distribution and liquidity matter as much as product.” Institutional momentum pushes DeFi toward mainstream adoption According to on-chain data from DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) across all DeFi protocols is currently at $121.194 billion, representing a 2.67% increase over the previous 24 hours. On-chain data reveal that stablecoins have an accumulated market capitalization of $305.356 billion, and DEXs process $10.739 billion in daily volume. On-chain perpetuals recorded $41.394 billion in 24 hours. The on-chain data indicate that the DeFi TVL reached a peak of almost $177.5 billion during the “DeFi Summer” of 2021. The DeFi TVL nearly hit that record once more last month after hovering around $165 billion before the market crisis on October 10. Despite DeFi initially being intended as a specialized field that offers a decentralized alternative to traditional banking, leaders such as Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, believe that centralized institutions will be crucial to the industry’s mainstream adoption. In an interview with Michaël van de Poppe, the founder of MN Capital, Sergey Nazarov said DeFi is already 30% of the way to becoming widely accepted. He added that DeFi may be completely embraced worldwide by 2030. According to Nazarov, DeFi will achieve 50% mass adoption once the regulatory environment becomes clear. He added that DeFi will reach 70% after the technology and infrastructure are direct and effective enough for institutions to invest their money and client funds in DeFi. On Wednesday, Cryptopolitan reported that Nazarov stated that Institutional participation in Web3 has grown, and most of the sessions at the most recent SmartCon had a clear institutional focus. He claimed that as the industry has developed, large financial institutions are increasingly utilizing blockchain technology, and adoption is accelerating. According to Nazarov, DeFi clarity will quickly extend outside of the U.S. He added that many governments adopt U.S. methods to be compatible with the U.S. financial system.

The incident, which resulted in a loss of approximately $38.5 million, involved a wide array of tokens on the Solana blockchain. Upbit Freezes Solana-Linked Withdrawals In a notice published early today, Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok, who operates Upbit, confirmed that “abnormal withdrawals” occurred around 04:42 KST on the Solana network. The outflow involved a basket of Solana ecosystem tokens, including SOL, USDC, BONK, JUP, RAY, PYTH, ORCA, and several smaller assets such as Double Zero (2Z), Access Protocol (ACS), Magic Eden (ME), and others tied to the Solana network. The event was also flagged by several blockchain security firms, including PeckShield, which, a few moments before Upbit’s detailed statement, took to X, saying that the exchange’s wallets “were compromised,” with around $36 million in Solana-based assets leaving for an unknown address. Following the incident, Upbit informed users that it had immediately suspended all deposits and withdrawals and moved remaining funds linked to the affected assets into secure cold wallets. The exchange reported that about 12 billion won worth of Solaire (LAYER) tokens have already been frozen on-chain, with efforts going on with project teams and institutions to lock down more of the stolen tokens. It stressed that customers will not bear losses from the incident, saying it had “internally identified the extent of the loss” and pledged to cover the full amount from its own holdings. The company also repeated that user balances “will not be affected.” Meanwhile, a broader security review of the firm’s deposit and withdrawal systems, beyond just the Solana network, is underway, with services to be restored gradually once checks are complete. A Persistent Industry-Wide Problem The Upbit incident has once again brought to light the persistent security challenges facing digital asset exchanges. It is a continuation of a troubling yearly pattern. According to a previous report from PeckShield, there were around 20 major exploits in September alone, with about $127 million lost. While it represented a 22% drop from the $163 million stolen in August, it was still a heavy hit for users and projects. Some of the biggest incidents included UXLINK’s $44 million exploit, where attackers manipulated a multi-signature wallet and later flooded the market with newly minted tokens, and SwissBorg’s $41.5 million loss tied to a compromised Solana staking provider. One of the more recent occurrences involved the OG DeFi platform Balancer, which, on November 3, lost more than $128 million in assorted cryptocurrencies to hackers. Those cases sit within an even wider pattern, with analysis from on-chain security provider Hacken estimating that halfway through this year, more than $3.1 billion had already been stolen, exceeding the full-year tally for 2024.

Data from CryptoQuant shows a drop from around 2.4 million BTC to 1.82 million BTC during that time. This represents a reduction of more than 580,000 units in under a week. The move is one of the largest multi-day outflows seen this year and has raised questions across the market. Bitcoin is trading near $91,700 at press time. It is up 6% in the past day but slightly down over the week. The recent recovery followed a pullback to below $81,000, but BTC still trades around 27% below its ATH of over $126,000, reached in early October. Large Wallets Withdraw as Spot Pressure Eases The fall in exchange reserves followed months of steady outflows. However, the pace of the recent move stood out. It may suggest that larger holders have taken BTC off exchanges, possibly into custody or cold storage. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, on-chain data from Santiment shows that 91 new wallets holding at least 100 BTC have been added since November 11. Smaller wallet numbers are dropping, pointing to lower participation from retail users. As reported by CryptoPotato , a key derivatives funding metric on Binance has dropped to levels not seen in nearly two years. This points to increased selling from leveraged positions during the past weeks. Derivatives Data Show Market Reset BTC’s aggregated funding rate has turned negative, now at -0.0007. This reflects lower long exposure in the futures market. It also suggests that short positions are increasing, or that longs are being closed. At the same time, the Coinbase premium is still negative at -0.0135. However, this value has improved from deeper lows earlier in the month. According to Daan Crypto Trades, “Spot selling pressure is easing significantly compared to the 2 weeks prior.” Key Price Zones in Focus Analyst Daan Crypto Trades also pointed to the $89,000 to $91,000 area as a zone to watch. It acted as both support and resistance in earlier cycles. The asset is now trading inside that range. Elsewhere, Captain Faibik noted that BTC is forming a descending broadening wedge on the 4-hour chart. The analyst said the price “ has likely bottomed out ,” but added that bulls need to reclaim the $100,000 level for stronger upside. Lennaert Snyder described $93,000 as a “ make or break ” level, saying that it could decide whether the trend flips or continues downward.

Upbit said abnormal withdrawals appeared on the Solana network early on November 27, triggering an emergency shutdown of deposits and withdrawals. The event has drawn intense attention because it comes during a critical regulatory period in South Korea and only days after officials increased scrutiny on AML and KYC procedures across major exchanges. Besides the immediate market impact, the breach again raises questions about the security of hot wallets on high-throughput chains such as Solana. Details of the Solana Hot Wallet Incident According to Upbit’s incident review , one Solana hot wallet experienced unusual activity around 4:42 a.m. KST. The transfers moved roughly 54 billion Korean won, equal to about $36.8 million, into an unknown external address. The drained assets included a wide range of Solana tokens. These included SOL, USDC, BONK, JUP, ORCA, PYTH, RAY, JTO, TRUMP, RENDER, and several smaller ecosystem tokens. Upbit responded by freezing all Solana deposits and withdrawals. Additionally, the exchange moved remaining Solana assets into cold wallets to stop further unauthorized transfers. The company has already secured around 12 billion won in frozen tokens with help from project teams and blockchain analytics firms. The remaining assets are under constant on-chain monitoring as investigators work to trace the funds. Upbit stressed that the breach affected only one Solana hot wallet. Other networks and core systems continued operating normally. However, a full security review is underway across its entire digital asset infrastructure before services resume. Broader Context and Industry Reaction The timing of the attack adds new pressure on Upbit and its parent company, Dunamu . The firm is currently preparing a major stock-swap combination with Naver Financial valued at about $10.3 billion. Hence, the breach has become a focal point for market observers tracking regulatory stability and operational risk in South Korea’s digital asset sector. This incident also mirrors a previous Upbit breach in late November 2019, when hackers stole 342,000 ETH. Consequently, analysts argue that hot wallets still pose persistent vulnerabilities despite better security standards. Solana Price Holds Steady Despite Security Shock Solana’s market performance showed surprising strength even as the hack gained attention. SOL traded near $142 , marking a slight daily gain. According to analyst Ali Martinez, Solana’s NUPL chart indicates deeper capitulation over recent weeks. Source: X He noted that SOL often forms major bottoms during extended loss phases. The asset recently moved toward the $80–$95 demand range, where past reversals occurred during strong fear cycles. Moreover, Martinez explained that previous capitulation periods often preceded recoveries toward higher resistance zones. If buyers defend lower levels, SOL could revisit the $110 and $138 regions. The hack did little to change this broader trend, although short-term caution persists.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-27 09:44:52

The two-year study compared the price of BTC with net inflows of USDT to exchanges from December 2023. Based on the survey, net outflows of USDT correlated with the price increase in BTC . According to the Glassnode report, during bull runs, USDT outflows increased across the exchanges, ranging from $100 million to $200 million per day. The report noted that the net flows in USDT were primarily due to profit-taking activities. During the October bull run when BTC hit its all-time high above $126,000, the net USDT outflow reached $220 million. Glassnode says Tether mints USDT during bull markets Glassnode’s study noted that Whale Alert’s April 2025 analysis echoed the fact that Tether mints USDT during cryptocurrency bull markets and burns tokens during market corrections. The trends underscored the role of stablecoins as liquidity tools. So far, USDT and BTC remain the top digital assets by market capitalization valued at approximately $1.8 trillion and $184 billion, respectively. Revisiting this cycle’s USDT netflow to exchanges, we find a strong negative correlation with BTC’s mid-term performance. During euphoric phases, USDT typically flows out at –$100M to –$200M/day as investors lock in profits. At the $126K peak, net outflows reached >$220M… pic.twitter.com/AOsHf8dQ2p — glassnode (@glassnode) November 26, 2025 Research from Glassnode further reinforced the trend, noting that as the Bitcoin price approaches peak points, USDT inflows to exchanges tend to decline. According to the study, the trend indicated that investors were moving stablecoins off exchanges to preserve their gains. Following the July 2025 passage of the GENIUS Act, the U.S. government established a favorable regulatory framework for stablecoins across the country. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, confirmed the launch of USAT, a GENIUS Act-compliant stablecoin designed for the U.S. market to support institutional adoption while complying with the GENIUS Act. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order in March directing the creation of a digital asset reserve. The bill sought to hold seized cryptocurrencies, but it has not yet been fully implemented. The report highlighted the net outflows in November across the spot Bitcoin ETFs, where institutional investors accounted for a significant portion of the outflows. Approximately $3.55 billion in net ETF outflows has been recorded in November so far, based on on-chain data . The institutional takeover has highlighted a shift in investment patterns from retail investors, who previously dominated the crypto market, to large institutions. According to the Glassnode report, tracking Bitcoin and USDT movements provides a key insight into the behaviors of both retail and institutional investors, revealing patterns that impact liquidity, pricing, and market volatility. BTC recovers to $90,000 levels Glassnode noted that the integration of stablecoins into institutional portfolios has a significant impact on Bitcoin price movements, with price dynamics poised to continue growing further. The uncovered correlation between BTC price movements and USDT flows revealed that when profit-taking trends are in place, coupled with institutional adoption, they influence how liquidity flows impact price movements. According to Glassnode, the identified pattern provides investors with a lens into market trends, enabling them to interpret signals from stablecoin activities as they navigate the crypto ecosystem. The study noted that monitoring trends is crucial for maintaining investor sentiment and confidence across the digital asset landscape. Bitcoin has recovered from levels below $90,000, trading at approximately $90,970 at the time of publication, representing a 3.89% increase over the past 24 hours. The Fear and Greed Index has also improved from a low of 15, currently standing at 18 points, showing renewed confidence across the crypto ecosystem. USDT stablecoin remains at the top by market capitalization followed by USDC, with a market cap of $184.4 billion and $75.4 billion, respectively, based on current on-chain data . USDT supply is concentrated mainly on the Ethereum network, with 47.6% of the supply and the Tron network, with 41% of the supply. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

By integrating Fireblocks MPC-CMP, an Upcoming Tokens portal, and fee and APY boosts for $BEST holders, Best Wallet targets mainstream Web3 adoption with tangible daily utility. The $BEST presale raised over $17.6M and is set to end in just over 27 hours. A potential price prediction for $BEST puts the token at $0.62 in 2026 for an ROI of 2,284% based on today’s presale price. Crypto is in one of its most unforgiving phases for retail users: too many chains, too many apps, and too many steps just to move value around. You hold in one wallet, stake in another, and chase presales through sketchy websites, all while worrying if your funds are actually safe. At the same time, non‑custodial security is no longer optional. Centralized failures have pushed more users toward self‑custody, but most Web3 wallets still feel like they were built for power users, not for everyday investors trying to manage portfolios on their phone. The gap between ‘safe’ and ‘simple’ is still wide. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) targets that gap directly. Instead of fragmenting your experience across multiple platforms, it aims to put holding, staking, swapping, and presale access into a single, mobile‑first interface. The presale is now in its final phase and ends tomorrow, making this the last chance to buy before listings. With the presale already raising over $17.6M at a token price of $0.026005, the market has clearly noticed the pitch. For investors tired of juggling apps and missing early allocations, Best Wallet is positioning $BEST as the key to a cleaner, more rewarding Web3 experience. Learn more about Best Wallet Token in our guide. Best Wallet Puts Holding, Staking and Presales in One App Best Wallet is building a non‑custodial Web3 wallet that combines three pain points into one interface: secure asset storage, on‑chain yield, and curated presale access. The goal is simple but ambitious – capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026 by being the easiest, safest place to manage your portfolio. Instead of forcing you to jump between CEXs, launchpads, and DeFi dashboards, Best Wallet integrates an Upcoming Tokens portal that surfaces vetted presales directly in the app, with a simplified purchase flow. For users, that means early access without hunting for links on social media or worrying about connecting to the wrong contract. Under the hood, Best Wallet plans to lean on Fireblocks MPC‑CMP to deliver institutional‑grade key management in a non‑custodial format, alongside custom multi‑wallet portfolios and a Rubic‑powered DEX aggregator spanning across 330 DEXs, and 30 bridges. With the presale already at $17.6M, momentum suggests the pitch is resonating with users hunting for a ‘one‑stop’ wallet. You can buy your $BEST on the official presale page today. $BEST Price Outlook and Post-Launch Predictions Given the project’s utility and investor hype, our price prediction for $BEST considers a potential price point of $0.62 by the end of 2026. Following successful implementation, the ecosystem could push the token to $0.82 or higher by 2030. In terms of raw ROI, we’re talking about numbers like 2,284% for 2026 and 3,035% for a 5-year investment. Theoretically, of course. The presale is now at over $17.6M and will likely put more meat on the bone by tomorrow, when it finally ends. With a product narrative built around consolidating wallet, DeFi, and presale access into one interface, plus staking rewards and fee perks for holders, the project is clearly designed to reward long‑term participation over short‑term speculation. If you believe the next wave of adoption will be driven by secure, mobile‑first wallets that feel more like consumer apps than developer tools, then $BEST offers a direct bet on that thesis at presale valuation. Read our guide on how to buy $BEST now to secure your spot at the best table. Buy $BEST before the presale ends; ETA 27 hours. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR before investing.

Bitcoin Could Bottom Around True Mean Price Instead This Time In a new post on X, Checkonchain co-founder Alec Dejanovic has talked about a couple of pricing models related to Bitcoin. The first of these is the “Realized Price,” keeping track of the cost basis of the average investor on the BTC network. Related Reading: XRP Rebounds From Channel Bottom, Analyst Says $2.60 Could Be Next When the BTC spot price is trading above this level, it means that the network as a whole is in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, the asset being under the metric suggests that the average token is being held at some loss. This indicator has displayed an interesting relationship with the cryptocurrency in the past. “Historical Bitcoin bears usually bottom around the Realised Price level,” explained Dejanovic. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this effect in action. As is visible in the graph, the 2015, 2018, and 2022 bear markets all found their bottoms when the Bitcoin spot price plunged under the Realized Price. Even the COVID crash in 2020 bottomed out below the indicator. The explanation behind this pattern could lie in the fact that below this line, the majority of the network can be considered underwater, so there wouldn’t be many profit-takers left. In these conditions, resolute entities take coins off investors capitulating at a loss and selling pressure slowly reaches exhaustion, allowing BTC to regain its footing. Today, the Realized Price is situated at $56,000. Considering the past pattern, perhaps this cycle’s bear market would also bottom out around or below this level. Dejanovic thinks things can go differently this time, however, saying, “with ETF flows remaining resilient and no FTX-style fraud in sight, that target feels excessive.” If not Realized Price, then where else could Bitcoin find its bottom? The answer may be the second price model listed in the chart: the True Mean Price. This metric functions similarly to the Realized Price, except for the fact that it represents the cost basis of just the active market participants, not the entire network. A chunk of the Bitcoin supply has become lost due to associated wallets no longer being accessible. As BTC is growing older, this supply is only increasing in size, making the Realized Price a somewhat inaccurate representation of the real network situation. Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why By focusing on only the active part of the supply, the True Mean Price sidesteps this issue. Its value is currently $82,000, which is around where BTC found its recent low. “This could be the new line in the sand we are hammering out,” noted the analyst. BTC Price Bitcoin has shown a sharp jump during the past day that has taken its price back above $90,000.

The king digital currency had fallen nearly 30% in the past month, dropping below $82,000 and causing “max pain” to maxis who have been blasting US President Donald Trump’s influence on the broader crypto market. The cryptocurrency’s recovery comes on the heels of a price downturn that began in “Uptober,” when Bitcoin last traded above $126,000. According to Cryptopolitan’s coverage, a mass liquidation event on October 10 wiped over $20 billion from the leverage market after Trump threatened China with a 100% tariff rate. Bitcoin ended October in woes, investors hope for end-November upside Per CoinGecko’s latest updates, Bitcoin rose 4.5% in the past 24 hours, climbing to $91,755 before correcting downwards to $91,225. Other top-10 ranked cryptos also recorded gains, with Ethereum up 2.8%, alongside BNB and Solana’s 3.2% and 2.9% upward price movements, respectively. Bitcoin has fared better than smaller cryptocurrencies in recent weeks but is still down roughly 20% since late October. Social media chatter tracked by analytics firm Santiment shows Bitcoin is the second most trendy coin, with most debates focused on technical analysis, institutional investments like ETFs, and the zero BTC purchase from Michael Saylor-led treasury firm Strategy this week. 🗣️🦃 As many areas of the world begin to celebrate Thanksgiving, the rest are celebrating Bitcoin's return to a high of $91.8K. These are the top trending coins in crypto, and their reasons why: 🪙 Tether $USDT : Trending due to extensive discussions about the Tether stablecoin… pic.twitter.com/TFPjBlefgE — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 27, 2025 CryptoQuant’s on-chain and futures charts show the market is stabilizing after the previous week’s leveraged market losses. The retail futures activity indicator has turned green, meaning the number of retail holders who had been selling the dip is dwindling enough to create a healthier market structure. Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio, the measure of market value relative to realized value, has compressed to 1.54. CryptoQuant author XWIN Research Japan surmised that this level historically signals a “value zone” where price rebounds and positive market corrections begin. The Trump factor: Is he to blame for Bitcoin’s price fall Last year in November, when President Trump clinched his ticket back into the Oval Office for the second time, Bitcoin’s price surged to an all-time high of $90,000. The largest coin by market cap finally breached the $100,000 border just a month later, in part due to policies and initiatives associated with Trump’s administration. According to several market watchers, the cryptocurrency treads on “Trump trade,” which means it is influenced by pro-crypto executive orders, regulatory decisions, and administration policies. Trump has so far signed measures allowing ordinary Americans to invest 401(k) funds in crypto assets and the creation of a National Strategic Reserve. Just before he was inaugurated, the POTUS launched his memecoin Official Trump, setting the tone for how friendly his administration has become for the digital currency market. The administration also undertook efforts to weaken regulatory bodies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and attempted to reduce bank oversight. Crypto exchange executives like Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, previously found guilty of violating US money-laundering laws, received a pardon from Trump against the wishes of liberal politicians like Senator Elizabeth Warren. However, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman believes there is a negative causality to a Trump-fueled crypto market. In a Substack post titled “The Trump Trade is Unravelling,” Krugman said President Trump’s political influence directly caused the cryptocurrency’s top and decline. “Trump is as determined as ever to reward the industry that made his family rich, and those around him are as determined as ever to make America safe for predators of all kinds,” Krugman wrote. Cryptopolitan had reported that Trump ally Brandon Gill, a US representative for Texas’s 26th congressional district, disclosed purchases of $300,000 in Bitcoin and shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). According to disclosure reports, he initially acquired between $100,000 and $250,000 in Bitcoin on October 20 and added $15,001 to $50,000 in IBIT nine days later. Much like Gill has seen the opportunity to buy the news, Krugman says many members of Trump’s camp will continue to take advantage of the market sway caused by his decisions and his falling poll numbers.

Therefore, this approval designates RLUSD as an Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token, enabling its use within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), one of the region’s most prestigious financial hubs. ”FSRA approval now allows RLUSD to be used by authorized persons conducting regulated activities, provided they meet all compliance obligations for Fiat-Referenced Tokens. Its inclusion under this rigorous framework underscores Ripple’s commitment to transparency, security, and regulatory compliance in the evolving digital asset ecosystem. Renowned for its forward-thinking yet robust regulatory framework, ADGM has become a strategic hub for fintech innovation in the UAE and beyond. With its clear digital asset guidelines and commitment to market integrity, the FSRA’s recognition of Ripple’s RLUSD marks a significant milestone, positioning it as a trusted, enterprise-grade settlement asset for institutions across the Middle East. Reece Merrick, Managing Director, Middle East and Africa at Ripple welcomed this move and said : “The UAE continues to set a global benchmark for digital asset regulation and innovation. ADGM is recognized globally for its robust and forward-thinking regulatory leadership, so this approval reinforces RLUSD as a compliant stablecoin that meets the highest standards of trust, transparency, and utility.” Therefore, Ripple’s expansion in the Middle East and Africa underscores its focus on markets with clear regulations and innovation-driven policies. FSRA recognition of RLUSD in Abu Dhabi positions Ripple to partner with banks, payment providers, and enterprises in ADGM, enabling seamless cross-border payments and enhanced liquidity solutions. As demand for stable and transparent digital currencies grows, RLUSD’s recognition in Abu Dhabi, a leading global financial hub, cements Ripple’s role as a catalyst for next-generation digital finance. With regulatory clarity secured, Ripple is set to accelerate RLUSD adoption and expand its footprint across the MEA region.

This eye-opening forecast comes at a crucial time when cryptocurrency markets are showing renewed strength. But what exactly drives such an optimistic Bitcoin price prediction, and should investors take notice? Why Cathie Wood’s Bitcoin Price Prediction Matters Cathie Wood isn’t just any investor making random guesses. As the founder and CEO of Ark Invest, she has built a reputation for spotting technological trends early. Her latest Bitcoin price prediction stems from careful analysis of macroeconomic factors that could propel BTC to unprecedented heights. Wood points to two primary drivers behind her bullish outlook: Global liquidity recovery accelerating capital flow Growing expectations for interest rate cuts These factors combined create a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s potential growth. The current market conditions suggest we might be witnessing the early stages of this remarkable transformation. How Global Economics Support This Bitcoin Price Prediction Understanding Wood’s Bitcoin price prediction requires looking at the bigger economic picture. When central banks increase liquidity and potentially cut interest rates, several things happen that benefit Bitcoin. First, more money enters the financial system. Second, investors seek alternative assets that can outperform traditional investments during such periods. Bitcoin naturally becomes an attractive option in this scenario. Wood emphasizes that the probability of rebounding from bear market conditions has significantly increased. This shift in market sentiment could be the catalyst that validates her ambitious Bitcoin price prediction. What About Competition From Stablecoins and Gold? Some critics question whether stablecoins and gold might limit Bitcoin’s growth potential. However, Wood addresses these concerns directly in her analysis. While stablecoins are indeed replacing some of Bitcoin’s utility functions, and gold prices are rising, she sees these as complementary rather than competitive forces. The digital asset ecosystem has room for multiple players to succeed simultaneously. Key balancing factors include: Stablecoins expanding overall crypto adoption Gold providing traditional safe-haven appeal Bitcoin offering unique digital scarcity What This Bitcoin Price Prediction Means for Investors For everyday investors, Wood’s Bitcoin price prediction offers both opportunity and caution. While the potential upside is enormous, understanding the timeline and risks remains crucial. Successful cryptocurrency investing requires: Long-term perspective beyond short-term volatility Proper portfolio diversification Continuous market education Risk management strategies Remember that even the most accurate Bitcoin price prediction doesn’t guarantee immediate results. Market movements take time to unfold. Frequently Asked Questions What is Cathie Wood’s exact Bitcoin price prediction? Cathie Wood maintains a bull case price target of $1.5 million for Bitcoin, based on macroeconomic analysis and adoption trends. How realistic is this Bitcoin price prediction? While ambitious, Wood’s prediction considers multiple factors including institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and Bitcoin’s fixed supply mechanics. What timeframe does this prediction cover? Though not specified in recent comments, Wood typically looks at multi-year horizons for such significant price movements. How does global liquidity affect Bitcoin’s price? Increased global liquidity typically leads to more capital seeking higher returns, which often flows into alternative assets like Bitcoin. Should I invest based on this prediction alone? No single prediction should dictate investment decisions. Always conduct personal research and consider your risk tolerance. What are the main risks to this prediction? Potential risks include regulatory changes, technological challenges, and unexpected macroeconomic shifts that could affect adoption rates.

Full Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/strategy-mstr-the-best-bitcoin-btc-play-right-now-full-analysis,"While Bitcoin has been beaten down, Michael Saylor’s Strategy has literally plunged. To top it all, a potential MSCI exclusion, and rumours that JP Morgan is executing a ‘hit job’ against Strategy, make this an extremely unloved and unwanted equity. Is this the time to buy? While Strategy defends itself from all the bearish news and the oft-announced possibility on social media that a $BTC price fall to below $25,000 would result in margin calls for Strategy, the MSTR price is actually at a very buyable level. MSTR at a bottom? Source: TradingView The weekly chart for MSTR shows that the price has arguably reached a bottom. Looking left, it can be seen that the horizontal support is sitting on top of previous price structure. This is likely to be a very strong level. Given that the price has already fallen through the last Fibonacci level of 0.786, MSTR is now very beaten down. That said, the Stochastic RSI for the weekly time frame has its indicators just in the process of crossing up. If one also takes into account that the 2-week, and even the monthly Stochastic RSI indicators are at the bottom, a bounce from hereabouts looks increasingly likely, and as can be seen in the chart, has probably just begun. For future targets, $200 will need to be reclaimed first. After this, the ascending trendline at $260 and above is the key to a complete recovery or a revisit of the lows. MSTR against the SMH Source: TradingView The SMH ticker on TradingView is an ETF of all the major chip manufacturers, and as such it is another way to judge the strength of the economy, given that some of the biggest companies in the world comprise it (Nvidia (NVDA), TSM, Broadcom (AVGO), AMD etc.) Contrasting the MSTR price with SMH gives the chart above. This 2-week chart is showing that the MSTR/SMH ratio has arguably reached a bottom. That said, it would be good to see the first signs of a MSTR recovery, given that an entry would be like trying to catch a falling knife. However, all the Stochastic RSI indicators are at the bottom, so a turn back in favour of MSTR will perhaps happen soon. MSTR soon to outperform BTC? Source: TradingView The first thing that the MSTR bulls must do is turn the ratio around against $BTC (MSTR/BTCUSD). Since November 2024, MSTR is 66% down against $BTC. This is normally the case. When $BTC goes up, MSTR goes up faster, and when $BTC goes down, MSTR goes down faster. Therefore, MSTR is like a leverage play on $BTC. The above weekly chart illustrates that the ratio has arrived at a strong support level. If this doesn’t hold, there is another below, and this lines up with the 0.786 Fibonacci. MSTR could be about to start on its next leg of outperforming $BTC . If it does so, it is likely to outperform the S&P 500 and the vast majority, if not all, of the companies in it.

Ora che BTC viene scambiato nuovamente a “cinque cifre”, le speranze di rivedere presto i 100.000$ rimangono alte. Ma c’è chi va oltre: un noto analista crypto prevede che l’asset digitale leader per capitalizzazione di mercato potrebbe essere in rotta per toccare addirittura i 300.000$ . Bitcoin ha ancora spazio per correre (Non è la fine del ciclo) L’analista Coinskid ha condiviso un grafico su X (ex Twitter) che suggerisce una tesi audace: molti esperti si starebbero sbagliando su dove ci troviamo esattamente nel ciclo di mercato di Bitcoin. Invece di essere alla fine della Bull Run, l’analista crede che la corsa sia ancora nelle sue fasi iniziali. Questa prospettiva si basa sull’ Analisi delle Onde (Wave Analysis). Secondo Coinskid, il trend attuale rappresenta solo l’ Onda 2 . Se fossimo davvero alla fine del ciclo, il prezzo di Bitcoin avrebbe già dovuto completare l’Onda 5. Tuttavia, l’analista contesta questa visione, sottolineando che il trend delle onde non è nemmeno a metà strada. La spiegazione tecnica è intrigante: l’asset digitale si trova in una “correzione di Onda 2” da oltre un anno. Ciò significherebbe che l’attuale fase correttiva sarà probabilmente di breve durata, pronta a lasciare spazio ai “tori” per riprendere il controllo e spingere il prezzo verso nuovi massimi. Il Pattern “Cup and Handle” più grande della storia A supporto della tesi rialzista, Coinskid ha evidenziato che Bitcoin sta formando uno dei pattern Cup and Handle (Tazza con Manico) più grandi della storia. Con il prezzo che sta tenendo più o meno la “neckline” (linea del collo), i compratori potrebbero riprendere rapidamente il controllo della criptovaluta. In questo scenario, Bitcoin sarebbe destinato a riconquistare i 100.000$ con l’arrivo del nuovo anno. Mentre l’onda correttiva ABC si esaurisce, il grafico dell’analista mostra che il rimbalzo dalla fine dell’Onda C porterebbe a un breakout del 250% , proiettando il prezzo fino a quota 300.000$ . Attenzione agli Orsi: Il livello da non perdere Sebbene la maggior parte dell’analisi punti al rialzo, Coinskid avverte che tutto dipende da un supporto cruciale: Bitcoin deve tenere il minimo registrato ad Aprile 2025 , ovvero i 74.000$ . Se il prezzo dovesse scendere sotto questo livello, l’intera struttura rialzista verrebbe invalidata. Non mancano visioni più pessimiste: alcuni analisti prevedono che Bitcoin possa scendere fino a 50.000$, con alcuni che si aspettano addirittura un movimento verso l’area dei 40.000$ prima di un vero rimbalzo. Tuttavia, il consenso generale rimane che Bitcoin, nel lungo termine, sia ancora in un trend positivo.",Uncategorized|bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-27 11:26:24

XRP displays a technical buy signal, typically known to be accompanied by strong rallies in prices, whereas Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out amidst upcoming completion of its presales. The combination of a strong core asset and a rapidly changing new asset represents a strategic combination for portfolios to be expanded. In particular, for interested buyers trying to identify the best crypto to invest in presently, this combination represents a strategic blend of XRP for its prospective short-term relief and MUTM for its organized purchase and promising returns post-listing. XRP Technical Analysis Hints At Potential Recovery XRP is currently consolidating around $1.93 and represents a great trading opportunity. The TD Sequential indicator recently showed a buy signal in its daily graphing pattern. Historically speaking, such signals have been followed by relief rallies of 14% to 18% for this asset. All these indicators imply that the current trend for this asset may be ending and may be met by resistance in $2.10-$2.20 soon. Despite market weakness hindering major gains, XRP is maintaining the critical $1.90 level, which has always been a strong accumulation level. The target value estimated by models involving AI research stands at $2.02 as of Dec 1st, but technically, it looks like it may be poised for something greater. At present, for traders wishing to execute a swing trade, XRP makes for a great trade due to market risks associated with Bitcoin. MUTM Presale Phase 6 Nearing Conclusion In addition to the strategic opportunistic play in XRP, there exists a fundamental investment play via Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which sports an accelerating presale. The initiative has already raked in $19 million from its community of holders numbering 18,230 strong. The presale stage stands at Phase 6, and it has distributed over 95% of tokens to date for $0.035. Phase 7 will provide close to a 20% hike to $0.040, generating immediate market demand and making MUTM very desirable for investor purchase to accumulate major market returns from pre-market launch. At a market launch of $0.06 pricing, purchasing tokens currently may generate returns of as much as 400%, encouraging great market entry prior to Phase 6’s complete sell-out as the best crypto to buy vanishes. Stablecoin Foundation for the Ecosystem In addition to the presales momentum, Mutuum Finance is creating long-term value by issuing their very own native and fully decentralized stable coin. The value of this coin will be pegged to the value of 1 U.S. dollar and will have reserves that come from the lending pools in their lending market. Stablecoin Further, Mutuum Finance’s lending framework features its own stablecoin component. The inclusion of this element improves capital efficiency and overall security within their DeFi ecosystem. Being very particular about such basic DeFi functionality makes Mutuum Finance appear to be one of the best cryptos with serious intentions. Act Before the Opportunity Expires The coming together of a technically positioned XRP and an MUTM presale about to close creates a critical juncture for crypto investors. XRP represents a tempered gamble regarding a short-term rebound, while Mutuum Finance represents access to the ground floor of a DeFi project that holds great promise. The last tokens of Phase 6 will be acquired soon; it’s expected to have a price hike. You wouldn’t want to miss this chance to be part of possibly the biggest crypto deal of the year.

The event recognized five projects with a combined prize pool of USD 140,000 following a global competition that brought together 90 teams across six innovation tracks. Hosted at S/O Uptown Dubai, the hackathon gathered international developers, founders and investors under the theme “Shaping the next wave of Web3: driving the future of decentralisation.” This year’s edition expanded its scope with two new categories, DeFAI and DeSci, introduced alongside existing tracks in DeFi, Web3 Gaming, SocialFi, Infrastructure and Tokenisation. The broader structure reflected the increasing diversity and technical maturity of solutions emerging across the decentralised technology landscape. Ten finalist teams presented their concepts to a panel of industry specialists and venture leaders. Five teams were selected for top recognition based on innovation, technical execution and potential impact. The winners were: Yumi Finance Glint Analytics Sorachain AI Aurayale Spout Finance Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of DMCC, said: “The continued success of Web3 Unleashed reflects how Dubai has evolved into a truly global hub for next-generation technologies. In just three years, this platform has grown from a regional initiative into an international benchmark for Web3 innovation – drawing participants, investors and partners from every corner of the world. Each edition builds on the last, and the introduction of DeFAI and DeSci this year demonstrates our commitment to staying ahead of technological change. Through initiatives like this, DMCC is helping define what the future of decentralised innovation looks like, ensuring that Dubai remains at the forefront of the digital economy and continues to empower those shaping it.” “Our collaboration with DMCC continues to demonstrate how rapidly the Web3 ecosystem in the UAE is advancing. Each year, we see a notable rise in the technical depth and global calibre of the teams joining Web3 Unleashed,” said Helen Liu, Co-CEO of Bybit. “Bitcoin’s pullback from its historical high serves as an important reminder that this industry is built for the long term. Real progress in blockchain requires patience from founders and builders, especially during moments when the market tests conviction. Bybit remains committed to supporting innovators who focus on real utility and sustainable impact, and we are proud to help cultivate an environment where world-class talent can continue to grow in Dubai.” The hackathon was supported by partners including DWF Labs, TOP Ventures, CROSS, Verse8, The Open Platform, CV Labs, Hacken, Cointelegraph, Blockchain for Good Alliance (BGA) and Blockchain Gaming Alliance.

The company’s ETH concentration is rising faster than its share dilution, lifting ETH per share. Management accesses enhanced multi-year staking yields unavailable to retail or ETFs. SharpLink can issue shares above NAV and repurchase below NAV, supporting long-term NAV growth. ETH volatility, dilution, and reliance on capital markets remain the primary risks. Investment Thesis I assign SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) a buy rating because the stock trades at a discount relative to the value of its Ethereum treasury, with a potential 24.5% upside to its fair value estimate of $12.55 per share. The company has expanded its ETH concentration, management can secure yield opportunities from its ETH staking that are unavailable to retail or ETFs, and the company is positioning itself as a direct beneficiary of Ethereum's accelerating institutional adoption. Management's ability to issue shares above NAV, repurchase shares below NAV, and its access to multi-year staking initiatives also give the company a versatility to grow its ETH per share over time using multiple levers. Dilution and ETH volatility are, of course, ongoing risks, but these risks have been factored into its valuation given below, and, at today's price, the company offers investors an undervalued proxy for ETH that is also displaying improving fundamentals. Background My last article was on Ethereum , and one of my recent followers asked me what my take was on SharpLink Gaming. I wasn't quite sure what my take was at the time, so I didn't want to give a rushed answer and replied that I would do a piece on the company shortly. Hence, this article serves as my reply to his comment. Reader Question and My Reply (Seeking Alpha) Business Overview According to the company's latest investor presentation and the company's latest 10-Q , SharpLink Gaming is a two-segment company whose primary line of operation revolves around an Ethereum-based treasury management strategy. As of June 2025, the company adopted ETH as its primary treasury asset, and the company, in essence, raises cash by selling new shares through PIPE placements, public offerings, and ATM shares, and uses that cash to buy and expand their ETH holdings. And this treasury strategy is now their predominant line of business that has established the company as the second largest corporate ETH treasury available to trade on the public market. SharpLink’s ETH Treasury Platform (SharpLink Gaming's Latest Investor Presentation) The company's ETH Treasury Management segment generates revenue by putting its ETH to work using two methods: first, using native staking, where the company stakes its ETH directly on the Ethereum network and, therefore, helps to secure the blockchain and earns protocol rewards in return, and, second, using liquid staking, where the company deposits its ETH with a staking provider in exchange for a token—LsETH—that continues to earn rewards but still remains usable in other digital asset markets. What both of these approaches allow the company to do is to allow them to earn continuous ETH-denominated income and restake these earned rewards to compound their growth over time. The company's second segment, affiliate marketing, provides both customer-acquisition and performance-marketing services to both sportsbook and online casino operators but is a much smaller revenue segment than their ETH treasury and does not drive overall company performance. Latest Quarterly Results and Critical Financials Per the latest 10-Q released two weeks ago, the company had 580,841 ETH, split between their crypto assets at fair value totaling $2.41 billion and their crypto assets at cost totaling $623 million—the difference being that their ETH held directly is marked to market each quarter under GAAP while their ETH staked through a liquid-staking protocol is recorded as LsETH at cost and, therefore, cannot be written up even if the market value rises; this is now the core economic engine of the business. Meanwhile, the company's cash and USDC, together, total roughly $37.8 million that provide both near-term liquidity for operations and a continued deployment of ETH. Q3 Balance Sheet (SharpLink Gaming 10-Q) Meanwhile, the company's liabilities remain modest at a rounded $4.6 million, which looks great on paper but is almost entirely the result of the company's continuous issuance of equity, as seen in the YCharts below, as opposed to cash generation. This massive issuance of new shares is reflected in their additional paid-in capital [APIC] that rose from $79.9 million to a whopping $3.18 billion in nine months—money that the company used to accumulate ETH—and common shares outstanding rose from 407,295 to its current 196,693,191. However, I do want to make a brief note that, back in August , the company did announce a $1.5 billion share buyback program and has begun to utilize it ; they've repurchased 939,000 shares at an average price of $15.98, and it signals management's willingness to support the stock when it trades below NAV. Data by YCharts As for income, the company generated approximately $10.3 million in staking revenue and $2 million from affiliate marketing, bringing their total revenues and gains from operations to $12.28 million. But the real driver of their revenue is to be found under their 'other operating income' category, where the company had $104.9 million of unrealized gains on ETH, along with $11.7 million in realized gains that, together, produced $116.6 million of total operating income. All this revenue together offset the company's operating expenses of $128.3 million, bringing the company's operating income to approximately $615,000 for the quarter. Q3 Income Statement (SharpLink Gaming) Meanwhile, the company's financing activities generated $2.92 billion from the above-mentioned PIPE placements, public offerings, and ATM shares, of which they spent a rounded $2.54 billion purchasing crypto assets. As for the company's cash flow, the net cash used in the company's operations totaled $8.4 million. Overall, the company's economics, as illustrated from this quarterly report, tell us investors that this is a company tied to its ETH-appreciation and ETH yield supported by continual access to equity capital and whose holdings have grown to a value that is far larger than the equity used to buy them, thereby amplifying the company's gains and losses without needing to take out debt. Growth Drivers & Catalysts There are three categories that serve as catalysts for SharpLink going forward: macro-Ethereum tailwinds, strategic deployment of its ETH treasury, and levers from capital markets that directly increase the company's ETH per share. Ethereum Macro Tailwinds The company, by default, is tied to the same structural forces that drive Ethereum's growth. Some of these structural forces were mentioned in SharpLink's latest earnings call , and I'll go ahead and mention what I think are the most important for the company going forward: Institutional adoption of Ethereum is now accelerating thanks to regulatory clarity brought on by the SEC's "" Project Crypto ,"" which has the underlying plan to make the United States the ""crypto capital of the world"" and is designed to attract crypto business and to accelerate developments in Ethereum. There are also the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts that have legitimized institutional staking and that have unlocked $43.7 billion in on-chain capital; major financial institutions onboarding Ethereum, such as JPMorgan's announcement that they will allow institutional clients to use their Ether holdings as collateral for loans; and SWIFT, the current backbone for global payments, is building its ledger using Linea—Consensys' Layer 2 Ethereum technology. Major Ethereum Adoption Catalysts (SharpLink Gaming's Latest Investor Presentation) And we can't forget the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, which I wrote about in detail in my previous Ethereum article , that will increase throughput and reduce rollup settlement costs by around 15% to 40%. All of these dynamics combined increase staking demand, ETH burn, and settlement volume, thereby strengthening ETH's monetary profile and, thereby, lifting the value of the company's treasury. Treasury Development and Yield Generation Company management has staked nearly 100% of its ETH and, due to the large amount of ETH the company is holding, can access special yield deals that normal ETH investors or even ETFs cannot get; the $200 million deployment to Linea is the best example of this: it's a multi-year commitment that, in essence, pays higher rewards than standard ETH staking while safely keeping the assets at Anchorage Digital Bank. In the latest earnings call , management stated that they are looking for more opportunities to boost their rewards from staking. In the words of Co-Chief Executive Officer Joseph Chalom: When we approach the ecosystem and are willing to provide multiyear commitments, we are seeing that they [ecosystem protocols and platforms such as Linea] are very eager to provide enhanced incentives for that locked TVL or total value locked. So we're still surveying. You will see, I believe, additional announcements later this quarter and in quarter 2. But we're viewing it essentially as a portfolio of staking. And as an institutional investor and steward, we are looking at the efficient frontier of opportunities. And, since June, management also noted in their latest earnings call that its internal ""ETH concentration"" has risen from two to four, which basically means that the company is adding ETH to its treasury faster than it is issuing new shares based on a calculation using the company's own proprietary metric . All that to say, the company is growing faster than its dilution, which, in turn, supports the value of each share even as the company continues to raise capital. SharpLink Yield Advantage (SharpLink Gaming's Latest Investor Presentation) Capital Markets Catalysts SharpLink is currently managing its stock price relative to the value of its ETH holdings. For example, when shares trade above the value of the ETH that backs each share, the company issues stock and uses the proceeds to buy more ETH that, thereby, increases the amount of ETH behind each share. And when shares trade below that value, SharpLink can buy back its stock, borrow against their ETH, or even use structured financing to benefit from ETH's volatility. But all three approaches have one thing in common: they are designed to keep raising ETH per share over time. And, once again, per the company's latest earnings call, SharpLink is planning to tokenize its equity on Ethereum, thereby making the stock easier to trade and to integrate into on-chain finance. As Joseph Chalom put it in the call: In September, we announced a partnership with Superstate, a digital transfer agency to become the first public company to natively issue its stock on Ethereum. The intent of this innovative partnership is to increase both accessibility and on-chain utility of our public equity for the new digitally native investor base. All together, these tools give management multiple ways to keep expanding the company's ETH per share over the long-term. Valuation To value SharpLink, we must calculate how much ETH the company owns, divide it by a realistic share count, and make a small adjustment based off management's current execution strategy: Based off the latest 10-Q, the company holds 861,251 ETH. Using ETH's rounded price of $3,000, we find that the total value of the company's treasury is approximately $2.58 billion. The company also has 196.7 million shares outstanding, but we cannot ignore the warrants, stock options, and other instruments that could potentially convert. Thus, a more reasonable diluted estimate is 226.2 million shares. Dividing the company's ETH value by this diluted shares estimate gives us a NAV per share of $11.41. Data by YCharts The next step is to figure out whether the company deserves a premium or a discount, and I believe they deserve a modest premium for three reasons—all of which have already been mentioned above: The company's ETH concentration has doubled since June. The company can access multi-year staking deals unavailable to retail or ETFs. Management can raise capital at a premium and repurchase stock when it trades below NAV. I think these three make for good advantages, but justify only a limited markup, and, hence, I will assign a premium of 10%. Thus: Fair Value = $11.41 x 1.10 = $12.55 per share Since SharpLink currently trades at $10.08, this implies an upside of 24.5% to its fair value and, thus, makes the company an undervalued ETH proxy with growing value from its staking deals and capital strategy. Thesis Risks There are quite a number of risks for the company, and I'll briefly mention five. The first risk that is the most obvious, at least to me, is ETH price volatility. Since virtually all of the company's economic value comes from its Ethereum holdings, a continuous decline in ETH (keep in mind that Ethereum is down 12% YTD) reduces the company's NAV per share and could overwhelm any gains that are made from its staking or its treasury management. The second risk, and another obvious one, is ongoing dilution. SharpLink's business model relies on issuing new shares to fund ETH purchases, and, while management has shown, per the latest earnings call, an ability to grow ETH per share, this is not guaranteed. For example, if future capital raises occur at lower prices, or suppose warrant exercises accelerate, shareholders could face future decline in ETH per share. A third risk is the company's inherent dependence on capital markets; what I mean by this is that SharpLink's strategy works best when the company is trading above NAV because it allows them to issue new shares at a higher price than what the value of each share is actually worth, thus enabling the new capital to lift ETH per share instead of diluting it (i.e., accretive issuance). But this leaves the company open to the market going risk-off, and if market sentiment toward crypto weakens, then this means that the company could lose access to attractive financing and limit its ability to expand its treasury or even to secure new staking deals. A fourth risk is SharpLink's reliance on outside custodians and staking partners to generate its higher ETH yields. This, in essence, introduces outside risks such as, for example, Anchorage or a staking provider facing operational problems, or a hack, or something of the sort that is outside of SharpLink's control. The company also makes multi-year commitments, which essentially means that the company cannot move ETH quickly should there be market stress. And, last, there is always the possibility of regulatory risk. Any changes to staking rules or digital asset classification could always disrupt the company's business model. Conclusion & Investor Takeaway The company has a simple business model: convert its capital into ETH, compound that capital through staking, and raise its ETH per share over time. And, at the end of the day, I think a case for an investment in SharpLink comes down to one simple question: How much are investors paying for each dollar of ETH exposure the company controls? The market is currently valuing the company at a discount relative to its NAV per share of $11.41 and a further discount to its fair value of $12.55 when factoring in a growing ETH concentration, access to unique staking opportunities, and a structured handling of its issuance and buybacks around NAV. Of course, none of this removes the company's risks tied to its ETH volatility, dilution, and its overdependence on capital market conditions, but it seems that the market price for the stock is already reflecting those pressures. Thus, in sum, for any investors who are looking for an ETH proxy on the public market with the potential for additional upside from staking deals and strategic capital management, SharpLink offers a discounted, but still compelling, entry point. Therefore, I maintain a buy rating given an estimated upside of 24.5% from the company's current stock price.",SBET,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-27 11:37:25

The on-chain analytics firm reports that STH realized losses have reached concerning levels, potentially signaling deeper market trouble ahead. This development could impact every cryptocurrency enthusiast’s portfolio. What Do Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Losses Mean for the Market? Glassnode’s data shows the realized loss ratio for Bitcoin short-term holders has dropped to just 0.07x. This metric measures how much loss these recent investors are realizing compared to their purchase prices. When this number falls, it indicates reduced buying demand and contracting market liquidity. The current situation mirrors patterns seen during the early 2022 bear market. This similarity worries analysts because prolonged low loss ratios typically precede significant price corrections. The $81,000 support level now hangs in the balance. Why Should Bitcoin Investors Care About STH Metrics? Short-term holders represent the most active segment of Bitcoin investors. Their behavior often signals immediate market sentiment and liquidity conditions. When these Bitcoin short-term holders start realizing significant losses, it creates several market effects: Reduced overall market liquidity Increased selling pressure Weakened investor confidence Potential for rapid price declines The current 0.07x ratio suggests these Bitcoin short-term holders are either holding through losses or selling at minimal losses, both concerning scenarios for market health. What Levels Must Bitcoin Reclaim for Recovery? Glassnode identifies a clear path for market recovery. Bitcoin needs to reclaim the $100,000 to $105,000 range, which represents the STH realized price. This level marks the average acquisition price for recent Bitcoin short-term holders. Reaching this threshold would signal that most recent investors are back in profit territory. This achievement would likely restore confidence and stimulate renewed buying activity. However, the journey to this level faces significant resistance given current market conditions. How Can Investors Navigate This Volatile Period? Understanding Bitcoin short-term holder dynamics provides valuable insights for making informed decisions. During periods of STH stress, consider these strategies: Monitor on-chain metrics regularly Set clear risk management parameters Diversify investment timelines Watch for institutional accumulation patterns Remember that Bitcoin short-term holder behavior often creates buying opportunities for long-term investors during market stress. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Critical Juncture The warning from Glassnode about Bitcoin short-term holder losses serves as a crucial alert for the entire cryptocurrency community. The potential break below $81,000 represents a significant technical and psychological level that could determine medium-term market direction. While the situation appears challenging, understanding these metrics empowers investors to make calculated decisions rather than emotional reactions. The path to recovery remains clear, though challenging, requiring Bitcoin to reclaim the $100,000-$105,000 STH realized price zone. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin short-term holders? Bitcoin short-term holders are investors who purchased their Bitcoin within the last 155 days. Their behavior often indicates recent market sentiment and liquidity conditions. Why is the 0.07x loss ratio significant? This low ratio indicates that short-term holders are realizing minimal losses compared to historical patterns, suggesting either capitulation hasn’t occurred or investors are holding through losses. What happens if Bitcoin breaks below $81,000? A break below $81,000 could trigger further selling pressure and test lower support levels, potentially leading to increased market volatility. How long do STH metrics typically affect price? STH metric influences can last from several weeks to months, depending on broader market conditions and institutional participation. What’s the difference between STH and LTH metrics? Short-term holder metrics reflect recent investor behavior, while long-term holder metrics show patterns of investors holding for over 155 days, indicating different market segments. Can institutional buying offset STH selling pressure? Yes, significant institutional accumulation can absorb STH selling pressure and stabilize prices, though timing and scale determine effectiveness. Found this analysis helpful?

Despite that cushion, institutions are bailing on the stock and moving into spot Bitcoin ETFs instead, leaving Strategy out of the S&P 500 and trading below the value of its own $BTC holdings. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale is building an SVM-based Bitcoin Layer 2 with near-instant, low-fee smart contracts and DeFi that settles back to Bitcoin, giving $BTC holders a scaling and yield angle instead of just spot exposure. PEPENODE’s presale pushes a mine-to-earn meme model where you buy virtual nodes, build a digital mining rig, and earn $PEPENODE plus other meme coins, with node upgrades and token burns tying demand to in-game activity. Corporate Bitcoin strategy hits differently when it’s backed by hard numbers instead of doompost threads. A 5.9x asset‑to‑debt ratio at the average $BTC cost basis, and even 2x coverage if Bitcoin nukes to $25K, is exactly the kind of balance‑sheet resilience big money cares about. When the top asset on corporate books still comfortably covers obligations after a deep crash, the signal isn’t ‘risk off’ – it’s that Bitcoin has matured into collateral that institutions actually trust. That trust doesn’t just sit in cold wallets; it becomes the backdrop for the next wave of risk‑on bets. Historically, when the market accepts Bitcoin as sound collateral, the next move is usually into high‑beta plays that can ride the same long‑term conviction with far larger upside. That’s where presales, aggressive Layer 2s, and high‑throughput chains tend to explode, turning $BTC strength into altcoin momentum. Below are three projects positioned to benefit from this environment – led by Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin Layer 2 trying to do for $BTC what high‑performance chains did for DeFi elsewhere, alongside Solana‑style execution and Tron’s stablecoin machine. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): SVM Speed On A Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper pitches itself as ‘the fastest Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain’ with integrated Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), aiming to deliver faster performance than Solana itself while anchoring to Bitcoin for settlement. The idea is simple: keep Bitcoin as the base layer of trust, outsource speed and programmability to a purpose‑built Layer 2. Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper uses a modular design: Bitcoin L1 for settlement and a real‑time SVM Layer 2 for high‑throughput execution. A single trusted sequencer batches transactions and periodically anchors state back to Bitcoin, enabling sub‑second confirmation at low cost instead of waiting for slow on‑chain $BTC finality and paying full L1 fees. This architecture attacks Bitcoin’s three core limitations at once: slow transactions, high fees, and lack of native smart contracts. On Bitcoin Hyper, you get extremely low‑latency processing, SVM‑based smart contracts, and SPL‑compatible tokens adapted for the L2. That opens the door to wrapped $BTC payments, AMMs, lending markets, staking protocols, NFTs, and gaming dApps built in Rust with SDKs and APIs developers already know. Here’s how to buy $HYPER before the presale ends tomorrow. The presale has raised $28.58M, with tokens at $0.013335, and staking is set at 40%, so there are long-term gains to be made alongside price appreciation. Join the $HYPER presale today. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-To-Earn Meme With Node Economics If Bitcoin Hyper is the infrastructure bet, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is the speculative meme play wrapped in a pseudo‑mining economy. Branded as the world’s first mine-to-earn memecoin, it swaps hash rate and ASICs for a virtual mining system where users deploy ‘nodes’ through a gamified dashboard to earn token emissions. Instead of proof‑of‑work, PEPENODE uses tiered node rewards to simulate miner economics. Higher‑tier nodes are designed to capture larger slices of emissions, encouraging early participation and laddering up through the system. Eventually, you’ll be able to receive rewards on popular meme coins like Fartcoin and Pepe. It’s a familiar pattern from DeFi node projects, but re‑skinned for meme traders who want something more interactive than simply buying and waiting. Despite the playful branding, there’s real capital flowing in. The PEPENODE presale has raised $2.2M with tokens at $0.0011685, putting it firmly in micro‑cap territory where order‑book depth will matter but upside can be violent if the narrative catches a bid. Our PEPENODE price prediction puts a potential 2026 price at $0.0071, which is a 508% increase from the current price. Staking isn’t specified yet, so yield for now is focused on the virtual mining mechanics and node tiers. In a market where Bitcoin is proving itself as a durable treasury asset, memes like PEPENODE sit at the opposite end of the risk curve: pure beta with a gamified wrapper. If you’re looking for exposure that can move multiples faster than $BTC on narrative alone, the mine‑to‑earn angle aims directly at that demand. Join the PEPENODE presale now. 3. Tron (TRX): Stablecoin Workhorse With Massive USDT Flows Tron (TRX) remains one of the purest expressions of ‘blockchain as payments rail’ in the market. It’s a high‑throughput network designed for fast, low‑cost transactions and dApp deployment, but its real edge today is stablecoins: Tron has become a major hub for $USDT transfers across exchanges and payment platforms. With high TPS and tiny fees, Tron quietly turned into the default settlement layer for a big chunk of crypto’s dollar liquidity. Recently, it even surpassed Ethereum in total circulating $USDT, reaching about $73.8B, underscoring how much real transactional flow now prefers Tron’s cost structure over more expensive chains for day‑to‑day movement. That stablecoin gravity feeds into a growing DeFi and cross‑chain ecosystem, where users can tap lending, swaps, and yield strategies without abandoning the payment rails they already use. In a market where Bitcoin is the collateral anchor, Tron offers exposure to the transactional layer of crypto dollars. And the token is showing signs of recovery from the recent market dump, with a 1% increase in the last day. You can get Tron from Binance. Recap: When corporate treasuries show Bitcoin reserves still comfortably covering debt even in a deep crash, it sets the stage for high‑beta plays. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) stand out as the most direct bets in the current market.

Additionally, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Fed Governor Christopher Waller suggested that the central bank may move from holding to easing. Other data suggests that layoffs are contained, supporting a soft landing narrative . UPDATE: Just 7 days ago, markets priced a December rate cut at 30%. Today? 85% even @jpmorgan piling on – confirms the cut! What changed, you ask? NY Fed's Williams (Powell's right-hand) signaled openness to cuts Sep jobs report showed weakness (119K vs expected)… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) November 27, 2025 Moreover, Bolivia has reversed its long-standing ban on digital assets. It is now preparing to integrate cryptocurrencies, starting with stablecoins, into its formal banking system. Bulls and Bears Battling According to Glassnode , the market is likely to stay in a low-conviction consolidation until price reclaims key cost-basis levels and new inflows return. “Bitcoin is not in full capitulation but remains firmly in a low-liquidity, low-conviction environment. Until price reclaims major cost-basis levels and fresh demand returns, the market is likely to stay in a defensive consolidation phase,” the analysts say. Additionally, Przemysław Kral, CEO of zondacrypto , said that the global ‘risk-off’ macro environment and swell of leveraged selling has ultimately served as a necessary structural cleanse for Bitcoin. “This deleveraging event removed many of the short-term, speculative players and made way for long-term investors, including institutional investors and hodlers, who have been accumulating Bitcoin strategically during the market dip,” Kral said in an email comment. “The resulting rebound of Bitcoin from multi-market lows, despite a perceived climate of ‘extreme fear’, signals the deep conviction in the asset’s underlying value and its continued resilience as the industry continues to mature.” Moreover, Bitunix analysts commented that markets broadly expect policymakers to fiercely debate between a “third rate cut” and holding rates unchanged. “The dominant market driver has shifted from policy direction to the interplay between ‘inflation stickiness vs. economic slowdown,” the analysts say. “Current price structure shows bulls and bears battling around key liquidity zones.” They concluded that “investors should monitor the rising risk of volatility ahead of the [US] December meeting and pay close attention to how strongly capital absorbs price moves near the upper range—an important signal of evolving risk appetite.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC stood at $91,506. The coin jumped from $86,448 to $90,334. After that, it hit the intraday high of $91,849. In the past week, the price moved between $82,175 and $92,032. It’s still down 0.7% in this timeframe. It’s also down 20% in a month and 27.3% from the all-time high. Bitcoin is stabilizing after a steep correction. A breakout above $93,966 could open doors towards $97,135 and perhaps even $102,255.

Key Takeaways: Two senior South Korean police officials and five crypto-linked figures were indicted in a bribery and money-laundering case. Prosecutors allege officers took cash and luxury goods in exchange for internal investigative information and favors. The scheme is tied to 249.6 billion won in voice-phishing funds laundered through cryptocurrencies. The Suwon District Prosecutors’ Office Criminal Division 2 said the indictments were filed without detention and include violations of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes and the Act on the Regulation and Punishment of Criminal Proceeds Concealment, according to a Thursday report from The Chosun Daily . Former Police Chief, NPA Officer Charged in Crypto Bribery Ring Those charged include a former police station chief, identified as A, and a former officer from the National Police Agency, identified as B. Prosecutors say both men accepted money and luxury goods from executives at a cryptocurrency business in return for sensitive investigative details and operational favors. Five others, including a crypto company operator, C, and a chief executive, D, were also indicted for allegedly offering bribes and laundering criminal proceeds through digital assets. Investigators allege that A received a total of 79 million Korean won between July 2022 and July of last year after being introduced to C by an official at a domestic virtual asset exchange. In exchange, A is accused of providing investigative information and “conveniences,” including checking whether officers familiar with him were involved in C’s case and introducing lawyers to blunt the probe. Prosecutors claim A was enticed with promises of access to coins before exchange listings and assurances that investments would be refunded if they failed. B allegedly received goods and favors worth 10 million won across roughly ten occasions from February last year through February this year. According to prosecutors, B was introduced by A to C and D and subsequently obtained designer items such as wallets, shoes and coats. In return, B is accused of confirming case progress and requesting the lifting of payment suspensions on accounts allegedly tied to the crimes. Authorities say the crypto executives ran a laundering operation that converted 249.6 billion won in voice phishing proceeds into digital assets between January and October of last year. The prosecution estimates illegal profits at 11.2 billion won and has imposed seizure and asset-preservation measures on 1.5 billion won by tracking hidden properties. South Korea To Sanction Crypto Exchanges Over AML Failures As reported, the South Korean financial watchdog is preparing a fresh round of penalties for domestic virtual asset exchanges, stepping up its campaign against anti-money laundering failures that regulators say threaten the integrity of the country’s fast-growing crypto market. South Korea is set to hit major crypto exchanges with new penalties over anti-money laundering failures, signaling a tougher enforcement phase for the industry. #SouthKorea #CryptoAML https://t.co/9r42trYMmE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 Financial authorities are expected to issue both institutional and individual sanctions, along with fines, against major trading platforms that breached anti-money laundering obligations.

This is amid the XRP ETF launches that have taken place over the last week, X triggering a significant amount of inflow into the cryptocurrency. The calls for new all-time high prices to surpass its 2018 $3.84 peak have only grown louder, with timelines getting shorter. This time around, one analyst has predicted a new all-time high, with what they call a “true Elliot Wave view.” Why XRP Price Could Still Gun Above $4 In an analysis shared on X with over 35,000 followers, crypto analyst XForce Global has put forward the idea that the Elliot Wave Theory has not completely played out for the XRP price. So far, the belief has been that the XRP price has completed the last and final wave and could be headed into a bear market. However, the crypto analyst doesn’t believe this is the case. Related Reading: XRP Price Will Climb Above $10 When This Happens: Analyst XForce Global points to the fact that analysts who use the Elliot Wave theory could struggle with the chart they shared. But this chart apparently removes all of the market inefficiencies, allowing the XRP price to be viewed through a clear lens. The analysis suggests that the altcoin could see a bullish continuation, running a flat route upward after hitting support above $1.87. Such a surge would put the XRP price on the path above $4, with the digital asset possibly topping above $5. In the event that the price does crash further than the current local lows, the analyst believes that an expanded flat route beginning above $1.6 would still trigger a similar outcome. Both rallies are expected to push the XRP price above $4 and then top toward $6. Major Factor To Drive Price Explosion One major factor that analysts have put forward to drive an XRP price explosion is the launch of XRP ETFs. With more than 3 XRP ETFs now trading in the US, analyst Chad Steingraber has outlined how their launch could affect the altcoin’s price. Related Reading: Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days Steingraber explained that, so far, the XRP price had been seeing some uptick during ETF trading hours, and then declining during off-hours. This is building pressure and momentum, and is expected to accumulate over time. The result of this is supposed to be a major price explosion in the next few months, possibly pushing XRP to new peaks.

54988631,635108,1764244821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54988631.jpeg,Ripple Gains Abu Dhabi FSRA Greenlisting In Latest Middle East Push,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-abu-dhabi-fsra-greenlisting/,"Ripple has secured a key regulatory win in the Gulf as Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) has recognized Ripple USD (RLUSD) as an “Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token,” effectively greenlisting the USD-backed stablecoin for use within Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). Ripple Adds Another Middle East Win The designation means RLUSD can now be used by FSRA-licensed “Authorised Persons” for applicable regulated activities inside ADGM, including its use as lending collateral. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, highlighted the significance in a post on X, calling the approval “another milestone for Ripple here in the Middle East” and noting that “RLUSD is now approved for use as lending collateral within @ADGlobalMarket.” He added that 2025 had brought “awesome momentum for Ripple in the Middle East” and said he “can’t wait to keep building on these solid foundations as we head into 2026.” The move slots RLUSD into ADGM’s dedicated framework for fiat-referenced tokens (FRTs), under which only assets granted “Accepted” status may be used by regulated firms for key activities such as custody, dealing and operating venues. For RLUSD, this shifts it from being merely technically usable to being explicitly permitted under one of the most structured digital asset regimes in the region. Jack McDonald, Senior Vice President of Stablecoins, framed the approval as a validation of the product’s institutional positioning. “The FSRA’s recognition of RLUSD as a Fiat-Referenced Token reinforces our commitment to regulatory compliance and trust – two non-negotiables when it comes to institutional finance,” he said. With “a market capitalization of over $1 billion and growing adoption in core financial uses like collateral and payments,” McDonald argued, RLUSD is “quickly becoming a go-to USD stablecoin for major institutions.” RLUSD is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services Limited Purpose Trust Company Charter and, according to the company, has grown to more than $1.2 billion in market capitalization since launching in late 2024. The company emphasises 1:1 USD backing in high-quality liquid assets, strict reserve segregation, third-party attestations and clear redemption rights, aiming squarely at regulatory and institutional expectations rather than retail speculation. From ADGM’s side, the move is also being presented as a proof point for Abu Dhabi’s regulatory architecture. “We congratulate Ripple on achieving this important milestone,” said Arvind Ramamurthy, Chief Market Development Officer at ADGM. He pointed to ADGM’s “robust regulatory framework, designed to support the sustainable growth of innovative firms and ensure the highest international standards of governance and compliance,” and argued that Abu Dhabi’s focus on “innovation, transparency, and trust positions Abu Dhabi as a leading hub for the next generation of financial services and digital finance.” The RLUSD recognition adds to Ripple’s rapidly expanding Middle East footprint. In the UAE, the stablecoin has also been cleared in Dubai’s DIFC through the DFSA’s recognised token regime, while in the broader region Ripple has announced a new strategic partnership in Bahrain and onboarded Absa Bank as its first custody client in Africa. RLUSD is being integrated across Ripple’s own stack – including Ripple Payments, Ripple Custody and Ripple Prime – to function as a settlement and collateral asset for cross-border payments, institutional trading and capital markets.

Expanded Bitcoin options capacity has historically coincided with stronger volatility regimes, often driving capital into higher‑beta meme and narrative coins. PEPENODE proposes a virtual mining meme coin ecosystem where tiered nodes and gamified rewards target boring mining models and weak early user incentives. The Nasdaq just made a massive move. It set a 1M-contract limit on BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) options. This is Nasdaq clearing the runway for some serious heavy hitters. By cranking up the limits this aggressively, they are basically rolling out the red carpet for macro funds, volatility desks, and the big-money structured product guys to pile into Bitcoin like never before. The change officially puts $BTC on the map as a legit institutional playground, not just a side-show for spot traders. Sure, bigger capacity means deeper order books, which is great, but the real story is the leverage. This scale allows the big funds to run complex strategies, like basis trades , that dump a ton of persistent gamma flows into the market. Historically, when you get that much one-sided action in the derivatives market, it acts like rocket fuel. X analysts quickly pounced on the news, some highlighted that $IBIT is now the largest $BTC options market in the world by open interest (OI). Whilst others broke down what the action means, citing it as bullish Bitcoin news . Now we could start to see traders start rotating their profits out of ‘safe’ $BTC bets and go hunting for asymmetric gains in the wilder corners of the market. The money flows down the risk curve, first into leveraged perps, and then straight into meme coins and narrative plays. Basically, Nasdaq is building the pipes for a massive leverage influx, and the rest of the market is getting ready for the inevitable alt season speculation that follows. Projects like PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) could really stand to gain due to their unique offerings. PEPENODE: Catching the Wave with a ‘Mine-to-Earn’ Twist With all that capital likely looking for the next big thing outside of Bitcoin, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is stepping up to catch the rotation. It’s pitched as the world’s first ‘mine-to-earn’ meme coin. The idea is pretty clever: while most meme coins are just about community hype and vibes, $PEPENODE is trying to ground that speculation in a gamified system that feels like crypto mining, but without the headache. The project is built around a Virtual Mining System. Forget about buying expensive ASIC rigs, dealing with insane electricity bills, or setting up cooling fans in your garage. Instead, you just hop onto a slick, gamified dashboard where you can buy and customize ‘Miner Nodes.’ You can upgrade these digital facilities to boost your stats, which directly pumps your yield. It’s a smart pivot because it takes the usually dry, technical world of DeFi yield farming and turns it into an addictive management game. By mashing up meme culture with sticky gameplay mechanics, PEPENODE is trying to solve the classic farm and dump problem. You aren’t just staking tokens; you’re building a virtual empire. Plus, active players earn rewards not just in $PEPENODE, but also in other blue-chip memes like PEPE and Fartcoin. It creates a loop where playing the game actually feeds demand for the token. Already want in? We’ve got you covered in our ‘ How to Buy PEPENODE ’ guide. $PEPENODE: It’s All About the Numbers The gameplay sounds fun, but let’s talk numbers specifically regarding the $PEPENODE token, which is the engine running this whole thing. It’s the currency you need for staking, rewards, and governance, and right now, the presale is seeing some serious action. Smart money seems to be positioning itself ahead of the Token Generation Event (TGE). The presale has already raked in over $2.2M, and costing only $0.0011685, it’s one of the best low-cap coins . This entry point is basically the early bird special before all the fancy node utilities and gameplay features actually go live. This pre-activation phase is a golden chance for you to front-run the narrative before the rest of the market catches on to the whole mine-to-earn trend. The on-chain data backs this up, too. We’ve seen whale wallets scoop up large chunks as high as $94.1K worth of $PEPENODE recently. That’s a strong signal that some big wallets are betting on upside that goes beyond your typical meme coin pump. Our experts see the same. In our ‘ PEPENODE Price Prediction ’, where EOY predictions for 2026, see $PEPENODE potentially reading $0.0072. That would be an ROI of 516% if you invested at today’s price. These guys are likely wagering that if institutional flows send the market higher, gamified projects like this will outperform static coins. If you’re looking for a high-beta play, it might be time to check out the $PEPENODE presale. With dynamic staking rewards of 586% it’s time to check out $PEPENODE. Remember, this is not intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before making any investments.

The latest disclosure from Bitwise signals growing engagement from traditional finance at a time when XRP remains central to conversations around utility, liquidity, and long-term market depth. Bitwise’s Updated XRP Position Chad Steingraber drew attention to the update when he shared the new figures on X. His post revealed that Bitwise now holds 80,503,659.37 XRP in its trust. The reported market value is $178,833,244.05, showing steady institutional exposure. Bitwise lists 11.196615 XRP per share and assigns a 100 % weight to the asset. What the Numbers Reveal The updated holdings show strong demand from investors who prefer regulated exposure. The trust model allows participants to own XRP indirectly without handling private keys or managing custody. This structure appeals to institutions that operate under strict compliance rules. The rising market value also reflects broader confidence in XRP’s liquidity strength. Bitwise XRP updates it holdings… Now over 80,5Million XRP AUM https://t.co/4PJIGZF9xq pic.twitter.com/JNOSPjbqm6 — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 27, 2025 Importance of Institutional Custody Institutional products like the Bitwise XRP Trust help stabilize supply within controlled environments. Large asset pools reduce abrupt market distribution and support predictable flows. Custody providers ensure secure storage, which adds credibility to the product. These factors help position XRP as a more mature and investable asset. How XRP Per Share Shapes Valuation The XRP-per-share figure helps investors understand how assets back the trust’s circulating shares. This number moves gradually as fees, inflows, and redemptions adjust the balance. A higher backing ratio strengthens investor confidence. It also helps analysts track how much XRP Bitwise must acquire during inflow periods. Market Impact of Growing Holdings A trust holding over 80 million XRP becomes a significant player in the asset’s liquidity structure. Large custodial positions reduce circulating supply on open exchanges. This shift can influence market behavior, especially during periods of rising demand. Increased institutional allocation often supports long-term price stability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Update Matters to XRP Holders The XRP community tracks institutional movements because they signal adoption trends. Bitwise’s updated figures show continued interest despite market fluctuations. These disclosures provide transparency, which strengthens investor trust. They also show how traditional asset managers view XRP as a viable digital asset. Broader Context for Institutional Interest Demand for blockchain assets remains strong as payment-focused tokens gain visibility. XRP benefits from its long-standing use case and its established settlement design. Funds like the Bitwise XRP Trust offer a simple gateway for investors who prefer regulated access. This framework supports wider market participation. Outlook for XRP in Institutional Portfolios If inflows continue, Bitwise may expand its holdings to maintain share backing. This possibility could deepen institutional integration. The market will watch for future disclosures that reflect new acquisitions or redemptions. Increased clarity helps traders understand liquidity movements and long-term positioning. Bitwise’s updated holdings, highlighted by Chad Steingraber, show strong institutional engagement with XRP. The 80.5 million XRP under management underscores growing confidence and offers the XRP Army a clear view of market interest.

According to reports , Las Vegas-based Alt5 Sigma Corp. has cut ties with its acting chief executive officer, Jonathan Hugh, and its chief operating officer, Ron Pitters, and appointed replacements for both men. The company says the decision was not related to specific misconduct. World Liberty Financial publicly downplays the executive changes Tony Isaac, the president of Alt5, is now the acting CEO. Before the company decided to focus on cryptocurrencies, he had worked for it in various capacities, including recycling appliances and assisting with opioid response operations. The change follows another shakeup , in which the publicly traded company informed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had suspended the previous CEO, Peter Tassiopoulos, effective October 16. This suspension came after an internal email reportedly revealed that the board had placed him on temporary leave on September 4. At the same time, Chief Revenue Officer Vay Tham was also placed on leave, according to the email obtained by Forbes from two sources close to the company. The company struck a $1.5 billion deal in August to acquire WLFI tokens from World Liberty Financial, co-founded by members of the Trump family, under an arrangement in which a Trump family entity would receive 75% of the token-sale proceeds. That deal swiftly made Alt5 one of the many small public companies this year that changed their plans from expanding business operations to collecting crypto tokens. Trump ally Zachary Witkoff chairs Alt5 Sigma’s board, while Eric Trump and co-founder Zachary Folkman serve as board observers. Eric’s brother, Donald Trump Jr., later joined executives at a Nasdaq bell-ringing ceremony to celebrate the partnership. World Liberty Financial has publicly downplayed the executive changes . “The filing speaks for itself,” said spokesperson David Wachsman, adding the group remains “excited about the future for Alt5.” The Alt5 controversies add to WLFI’s ongoing scrutiny This year, the SEC abruptly dropped its investigation into Justin Sun, a major investor in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), shortly after Sun made a $30 million investment in the Trump-backed venture. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Maxine Waters have since called for transparency, saying there may be conflicts of interest and asking if Trump’s financial interests affected the SEC’s actions in WLFI. As if this is not enough, behind the scenes, a subsidiary was ruled criminally liable for money laundering in Rwanda in May, months before the Trump-related deal was finalized. The same case also found Alt5 principal Andre Beauchesne liable, with a court ordering his imprisonment. Alt5 has said both the subsidiary and Beauchesne appealed, arguing they were victims of fraud. WLFI records double-digit surge The WLFI token has surged approximately 14% in the last week. This has been brought about by the ongoing buyback. During the past day, the project has spent approximately $10 million to acquire a little over 59 million WLFI tokens via CoW Swap, a decentralized exchange. The move follows a vote to pass a governance proposal on September 19, which aimed to reduce the token’s outstanding supply through burns and repurchases, thereby boosting the token’s value, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The vote was unanimous with 98% support, while only 0.06% voted against it. WLFI previously said that passing the governance proposal serves as the cornerstone of the platform’s strategy for token repurchases. Meanwhile, the price of WLFI is up almost 1% and is now trading at $0.1603. By extension, the TRUMP coin is also steady with a 0.15% rise, now trading at $6.20.

What began as a jab from McGregor over Khabib’s recent NFT drop has evolved into a wider debate involving blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who publicly accused the Irish fighter of hypocrisy over his own failed meme coin launch. McGregor Criticizes Khabib’s Papakha NFTs, On-Chain Investigator Fires Back The dispute intensified on November 26 after McGregor accused Nurmagomedov of orchestrating a “multi-million dollar scam” tied to a Telegram-based NFT collection known as the “Papakha” drop. The project featured 29,000 digital versions of the traditional Dagestani hat Khabib famously wore during his UFC walkouts, marketed as a cultural tribute to his late father, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov. Source: Telegram marketplace The NFTs reportedly sold out in just 25 hours. Controversy followed when promotional posts disappeared from Khabib’s Instagram and X pages, prompting McGregor to claim that fans were misled. Source: Conor McGregor on X Nurmagomedov responded , insisting that the collection was legitimate and designed as an “exclusive digital gift” symbolizing Dagestani traditions. You absolute liar You will always try to darken my name, after you got destroyed that night, but you will never achieve that! Yes, good guys don’t do that. They don’t create exclusive digital gifts with real time value, that you can share with your friends and family. Gifts… — khabib nurmagomedov (@TeamKhabib) November 26, 2025 He defended the distribution through Telegram and dismissed any claims of wrongdoing. The exchange revived tensions between the two athletes, but the debate escalated further when on-chain investigator ZachXBT entered the discussion. Hours after McGregor’s post, on-chain investigator ZachXBT reignited the controversy by turning McGregor’s own criticisms against him. There is just no way good guy McGregor used his reputation, as well as Irish culture, to scam his fans and fire sell a bunch of digital tokens’s online and then delete all of the posts after they were sold, leaving his fans robbed of their money? There is just no way good guy… pic.twitter.com/CuUzvPGiKS — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) November 26, 2025 ZachXBT reminded the public of McGregor’s April 2025 meme coin, $REAL , which was offered in a sealed-bid auction with staking rewards for participants. Despite the ambitious launch, the project raised only 39% of its targeted goal, prompting full refunds to investors. ZachXBT’s post questioned whether it was credible to label Khabib a scammer while McGregor himself had previously failed to deliver on a digital token project, effectively drawing parallels between the two fighters’ crypto endeavors. Celebrity Crypto Failures Spotlighted Amid Meme Coin Market Slide Both McGregor and Nurmagomedov have histories of controversial crypto ventures. Nurmagomedov faced criticism in 2023 for promoting a potentially fraudulent NFT in partnership with GoMining. He also faced mixed reactions for promoting the Sharia-compliant finance platform Wahed. Meanwhile, McGregor has had his own setbacks, including the 2022 McGregor Realm NFT project and the failed $REAL meme coin . These prior incidents have amplified the current dispute, as each fighter references the other’s past failures to strengthen their narrative. ZachXBT’s participation in the McGregor–Khabib spat coincides with a broader surge in enforcement against undisclosed promotions. Notably, in September, the investigator published documents revealing that more than 150 crypto influencers failed to label paid advertisements in token campaigns, raising concerns about market integrity. Meme coins were among the hottest narratives and top-performing sectors in crypto in 2024. However, their rapid surge came to an abrupt halt in 2025 amid broader turbulence across the meme and NFT markets . After peaking at $116.7 billion in early January, the sector collapsed to $39.4 billion in November, marking a 66% decline as several political and celebrity-backed launches rapidly lost value or were accused of misconduct. The downturn was compounded by a sharp contraction in speculative appetite across NFTs and low-liquidity tokens. While the meme coin market has shown brief signs of stabilization by recently rising to $46.64 billion with a 1.3% daily gain and a 24-hour trading volume of $5.05 billion, the sector remains far below its earlier highs. The ongoing dispute between McGregor and Nurmagomedov shows the renewed scrutiny facing celebrity crypto promotions, especially at a time when failures, stalled presales, and alleged misrepresentations continue to attract attention. Recent controversies have included the $433 million BlockDAG presale , which ZachXBT linked to an undisclosed founder, and the WEB3 token sale , which he tied to individuals associated with past NFT rug pulls.

The collaboration extends the Shiba Inu ecosystem into AI and gaming, signaling a broader push toward on-chain engagement. The project’s official Shib X account drew attention to the development on Wednesday, noting that the integration will strengthen SHIB’s use cases. The move forms part of a larger strategy to position the ecosystem for the next phase of Web3 innovation. AI Partnership Targets Expanded SHIB Engagement TokenPlay AI confirmed that it will launch an exclusive Shiba-themed miniapp on Thursday at 4 PM UTC. The mini application will offer gaming experiences built around the Shiba Inu brand and reward users for their activity. This approach encourages direct interaction and aims to convert passive SHIB holders into active participants. TokenPlay AI described the initiative as a step toward deeper utility and stronger community engagement. The miniapp rollout marks another milestone in Shiba Inu’s roadmap. Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has repeatedly highlighted AI adoption as a priority for the ecosystem. The SHIB team views the collaboration as a way to merge gaming, blockchain, and artificial intelligence within a unified experience. As a result, the project expects higher user involvement as more holders test the new Shiba-branded features. TokenPlay AI Brings Gaming Tools and Broad Partner Network TokenPlay AI operates as the only Token OS and was created by Astra Nova, a known name in Web3 development. NVIDIA and artificial general intelligence (AGI) contributed to the technology behind Astra Nova. The platform also collaborates with Alibaba Cloud, which increases its appeal to Web3 creators seeking scalable tools. The protocol intends to use these capabilities to streamline the creation of miniapps for blockchain communities. The company plans to offer Shiba Inu creators tools that generate applications in seconds. These tools require no coding and allow users to build simple games tailored to SHIB audiences. TokenPlay AI suggested that this feature will support a new wave of content and reward-driven engagement. The team believes this approach aligns with Shiba Inu’s long-term vision for Web3 expansion. While Shiba Inu is a core partner, TokenPlay AI confirmed that it will also support several other communities during its early access launch. The event, scheduled for Thursday, includes Neiro, Sundog on Tron, and Solana’s Peanut meme coin. Other participating projects include Hippo, MemeCore, Moodeng, and MemeX. The company targets ecosystems with active user bases to accelerate engagement across multiple networks. Meanwhile, user interest continues to rise. TokenPlay AI’s website shows 378,742 people on its waitlist, a steep increase from 22,021 in June. The growth reflects widespread anticipation around the new Shiba miniapp and the broader expansion of the protocol’s tools.

The native token XRP is in green territory today (November 27), albeit posting less substantial gains than many of the other leading digital assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The ETF Craze Canary Capital made history in mid-November, becoming the first company to introduce a spot XRP ETF that has 100% exposure to the asset. The product’s debut day was a real success, generating almost $60 million in trading volume. Shortly after, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a similar financial product issued by Bitwise, which also performed quite well. Earlier this week, Grayscale and Franklin Templeton followed suit, thus emerging as the latest major players to enter the spot XRP ETF arena. Current data from SoSoValue shows that the cumulative net inflows into the products are above $640 million since the first one saw the light of day a couple of weeks ago. Investors await the launch of additional exchange-traded funds with Ripple’s cross-border token as an underlying asset, and it seems the one issued by 21Shares will be next. Several X users revealed that the investment vehicle has been approved and is expected to go live on November 29. RLUSD’s Advancement Less than a year ago, Ripple introduced a stablecoin, pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. The product, dubbed RLUSD, was embraced by numerous exchanges in the following months and received support from some banking giants, including the oldest US bank, BNY Mellon. Just recently, Ripple announced that Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) has recognized its stablecoin as an accepted fiat-referenced token. The initiative makes RLUSD eligible for use by authorised individuals licensed by the agency to carry out applicable regulated activities. Speaking on the matter was Jack McDonald (Senior Vice President of Stablecoins at Ripple): “The FSRA’s recognition of RLUSD as a fiat-referenced token reinforces our commitment to regulatory compliance and trust – two non-negotiables when it comes to institutional finance.” The development marks Ripple’s further expansion in the Middle East. Earlier this year, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) recognized the stablecoin as a crypto token within the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC). Meanwhile, RLUSD recently saw its market capitalization surge above $1.25 billion. This makes it the 83rd-largest cryptocurrency but still far below the leaders in the stablecoin sector, USDT and USDC. XRP Price Outlook Ripple’s native cryptocurrency has posted a minor 1% increase on a daily scale and currently trades at around $2.20 (per CoinGecko’s data). This contrasts with the much more impressive gains experienced by BTC, ETH, and other well-known digital assets within the same period. Still, many analysts believe XRP could be gearing up for a substantial short-term rally. X user Ali Martinez noted that the price rebounded from the lower end of a particular channel located below $2, suggesting this could be followed by a pump to as high as $2.60. However, the recent whale sell-off should serve as a warning that another correction could be knocking on the door. As CryptoPotato reported , large investors offloaded almost 1.5 billion XRP in the past month or so, while earlier this week they dumped an additional 180 million tokens. The exodus may spark panic across the community and potentially trigger a wave of selling from smaller players as well. It also leaves open the possibility that the whales know something we don’t, which could explain their recent activity.

BLSH posted strong FQ3 2025 results, with 80% revenue growth, new product launches, and expanding institutional partnerships supporting the investment thesis. Despite trading at a premium valuation, BLSH's high growth, diversified revenue streams, and pro-crypto tailwinds justify its current multiple. Key risks include crypto market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and competition, but BLSH is well-positioned to rebound and dominate the sector. Bullish ( BLSH ) is a cryptocurrency exchange, which debuted on the stock market on August 13 through its IPO at $37 initial price. The IPO was successful, highlighting a significant demand for the company's stock, reaching an intraday high of $118. The technology company has been trending down since the summer and now trades at roughly 7% premium versus its IPO price. The blockchain technology company is a rapid top-line growth story. It has achieved roughly 80% revenue growth over the past year, implying a 9x outperformance versus peers and arguing for a rebound from the recent sell-off. Bullish is also tied to multiple tailwinds, including an existing possibility of a year-end rally, favorable crypto seasonality, pro-crypto administration, and others, which may elevate investor confidence and boost the stock price higher. The company experiences a solid momentum in demand, and with cryptocurrency adoption and improved sentiment in the space, I think the business results may grow at a high double-digit pace. That is why I rate Bullish a Buy with a $57 price target over the next 12 months. This suggests a 39% upside possibility and broader market outperformance. FQ3 2025: Top-Line Growth Remains Intact, A 33% Surge On A Quarter-Over-Quarter Basis On November 19, the company delivered FQ3 2025 results. This was a strong quarterly performance, underscoring improving fundamentals and increasing institutional demand. However, the market reacted to the results with roughly a 4% decline on the earnings day. Bullish posted $76.50 million in revenue, approximately $5 million above what the market had anticipated. The bottom line arrived at $0.10 in diluted EPS, in line with analysts' expectations. BLSH: FQ3 2025 Key Highlights (Bullish Investor Relations) In the earnings presentation , management highlighted that it has achieved $27 million in adjusted transaction revenue and $50 million in subscriptions, services, and other revenue. Moreover, Bullish has achieved $29 million in adjusted EBITDA and $18 million in net income. I would like to emphasize that these results are in line with or above what the company has previously guided, which justifies excellent execution and steady business performance. BLSH launched crypto options on October 8 , and this was an early success. The company partnered with 14 trading companies and has already surpassed $1 billion in options trading volume, indicating significant demand and seamless adoption. I think this pivot may unlock a new revenue growth cycle for the company. Furthermore, management highlighted its indices AUM rose to $49 billion in FQ3 2025, a roughly 20% growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis from $41 billion. The company achieved above 100% new partner growth on a QoQ basis, and anticipates the trend to continue into the year-end. I believe this highlight suggests strong institutional adoption and BLSH providing high-quality services. Such a substantial growth in new partners indicates a solid market demand for the company's infrastructure and rising interest in the cryptocurrency space. To that, in September 2025 , BLSH secured a NY BitLicense, which entitles it to launch spot trading across US institutional investors. The company is laying the ground for its future success, and I think it is positioning itself for a market-leading position. BLSH: FQ3 2025 Well-Diversified Business (Bullish Investor Relations) I would also like to emphasize that Bullish is a well-diversified business with diverse revenue streams. The company's focus on multiple areas guides a positive outlook, indicating a strengthening moat, as it specializes in both information services and market infrastructure spaces. This helps to gain additional revenue and visibility from operating streams, such as CoinDesk Data or Media, Events, and I think that may appear a compelling addition to its primary business of exchange, liquidity, and indices. Furthermore, with a pro-crypto administration, a more favorable crypto environment, and a clearer legal framework, there is a likelihood that demand for cryptocurrencies may accelerate, and BLSH positions itself to benefit from such growth. For instance, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act , which establishes a framework for stablecoins and accelerates the adoption of digital assets. This supports my bullish thesis and a more favorable environment for crypto, and remains a tailwind for the company. A higher trading volume may lead to higher market infrastructure revenue. To note, in FQ3 2025, the company achieved $142 billion in total trading volume, with spot purchases leading and accounting for $130 billion. Derivatives trading volume achieved $12 billion. Although I think spot trading is likely to remain a significant part of the total revenue portion further, the company's focus and strategic partnerships in the space of derivatives make me think derivatives volume may substantially accelerate. This would support a bullish narrative for the company. To conclude, this has been a solid quarter for the company, underscoring a strong demand for its services, new partnerships driving the top-line growth, and cost efficiency measures supporting bottom-line expansion. Bullish positions itself to dominate the space, and with tailwinds tied to cryptocurrencies and digital asset adoption, the company appears to be well-positioned to benefit from favorable changes. I think it may appear to be a compelling opportunity for long-term investors favoring the crypto space and seeking exposure to the landscape through equity markets. Bullish Appears Expensive, But If Future Tailwinds Materialize, It May Remain At The Current Valuation Bullish currently trades at a forward P/E of roughly 145 , representing a 13x overvaluation versus peers at an 11x earnings multiple. Although this may appear concerning, the blockchain technology company is a high-demand, high-growth name, and its future outlook supports a premium valuation. BLSH: Forward P/E (YCharts) The chart above indicates that Bullish has been used in trading at a significant earnings multiple over the past years. One could argue, the current valuation stands for a multi-year low, and the cryptocurrency exchange may appear to be well-positioned to rebound from this sell-off. This also signals there is room for multiple expansions if execution delivers. On a forward PEG (non-GAAP) of 0.90, the company appears to be undervalued versus peers at 1.05. The 15% discount supports my thesis and argues for a bullish continuation. On the other hand, the forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales ratios of 22.85 and 22.15, respectively, imply 7x overvaluation at the midpoint versus sector medians of 3.15 and 2.91. Based on these metrics, it appears that the market anticipates significant revenue growth in the future, and if BLSH struggles to meet the expectations, the downside is not protected. BLSH: Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) Furthermore, Bullish has a low-leveraged capital structure, and this supports an elevated multiple. The company has roughly $583 million in total obligations and $445 million in cash; thus, it covers the debt to a large extent. This is appealing, as management has financial flexibility to use leverage if needed. As highlighted previously, the company has been an outstanding top-line growth story, so far. An 80% revenue growth remains significant and signals outperformance versus peers. In addition to this, typically Q4 is the most bullish calendar quarter for crypto, yet this year, Bitcoin is down roughly 24% so far, and Ethereum 29%. Both of these coins typically experience a significant double-digit growth in Q4; thus, historical data argue that December may spark positive investor confidence, which could support continued revenue growth for Bullish. The last argument is also supported by digital asset treasury companies. There are more such publicly listed companies that are applying a HODL strategy for both Bitcoin and Ethereum , and provide a floor price. In addition, these companies are also gradually acquiring coins, and that may contribute to a positive outlook for the space. Overall, I think Bullish is not a cheap stock, but its phenomenal growth and future tailwinds justify the valuation. The company experiences solid momentum in demand, remains a low-leveraged business, and the recent sell-off argues that sentiment may be overdone. Driven by future tailwinds, I think Bullish is well-positioned to rebound from these levels, and if crypto sentiment shifts, this could spark the end-of-year rally for equities with crypto exposure. Wall Street analysts forecast $0.28 in diluted EPS for FY2025 and $0.67 in diluted EPS for FY2026. I generally agree with the estimates, yet if crypto sentiment shifts and coins experience an all-time high run over the next months, the estimates may appear conservative. Nevertheless, I favor a conservative approach. Thus, if we apply an 85x earnings multiple, highlighting roughly 40% lower than the current forward P/E to the FY2026 EPS estimate of $0.67, we arrive at my price target of $57. I think the company is well-positioned to achieve the targets, and favorable tailwinds could spark repricing sooner, rather than later. Main Risks And Concerns There are risks and concerns tied to Bullish that could meaningfully impact stock price performance in the short term. To begin with, the company remains heavily dependent on cryptocurrency sentiment and is sensitive to crypto market volatility. For instance, if the seasonality tailwind doesn't play out, this could pressure the company's performance. If Bitcoin and Ethereum experience a period of consolidation, trading volume is likely to decline, too, and investors may not be willing to pay a premium for BLSH. Although the space is rapidly expanding, Bullish experiences fierce competition. Other well-known names, such as Kraken, Coinbase, Bybit, Binance, and others, are competing for the market share. If investors think Bullish is losing a position to its peers, repricing could lead to a stock price decline. The crypto company is highly sensitive to regulatory uncertainty. Although the current administration is pro-crypto, any negative regulatory frameworks could erode the landscape's sentiment, and the stock may correct from these levels. On the other hand, this may also act as a significant tailwind, sparking the end-of-year rally. I think that if none of the above risks and concerns materialize, Bullish remains well-positioned to rebound from a multi-year low valuation. Conclusion: Bullish Is Positioning To Dominate The Space — A Buy I believe Bullish may appear to be a compelling opportunity for long-term investors seeking to expand crypto exposure via equity markets. Bullish is a rapidly growing cryptocurrency exchange and blockchain technology company that is tied to multiple tailwinds, outweighing the concerns. Weak crypto seasonality performance highly contributed to the downside trend of the stock. However, with more DAT companies in place and pro-crypto administration, I think Bullish may rebound from these levels. The company continues expanding, justified by partnerships with trading platforms and the strategic launch of crypto options, which may drive customer growth. The company is now trading at close to its IPO price, which may signal that the sell-off appears overdone. I rate Bullish a Buy with a $57 price target over the next 12 months. This represents a 39% upside possibility and broader market outperformance. 11 Wall Street analysts imply a $53 price target , representing a 31% upside potential.",BLSH,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-27 12:15:14

Yet, it still feels like it’s flying under the radar, especially compared to giants like Binance or Bybit. I spent some time testing its spot markets, futures engine, and many of its additional features and overall user experience, and found it to be surprisingly capable with a feature-rich set of products that can be very useful for both beginners and advanced traders. The following is my BingX review for 2025, aimed at walking you through my findings about its strengths, weaknesses, costs, safety profile, and how it compares to some of the industry leaders. Main Takeaways: BingX provides a broad suite of different trading products, such as spot, futures, copy trading, grid bots, and earning tools. Copy trading is a standout feature, making the platform especially appealing to passive investors and beginners. Futures fees are very competitive, with strong liquidity on major pairs and reliable execution. The platform lacks major-market regulatory oversight, and availability varies by region. BingX Exchange Rating: 4.7/5 Wide selection of spot, futures & automated trading tools Industry-leading copy trading with AI options Competitive futures fees & strong liquidity Beginner-friendly UI and mobile app Demo trading mode for practice Limited regulatory oversight in major jurisdictions Not available to U.S. users Thinner liquidity on small-cap altcoins Visit Website {""@context"":""http:\/\/schema.org\/"",""@type"":""Product"",""name"":""BingX Exchange"",""image"":{""@context"":""https:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""ImageObject"",""url"":""\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/11\/bingx.png""},""review"":{""@context"":""https:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""Review"",""author"":{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""George Georgiev""},""reviewRating"":{""@context"":""https:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""Rating"",""ratingValue"":4.7,""bestRating"":5,""worstRating"":0}}} Company Background and Reputation BingX was founded back in 2018 by Josh Lu and has since then grown to become a globally-recognized cryptocurrency exchange offering a full suite of trading and Web3-oriented tooling. The platform serves a relatively wide user base of more than 20 million users worldwide, according to the official website. Over the years, BingX has expanded its offering beyond traditional spot crypto trading. It now offers derivatives (futures), social trading via copy trading products, as well as a range of different tools oriented at different trader profiles, spanning from novice to advanced users. In 2024, it gained additional visibility through a massive sports sponsorship of the Football behemoth Chelsea FC. Earlier in 2025, the exchange also committed to invest $300 million in developing AI-powered trading and product tools, which is a signals for their desire to stay ahead technologically. In short, BingX has rapidly become a major, ambitious exchange with a global reach and a broad portfolio of service offerings, frequently being featured in CoinMarketCap’s top 10 exchanges by trading volume in both derivatives and spot markets. Supported Markets, Products, and Access BingX has positioned itself as a multi-market trading platform. In simple terms, this means that it has a broad range of crypto products. After testing it myself, here’s what I found out. Spot Trading Markets BingX supports hundreds of cryptocurrencies. Of course, this includes major assets such as BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, ADA, and all of the popular altcoins. The spot selection is clearly extensive and it’s well-suited for beginners and general investors. In addition, BingX expands this selection regularly. In terms of liquidity, as it is with the majority of exchanges, it is the strongest on major pairs. Long-tail assets have thinner books compared to some of the giant exchanges, but this is quite standard and I honestly didn’t expect anything else. Futures & Derivatives The futures trading environment has been passed as one of BingX’s core strengths, so I was curious to see if it would live up to the hype. Now, BingX supports USDT-M perpetual contracts, coin-margined futures, as well as a constantly growing roster of derivatives pairs. Notably, the exchange offers standard futures on multiple cryptocurrencies, which is a refreshing change of pace and something that we don’t see very often outside of the larger exchanges. The leverage options are very competitive, and so are the spreads. In my testing, I found that the derivatives engine feels stable and responsive, even during periods of relatively heightened market volatility. Other Supported Products Some of the remaining products of BingX, that I will look into the following section include: Copy Trading & Social Trading Grid Trading Bots Dual Investment Products Standard Staking & Earning Tools Core Features and Platform Functionality As I mentioned above, BingX seems to have turned into a feature-rich platform that tries to balance advanced trading capabilities with more accessible tools. At some things, they’ve yet to improve, while at others, they already do an excellent job. Let’s take a look. Copy Trading & Social Trading I have always had mixed feelings about copy trading, and I wouldn’t necessary recommend it for reasons that go beyond this review. However, if that’s the thing you’re into, BingX has a lot to offer on the social trading front. You can choose from copying popular and successful traders, as well as certain AI models – a concept that’s growing in popularity recently. That said, here’s what the copy trading interface looks like: They have done a good job with their explainer guides and adjacent products. Their AI-oriented copy-trading solution looks like this: Now, I’m sure there are plenty of disclaimers somewhere that we can access to find out all details and risks associated with the AI trading battle, but I didn’t see them clearly stated on the page, which is something I would have appreciated. Grid Trading Bots and Automation If you’re into automation, which seems to be the talk of the town in 2025, BingX has you covered. It has grid trading bots for both spot and derivatives. In addition, there are AI-enhanced bots, as well as strategy templates that you can use. These tools are very easy to use and deploy, even if you have no prior experience with it. However, if that’s the case, I would strongly suggest that you do some testing first before starting to use real capital. You won’t have to write code, don’t worry. Dual Investment Products These might be complicated for beginners, but I will try to break them down. In essence, it’s sort of an options trading tool, which allows you to earn a premium on your investment, regardless of where the price is going to go. Of course, there’s a catch. Let me try to give you an example. Here is what the interface looks like: So, in this specific case, you want to buy BTC lower than its current price. At the time of this snapshot, Bitcoin was trading at $91,600, but as you can see, we put an order to buy it at $91,500 and the system will act is if that’s true. So, you buy $1000 worth of BTC at $91,500 (regardless of current price) and you earn a premium on your investment at a rate of 260% APR for 22 hours. In 22 hours, the contract will expire, and depending on the BTC price, you will receive: If BTC > $91,500, you will get your investment + your premium back (e.g. $1006). If BTC In both cases, you get your premium, but depending on the price at settlement, you either get your USDT or its equivalent in BTC. The risks are obvious – if the price deviates too much in the opposite direction, you will be left holding a more expensive asset. On the other hand, if the price goes in your direction but the increase is larger than your premium, you would have incurred opportunity cost. This is the ideal product for users looking to earn a premium on their unused stablecoins and don’t mind buying BTC (or other cryptocurrency) at the predetermined price. For example, if you are happy to buy BTC at $91,500, knowing that it might go down – this is a great product because you will get the entry plus the premium on your investment. Standard Earn and Staking Beyond that, standard earn & staking opportunities are also available. These are relatively standard across the industry and provide very accessible ways for users to generate yield. Of course, the returns are going to vary based on asset and lock-up period. Fees, Costs, and Incentives BingX has positioned itself as an exchange with competitive trading fees, especially when it comes to the futures market. I did review its fees and paired it against some of the larger exchanges, and I found the fee structure to be quite transparent, so let’s take a look. Spot Trading Fees Spot trading fees are as seen in the table: For VIP level 0, the fees start at 0.1%, which is right on par with Binance. The higher your VIP level, the lower fees you pay. Futures Trading Fees For futures trading, this is what the fee structure looks like: Again, it’s pretty comparable to those of Binance, although it’s worth noting that Binance has more competitive fees at the highest levels. But you would only be concerned about this if your turnover is over $1 billion. Costs In terms of hidden costs, the most important thing to consider is the spread. This is the difference between your set order price and your execute order price. For example, if you set a limit order to buy BTC at $100,000, but the price drops down quicker and there was no liquidity at $100,000 to fill your order, you might receive a fill at lower rates, which could be a problem if you are using this as a stop-loss for example. Now, BingX has very solid liquidity for the larger markets and the spreads are very competitive. However, when it comes to thinner markets for more obscure altcoins, you have to keep in mind that the spreads are larger. Naturally, this is present across most cryptocurrency exchanges, but it’s often a point that is overlooked in educational resources. Incentives To counter the above point, BingX is doing really well on the incentives side and they are constantly running some sort of promotions. For example, at the time of this review, there is a promotion for 0% maker and taker fees on a number of spot markets. Security, Compliance, and Risk Management Undoubtedly, security is amongst the first points of assessment when evaluating any crypto exchange. The first thing I will say is that BingX has never been hacked and it supports all of the standard account-level security features, including end-to-end encrypted connection, two-factor authentication, separate trading accounts for different products, and more. It also has Proof of Reserves, which is notable for any exchange that claims to be reliable. Regulatory Status and Licensing Although it’s positioning itself as an international and global exchange, BingX doesn’t operate in the UK, the United States, or Canada. There are other restricted countries, but these are the most important jurisdictions out of it. Don’t get me wrong, this is nothing out of the blue – many exchanges don’t operate there because of the regulatory hurdles, so it’s quite common. I believe BingX is reasonably secure, using industry-standard protection methods. It’s important to note that there are exchanges that place greater focus on licensing. User Experience and Customer Support The overall user experience on BingX is excellent, at least in my experience. The tools are easy to locate and to operate, and it doesn’t feel like I need to get used to the otherwise very extensive tooling and feature-rich product set that it has to offer. This is good. The experience feels familiar and if you’ve used other centralized exchanges, chances are that you will find some things that work in comparatively similar manner. At the same time, BingX is rated 1.8 out of 5 on Trustpilot for its customer service, with many negative reviews. At first, this may seem off-putting, until you compare all the other exchanges as well. Binance has a score of 1.4, for example. In most of the cases, users are not incentivized to leave a positive review, where their frustration with certain matters almost always results in a bad review. BingX Pros and Cons Pros: Wide selection of spot, futures, and automated trading tools. Industry-leading copy trading with strong social features. Competitive futures fees and reliable execution. Beginner-friendly mobile app and intuitive UI. Demo trading mode for safe practice. Cons: Limited regulatory oversight in major jurisdictions. Not available to U.S. users. Final Verdict and Recommendations After using Bingx for a fair amount of time, I have to say that I am left content with the majority of its features, including spot and futures trading, which I gues matters most to the majority of users. Its biggest strength, however, is the overall wide selection of retail-oriented audience such as the copy-trading ecosystem, which remains one of the most accessible and feature-rich in the industry. That said, Bingx does come with some trade-offs. The limited regulatory coverage in certain jurisdictions such as the US and the UK could deter some users, but that’s not that uncommon. Overall, I believe BingX to be a very strong choice for traders who seek easy-to-use and feature rich platform. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is BingX a regulated exchange?

The analyst used a 12-month chart and pointed to a cup-and-handle pattern on the asset’s chart. The chart shows a rounded base formed over several years, followed by a smaller pullback that sits on top of the structure. The setup creates a defined support zone and a clear range of upside targets. XRP, Yearly Candles formed the CUP & Handle. The pattern is waiting for further Surge. Supports: $1.88, $2.10 Targets: $5.85, $18.22, $36.76 NFA pic.twitter.com/322ErxWzCG — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) November 26, 2025 XRP’s Long-Term Structure XRP has moved through phases of expansion and retracement since 2014. The chart shows a steep rise in 2017 followed by a decline. This move began the cup-and-handle pattern and shaped the left side of the cup. The price then shifted into a multi-year accumulation phase. This phase created the rounded structure that completes the base of the cup. The right side formed as XRP recovered and reached the neckline level again. The handle formed as the asset pulled back from that neckline. This move began after its 2021 peak . The asset experienced a prolonged downturn in the following years. However, it took a different turn in late 2024 when it rose by over 500%. The analyst included support levels at $1.88 and $2.1. These levels sit near the neckline at $1.90. They serve as areas where buyers may attempt to hold the trend. The current yearly candle shows XRP sitting just above the neckline, preparing for a massive rally. XRP Targets Based on the Cup Depth The measurements in the chart use Fibonacci extensions tied to the depth of the cup. The image marks the cup depth with a vertical white arrow, and those measurements anchor the projected price levels. The targets are $5.85 (Fib. 261.8%), $18.22 (Fib. 361.8%), and $36.76 (Fib. 423.6%). The setup suggests that a confirmed move above the neckline could activate those targets. Meanwhile, Dark Defender has previously set $5.85 and $18.22 for XRP. His analysis reaffirms these predictions and has inspired confidence in many market participants.

XRP’s performance has remained within a controlled range for several years. This supports the interpretation of a long consolidation . At the time of his analysis, XRP traded at $2.1. The digital asset is above the neckline, and the analyst noted that the pattern is waiting for another surge. If Dark Defender’s analysis is correct, XRP could reach double digits soon. The pattern remains intact on the 12-month timeframe, and traders are watching to see where XRP goes next. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $5.02. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.5124 Market cap $548.90M Trading volume (24-hour) $27.27M Circulating supply 1.065B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.5179 24-hour low $0.4926 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.71% (High) 50-day SMA $0.5800 14-Day RSI 39.73 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 22 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-day SMA $0.7078 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is stabilizing well above $0.45 and now grinding upward near $0.51–$0.515. A breakout requires a daily close above $0.54–$0.55. Although some accumulation has occurred, the volume is not yet substantial. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart As seen on the 1-day price chart for November 27, XTZ appears to be stabilising and recovering some gains after reaching a low of $0.4526. The last several candlesticks show signs of accumulation; however, the mid-bollinger band at $0.5482 might cap upside movement in the short term. The RSI at 39.84 continues to sit in a bearish-neutral zone but has flattened, which aligns with the market’s attempt to carve out a bottom XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD indicator is still in the red, but its tightening histogram reflects fading downside momentum. Buyers still lack the thrust needed for a more aggressive rally. For now, XTZ is in a controlled recovery phase but capped by overhead resistance until a daily close above $0.54–$0.55 materializes. Failure to push through that zone risks a retest of $0.49–$0.50, where demand recently stepped in. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, XTZ holds firmly above the Alligator’s lips, teeth, and jaw, a constructive positioning that shows buyers are in control on the shorter timeframe. The recent sequence of green candles forming from $0.505 to $0.515 signals active accumulation, not just passive drifting. Yet the candles near $0.5145 show signs of stalling. The wicks indicate mild selling pressure at the current intraday top. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The Price Volume Trend indicator sits at 56.21M and has stabilized, but OBV remains slightly depressed at 345M, which confirms that while buyers are present, volume has not yet surged in a way that typically accompanies a breakout. This hints that XTZ might consolidate around $0.51–$0.515 before attempting another leg toward $0.52 and beyond.

XTZ is in a controlled early recovery phase, but unless it breaks $0.55 with stronger volume, expect steady but choppy movement between $0.50 and $0.54. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $1.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos XTZ holders on Revolut to earn 100% delegation rewards.

He made this request after pleading guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud in August, thereby avoiding a trial following his extradition from Montenegro. Notably, Montenegro is where authorities had arrested and convicted Kwon for using a fake passport while fleeing charges in South Korea. Kwon’s defense team urges court to consider reducing his prison sentence *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:a99a1f42-721e-40f6-93e3-d6f186af3bd3-4"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-10"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> In a sentencing recommendation filed Wednesday, November 26, Kwon’s lawyers argued that while prosecutors agreed not to seek more than 12 years under his plea deal, even that term exceeds what is necessary for justice. His defense team argued that Kwon had already served almost three years in jail, with more than half of this time spent under severe conditions in Montenegro. They also noted that Terraform’s co-founder already suffered repercussions for his actions. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Kwon had also agreed to relinquish over $19 million and certain properties as part of the plea agreement. As they await the judge’s consideration of their argument, the lawyers reminded the court that their client is still on trial in South Korea on similar charges, where prosecutors are seeking a 40-year prison sentence. Reports indicated that Kwon’s sentencing is scheduled for December 11 and will be conducted by Paul Adam Engelmayer, an American lawyer and jurist serving as a United States District Judge of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Before then, the government is required to present its own sentencing recommendation soon. Following his decision to confess to his guilt, Kwon read from a prepared statement acknowledging that he had willingly collaborated with others to deceive Terraform Labs’s cryptocurrency buyers and had ultimately defrauded them. “What I did was wrong, and I want to apologize for my actions. I accept full responsibility,” he added. Terraform’s TerraUSD collapses due to a fraud incident Regarding the collapse of Terraform’s TerraUSD, reports noted that this collapse was significant, leading to major disruptions in the crypto market in spring 2022. It also resulted in the downfall of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Kwon’s guilty plea halted a trial scheduled for next year before US District Judge Engelmayer. The court decided to charge him in 2023 and sent him to the US in January. To serve as a warning to any individual with such a motive, US prosecutors implied that they would aim for a maximum sentence of 12 years in this plea deal. Under US law, the highest penalties for conspiracy are five years, and for wire fraud are twenty years. Initially, the 33-year-old encountered a total of nine charges. The US court ruled that once he completed half of his sentence, he would be allowed to finish the remaining agreed-upon time in prison in South Korea. However, this only applied as long as he strictly adhered to the rules of his plea agreement and met the requirements for a transfer program. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit in 2024 alleging that Terraform and Kwon, who owned 92% of the company, committed civil fraud. This led to a two-week trial in New York, during which a jury concluded that Kwon and Terraform had deceived investors. Following this information, analysts noted that this outcome is a bad sign for Kwon’s chance of winning against criminal charges.

The exec pointed to a sharp rise in perpetual futures trading that has reshaped market behavior. Bitcoin OI Hits Fivefold 2021 Levels In a post on X, Wedson explained that perpetual trading activity has “exploded,” as traders, funds, and high-frequency desks are increasingly opting for leverage over spot exposure. He said leveraged activity tends to surge during periods of increased volatility, particularly during large market drops. This shift is also visible in open interest (OI), which reached an October peak nearly five times higher than levels seen at Bitcoin’s November 2021 all-time high. Such a pattern indicates traders’ focus on securing rapid gains through high-risk leverage. Wedson added that the distribution of OI across exchanges shows how aggressively platforms have promoted leveraged products. He even went on to note that BitMEX, which controlled 90% of the market in 2017, now holds just 0.65%, while newer exchanges dominate the landscape. Binance, for one, accounts for 30% of the market, followed by Bybit at 16.7%. Wedson also revealed that Alphractal’s model on current long-short positioning shows longs at 72.4% (worth around $25.72 billion) and shorts at 27.6% (worth around $9.79 billion). He said trader exposure is tilted 2.6 times more toward longs, despite historical trends showing short sellers often having better odds of profit. Wedson described the positioning as “strange,” but noted that extreme leverage helps explain the imbalance, with Bitcoin spending more time rising while leveraged longs remain vulnerable to rapid wipeouts. BTC’s $91K Breakout Bitcoin broke above the $91,000 mark on Thursday after rising by nearly 5% amidst a broader market rebound and is now trending higher. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, the crypto asset is approaching resistance between $93,000 and $94,000, and a successful reclaim could push the asset toward $100,000. However, he warned that failure to reclaim this resistance may trigger a short-term correction, which could potentially drive BTC back down toward the $88,000 level. Another market commentator, “Captain Faibik,” observed that Bitcoin is forming a Descending Broadening Wedge on the 4-hour chart. The pseudonymous trader said that BTC has likely bottomed out, but bulls must reclaim the $100,000 resistance level to restore strong upward momentum. He added that a break above $100,000 could trigger a solid bullish rally in December.

Coinbase Ventures 2026 Focus Areas. Source: Tim Haldorsson on X The firm highlighted real-world asset perpetual markets, describing the trend as the “perpification of everything.” At the same time, it pointed to alternative, prop-focused automated market makers and prediction market trading terminals as part of a broader push into specialized exchanges and new trading tools. Next, Coinbase Ventures emphasized composable perpetual markets and unsecured on-chain credit, signaling a focus on lending models that do not rely on traditional collateral. It also named on-chain privacy and proof-of-humanity frameworks as priorities, saying decentralized finance will increasingly mix with identity and privacy tools. Later, the firm added robotics data captured through DePIN incentives and AI agents for on-chain development, security and smart-contract engineering, expanding its thesis to machine and robotics data pipelines tied to blockchain. Bitcoin Funding Shows Fading Sell Pressure on Coinbase Coinbase premium for Bitcoin is returning while funding rates on major futures venues have turned negative, according to Daan Crypto Trades, signaling easing spot selling pressure after weeks of heavy outflows. Bitcoin Funding Coinbase Premium Chart. Source: Daan Crypto Trades “ Spot selling pressure is easing significantly compared to the 2 weeks prior, ” the analyst wrote on X. He said sell intensity is fading when measured against the pressure that dominated exchange books earlier this month. He cautioned that the shift alone is not enough to move price. “You'll obviously still need to see actual bid to move price,” he wrote, adding that earlier sell pressure was so strong that “no bid could withstand that.” On a 4-hour BTC/USDT chart from Binance Futures, Bitcoin trades near the 91,339 dollar level after a sharp drop from November highs.

The recent revelation that CalSTRS holds $80 million in MicroStrategy stock represents a significant milestone in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This strategic CalSTRS investment demonstrates how major pension funds are positioning themselves for the digital asset revolution. Why Is the CalSTRS Investment in MicroStrategy So Important? As the third-largest pension fund in the United States, CalSTRS manages retirement assets for nearly one million California educators. Their investment decisions carry enormous weight and influence institutional investment trends. The $80 million CalSTRS investment in MicroStrategy isn’t just about stock ownership—it’s about indirect Bitcoin exposure through one of corporate America’s most vocal crypto advocates. MicroStrategy has become famous for its massive Bitcoin treasury holdings. Therefore, when CalSTRS invests in MSTR stock, they’re effectively gaining exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This approach allows traditional institutions to participate in crypto markets while navigating regulatory frameworks they understand. How Does This CalSTRS Investment Impact Bitcoin Adoption? The CalSTRS investment signals a crucial shift in how large institutions view digital assets. Pension funds typically follow conservative investment strategies focused on long-term stability. Their involvement suggests that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exposure are becoming mainstream investment considerations. Consider these key implications of the CalSTRS investment strategy: Validation – Major pension funds now see crypto exposure as legitimate Accessibility – Traditional investors can gain Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles Trendsetting – Other pension funds may follow CalSTRS’ lead Market impact – Institutional money brings stability and liquidity What Challenges Does This CalSTRS Investment Face? While the CalSTRS investment represents progress, it also comes with unique challenges. MicroStrategy’s stock performance remains closely tied to Bitcoin price movements, creating volatility that pension funds typically avoid. However, the CalSTRS investment team appears confident that the long-term potential outweighs short-term fluctuations. Moreover, regulatory uncertainty continues to impact institutional crypto investments. The CalSTRS investment approach through MicroStrategy stock provides a workaround that complies with existing investment guidelines while still gaining cryptocurrency exposure. What Can Other Investors Learn From This CalSTRS Move? The CalSTRS investment offers valuable lessons for both institutional and individual investors. First, it demonstrates that there are multiple paths to gain cryptocurrency exposure beyond direct ownership. Second, it shows that even conservative institutions recognize the importance of digital assets in modern portfolios. Key takeaways from the CalSTRS investment strategy include: Diversified approach – Consider indirect exposure through companies like MicroStrategy Long-term perspective – Pension funds think in decades, not days Risk management – Balance innovation with established investment principles Trend awareness – Monitor how major institutions position themselves Conclusion: The Future of Institutional Crypto Investment The $80 million CalSTRS investment in MicroStrategy marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency adoption. It demonstrates that sophisticated institutional investors recognize the value of Bitcoin exposure and have found creative ways to incorporate it into their portfolios. As more traditional funds follow this CalSTRS investment model, we can expect increased stability and legitimacy in crypto markets. Frequently Asked Questions How much MicroStrategy stock does CalSTRS own? CalSTRS holds 448,000 shares of MicroStrategy stock valued at approximately $80 million according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Why would CalSTRS invest in MicroStrategy instead of buying Bitcoin directly? Investing in MicroStrategy stock allows CalSTRS to gain Bitcoin exposure through a regulated, traditional investment vehicle while navigating their established investment guidelines and regulatory framework. What percentage of CalSTRS’ portfolio is this investment? While the $80 million investment sounds substantial, it represents a small fraction of CalSTRS’ nearly $300 billion total portfolio, demonstrating a measured approach to crypto exposure. How does this investment benefit California teachers? As a pension fund, CalSTRS’ investment decisions aim to generate returns that fund retirement benefits for nearly one million California educators and their families. Are other pension funds making similar investments? While specific investments vary, many institutional investors are exploring cryptocurrency exposure through various channels, with CalSTRS being one of the most prominent examples. What risks does this investment carry? The primary risks include Bitcoin price volatility affecting MicroStrategy’s stock value and regulatory changes that could impact cryptocurrency-related investments.

A four-year trendline flip, a key barrier near 91,000 dollars, and a weekly hidden bullish divergence together suggest the current cycle may still have room to run. BTC Reclaims 4-Year Trendline as Support Bitcoin has returned to a four-year trendline that previously acted as major resistance on the weekly BTC/USDT chart. Bitcoin 1W Multi-Year Trendline Hold. Source: TradingView / X The chart shows price holding near the diagonal line that capped rallies in 2021 and 2022 and later guided the advance into the 2024–2025 highs. Recent candles sit just above this level, marked as macro support, after the latest pullback. Crypto analyst @ardizor highlighted the move on X, writing that “$BTC is back on the 4-year trendline” and that “resistance finally turned support.” He described the structure as “mega bullish longterm,” pointing to the trendline hold as a signal that the broader uptrend remains in place despite recent volatility. Analyst Says Bitcoin Near Crucial Resistance With Path to $100K Bitcoin is approaching a key resistance zone that could reopen a path to $100,000 if it breaks, according to trader Michaël van de Poppe. His latest BTC/USDT chart shows price pushing into the first “crucial resistance zone” after a sharp rebound from recent lows. Bitcoin Crucial Resistance Zone Near $91K. Source: Michaël van de Poppe Van de Poppe wrote that he views the move as a “pretty strong bounce upwards” but wants to see consolidation below resistance before any breakout. In his view, a clean move through this band would signal that downside pressure is fading and that the market trend is turning back upward. He added that a retest near $88,000 would not surprise him and could still fit a constructive structure. However, he said that if the current level holds and breaks higher, the odds increase that Bitcoin has already set its cycle low. “The cycle is far from over,” he concluded. Bitcoin Shows Weekly Hidden Bullish Divergence, Analyst Says Meanwhile, Bitcoin printed a hidden weekly bullish divergence on the one-week BTC/USD index chart, analyst Cas Abbé wrote on X.

Those prior bounces, marked on the lower momentum pane, weakened temporarily yet did not invalidate the directional sequence that resumed afterward.

BitFuFu's Q3 revenue doubled YoY, driven by cloud mining and a surge in mining equipment sales, with net profit reversing last year's loss. The company's capital-light, flexible model and high customer retention rate position FUFU to capitalize on industry downturns and future upcycles. Compared to peers, FUFU's recurring, contract-driven revenue offers more stability than rivals chasing spot Bitcoin gains; I remain bullish pending Q4 results. As someone who started investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ) as early as 2018, I’ve witnessed its price crash from around $20k to $3k, only to see it surge past $50k a few years later. That experience taught me that volatility is part of the journey, not the end of it. So I’m not worried about the recent selloff; in fact, I see it as another opportunity to buy the dip. Of course, for newcomers to the crypto world, this kind of steep drop can look terrifying. But long-time investors like me know that Bitcoin selloffs don’t just create fear; they create opportunities. When prices fall and weaker miners scale back, the smartest operators seize the moment to buy cheap power, deploy rigs, and secure customers. In other words, when coin prices drop, infrastructure players build for the long run. I wrote about BitFuFu (FUFU) a while back, and it seems the share price did go up after my analysis, but unfortunately it went down recently following the industry-wide selloffs. What I want to highlight today is I am still bullish about the company given its focus on cloud mining and better than expected Q3 earnings. What is cloud mining? Cloud mining allows people to participate in BTC mining without owning or maintaining any physical equipment. Of course you can buy mining machines at home, but they are very expensive and need constant upgrades or maintenance and consume a huge amount of electricity. Unless you live in an area with extremely low-power costs, mining from a home setup usually isn’t worth it. So instead of buying and running your own rigs, you rent mining power (hashrate) from providers like BitFuFu. The provider operates large-scale mining farms in a very low-cost electricity area and allocates a portion of its computing power to each customer, who then earns Bitcoin proportional to their contract size. Another question I often get is whether the demand for cloud mining dries up when Bitcoin’s price drops. The answer, surprisingly, is no. If you look at BitFuFu’s historical performance, you’ll notice that even during bear markets, its cloud mining business has continued to grow and remain profitable. Why? Because when prices fall, long-term believers don’t disappear — they double down. Many investors view price dips as opportunities to accumulate Bitcoin, and cloud mining offers a simple, low-friction way to keep earning BTC without additional setup costs. In down markets, the number of people buying mining contracts often increases because they see it as a way to “mine the dip” — to accumulate Bitcoin at lower costs while waiting for the next up cycle. Q3 Earnings In Q3’25, BitFuFu reported total revenue of $180.7 million, doubling YoY. The key driver was its cloud-mining business, which generated $122.9 million, up 78% from the same period a year earlier. Another line of business, which I honestly didn’t know they had, is mining equipment sales, and apparently this segment jumped from less than $1 million to $35.8 million this quarter. That shows strong institutional and retail demand for hardware, which is a leading indicator that investors are quietly expanding infrastructure in anticipation of the next upcycle. Self-mining revenue dipped slightly to $20.1 million. According to the earnings report, that is due to higher network difficulty, and the company reallocated part of its hash rate from self-mining to its more profitable cloud-mining contracts. I think this move is a very smart, adaptive move that optimizes returns without overexposing itself to market volatility. Like the company CEO said so in the earnings call, ""Collecting service fees upfront improves cash flow and creates revenue visibility through orders, which greatly mitigates the uncertainty caused by Bitcoin's price volatility."" In an environment where many miners are struggling with rising hash difficulty and shrinking margins, this kind of topline growth is pretty impressive. One caveat, though, is that Q3 earnings only cover results up to September, so they may not capture the recent Bitcoin drop. I’ll be watching the Q4 report to see if this trend holds. On the bottom line, BitFuFu delivered a net profit of $11.6 million, a sharp reversal from a $5 million loss in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA jumped nearly fourfold to $22.1 million, reflecting both higher gross margins and disciplined cost management. These aren’t just accounting wins. It shows that the company has turned topline growth into real profit. That's something a lot of miners struggle to do, like Bitdeer (BTDR), which we will discuss further later. The balance sheet looks solid as well. As of Q3'25, BitFuFu held $254.8 million in cash and digital assets, up from $168.1 million at the end of 2024. Having that kind of cash cushion matters in a choppy market like right now. That liquidity gives the company flexibility to keep expanding capacity. Another key metric worth noting is the company’s retention rate of 118.8%. Just to give some context: in the SaaS world, any business with a retention rate above 100% is considered strong, because it means existing customers are not only staying but also spending more. This kind of expansion rate signals PMF (product-market fit) and customer satisfaction. It’s rare to see that kind of stickiness in the mining industry, where churn is usually high. One more thing I don’t think the market fully appreciates is their asset-light setup. On their latest call, management said they run their own mining facility, but they also work with partners and use their mining facilities and power resources. The key idea is, in their words, they can “access and deploy significantly more hash rate with limited capital outlay.” It’s a more flexible way to grow, especially in a bear market. Honestly, I think that is super smart, especially right now when the whole sector is cooling down. If BitFuFu wants to hit their 1 GW hash rate goal, now could actually be the best time to pick up assets and cheap power deals because prices are down in this bear market. Sometimes the best opportunities show up when everyone else is just trying to survive. But here is the bigger point. The core of cloud mining is about reliability. If you are building long term contracts with big institutional clients, what matters is not all the hype during the bull market. It is being able to deliver a stable and predictable hash rate for years. That is what keeps customers coming back, hence the high retention rate mentioned earlier, and that is what helps a company look past the short-term noise. I think BitFuFu understands this, and their approach puts them in a strong spot to benefit from this down cycle. Comparative analysis I went through three companies Q3 earnings reports, and it’s clear that not all infrastructure players operate in the same way. Riot Platforms (RIOT) is a pure self-mining play. Its entire business model revolves around owning and operating massive mining facilities in Texas. Riot reported Q3’25 revenue of around $180 million and net income of $104.5 million. Its profit is highly correlated with BTC price. Bitdeer Technologies (BTDR), on the other hand, operates a model that looks much closer to BitFuFu’s. Bitdeer runs both cloud mining solutions and self-mining, with an additional hosting and data center business. In its Q3 '25 results, Bitdeer reported total revenue of $169.7 million, up 174% YoY, showing remarkable topline momentum. However, even though Bitdeer revenue went up 174% YoY, it recorded a net loss of $266.7 million in Q3'25, compared with a loss of US$50.1 million in Q3'24, a substantial widening of losses! Also, what’s interesting is that Bitdeer’s strategy during the quarter was to lean into direct mining profits rather than growing the cloud-mining side. Cloud mining business fell to nearly zero during the quarter. This raises a real question: if you can't stay profitable when Bitcoin was at its all-time high and now that Bitcoin prices have turned downward, what happens to their bottom line in Q4? I believe BitFuFu's Q4 bottom line could come under even heavier pressure unless Bitcoin prices rebound or the company rebalances toward more stable revenue streams, like cloud mining. But it seems they have stopped the cloud mining business. Will big clients still come back? It's hard to tell. Hut 8 (HUT) is at an interesting transitional state. The company is evolving from a pure miner into a more diversified computing platform, such as offering GPU services, not solely mining-hash rental. From a cloud mining perspective, Bitdeer is the best comp to BitFuFu in terms of scale and business design. Both have the capacity, customer base, and brand credibility to dominate the hash-rate rental market. The difference lies in execution: BitFuFu continues to double down on cloud-mining growth even in choppy markets. Bitdeer, at least in this quarter, pivoted capacity back to self-mining, capturing short-term BTC gains but reducing the contract-driven recurring revenue that defines cloud mining’s stability. That contrast actually strengthens BitFuFu’s position in my eyes. In a bear market like where we are right now, I’d rather own the company that’s expanding its recurring, customer-based revenue than one that’s chasing the spot price of Bitcoin. Risks Right now, BitFuFu’s cloud-mining model is definitely more defensive than running big self-mining operations, thanks to its stable, contract-based income. But it’s not risk-free. If Bitcoin keeps sliding, margins across the board get squeezed, and even cloud-mining fees could take a hit as customers rethink ROI. There’s also the question of whether BitFuFu can actually lock in cheap power deals and good assets while the market is weak. Downturns are usually the best time to pick up bargains, but they’re also when other players are hunting for the same distressed opportunities. Conclusion Like Warren Buffett used to say, when the tide goes out, you see who’s been swimming naked. When the market turns bearish, we see which businesses were built on leverage and which ones are on real operational strength. One caveat, as I mentioned earlier, is that the Q3 earnings only cover results through September and don’t capture the latest Bitcoin sell-off. I’ll be watching the Q4 report closely, and if this trend of resilience and disciplined growth continues, I plan to increase my position.",BTDR|RIOT|BTC|FUFU,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-27 13:28:06

The ongoing downward trend has hampered several crucial on-chain metrics, as they begin to turn highly negative once again, painting a highly volatile market state. A Sign Of Fading Strength In The Bitcoin Market Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics are starting to decline alongside the ongoing pullback in the price of BTC . In a sudden shift, Bitcoin’s once-confident stride has taken on a softer, more cautious pace as the leading cryptocurrency asset experienced a notable drop in the key Sharpe Ratio metric. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform, reported this drop in the metric, which signals a less efficient market in the short term. The drop in Sharpe Ratio is the kind of shift that does not scream, but rustles. For those tracking the market through a professional lens, Alphractal highlighted that the drop in the annualized Sharpe Ratio is an important signal to gauge the next possible market direction . BTC’s Sharpe Ratio is a metric that measures risk-adjusted performance, which is essentially how much return BTC is generating for each unit of volatility. According to the on-chain data platform, a drop in this major indicator suggests that the market has lost its efficiency, aligning with the current state of the market. Several key factors have been outlined by the platform to be responsible for this decline in the Sharpe Ratio metric. The first factor is the spike in volatility after a sequence of rapid sell-offs from big and small investors. Presently, half of the 12-month accumulated returns on BTC positions have been cleared. Furthermore, a rise in systematic risk is weakening the quality of the trend, and aggressive movements from whales and leveraged traders have increased uncertainty in the market. Historic Data Points To More Bearish Period Based on past scenarios, this recent drop could trigger more volatility in the market. Alphractal highlighted that the same signal was observed in 2019, at the peak of 2021, and during the 2022 capitulation , all of which led to more challenging periods in the short to medium term. This is a typical indication of Bitcoin entering prolonged sideways phases when the Sharpe Ratio experiences a decline. During the period, BTC faces additional corrections, and the flagship asset takes longer to regain trend efficiency. However, there is a good story underneath this current trend. Once risk is repriced and the market reorganizes, Alphractal noted that significant bull cycles have always followed these resets. In the short term, this signal appears to be bearish, while in the long term, it continues to be a natural part of building new cycles. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was trading at $91,388, indicating a more than 4% increase in the past day.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|sharpe ratio,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-27 13:30:06

The change to a higher limit is meant to allow institutional traders and market makers to establish larger positions, thereby increasing market depth and liquidity for the product. Nasdaq ISE requests exemption to eliminate limits entirely The filing also requested an exemption to eliminate limits for customized “FLEX” options that are physically delivered. According to the filing, this move would “align IBIT with other major commodity-based ETFs and help pull trading activity away from opaque over-the-counter markets.” As a key factor supporting the change, Nasdaq highlighted IBIT’s market capitalization of $86.2 billion and an average daily volume of 44.6 million shares as of September 22, 2025. BlackRock holds over $71 billion in Bitcoin. The increased options limit would allow roughly $5.3 billion, representing about 8% of that total value, which is a standard, conservative practice for large ETFs The ISE proposal is subject to SEC approval, and the public comment period runs until December 17, 2025. “IBIT is now the biggest bitcoin options market in the world by open interest,” Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, stated. Additionally, Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest Advisors stated, “At last, IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves. Institutional vol is finally here.” Meanwhile, BlackRock continues to accumulate Bitcoin exposure in its in-house funds. A separate Wednesday filing revealed its Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio increased its IBIT holdings by 14% in Q3 to $155.8 million. Investors stick around even after IBIT records monthly outflows The proposal coincides with over 2 billion monthly IBIT outflows . On-chain data shows the same wallet has fallen from a $117 billion peak to $78.4 billion, losing more than 30% of its value over the past month. “…After months of steady inflows, the outflows reflect rising caution as Bitcoin falls ~22% over the past month and 7% year-to-date,” wrote Walter Bloomberg. However, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pushed back on the panic, stating that the majority of investors are sticking around despite the outflows. He also highlighted the collapse in short interest, ascribing plummeting IBIT short interest to traders who tend to short into strength and cover in downturns. This take was supported by trading records from last week, which surpassed $40.32 billion across the 11 US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s IBIT led the industry with $27.79 billion in trading volume, accounting for nearly 70% of the total, according to data source SoSoValue. iShares Bitcoin Trust. Sources: Sosovalue Meanwhile, on November 26, IBIT had a 1-day inflow of $42.82 million, while its cumulative inflow remains extremely large at $9.98 billion. This indicates strong long-term demand. However, daily flows have been smaller recently. The fund’s net assets stand at $33.5 billion, and it is currently holding about 665.5K BTC. The premium/discount is 0.05%, meaning IBIT is trading almost exactly in line with the real Bitcoin price, with no major gap. The orange line on the chart is Bitcoin’s price trend, while the blue bars represent daily inflows/outflows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has risen back to the $90k threshold. According to Coinmarketcap, the coin is up 5% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $91,254. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Many traders are now looking for coins that reward them while they hold, and staking tokens have become a clear way to build steady gains during a slow market. A few projects already show strong activity as top crypto investments , and one newer entry, Noomez ($NNZ), is starting to stand out as more buyers look for staking setups that offer real growth alongside long-term incentives. Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2025: Top Staking Picks to Watch 1. Noomez ($NNZ) Noomez enters the ranking of the best crypto investment today as a rising staking-focused token that has gained strong momentum in its early stages. The presale is already live and currently in Stage 5 , priced at $0.0000230 , and the structure increases the price at every stage, which pushes buyers to secure entries earlier. Its staking setup rewards every holder with transparent distribution shown through a live dashboard, and partner projects feed new rewards into the Noom Engine . The deflationary design includes automatic burns at the end of each stage, tightening supply as demand grows. Because each stage is limited, traders are moving fast while Stage 5 is still open. The system makes $NNZ appealing for staking-focused investors who want a token that grows stronger with activity and offers increasing pressure as it progresses. 2. Ethereum ($ETH) Ethereum remains the largest staking asset in crypto and still dominates validator demand going into 2026. The price sits around $2,952.40 with a daily range between $2,862.84 and $2,973.89 . Its market cap stands at $356.4B with more than $23B in 24-hour trading volume, showing how active the network remains even during slow market periods. ETH’s circulating supply is 120.6M , and since the shift to Proof of Stake , staking rewards have become a key driver for long-term holders. Millions of ETH continue to be locked in validators, giving the asset predictable demand from both retail and institutions. 3. Solana ($SOL) Solana continues to attract buyers thanks to fast transactions, active validators, and steady staking rewards. The price is currently around $139.14 , and the 24-hour range sits between $133.76 and $140.11 . With a market cap of $77.8B and more than $4.7B in daily trading volume, Solana shows strong on-chain activity. Its circulating supply sits at 559.2M , with a total supply of 614.7M . After recovering from earlier volatility, Solana’s consistent performance and large liquidity pools make it one of the most watched staking tokens heading into 2026. 4. Cardano ($ADA) Cardano maintains its position as one of the most widely used staking coins, supported by long-term holders and steady network upgrades. The price stands at $0.423 with a daily range between $0.4065 and $0.428 . ADA’s market cap is $15.48B , and trading volume sits around $791M in the last 24 hours. With a circulating supply of 36.6B ADA and a total supply capped at 45B , Cardano remains one of the largest Proof of Stake networks in the market. Because it’s easy for retail traders to stake ADA without technical hurdles, participation remains strong. Cardano keeps a stable momentum even during downturns, making it a long-term staking pick. 5. Polkadot ($DOT) Polkadot offers a staking model built around nominated validators and continues to serve as a major multi-chain hub. The price is at $2.29 with a daily range between $2.19 and $2.34 . DOT holds a market cap of $3.75B and maintains $189M in 24-hour trading volume. Its circulating supply is 1.63B DOT , matching the total supply since the network uses an inflationary model instead of a fixed cap. Traders often stake DOT to secure consistent returns and support parachain activity. The network’s interoperability design brings new activity to the ecosystem, and staking helps secure the constant flow of projects. How Noomez Coin Builds Long-Term Strength Through Its Staking System Noomez ties its story to a very clear staking design. The total supply is fixed at 280 billion $NNZ , with 140 billion sold across the 28-stage presale and no minting at launch. During the sale, buyers can lock their tokens into Noom Rewards , a presale staking pool that pays up to 66% APY with a 2x multiplier for Stage 1–7 stakers. Rewards accrue through the entire sale, then unlock 30 days after launch , which keeps early holders motivated to stay in. Fixed supply, no inflation at launch Staking rewards funded from the Noom Stake allocation Early stakers in Stage 5 still qualify for boosted terms After launch, the Keeper’s Path opens with flexible locks from 30 to 365 days , and extra rewards can flow in from the Noom Engine as partner tokens drop directly to holders. Buyers can also stack bonuses with the active BONUS250 code offering a 250% boost and a 10% referral reward . With Stage 5 live at $0.0000230 and every next stage priced higher, traders who want the strongest staking setup are moving before the later, more expensive rounds.

He posted it to highlight an important detail about XRP’s real market role. He wrote, “Yes, SWIFT GPI can partner with digital currency companies such as Ripple to leverage XRP for settlements.” The document came from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It reviewed changes in the remittance transfer market. It noted rapid growth in several payment systems. It also listed Ripple and XRP within that shift. This created interest because it placed XRP beside long-established networks . Yes, SWIFT GPI can partner with digital currency companies such as Ripple to leverage XRP for settlements. Of course it’s documented. https://t.co/fBdPIV5sjl pic.twitter.com/eTQTtBKms5 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 24, 2025 U.S. Agency Names XRP as a Settlement Asset The excerpt states that the Bureau continues to track new activity in cross-border payments. It describes expanded use of SWIFT tools. It cites SWIFT’s Global Payment Innovation (GPI) tracking product, which helps sending institutions access more information. It also notes stronger support from major payment card networks. The report then shifts to nonbank “fintech” providers. These firms establish partnerships with banks or credit unions to access closed payment systems. It then turns to digital asset firms. It references “virtual currency companies, such as Ripple,” which offer technology for global transfers. It also names XRP, and states that Ripple offers a proprietary virtual asset “which can be used to settle those transfers.” That line matters because it confirms that XRP plays a settlement role . It does not present XRP as a theory or a distant plan. It places XRP inside a current payment framework. It demonstrates that federal reviewers recognize XRP’s role in actual transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Appears in Mainstream Payment Discussions Ripple continues to market XRP as a tool for fast and frictionless settlement. Many banks face delays, high fees, or limited transparency. Ripple solves these issues with XRP . It offers liquidity across currency pairs. It supports messaging for transaction tracking. The CFPB document outlines these services in direct terms. It does not instruct banks to use XRP or call for policy changes. It simply lists products now active in the market. The mention still matters because it indicates policymakers reviewing XRP alongside established payment systems. The report also shows a shift in the payment landscape. Banks once relied only on correspondent networks or card systems. Now they consider new technology like XRP. Institutions are already testing XRP , and this creates a path for growth.

This strategic decision marks a pivotal moment for the MapleStory Universe ecosystem and demonstrates Nexpace’s commitment to creating sustainable tokenomics. What Does This NXPC Token Burn Actually Mean? The recent NXPC token burn represents a deliberate reduction in total token supply. By destroying 3.84 million NXPC tokens, Nexpace effectively increases the scarcity of remaining tokens. This fundamental economic principle often leads to increased value for token holders through reduced inflation pressure. Token burning has become a popular mechanism in the cryptocurrency world for several key reasons: Supply reduction – Fewer tokens in circulation means each remaining token becomes more valuable Investor confidence – Shows project commitment to long-term sustainability Price stability – Helps combat inflation and maintain token value Community trust – Demonstrates transparent token management practices How Will This NXPC Token Burn Impact Investors? For current NXPC token holders, this token burn creates immediate positive implications. The reduced supply means your existing tokens now represent a larger percentage of the total ecosystem. Moreover, this strategic NXPC token burn signals strong project management and forward-thinking tokenomics. However, it’s crucial to understand that token burns alone don’t guarantee price appreciation. The success of any NXPC token burn strategy depends on continued project development, user adoption, and market conditions. Therefore, while this NXPC token burn is undoubtedly positive, investors should consider the broader ecosystem growth. Why Choose Token Burning Over Other Strategies? Nexpace selected the NXPC token burn approach for its transparency and immediate impact. Unlike complex staking mechanisms or locked vesting schedules, token burning provides clear, verifiable results that benefit all token holders equally. This NXPC token burn creates a deflationary effect that can help stabilize token value during market fluctuations. The decision to conduct this NXPC token burn also aligns with MapleStory Universe’s long-term vision. By carefully managing token supply, Nexpace ensures the ecosystem remains healthy and sustainable for years to come. This NXPC token burn represents just the beginning of their comprehensive token management strategy. What’s Next After This Initial NXPC Token Burn? Looking forward, this first NXPC token burn sets a precedent for future token management. The successful execution demonstrates Nexpace’s capability to implement deflationary mechanisms effectively. Consequently, we might see additional NXPC token burn events as the project evolves and generates more ecosystem revenue. The Web3 gaming space continues to evolve rapidly, and strategic moves like this NXPC token burn position Nexpace as an industry leader. As more players join the MapleStory Universe, the careful token supply management through mechanisms like this NXPC token burn will become increasingly important for maintaining ecosystem balance. Final Thoughts: A Strategic Move Worth Watching The 3.84 million NXPC token burn represents more than just numbers – it’s a statement of intent from the Nexpace team. This decisive action shows their commitment to building a sustainable Web3 gaming economy where token holders can genuinely benefit from ecosystem growth. The careful planning behind this NXPC token burn demonstrates sophisticated tokenomics understanding that should inspire confidence throughout the community. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a token burn? A token burn permanently removes cryptocurrency tokens from circulation by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address, effectively reducing total supply. How does the NXPC token burn benefit holders? The NXPC token burn increases scarcity of remaining tokens, which can potentially increase value and demonstrates project commitment to sustainable tokenomics. Will there be more NXPC token burns in the future? While not confirmed, the successful execution of this first NXPC token burn suggests it could become part of their ongoing token management strategy. How can I verify the NXPC token burn occurred? You can check the blockchain transaction where the tokens were sent to a burn address, providing transparent verification of the token destruction. Does token burning guarantee price increase? No, while token burning reduces supply and can support price appreciation, it doesn’t guarantee it as market factors and project development also play crucial roles. What makes this NXPC token burn different from others? This NXPC token burn is significant because it’s the first for the project and directly supports the growing MapleStory Universe Web3 ecosystem.

The Kaspa price is currently around $0.0615, marking a 21% increase over the past 24 hours and a remarkable 44% gain over the past week, although it still faces a long-term decline of nearly 59% over the year. This sharp rally signals the potential for a bullish shift, driven by both technical breakout and significant whale activity. Falling wedge breakout fuels momentum Recently, KAS has been trading within a descending channel pattern, which has historically acted as a bearish constraint, limiting upward moves for months. Kaspa has finally broken above the channel’s upper trendline, signaling a potential trend reversal. Kaspa price analysis | Source: TradingView The breakout was confirmed on both daily and multi-week charts, as KAS surged past key resistance levels, including the $0.060 psychological mark. Momentum indicators, such as the RSI and MACD, reflect strong upward pressure, while the Parabolic SAR has flipped bullish, reinforcing the idea that short-term sentiment is turning positive. Traders should now closely watch whether KAS can maintain gains above the $0.062 level, which is critical for a sustained breakout. Whale accumulation drives price resilience Alongside technical patterns, on-chain activity points to strong whale accumulation supporting Kaspa’s rally. According to Kaspa Builders, several major wallets have been buying aggressively, with the top holders collectively acquiring over 35 million KAS. Kaspa Builders @KaspaBuilders · Follow 🚨 Big wallets are buying the dip — aggressively. 🚨While the market is shaking out weak hands, the top $KAS holders are quietly loading up millions of coins.Looking at the on-chain data in this snapshot:• Rank #164 wallet: +9,000,000 KAS• Rank #8 wallet: +6,571,183 KAS 1:27 PM · Nov 25, 2025 155 Reply Copy link Read 3 replies This coordinated accumulation has been especially evident during periods when the KAS price hovered near $0.050, effectively establishing a floor and signaling confidence from long-term investors. The presence of these large wallets adds an extra layer of market stability, suggesting that the recent surge is backed by fundamental buying rather than purely speculative momentum. Kaspa Builders has also highlighted that the recent breakout from a multi-day accumulation zone was accompanied by high trading volume and clean price action, reinforcing the credibility of the move. The combination of strong technical signals, including a rising RSI and bullish Ichimoku cloud flip, with whale accumulation, suggests that KAS may have entered a new phase of sustained upward pressure. Kaspa price forecast Looking ahead, the Kaspa price forecast appears cautiously optimistic as the larger crypto market led by Bitcoin (BTC) recovers from the recent dip . If KAS can hold above the current breakout level and maintain support around $0.055–$0.057, the next targets are likely $0.065 and beyond, with Fibonacci extensions pointing toward a potential move as high as $0.079. Technical indicators such as the DMI and ADX also confirm strong momentum, suggesting that the bullish trend is part of a sustained move rather than a minor fluctuation. Conversely, a failure to defend these support levels could trigger profit-taking, with analysts pointing to $0.0515 as the immediate support level in case the main support around $0.055–$0.057 breaks.

This vision is becoming reality as Visa announces a massive expansion of its stablecoin payments infrastructure across Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. This groundbreaking move could transform how millions of people conduct financial transactions in these rapidly developing regions. What Makes Visa’s Stablecoin Payments Expansion So Significant? Visa’s partnership with crypto infrastructure firm Aquanow represents a major step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. The collaboration focuses on establishing a 24-hour real-time settlement system using stablecoins. This means businesses and individuals can transfer value across borders without waiting for traditional banking hours or dealing with lengthy processing times. The timing couldn’t be better. Many countries in these regions face challenges with traditional financial infrastructure. Stablecoin payments offer a practical solution that combines the stability of traditional currencies with the efficiency of blockchain technology. How Will Stablecoin Payments Benefit These Regions? The expansion brings several key advantages to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. First, it addresses the critical need for faster cross-border transactions. Second, it provides financial inclusion opportunities for unbanked populations. Third, it reduces transaction costs significantly compared to traditional money transfer services. 24/7 availability – No more waiting for banking hours Lower fees – Dramatically reduced transaction costs Faster settlements – Real-time processing instead of days Financial inclusion – Access for underserved populations Currency stability – Protection against local currency volatility What Challenges Might This Expansion Face? Despite the exciting potential, Visa’s stablecoin payments expansion faces several hurdles. Regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions remains complex. Different countries have varying approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. Additionally, educating users about stablecoin technology and building trust in these new systems will require significant effort. Technical infrastructure also presents challenges. Ensuring reliable internet connectivity and digital literacy in some areas will be crucial for successful implementation. However, the partnership with Aquanow brings specialized expertise in crypto infrastructure that should help overcome these obstacles. Why This Matters for the Future of Global Payments Visa’s move signals a fundamental shift in how major financial institutions view digital assets. By embracing stablecoin payments, Visa acknowledges the growing importance of blockchain technology in global finance. This expansion could pave the way for other financial giants to follow suit, accelerating the integration of cryptocurrency into everyday financial services. The real-time settlement capability is particularly transformative. Traditional cross-border payments often take several days to clear. With stablecoin payments, settlements happen almost instantly, providing businesses with better cash flow management and individuals with immediate access to funds. Conclusion: A New Era for Cross-Border Transactions Visa’s expansion of stablecoin payments across Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa represents more than just a technological upgrade—it’s a fundamental reimagining of how value moves across borders. This initiative has the potential to democratize financial services, reduce costs, and increase efficiency for millions of people. As this infrastructure develops, we can expect to see accelerated adoption of digital assets in everyday commerce, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of global payments. Frequently Asked Questions What are stablecoin payments? Stablecoin payments involve using cryptocurrency tokens pegged to stable assets like the US dollar to facilitate fast, low-cost transactions on blockchain networks. Which countries will benefit from Visa’s expansion? The expansion covers Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, though specific country rollouts may vary based on local regulations and infrastructure. How do stablecoin payments differ from traditional bank transfers? Stablecoin payments offer 24/7 availability, faster settlement times, lower fees, and operate on decentralized networks rather than traditional banking systems. Is this service available to individual users? While initially focused on business and institutional clients, the infrastructure could eventually support individual users as the ecosystem matures. What makes this partnership with Aquanow important? Aquanow brings specialized cryptocurrency infrastructure expertise, helping Visa navigate the technical complexities of stablecoin integration at scale. Are stablecoin payments secure? Yes, blockchain-based stablecoin payments use advanced cryptography and decentralized networks, making them highly secure when properly implemented.

The analyst highlights the importance of consolidation and long-term accumulation, suggesting that XRP’s support levels are laying the groundwork for a market reset and a significant price surge. The Mind-Blowing Truth About XRP On Wednesday, crypto market expert Diep Sanh took to X, announcing that he had a mind-blowing message to share with the crypto community. The analyst explained that XRP’s current price action is far more important than many investors realize. According to him, extended periods of consolidation, as XRP is currently experiencing, lay the foundation for major rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dead Cat Bounce: Analyst Reveals What To Expect As Price Recovers Sanh emphasized that when XRP spends a significant time near the $2 mark, it gives investors the chance to accumulate at that price. He explained that this accumulation builds a powerful layer of support, which can help stabilize the market during future corrections. He also noted that once XRP climbs to a higher region and stays there long enough to form a higher low, a new wave of investors usually enters. This creates the next support base and sets the stage for a major upward move. Sanh hinted that XRP could reach dramatic price targets, such as $10 or even $100. However, it would require several of these strong support layers to form over time. Each layer represents greater confidence in the asset and more liquidity to sustain a stronger market. The analyst noted that investors or traders who are frustrated by XRP’s low price and recent downturn are missing the bigger picture. He highlighted that they do not understand how these gradual accumulation phases work or how they can contribute to long-term gains. XRP Remains One Of The Best Crypto Plays After Price Dip In a subsequent analysis, Sanh reaffirmed his confidence in XRP’s future outlook following the recent market downturn. He noted that XRP remains one of the strongest crypto plays despite its recent price crash. The analyst emphasized that the cryptocurrency continues to stand out due to the utility of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a blockchain network engineered for fast and efficient global payments. Related Reading: XRP 100x Rally To $225: Why The Only Place To Go Is Up Sanh noted that this unique design of XRPL gives it an advantage over many large-cap competitors. Moreover, with regulatory uncertainty largely resolved after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dispute, the analyst highlights that XRP has already outperformed most top assets. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.2, experiencing a slight recovery despite recording weeks of choppy price action. Sanh disclosed that investors and traders tend to treat such corrections as strategic accumulation periods rather than signs of weakness. He argued that if XRP continues to expand in areas such as cross-border payments, tokenized asset markets, and stablecoin development, it would benefit its underlying structure. He added that these expanding sectors will also provide long-term support for the cryptocurrency’s growth potential.

Per data retrieved by Finbold from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant , XRP exchange reserves fell from roughly 3 billion tokens in mid-October to just 2.71 billion as of November 27, coinciding with a continued decline in price momentum. XRP Ledger Echange Reserve. Source: CryptoQuant During the period of peak accumulation at around 3 billion XRP, the asset was trading near $3.025, whereas it currently trades at $2.17, recording a mild 1% gain in the past 24 hours. The sharp reserve contraction signals either increased withdrawals toward self-custody or strategic long-term holding behaviour at lower price levels. XRP Ledger Echange Reserve. Source: Finbold/CryptoQuant XRP price divergence While XRP price has fallen steadily since early November, exchange-held reserves have simultaneously trended lower, marking a potential inverse correlation between available liquidity and investor confidence. Typically, declining exchange reserves are considered a bullish indicator in the long term, as reduced supply can limit sell-side pressure and amplify price elasticity in the event of renewed demand. However, the move also reflects fragility in near-term sentiment, with market participants hesitant to deploy capital until XRP breaks above key resistance levels, most notably the $2.40–$2.50 range, which capped multiple upside attempts this month. XRP institutional interest may rise if supply contraction continues Historically, supply reductions on major exchanges such as Binance have preceded accumulation from high-net-worth entities and custodial platforms seeking low entry points. That said, momentum remains weak across broader altcoin markets, coinciding with elevated macro uncertainty ahead of December’s Federal Reserve meeting. XRP currently trades around its two-week moving average, reflecting sideways consolidation rather than definitive trend reversal. Can XRP hold above $2.15 support as liquidity tightens? With exchange reserves at their lowest point since August, market dynamics are now increasingly dependent on whether XRP can maintain support above $2.15. A breakdown below this level could trigger derisking and invalidate the supply-driven bullish thesis. Conversely, a sustained hold above current levels, coupled with continued reserve reduction, may set up XRP for a structurally stronger breakout should institutional flows begin to materialize.

This defied some of the pessimists who thought the collapse signaled the start of the bear market, and now the question is whether the bull run continues at full speed. Here’s what four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots said on the matter. ‘The Train is Starting to Accelerate Again’ ChatGPT claimed that BTC’s break above $90,000 is a strong bullish signal, especially coming shortly after a heavy correction. It estimated that the bull run is back, although not at full force, outlining several factors that support the thesis. It started with the spot BTC ETFs, which over the past two days have seen more inflows than outflows. This usually suggests renewed interest among institutional investors and could be beneficial for the price. The chatbot then paid special attention to the asset’s exchange reserves that recently hit their lowest level since 2017. As CryptoPotato reported , the total amount of BTC stored on such centralized platforms dropped to approximately 1.82 million, representing a significant decline of over 580,000 units in less than a week. This indicates that many investors have moved their holdings from exchanges to self-custody methods, which in turn reduces the immediate selling pressure. In conclusion, ChatGPT stated: “The train is starting to accelerate again — not at full speed, but definitely moving in the right direction.” Grok, the AI chatbot built into the social media platform X, argued that BTC’s bull run is currently resetting for its next leg. It stressed that the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts, which will likely be announced next month, are the primary factor behind the rally’s continuation. Earlier this month, the chances of lowering the benchmark on December 10 dropped to nearly 20%. After recent statements from some Fed officials, though, the odds have increased to 83% (according to Polymarket). Fed Decision in December, Source: Polymarket Google’s Gemini also highlighted BTC’s recovery. It stated that “it’s fair to say” that the asset is in “a very bullish, high-growth environment, fueled by unprecedented adoption.” “The market is in a new, powerful bull phase where demand is now primarily driven by Wall Street’s rhythm rather than just mining rewards,” it added. Not Yet Perplexity was less optimistic, saying Bitcoin’s bull run has not restarted. The chatbot claimed that despite the resurgence, the conditions remain bearish and the price could soon plummet below $75,000. At the same time, it agreed with Grok and many industry participants that the potential rate cuts that the Fed is expected to enforce next month could prevent the bears from regaining full control.

But in 2025, a new trend is reshaping holiday philanthropy—a surge in crypto-based donations. Benjamin Pousty, chief operating officer at crypto donation platform The Giving Block, told Cryptonews that The Giving Block has processed nearly $100 million worth of crypto donations this year for thousands of nonprofits. “This has been our biggest year yet,” Pousty said. “We’re approaching $300 million in crypto donations processed since our launch in 2018, a significant milestone for the crypto philanthropy movement.” 2025 Has Been A Breakout Year For Crypto Giving Despite the current crypto market downturn , Pousty believes that recent all-time highs have sparked charitable giving efforts this year. “Crypto markets have hit multi-year highs, and historically we see charitable giving rise alongside gains in asset value,” he said. For instance, Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached a record all-time high of over $126,000 on October 6, 2025. Pousty shared that Bitcoin continues to be The Giving Block’s top donated asset this year. This is followed by major stablecoins, including Tether’s USDT, Circle’s USDC, and Ripple’s RLUSD. “We also continue to see strong donation activity in ETH, XRP, and SOL,” Pousty added. We’re almost there The crypto community is making incredible progress toward our goal of reaching $300M in donations by year-end. Give today and keep the momentum going. https://t.co/YiA3wYtZli #CryptoPhilanthropy #CryptoForImpact pic.twitter.com/rnD1KtBLUn — The Giving Block (@TheGivingBlock) November 26, 2025 Even as crypto prices continue to decline, Pousty pointed out that crypto donations consistently spike during the holiday season—a pattern that has been seen every year. He mentioned that nearly 30% of all crypto donations arrive in December alone, which mirrors broader charitable giving trends that donors are simply more generous around the holidays. Pousty expects crypto donations to flood in specifically on December 2, which marks “Crypto Giving Tuesday .” “This is the crypto community’s version of ‘Giving Tuesday.’ For The Giving Block, it marks the official launch of our big Crypto for Impact giving season fundraising campaign. Crypto for Impact brings together donors, nonprofits, and partners across Web3 to celebrate generosity and encourage charitable giving using digital assets,” he added. Crypto can build more than wealth — it can build hope. One week until #CryptoGivingTuesday Your gift to @KidWorksUSA helps first-gen students reach college and become leaders in their communities. #CryptoForGood #GiveCrypto pic.twitter.com/7RIxKnSAIm — KidWorks (@KidWorks) November 26, 2025 Where Crypto Donations Are Making An Impact This Year A growing number of nonprofits currently support and accept crypto-based donations , showing the impact of these initiatives. For example, Keith Grossman—president of crypto technology company Moonpay—told Cryptonews that he helped the nonprofit organization New York Cares get started with crypto donations in 2021. As a board member of the organization, Grossman shared that New York Cares has seen an impact through crypto giving, yet this year has been especially impactful for New York City’s largest volunteer network. “This year we had 16 crypto companies come together to donate over $400,000 to an initiative titled ‘Crypto for Good,’ which supported Title I schools in New York City,” he said. The campaign was also part of New York Cares’ broad embrace of digital innovation. “From a MoonPay perspective, we integrated Helio (now MoonPay Commerce) into the New York Cares website to help facilitate some of the donations,” Grossman explained. In addition, The Giving Block’s “Crypto For Impact” report shows measurable outputs tied to crypto giving. For example, as of late 2025, findings show that 28.5 million children have been fed, 357,000 people have gained access to clean water, and 22,160 animals have been rescued and rehabilitated, all thanks to crypto donations. Donor Advised Funds Help The Crypto Community While crypto donations are helping traditional nonprofits, funds are also being used to grow the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained Capital, told Cryptonews that Unchained created the “Bitcoin Legacy Project” in April this year as a philanthropic initiative designed to strengthen Bitcoin’s ecosystem. “The initiative launched with a one-million-dollar initial commitment, and plans to continue expanding funding in the years ahead. The project directly supports the developers, educators, and advocates driving Bitcoin’s future,” Kelly said. He explained that the Bitcoin Legacy Project is the first-ever Bitcoin-native donor-advised fund (DAF) platform. This allows donors to support Bitcoin-aligned nonprofits in a structured, tax-efficient way. To further support development and incentivize giving, Kelly noted that Unchained will match 1:1 grants donated through its Bitcoin-native DAF platform to partner organizations. MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, Human Rights Foundation, Open Sats, and Brink will receive up to 1 BTC through this initiative. “The DAF gives high-net-worth individuals and organizations a simple, tax-efficient way to give back. Donors can contribute Bitcoin or other assets, receive an immediate tax deduction, and keep the donation in BTC within the fund,” Kelly said. Over time, donors can recommend grants to any 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the US, with the option for recipients to receive the donation in Bitcoin. Kelly added that Unchained is committed to funding collaborative spaces where Bitcoiners can build, innovate, and conduct ongoing research to shape Bitcoin’s future worldwide. As part of this multifaceted approach, the Bitcoin Legacy Project will direct funding toward six additional key initiatives throughout its inaugural year. This includes three leading Bitcoin hubs—Bitcoin Park Nashville, Bitcoin Park Austin, and The Space (Denver)—which will provide essential infrastructure for builders. Benefits of Donating Crypto While donors want to support causes they care about, crypto donations have a number of tax benefits associated with them . According to Pousty, crypto donations are often far more tax-efficient than selling appreciated assets. This allows donors to eliminate capital gains taxes while deducting the full fair-market value. For instance, if a donor gives cryptocurrency that has increased in value, they can completely avoid capital gains tax as long as it was held for more than 12 months. This is often the single biggest tax advantage and one of the most common reasons donors give crypto instead of cash. Additionally, crypto moves instantly across borders, meaning that nonprofits can receive funds faster during emergencies. For example, shortly after the 2022 Russian invasion, the Ukrainian government created public crypto wallet addresses to receive donations in various cryptocurrencies. Millions of dollars’ worth of crypto have been donated to help with efforts in regions like Ukraine. It’s also been noted that crypto donations tend to attract a younger donor base. This is due to the fact that Millennials and Gen Z make up the majority of crypto users. Challenges To Consider Although a number of benefits are associated with crypto donations, some organizations and donors may struggle with certain challenges. Primarily, crypto’s volatility can be problematic. If an asset decreases in value and it is not converted into its dollar value at the time, that donation will depreciate. Crypto donations are also treated differently from cash in many jurisdictions, making rules around tax deductions, reporting, and compliance confusing. The correct infrastructure is further required in order for crypto donations to be accepted and processed. Platforms like The Giving Block work directly with nonprofits to ensure that crypto donations can be received and reported on properly for tax purposes. Crypto Donations Continue To Flood In Challenges aside, crypto donations will likely continue to increase moving forward. Pousty believes that there is a clear trend toward greater acceptance of crypto donations as an essential donation method alongside cash. He added that more crypto giving from high-net-worth persons and a steady increase in the total share of charitable giving coming from crypto assets are expected as adoption continues to rise. “Every cycle, we see donor behavior become more sophisticated, nonprofits become more proactive, and partners across the industry step in to support mission-driven causes. We’re moving toward a future where crypto giving sits alongside stocks, DAFs, and other non-cash assets as a standard part of modern philanthropy,” Pousty said.

In a single trading session, Ark added more than 174,000 shares of Alphabet, valued at over $56 million, marking one of its largest allocations of the quarter. The move follows Google’s unveiling of its most advanced AI model, Gemini 3, and reports that the tech giant is in talks to sell its in-house chips to major cloud providers. Google’s rally has been equally notable. Shares have climbed nearly 9% over the last five trading days and more than 22% in the past month, lifting its market capitalization to $3.816 trillion, now exceeding the total combined value of the entire global crypto market. Ark’s buying spree extended well beyond Alphabet. The firm also increased exposure to: Coinbase with a $3.75 million purchase Circle with an additional $7 million allocation ARKB, its own Bitcoin ETF, with nearly $2 million in new shares CoreWeave with $29.4 million added Meta with a $21.5 million increase AI Momentum vs. Bubble Concerns The acceleration in AI-linked valuations has sparked debate on whether the sector is nearing bubble conditions. Wood disagrees. Speaking on Ark’s latest podcast, she said anxiety around another tech-style bubble “actually reassures” her, emphasizing that unlike the late-1990s cycle, today’s AI technologies are real, scalable, and already reshaping business models. During the dot-com era, she noted, most companies were funded based on projected user growth. Today’s AI firms, by contrast, are generating measurable demand and deploying products across industries including cloud computing, robotics, and financial services. Broader market unease has persisted due to delayed macroeconomic data tied to the government shutdown, but Ark has remained consistently active. Recent additions include Coinbase, BitMine Immersion Technologies, and further accumulation of Circle as USDC’s issuer retraces to its post-IPO levels. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Can BTC Break the Downtrend as Buyers Eye $94K Next? Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize after weeks of selling, with the 4-hour chart showing signs of a potential shift in momentum. Price is now testing a descending trendline aligned with the 0.382 Fibonacci level near $90,800, a key zone that has capped every rebound since early November. The bounce from $83,683 has created a higher low, while BTC has reclaimed the 20-EMA and is closing in on the 50-EMA, hinting at improving short-term strength. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview RSI has moved into the low-60s, maintaining a steady upward structure without entering overbought territory. A recent bullish engulfing candle from $86,878 adds to the recovery case. A confirmed breakout above $91,000 could open a path toward $93,900 and potentially $97,100 if momentum accelerates. Failure to clear resistance risks a pullback toward $88,800 or $86,800. For now, traders are watching for a decisive break that could signal the start of a broader rebound. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.20 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year. The project mixes bold branding with real engagement features, from ROI contests to nonstop community events, giving it more personality and momentum than typical dog coins. Its shredded, leverage-obsessed mascot has already turned Maxi Doge into a recognizable culture coin. Holders can also stake $MAXI for daily smart-contract rewards and unlock access to exclusive competitions and partner events.

The factory in the northeastern Spanish region of Aragon is expected to create nearly 4,000 jobs, with media reports suggesting that 2,000 Chinese workers are already on site. The joint venture’s CEO, Andy Wu, and executives from the joint project declined to confirm the alleged numbers, stating that the final figures have not yet been determined. Wu also said that the joint company is still seeking a subcontractor. The executives announced on Wednesday that the new plant will operate solely on renewable energy, with production scheduled to start by the end of next year. The projected annual output is approximately 50 GWh (gigawatt-hours) of LFP batteries, which will be supplied to EV makers across Europe. Hereu says partnership reflects strong China-Spain tie Jordi Hereu, the Spanish Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, described the groundbreaking event as a strategic milestone for the country’s industrial modernization and energy transition. He pointed out that the partnership reflects the strong confidence between Chinese and Spanish companies. It also emphasizes Spain’s role and effort in the electrification of Europe. The country was generating more than 50% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2024 and relies on imported raw materials from other nations, noted the Minister. For instance, Spain needs imported green technologies to accelerate its transition away from fossil fuels, and China has substantial influence over these materials. CATL, the Chinese partner in this joint venture, is arguably the world’s largest EV battery maker. Its customers reportedly include Volkswagen, Tesla , and BMW. The company’s existing production in Germany has been running since 2022, and it is seeking to expand further in Europe. Full-scale production at CATL’s Debrecen, Hungary, plant is expected to kick off operations in the coming months. The company is also significantly involved in the global EV batteries supply chain through large-scale mining. CATL has invested heavily in the mining of cobalt, lithium, and nickel in China. It also has similar projects abroad, such as those in Bolivia and Indonesia. CATL plans to train 4000 Spanish workers China’s ambassador to Spain and Chinese executives reassured an audience of Spanish ministers, reporters, and officials that China is committed to training Spanish workers. They also disclosed that China is ready to share technologies to support the energy transition in Europe. The Director of Public Affairs at CATL Europe, Wenpei Lin, stated that the production of EV batteries requires advanced technology and operational expertise accumulated over many years. She added that her company’s mission is to make this technology accessible to everyone. “We don’t know this technology, these components – we’ve never made them before…They’re years ahead of us. All we can do is watch and learn.” – David Romeral , Director General of CAAR Aragon Meanwhile, auto industry representatives and unions pointed out that Spain lacks the technical know-how for producing EV batteries. However, Europe’s auto associations are pushing for stricter requirements on the sourcing of components locally, partly to protect the region’s companies from their Chinese rivals. The European Commission is also preparing to introduce a new set of measures to strengthen the sector. Hereu said technology transfer is fundamental to the project. He emphasized that the Spanish side needs to learn from their Chinese counterparts, who are knowledgeable in this area. Hereu also added that Spain is open and ready to work with all countries of the world, especially China. Stellantis shipping manager Roque Mangiron also noted that many countries that previously relied on German technology now depend on China. Mangiron stated that Spain will always be ready to provide labor. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Bitcoin led the recovery, climbing back above $90,000 and triggering a sharp wave of liquidations that removed more than $43 million in leveraged short positions in a single day. Short Squeeze Accelerates Bitcoin’s Rebound The surge in Bitcoin's price above $90,000 was driven by a short squeeze, as evidenced by a substantial spike in short liquidations. According to CryptoQuant data analyzed by Outset PR , a data-driven crypto PR agency, BTC short liquidations escalated from 185 BTC on November 25th to 658 BTC on November 26th. This increase of 473 BTC, equivalent to approximately $43 million, confirms that traders with bearish positions were forced to close their shorts, fueling the price rise. Outset PR is watching the markets, are you?A major short squeeze pushed #Bitcoin back above $90K, with $43M in shorts liquidated in one day.Liquidations spiked from 185 $BTC to 658 $BTC , showing how crowded the downside trade became.Key levels ahead: $92.5K, $98.8K, $102.5K. pic.twitter.com/Be0GUdVNM7 — Outset PR (@OutsetPR) November 27, 2025 The liquidation spike reflects how aggressively some market participants were positioned for further downside following last week’s decline toward the $80,000 level. As Bitcoin moved higher, those short positions became unsustainable, accelerating the rebound through forced buying — a characteristic of a short squeeze. Technical Indicators Point to Short-Term Relief, Not Full Recovery Bitcoin’s rebound coincides with price action reclaiming two near-term technical levels: the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $107,720, and the 7-day simple moving average at $87,043. Both levels had acted as resistance during the selloff and now provide context for the correction-driven bounce. The RSI (14) currently stands at 39.37, indicating the market is stabilizing after reaching oversold territory but is still far from overheated. Meanwhile, the MACD remains negative, showing that momentum has yet to shift decisively in favor of the bulls. One of the strongest signals comes from the bounce off the $80.6K low on Nov. 22, where buyers stepped in aggressively. Still, the broader trend remains fragile. How Outset PR Interprets Market Signals Outset PR is built around a simple idea: stories land best when they reflect what the market is actually paying attention to. Instead of treating PR as a distribution exercise, the team follows real-time data — from on-chain flows to sentiment shifts — to understand how narratives move. Founded by crypto PR veteran Mike Ermolaev , the agency blends analytical depth with a personable, boutique-style workflow. Outset PR keeps a close eye on the same indicators traders watch: liquidation spikes, volatility clusters, funding trends, and momentum signals. This lets the team place each story within the market’s natural rhythm, so articles resonate rather than getting lost in the noise. The approach is hands-on and very human. Outset PR monitors: daily sentiment changes across media and social channels on-chain and derivatives patterns that hint at upcoming market narratives how macro events influence the timing and tone of coverage which stories gain traction organically — and why By weaving data with editorial instinct, the agency helps founders communicate in a way that feels timely, credible, and grounded in real market behavior. The goal isn’t just exposure — it’s impact. Outset PR uses its proprietary Syndication Map and traffic analytics to ensure that each placement has a strong chance of being discovered, shared, and picked up by aggregators like CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because the team tracks market momentum daily, they can provide context like today’s short squeeze — explaining not only what happened, but why it matters and how it fits into the broader narrative cycle. Key Levels to Watch: BTC Faces Resistance at $102.5K The next test for Bitcoin is a close above $92,500, the high reached on Nov. 25. Clearing this level would confirm that the rebound is being sustained by genuine demand rather than short liquidations alone. Above that, Bitcoin faces two notable resistance zones: 30-day SMA at $98,852 — the threshold separating short-term weakness from renewed bullish structure. 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $102,500 — a level that typically attracts increased selling interest. A move toward $102,500 would mark a deeper retracement of the recent downtrend and suggest that buyers have regained control of the near-term outlook. Market Outlook The latest price action shows that the crypto market is finding relief after a steep correction, but the recovery is still dependent on follow-through buying. The liquidation-driven jump over $90,000 highlights how crowded the short side had become, yet the negative MACD and the looming resistance around $98,800 and $102,500 point to a market not fully out of danger. For now, the data suggests this is a corrective upswing with improving sentiment — not yet a confirmed return to the broader bullish trend.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,785, showing a 4.42% increase over the past 24 hours. BTC price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The recovery represents a significant bounce from last Friday's low near $80,000. Bitcoin has gained roughly 12% since that panic-driven selloff. Despite the recent uptick, the digital asset remains down 4% over the past week and 21% over the past month. It continues trading 28% below its all-time high of $126,000. Volatility Subsides Amid Holiday Trading Options data reveal traders expect Bitcoin to remain range-bound. Traders are selling call options and strangles around the $85,000 to $90,000 range. Minimal downside protection suggests confidence that major price movements are unlikely during the holiday period. ”The market looks comfortable fading moves on both sides rather than positioning for a breakout,” De Maere stated. Lower volumes during the long weekend typically limit significant price action. Historical Thanksgiving Performance Shows Mixed Results The Wednesday before Thanksgiving has historically proven challenging for Bitcoin . The cryptocurrency has declined in six of the past seven years on this specific trading day. Both 2020 and 2021 saw substantial drops during pre-holiday sessions. This year breaks that negative pattern. Bitcoin reached $95,737 on Thanksgiving 2024, setting a holiday record. The current price of $91,000 represents a decline from last year but remains historically elevated. Bitcoin's price history on Thanksgiving shows dramatic growth over the years. The cryptocurrency traded at just $12 in 2012 following its first halving event. By 2013, it reached $1,000 for the first time amid growing mainstream attention. The asset experienced significant volatility in the years that followed. It dropped to $369 in 2014 following the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange. Recovery came gradually, with Bitcoin hitting $737 in 2016 and $8,071 in 2017. The 2021 bull run pushed Bitcoin to $59,008 on Thanksgiving, fueled by corporate adoption and institutional interest. A subsequent crypto winter followed, intensified by the 2022 FTX collapse. Market sentiment remains divided. The Financial Times published multiple skeptical articles about cryptocurrency on Wednesday, continuing its critical stance toward the sector. However, Bitcoin's recent price action suggests resilience despite negative commentary from traditional financial media.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-27 15:19:13

The group registered $8.1 million in net outflows on Wednesday, ending a perfect multi-week inflow streak that had supported strong institutional demand. The reversal emerged as investors rotated between issuers, reassessed short-term volatility, and reacted to changing liquidity conditions across digital asset markets. TSOL Outflows Shift ETF Momentum Data from SoSoValue showed that a single issuer caused most of the pressure. The 21Shares Solana ETF posted $34.37 million in withdrawals, extending its cumulative net outflows to $26 million, while its assets settled near $86 million. Source: SoSovalue Besides this significant movement, the remaining Solana funds helped soften the overall impact. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF continued to attract interest, adding over $13 million and lifting its total inflows above $527 million. Moreover, the Grayscale Solana Trust collected more than $10 million, and Fidelity’s FSOL fund added $2.5 million. Data from Solana Strategic Reserve showed that all Solana ETFs collectively hold about 6.83 million tokens. Their combined value stands close to $964 million, reflecting sustained institutional positioning even during short-term fluctuations. Price Action Steadies Despite ETF Pressure Solana’s market price remained stable during the ETF turbulence. SOL traded near $141.14 , showing a 3.54% increase over the past day. Its market cap approached $79 billion, supported by a circulating supply of roughly 560 million tokens. However, analysts signaled caution despite the mild recovery. Source: X Umair Crypto observed weakness in recent trading behavior. He noted that Solana rejected the $138 value-area-low with declining buy volume. Hence, he suggested that the chart could drift toward the $120 liquidity level if demand remains weak. He also pointed to the $128 zone as a key threshold. A breakdown could pull the market lower, while a defense could allow a head-and-shoulders structure to form. Long-Term Drivers Remain Strong Gordon offered a different angle. He highlighted strong on-chain activity and solid ETF inflows recorded before the correction. Additionally, he mentioned that Solana’s inflation reduction proposal could improve long-term value dynamics. Hence, he argued that the broader trend remains intact.

This enormous USDT transfer, valued at approximately $200 million, represents one of the largest stablecoin movements we’ve seen this year. But what does this colossal transaction really mean for the market? Why This Massive USDT Transfer Matters When we see a USDT transfer of this magnitude, it typically signals significant market activity ahead. Large investors, often called ‘whales,’ move substantial amounts for several key reasons: Portfolio rebalancing between different cryptocurrencies Preparation for major purchases of other digital assets Risk management during volatile market conditions Institutional positioning for upcoming market moves This particular USDT transfer from a major exchange to a private wallet suggests the holder may be planning a strategic move rather than immediate trading. What Could Trigger Such a Large USDT Transfer? The timing and size of this USDT transfer raise important questions about market sentiment. Historically, massive stablecoin movements often precede significant price movements in either direction. The unknown destination wallet adds an element of mystery, leaving analysts to speculate about the holder’s intentions. Several factors could explain this substantial USDT transfer: Institutional investors positioning for market entry Whale accumulation strategy for upcoming bull run Risk-off movement during uncertain market conditions Preparation for major cryptocurrency purchases How Does This USDT Transfer Impact Market Stability? While a single USDT transfer of this size might seem alarming, it’s crucial to understand that stablecoin movements between wallets don’t necessarily indicate market instability. However, they do provide valuable insights into whale behavior and potential market directions. The $200 million USDT transfer represents substantial buying power that could significantly influence cryptocurrency prices when deployed. Market watchers will be closely monitoring where these funds eventually flow, as they could signal the next major market move. Key Takeaways From This Monumental Transaction This massive USDT transfer serves as a powerful reminder of several cryptocurrency market realities. First, whale activity continues to play a crucial role in market dynamics. Second, stablecoins like USDT remain the preferred vehicle for large-scale capital movements within the crypto ecosystem. Most importantly, this USDT transfer highlights the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency markets, where institutional-scale transactions occur regularly with minimal market disruption. Frequently Asked Questions What is a whale in cryptocurrency terms? A whale refers to an individual or entity that holds large amounts of cryptocurrency, typically enough to influence market prices through their trading activities. Why do whales transfer USDT to unknown wallets? Whales often move funds to private wallets for security reasons, to prepare for large purchases, or to maintain privacy about their trading strategies. Should I be concerned about large USDT transfers? While large transfers can indicate significant market moves, they’re a normal part of cryptocurrency markets and don’t necessarily signal immediate concern for retail investors. How can I track large cryptocurrency transfers? You can monitor services like Whale Alert or use blockchain explorers to track large transactions across various cryptocurrency networks. Does this USDT transfer affect USDT’s price stability? No, USDT maintains its peg to the US dollar through reserve mechanisms, and wallet transfers don’t impact its stable value. What’s the difference between exchange and wallet transfers? Exchange transfers involve moving funds between trading platforms, while wallet transfers move funds to private storage, often indicating longer-term holding strategies.

Historically, this technical pattern, which involves the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) crossing below the 200-day one, has coincided with drops of up to 15% for XRP, suggesting a possible slide toward the $1.50 range, based on the current price of $2.17. In a recent post on X, market analyst Umair noted that the asset is consolidating between $1.90 and $2.08, calling the range “the entire decision maker.” Sustained trading at this level could allow for a month-long consolidation, while a failure to hold could trigger a sharp decline. XRP Death Cross. Source: TradingView The same pattern emerged earlier this month, on November 9, when XRP was trading at around $2.33, only to drop to $2.21 by November 17. Last month, on October 2, the omen coincided with a 10.6% pullback on the weekly chart. Is XRP struggling again? The broader cryptocurrency market is seeing notable gains today, with most major coins trading higher amid renewed investor optimism. Bitcoin ( BTC ), for instance, soared as its total capitalization went from $1.73 trillion to $1.83 trillion , while Ethereum ( ETH ) rose nearly 4% and remained above the $3,000 mark. Meanwhile, XRP continues to struggle, capped under resistance at $2.30. The Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) sits at 46, pointing to weakened momentum that could persist in the near term. Nonetheless, while XRP’s price has steadily fallen since early November, it can be noted that exchange-held reserves have followed suit, indicating a potential inverse relationship between liquidity and investor confidence. That is, declining exchange reserves are often viewed as a bullish long-term signal since reduced supply can limit sell-side pressure. XRP Ledger Exchange Reserve. Source: Finbold/CryptoQuant Still, near-term sentiment remains fragile, influenced by macroeconomic uncertainty such as the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. To boot, the token is currently trading near its two-week moving average, reflecting sideways consolidation rather than a decisive trend reversal.

His update was accompanied by several market panels showing ETF inflows, asset levels, volume metrics, and the current operational status of various XRP funds. The post has brought attention to the growth of the ETF sector and what the near-term activity window may look like for institutional and retail participants. XRP ETFs are locked in for a massive week. Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/yfF7Oxts7j — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 24, 2025 Current Market Indicators The shared screenshots illustrate an ETF environment that is active and increasingly structured. Market terminals display 24-hour spot volume above $55 million and leveraged volume over $61 million. Additional data from SoSoValue provides a snapshot of daily XRP spot ETF net inflows. The recent daily figure stands at about 11.89 million, with total net assets exceeding 384 million. The inflow chart shows higher peaks earlier in November, followed by moderate levels in the most recent sessions. The displayed XRP price of $1.94 offers context for interpreting these flows, especially in relation to the market sentiment. ETF Listings and Asset Overview The ETF tracker panel outlines several active XRP-linked offerings. Canary’s XRPC holds approximately $269 million in assets under management, while Teucrium’s XXRP futures product maintains around $229 million. Other funds, including XRPI from Volatility Shares and XRPR from REX-Osprey, each show asset totals above the $100 million range. All appear with live status indicators, signifying mature operational readiness and ongoing institutional accessibility. These figures reinforce that XRP’s ETF ecosystem now spans multiple issuers and product types, creating a diversified structure for both spot and futures-based exposure. SMQKE’s message aligns with these conditions, suggesting that the upcoming week represents an important activity window within this growing segment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Response and Market Considerations An X user, OGA NFT, offered a measured perspective in response to the post. He noted that ETF approval alone does not guarantee immediate inflows, referencing examples in the crypto ETF market where expectations for rapid capital movement took months to materialize. He also pointed out that many existing XRP holders already own the asset directly, raising questions about the capacity of new ETF product investors. This viewpoint underscores a key distinction between structural readiness and actual inflow momentum. While the data attached to SMQKE’s update shows meaningful participation, the pace of additional inflows depends on market conditions, investor profiles, and how quickly institutions choose to expand their exposure.

Tom Wan, head of data at Entropy Advisors, who shared the Defillama chart showing the decline, also revealed that Unichain’s TVL crash is not happening in isolation, with other networks such as Linea dropping by 83% and Berachain experiencing a 91% decline from their respective peaks. Unichain, the Layer 2 blockchain developed by decentralized exchange giant Uniswap , spent over $21 million on a campaign that started in April 2025 and was managed by Gauntlet , which distributed approximately 3.5 million UNI tokens. The campaign saw Unichain’s TVL surge astronomically. A sizable chunk of that growth has now evaporated. Unichain TVL is down close to 90% from its all-time high. Source: DefiLlama Sustainable yields versus temporary incentives Erick Pinos , Head of Ecosystem at Nibiru Chain, noted that “incentives are very tricky to get correct” in response to Wan’s initial post. Wan responded to Pinos, writing, “100%, I like how we at Entropy Advisors are designing DRIP on Arbitrum, which supports the program to be very reflexive to market conditions, dynamics, and performance of participating protocols and assets.” An X user posting under the name Soleil also assessed Unichain’s predicament, writing, “Killer apps and sustainable yields are the only two elements that can keep TVLs. For Unichain, the app is basically Uniswap. When the incentives end, LPs have alternative choices in various DeFi protocols to maximize their ROI, the moat is simply not there.” Unlike established Layer 2 networks that have cultivated diverse ecosystems of applications, Unichain’s primary draw remains its connection to Uniswap itself. Without compelling reasons to maintain capital on the network beyond incentive farming, liquidity providers have simply redeployed their assets to more lucrative opportunities elsewhere. Eliezer Ndinga, global head of research and founding venture partner, 21shares, writing in his comment to Wan’s post , also echoed this sentiment: “Crypto in reality has a product-market fit problem without those incentives. Those then become table stakes. Protocols have so much to learn from Web 2 bootstrapping founders.” What’s next for Unichain and the blockchain market? Unichain is not lacking technically, as it still offers fast finality and low fees, properties that should, in principle, support sustained usage and make it appealing to builders. However, the data is saying that’s not happening at scale, and the challenge, according to observers, lies in converting transient reward-seekers into regular users of on-chain applications. On other chains , Berachain, whose platform experienced an exploit earlier this month, is the worst hit in terms of its TVL decline. It went from an all-time high of over $3.3 billion to $273.67 million , a 91.7% decline. Linea , on the other hand, has seen a slight recovery, moving from the 83% decline Wan reported to around 78.9% as of the time of writing. The reasons for these declines are not unrelated to the bear market that hit the market, with Bitcoin falling close to $80,000 last week. However, the market has seen some progress with Bitcoin gaining some momentum and is now priced at over $91,000 . Historically, events like this affect other blockchains, whether Layer 1 or Layer 2, and recovery may be slow and difficult.

For the first time since August, these massive holders are accumulating Bitcoin again, signaling a potential turning point for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. This surprising reversal comes after months of selling pressure from large investors. Why Are Bitcoin Whales Suddenly Buying Again? The Accumulation Trend Score for institutions holding over 10,000 BTC has surged to 0.8, indicating strong buying activity. This metric measures the intensity of accumulation among different holder groups. When the score approaches 1, it shows maximum accumulation is occurring. The current reading suggests institutional Bitcoin whales are returning to the market with conviction. This shift isn’t limited to the largest players. Multiple whale categories have begun accumulating simultaneously: 10,000+ BTC holders : Showing strongest accumulation since August 1,000-10,000 BTC holders : First accumulation since September 100-1,000 BTC holders : Consistent buying since October What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? When Bitcoin whales accumulate, it often precedes significant price movements. These large holders typically have better market timing than retail investors. Their collective actions can create substantial buying pressure that drives prices higher. The synchronized accumulation across different whale categories suggests strong consensus about Bitcoin’s current valuation. Moreover, retail investors holding less than one BTC are showing their strongest accumulation since July. This creates a powerful combination where both large and small investors are buying simultaneously. Such alignment between Bitcoin whales and retail investors often indicates broad market confidence. How Can Investors Interpret This Development? The return of Bitcoin whales as net buyers provides several important signals. First, it suggests that large investors believe current prices represent good value. Second, it indicates reduced selling pressure from major holders. Finally, it creates a more stable foundation for potential price appreciation. However, investors should consider these factors: Whale accumulation doesn’t guarantee immediate price increases Market conditions can change rapidly Multiple factors influence Bitcoin’s price beyond whale activity What’s Driving the Bitcoin Whales’ Behavior? Several factors likely contribute to this shift in whale behavior. Improving macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions, and Bitcoin’s strong fundamentals may be influencing these large investors. The timing suggests Bitcoin whales are positioning themselves ahead of potential positive developments. The consistent accumulation since October among mid-sized Bitcoin whales indicates this isn’t a fleeting trend. Rather, it represents sustained confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. This pattern mirrors previous cycles where whale accumulation preceded significant bull markets. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin Markets The transformation of Bitcoin whales from net sellers to net buyers marks a significant milestone. This shift, combined with strong retail accumulation, creates a bullish foundation for Bitcoin’s future. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the return of these major investors suggests renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency’s prospects. The synchronized buying across different whale categories and retail investors indicates broad-based optimism. As these Bitcoin whales continue to accumulate, they may create the momentum needed for the next phase of Bitcoin’s growth story. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin whales? Bitcoin whales are individuals or institutions holding large amounts of Bitcoin, typically 1,000 BTC or more. Their trading activities can significantly impact market prices. Why is whale accumulation important? When Bitcoin whales accumulate, it often signals confidence in future price appreciation and can reduce selling pressure in the market. How long has this buying trend been happening? Different whale categories began accumulating at different times, with the largest whales starting last week, while mid-sized whales have been buying since October. What is the Accumulation Trend Score? This metric measures the intensity of Bitcoin accumulation among different holder groups, with scores near 1 indicating strong buying activity. Are retail investors also accumulating? Yes, investors holding less than one BTC are showing their strongest accumulation since July, creating broad-based buying pressure. Does whale accumulation guarantee price increases? While whale accumulation often precedes price increases, it doesn’t guarantee them, as multiple factors influence cryptocurrency markets.

This unexpected transaction has sparked curiosity and speculation within the crypto community. Could this be a prelude to a new trend in Ethereum's market movement? Find out how this action might signal impending gains for certain coins in the ecosystem. Ethereum Shows Few Signs of Major Movement, Yet Holds Potential Source: tradingview Ethereum's price has floated between roughly $2500 and $3150, showing no dramatic shifts in the past week. Currently, the coin is just shy of breaking the $3500 resistance mark. While recent numbers hint at stability, a bump to $4080 may be possible if market conditions improve. This could mean a potential rise of around thirty percent from recent lows. However, given the minor dip over the past week and a considerable drop within the last month, Ethereum may need time to regain its momentum. Its RSI is balanced, suggesting no immediate trend. Traders are watching closely for signs of recovery. Conclusion Vitalik's transfer of 256 ETH to privacy messengers highlights a potential new interest in privacy-focused projects. This action could signal the start of increased attention and investment in ETH-related privacy initiatives. The move may boost confidence in ETH's privacy capabilities, potentially creating a narrative shift.

Can BNB leverage this move to regain a four-digit price tag? This article explores the potential of BNB and other coins ready for growth, offering insights into the shifting market dynamics. Discover the key players and upcoming trends. BNB Price Shows Stable Rise with Room for Growth Source: tradingview BNB is trading between a high $700s to low $900s range. Recently, it's been on a slight decline over the past week but shows a solid increase over the last six months. The coin's potential is promising as it's close to climbing past $1000, the first resistance point. If it clears that, it could target $1150, marking a substantial gain from its current state. Compared to six months ago, BNB has grown by almost 36%. While the one-month dip hints at caution, the overall trend suggests BNB might continue upwards, especially if it breaks through the nearest resistance. Conclusion The move to list on Nasdaq reflects growing acceptance and opportunity in the market. BNB’s potential for growth is significant in this environment.

This sustained exodus of tokens from a major trading platform is creating what analysts often call a classic supply shock setup, where dwindling exchange supply meets growing institutional demand. The Great XRP Exodus Data from the world’s largest crypto exchange shows a clear and persistent trend. Since October 6, approximately 300 million XRP have been pulled out of Binance. This has driven the platform’s total reserves down to around 2.7 billion tokens, a level rarely seen. As noted by on-chain analyst Darkfost on November 27, this is widely interpreted as a positive signal, suggesting investors are moving their holdings into private wallets for safekeeping rather than having them on an exchange for immediate selling. The behavior points to a growing conviction among holders to retain their assets for the medium to long term. When tokens are removed from exchanges in such volume, it directly reduces the amount of coins readily available for traders to sell. It can lay the groundwork for a significant price increase if buyer demand suddenly picks up, as there is less supply on the market to absorb the new orders. The sentiment is echoed by data from Arab Chain, also from November 27, which highlighted that the ratio of XRP on exchanges to its total supply has fallen to its lowest point this year. Market Sentiment and Price Performance While the reserve data tells a story of accumulation, the current price action presents a more mixed picture. XRP is currently trading near $2.19, showing little change over the past 24 hours. However, it is up by about 3.5% in the last 7 days, while losing more than 12% of its value over two weeks. In the previous month, the depreciation was even worse, with the asset dipping 17% in that period. This has created a noticeable disconnect: even as the price has struggled, a large cohort of investors appears to be withdrawing their coins, indicating they are not swayed by short-term price drops. Other market metrics have further complicated the divergence. According to a recent CryptoQuant report, open interest for XRP futures on Binance fell to its lowest point in a year, suggesting a drop in speculative trading activity. Furthermore, despite the recent launch of several spot XRP ETFs in mid-November, data shows that large holders, or “whales,” have sold over 180 million tokens, adding to the selling pressure. For technicians, the key level to watch is $2.00, with analysts like Ali Martinez stating that holding above this price is important for maintaining a potential bullish pattern; a break below it could signal further declines.

Onchain and offchain data both show that, until the price reclaims these levels and new inflows resume, the market will probably “stay in a low-conviction consolidation,” according to the latest report by the analytics platform Glassnode . BTC has been trading below the short-term holder cost basis of some $104,600 since early October. Per the analysts, it’s now in a zone that shows the market’s lack of liquidity and demand. Moreover, over the past weeks, the coin has been trading within the $81,000–$89,000 range. Notably, this resembles the Q1 2022 post-ATH interval, says Glassnode. Back then, the market weakened under fading demand. Also similarly to Q1 2022, we’re seeing raised loss realization. This is typical of a declined market in need of liquidity. As momentum fades, investors exit at a loss. Per Glassnode, “Bitcoin is not in full capitulation but remains firmly in a low-liquidity, low-conviction environment. Until price reclaims major cost-basis levels and fresh demand returns, the market is likely to stay in a defensive consolidation phase.” Meanwhile, short-dated downside flows are fading too. It suggests that the probability of an extended drop is smaller than it was during the recent downturn. “Sentiment has shifted from urgent protection to a more measured, cautious stance.” However, flows on the upside suggest that the latest upwards movement “may have removed short-term panic, but it has not resolved the deeper structural fragility still present in the market.” Liquidity on Edge Bitcoin is stuck in a fragile $81K–$89K range as liquidity thins and realized losses surge. Futures deleverage, options stay defensive, and demand remains weak.

Overall, data signals that “short-term fear has cooled, even if the broader environment remains prone to sudden shifts.” You may also like: Why Is Crypto Up Today? – November 27, 2025 Extreme fear still dominates crypto trading; the Crypto Fear and Greed gauge rose to 18 today, only slightly above last week’s low readings around 10, which marked the deepest stress since the index appeared.Bitcoin is currently trading above the $90,000 level, marking a 4% increase over the past day. It moves around liquidation zones rather than fresh territory, with outflows from some structured products and concern over global growth still shaping decisions in major venues.Within... Onchain Data Shows Rising Stress Three key points indicate increasing stress. Short-Term Holder (STH) loss ratios plunged to 0.07x, long-term holders (LTH) reduced profit margins, and realized losses reached levels similar to early-cycle lows. Liquidity is the key indicator of future events when the market weakens, the report says. Prolonged low-liquidity increases the risk of further contraction. Analysts found that liquidity is still thinning. Unless demand strengthens, the risk of retesting the True Market Mean (~$81,000) remains high. Source: Glassnode Moreover, the STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, which gives us a picture of the current demand, fell below its neutral Mean (4.3x) in early October and has now collapsed to 0.07x. “Such overwhelming loss dominance confirms that liquidity has evaporated,” says the report, and if this ratio remains depressed, “market conditions could begin to mirror the weakness of Q1 2022, raising the risk of a breakdown below the True Market Mean (~$81,000).” Moreover, the 7D-SMA of the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Realized Profit/Loss Ratio plummeted to 408x. Trading above 100x shows healthier liquidity conditions compared to Q1 2022, indicating that LTHs are still realizing profit. “However, if liquidity continues to fade and this ratio compresses toward 10x or lower, the probability of transitioning into a deeper bear market becomes difficult to ignore,” the report notes. “This threshold has historically marked severe stress across long-term cohorts.” You may also like: History Says Thanksgiving Is Bearish for Bitcoin — Can This Year Be Different?

Offchain Signals Echo Caution The report offered three key metrics to support this conclusion. Futures open interest is unwinding, funding rates are neutral, and leverage across major assets has faded. First, futures open interest is falling alongside price. They’re “steadily unwinding the leverage accumulated during earlier rallies.” The leaner leverage base lowers the odds of sharp, liquidation-driven volatility. But it also reflects a more cautious, defensive positioning across futures markets. Meanwhile, perpetual funding rates have largely been neutral, occasionally dipping into the negative zone. Per the report, “this marks a clear shift from the consistently positive funding typical of more speculative phases, signalling a more balanced and cautious derivatives environment.” Source: Glassnode Moreover, “neither aggressive short exposure nor strong long interest is taking control, leaving the market in a tentative state of fragile equilibrium as traders wait for clearer signals before committing to direction.” Finally, in the options market, volatility-arbitrage strategies and renewed demand for risk management have pushed BTC-denominated options open interest to its highest level ever. All signals point to a market preparing for volatility into the December expiry. This upcoming expiry is likely to be one of the most significant in the near term, the analysts argue.

The case of Cardano (ADA) exemplifies the challenge of many already existing layer-one blockchains that has fallen by over 30% since the start of October and is closing in on the year-to-date low. The abrupt downturn because of the perception of a lagging ecosystem development and its strong correlation of approximately 0.85 to the price of Bitcoin indicates additional downward pressure might be experienced before a possible reversal. In this regard, smart money is applying their capital to promising and low entry point presales that display evident progress. For example, those interested in cheap cryptos with maximal possible gains will see the paradigm shift from the faltering large altcoins to promising and momentum-guaranteed projects. The Turbulent Way of Cardano Cardano is challenged by various internal and external factors that might cause the downturn to continue. The prime worry of the investors revolves around the relative slower development of the ecosystem when contrasted with other layer-1 altcoins such as Solana; this remains a factor pushing funds out of ADA. From a purely technical point of view, the asset looks heavily oversold at RSI of 24 levels but is yet underneath all the important Moving Averages in the predominant bearish trend. However, the information from the on-chain analytics provides a slight hope of a possible reversal through the MVRV metric that suggests the asset is in an “Extreme Buy Zone” because of the accumulation of the asset through the whale wallets. Short-term estimates expect ADA to retest the support level of $0.30 due to continuous pressure and liquidations from the larger market. A Presale Phase Nearing Total Allocation As Cardano looks for a bottom, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) opens a clear and rapidly closing window of opportunity through its almost finalized presale phase 6. The platform has already accumulated a robust war chest of $19,020,000 from its supportive community of 18,250 holders, which reflects immense market faith. The presale has entered its sixth phase and has sold 95% of its tokens at the feasible price of $0.035. This is a rather large jump of 250% from the previous phase’s price and will surely attract many buyers. This phase will soon be sold out, which will be the final buying opportunity for MUTM at this price before it moves to $0.040 in the next phase. Being a step closer to the final price of $0.06 at the time of the launch makes this project one of the best cheap cryptos to consider buying at this point. Dual Lending The investment thesis of Mutuum Finance can be reinforced by its innovative approach to its protocol architecture and its two-layered lending framework. The two-layered framework combines two markets: the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools of high liquidity assets such as ETH and USDT, which provide automated yields, as well as the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets that support custom loans of various digital assets. This combined architecture also helps the platform achieve efficiency in capital usage and accessibility. The platform’s ability to provide solutions to various use cases makes Mutuum Finance create a resilient and attractive utility layer compared to various single-purpose protocols. This makes the platform a strong contender within the competition to grow its portfolio. Ironclad Security Protocols In the industry where security hacks can be devastating, the team at Mutuum Finance takes a proactive approach to ensure the platform’s integrity through rigorous and third-party verification. The lending and borrowing smart contract of the project is undergoing an audit at the hands of Halborn Security, which is a trusted name in the field of cybersecurity. The move helps ensure the security of the platform before it actually deals with real money. As an investor comparing various projects to invest in, this due diligence effort makes the investment almost risk-free and puts MUTM at the forefront of the best cryptos to buy in the risk-averse market. Secure Your Position Before the Leap The disparity between the uncertain recovery of Cardano’s ADA and the proven presale success of the MUTM token makes this decision clear cut. A possible trading bounce from oversold levels might be found in ADA, but MUTM delivers measured entry into a project which will soon be launched. The ability to participate at the $0.035 price level will soon be lost as Phase 6 is almost sold out. Investors looking to buy a cheap cryptocurrency that has the ability to grow explosively because of its innovative tech and security will not be able to wait.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Reports show that about 45% of those deposits came in chunks of 100 BTC or more, and on one day large transfers reached 7,000 BTC. The average deposit size in November rose to 1.23 BTC, the largest monthly figure in a year. Those numbers point to more than casual rebalancing; they point to coins being moved where they can be sold. Binance Stablecoins Hit Record According to market coverage, Binance’s stablecoin holdings climbed to a record $51 billion. At the same time, BTC and Ether inflows to exchanges swelled to roughly $40 billion this week, with Binance and Coinbase leading the move. Traders often park funds in dollar-pegged tokens when they want to wait on the sidelines. That build-up means cash is available, but it is sitting idle until sellers either step back or buyers turn up again. Bitcoin exchange inflows are rising as the price drops to ~87K, a seven-month low. Large deposits (100+ BTC) now make up 45% of all inflows, hitting 7K BTC on Nov 21. Large holders are increasingly sending BTC to exchanges, reinforcing the current downtrend. pic.twitter.com/UpN4rAL0FH — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 26, 2025 Analysts Eye Further Pullback Some market watchers warn the recent recovery could be only a pause, flagging remaining margin positions and suggested a test of lower levels. They said a wick into the $70k–$80k zone would be one way to clear out the last pockets of exposure. 10x Research put resistance levels at $92,000 and $101,000 as the key ranges to watch during any rebound. For context, Bitcoin had clawed back above $90,000 and was trading slightly higher at the time of reporting, but it remains down about 28% from the all-time high north of $126,000 reached in October. Short-Term Bounce, Not A Full Recovery Meanwhile, market moves in stocks and crypto have shown mixed signals. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were pushing gains as investors bet on a US Fed rate cut, and that helped risk assets. Yet reports from strategists show the usual close link between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq has weakened, with Bitcoin’s decline steeper in recent weeks. Ether and many altcoins also faced higher exchange inflows, and several tokens returned to bear-market lows as selling pressure widened. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Reenters ETH Market, Fires Off A $44-M Long What This Means Next Liquidity is present but it is parked in stablecoins, and big holders are still moving assets toward exchanges. A meaningful rally will likely need either heavy buying demand or a clear catalyst that draws those stablecoins back into risk assets. For now, the market sits in a waiting mode: a short rally could continue, but a deeper dip remains possible as positions get cleared and sellers complete their rotations.

Liquidity in the U.S. financial system reached a multi-year low of $5.56 trillion on Oct. 30, according to the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury. The sustained six-week period of government shutdown blocked roughly $621 billion from entering the U.S. market. To date, approximately $70 billion has been injected into the economy following the end of the government shutdown on November 12. According to Ark Invest estimates, roughly $300 billion more could be injected into the market over the next five to six weeks.

ARKW ETF was up 1.82%, trading at $ 150.10, and ARKF ETF was up 2.40%, trading at $48.78. The three ETFs added to Coinbase as equities and crypto benchmarks rose in response to the expected Fed easing rate cuts in December. Meanwhile, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood wrote on X today that the current liquidity squeeze, which has been limiting the rise of crypto and AI-related markets, is set to reverse in the next few weeks. Wood’s company predicted in April a 2030 Bitcoin price target of $1.5 million in its bull case and a $300,000 price target in its bear case. Wood affirms the net $1.5 million bull price remains unchanged Cathie Wood, Ark Invest CEO, explained that stablecoins have accelerated, taking on some of the roles initially held by BTC, as expected, but the gold price appreciation has been greater than expected. She spoke during a webinar on Monday, noting that the net bull price for the company hasn’t changed despite the recent crypto market correction and stablecoins taking on the role of BTC as a safe-haven asset. The U.S. Federal Reserve officials have publicly signaled a potential rate cut in December. For instance, New York Fed President John Williams’ recent remarks were interpreted as a signal of support for rate cuts. According to CME data, the futures market forecasted a 90% chance of a near-term rate cut. Meanwhile, the Treasury General Account remains inflated at $892 billion, compared to its normal level of approximately $600 billion, indicating that liquidity is poised to return. The September unemployment rate stood at 4.44%. ADP reported that 13,500 jobs were lost last week, retail sales slowed, and the core Producer Price Index came in below expectations. All these statistics point to a potential rate cut in December. The Fed is also expected to end quantitative tightening (QT) on December 1, a process by which the Fed allows securities to mature without reinvestment. According to Ark Invest, the end of QT is likely to increase liquidity and a positive sentiment towards investors to reopen risk exposures.

Here’s What to Expect Next,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-printed-historic-divergence-heres-what-to-expect-next/,"Few signals in crypto charts grab attention like a bullish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). XRP recently printed such a signal on its daily chart, echoing the decisive bottom seen in mid-2022. According to trading analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO, this setup could mark an important turning point for XRP. In June 2022, XRP hit a low of $0.30. The RSI already hinted at weakening selling momentum, even as the price made lower lows. This divergence signaled that bearish pressure was fading. The subsequent rebound proved substantial, with XRP climbing more than 100% from those lows. The RSI measures price momentum on a scale from 0 to 100. When price makes lower lows, but RSI forms higher lows, it often signals a trend reversal. Traders use this as an early warning of weakening bearish pressure. $XRP just printed the same bullish divergence on the RSI we had at the 2022 bear market bottom. This could get interesting fast pic.twitter.com/YZ0OfmCufP — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 26, 2025 The Significance of the New Divergence The recent XRP chart shows a similar pattern: price has formed lower lows while the RSI prints higher lows. Steph highlights that this mirrors the June 2022 setup. If history repeats, this could signal that bulls are preparing to regain control. It is important to note that divergences are not guaranteed indicators. Sometimes the price continues downward despite the RSI signal. Traders often wait for extra confirmation, like volume increases or trendline breaks. Potential Market Outcomes If buyers assert themselves, XRP could see a rapid rebound . Historical behavior suggests the potential for meaningful gains. On the other hand, if selling pressure persists, the divergence may fail, leading to sideways movement or further declines. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current market conditions remain mixed. XRP faces resistance levels, and broader crypto sentiment remains uncertain. However, the divergence makes XRP a coin worth monitoring closely. Why Traders Are Watching Closely For both long-term investors and traders, this setup offers a unique risk/reward scenario. The potential for a strong reversal is attractive, but caution is necessary. False signals do occur, and risk management remains essential. Steph’s analysis points to a setup similar to the 2022 bottom. If confirmation arrives, XRP could be on the verge of one of its most significant moves in 2025 . Discipline and patience remain critical for capitalizing on this opportunity. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

KAS, FLR, SKY Rise While Caution Lingers In Altcoin Season",https://cryptonews.com/news/has-crypto-fear-peaked-kas-flr-sky-rise-while-caution-lingers-in-altcoin-season/,"Extreme fear still dominates crypto t rading; the Crypto Fear and Greed gauge rose to 18 today, only slightly above last week’s low readings around 10, which marked the deepest stress since the index appeared. Bitcoin is currently trading above the $90,000 level , marking a 4% increase over the past day. It moves around liquidation zones rather than fresh territory, with outflows from some structured products and concern over global growth still shaping decisions in major venues. Within that backdrop, most altcoins continue to show weak weekly charts, yet a handful of names move higher in spite of caution. Kaspa, Flare, and SKY sit in that group today, each posting double-digit gains from yesterday’s levels, which gives a narrow look at the kind of stories that still attract attention when market participants remain nervous. Fear and Greed Index (Source: CoinMarketCap) Kaspa: High Throughput Story Keeps Interest Alive Kaspa is trading near $0.059 , up by about 16% in 24 hours, after a stretch of heavy trading that lifted both volume and open interest compared with earlier sessions this month. The latest leg is mainly linked to continued interest in its proof of work design that targets fast confirmation times and parallel block production, together with steady miner engagement despite weaker conditions across many other mining-focused coins. Liquidity on larger exchanges remains workable, with depth across key pairs supporting rotation between Bitcoin, stablecoins, and Kaspa itself, and that structure helps the token hold intraday gains even while fear readings stay in extreme territory. Flare: Data And Reward Programs Support Move Flare’s FLR token is trading near $0.015, up by roughly 13% on the day, with 24-hour volume higher than last week’s average. Flare Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The interest ties to its focus on data feeds and cross-chain connectivity, together with reward programs that continue to distribute incentives to holders and participants in staking and delegation routes. Those mechanisms keep yield-oriented accounts engaged during a period when many speculative plays lose volume. Order books show a steady two-way flow around current levels, with liquidity providers still active across major trading pairs. That pattern, combined with the ongoing rollout of integrations and incentive rounds, helps FLR stay in watchlists for desks that prefer assets with recurring network activity instead of one-time promotional bursts. SKY: Smaller Cap Rotation During Quiet Conditions SKY is trading near $0.047 at the time of writing, up around 11% in 24 hours according to price aggregates, and sits within the smaller cap bracket where swings often look sharper during thin sessions. Public feeds and trading data do not point to a single large announcement in recent days, which suggests that the move relates more to rotation into names that still provide liquidity for shorter-term strategies than to a fresh structural change inside the project itself. As institutional adoption accelerates and markets evolve, risk management is at the center of the conversation. Sky Connect Panel #1: • Sam MacPherson ( @sparkdotfi ) • Merlin Egalite ( @Morpho ) • Marcin Kazmierczak ( @CredoraNetwork ) Hosted by @CamiRusso on The Defiant Stage pic.twitter.com/Ia9fN8EV1Y — Sky (@SkyEcosystem) November 26, 2025 Volume today runs above prior days while spreads remain manageable on active markets, giving traders room to move in and out without extreme slippage. That setup matches periods when selective appetite returns for secondary tokens, even though attention and capital remain concentrated in larger ecosystems and in simple Bitcoin or stablecoin exposure. Altcoin Season Remains Fragmented Under Extreme Fear Altcoin season metrics still sit low , and performance across most large caps this month underlines how far the market remains from a wide, synchronized rally. The combination of extreme fear in the market and slower flows into complex products keeps many portfolios tilted toward caution, which suppresses the probability of an immediate shift into aggressive rotation across the entire altcoin space. Against that setting, today’s gains in Kaspa, Flare, and SKY point to pockets of activity rather than a new phase for the cycle. Projects that can point to ongoing technical narratives, live reward programs, or workable liquidity still manage to attract attention on specific days, yet until fear readings recover more clearly and Bitcoin stabilizes in a tighter range, altcoin season is likely to remain fragmented and selective instead of broad and sustained.

The United Kingdom is taking a monumental step toward creating a favorable DeFi tax framework that could transform how investors interact with decentralized finance. This groundbreaking proposal addresses one of the biggest pain points for crypto users – the complex tax treatment of DeFi transactions. What Makes This DeFi Tax Framework So Revolutionary? The current UK tax system often treats depositing crypto into DeFi protocols as a taxable event. However, the proposed ‘No Gain, No Loss’ approach changes everything. This means you won’t pay capital gains tax until you actually convert your assets to cash and realize genuine profits. This new DeFi tax framework represents a significant shift in how authorities view cryptocurrency transactions. Instead of taxing every movement within the DeFi ecosystem, the focus shifts to actual profit realization. This approach acknowledges the unique nature of DeFi operations and provides much-needed clarity for investors. How Will This New DeFi Tax Framework Benefit You? The proposed changes offer substantial advantages for UK-based DeFi users. Here are the key benefits: Tax Deferral : You only pay capital gains tax when converting to fiat currency Reduced Complexity : Simplified reporting requirements for DeFi activities Increased Participation : More confidence to engage in DeFi protocols Competitive Advantage : UK becomes more attractive for crypto businesses This progressive DeFi tax framework could position the UK as a global leader in cryptocurrency regulation. The CEO of Aave described this move as a major victory, highlighting how it recognizes the practical realities of using DeFi platforms. What Challenges Does This DeFi Tax Framework Solve? Previously, investors faced significant hurdles when participating in DeFi. The existing system created tax liabilities even when no actual profit was realized. This discouraged many from exploring DeFi opportunities and complicated tax reporting. The new DeFi tax framework addresses these challenges head-on. By deferring taxes until actual cash conversion, it eliminates the tax burden on intermediate DeFi transactions. This approach makes the system fairer and more practical for everyday users. When Can We Expect This DeFi Tax Framework Implementation? While the proposal is still in development, the momentum suggests positive changes ahead. The UK tax authority’s willingness to adapt shows recognition of DeFi’s growing importance. This forward-thinking approach could set a precedent for other nations considering similar reforms. The implementation of this DeFi tax framework would mark a significant milestone in cryptocurrency regulation. It demonstrates how governments can create supportive environments while maintaining proper oversight and tax collection. Conclusion: A Bright Future for UK DeFi Investors The proposed DeFi tax framework represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency regulation in the United Kingdom. By creating a more favorable tax environment, the UK positions itself as a forward-thinking jurisdiction that understands and supports technological innovation. This progressive approach to the DeFi tax framework could unlock new opportunities for investors and businesses alike. As the proposal moves forward, it promises to make DeFi participation more accessible and financially sensible for everyone involved. Frequently Asked Questions What is the ‘No Gain, No Loss’ approach in the DeFi tax framework? The ‘No Gain, No Loss’ approach means capital gains tax is deferred until you convert your crypto assets to cash and realize actual profits, rather than taxing every DeFi transaction. How will this DeFi tax framework affect current DeFi users? Current DeFi users will benefit from simplified tax reporting and deferred tax payments until they cash out their investments, making DeFi participation more financially efficient. When is this new DeFi tax framework expected to take effect? While no specific timeline is provided, the proposal shows significant progress and suggests changes could be implemented in the near future as the UK tax authority continues its review. Does this DeFi tax framework apply to all cryptocurrency transactions? The framework specifically addresses DeFi transactions like lending and liquidity provision, while other crypto transactions may still follow existing tax rules. Will this make the UK more attractive for crypto businesses? Yes, this progressive DeFi tax framework could position the UK as a leading destination for cryptocurrency businesses and investors seeking favorable regulatory environments. How does this compare to other countries’ approaches to DeFi taxation? The UK’s proposed DeFi tax framework appears more progressive than many other jurisdictions, potentially setting a new standard for crypto-friendly regulation worldwide.

RSI Break Hints at Surge Ahead,https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-eth-set-for-lift-off-rsi-break-hints-at-surge-ahead/,"Ethereum (ETH) has bounced from a key support level, now trading above $3,000, up 4% in the past 24 hours. The move followed a recovery from the $2,600–$2,700 zone, an area that has seen strong buying interest in the past. Volume has picked up during this move, with over $21.2 billion traded in the last day. Some analysts suggest a trend change may be developing, though confirmation is still needed. RSI Breakout and Short-Term Setup ETH has broken above its RSI downtrend for the first time since October. This jump comes alongside the price stabilizing above the $2,900 support level. Mister Crypto commented that “a bounce is very likely here,” pointing to improving momentum. $ETH is breaking out from this RSI downtrend. A bounce is very likely here! pic.twitter.com/HFoNtztcxx — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) November 26, 2025 Notably, the Relative Strength Index, which measures price strength, had been declining for weeks. A break above this trendline suggests that downward pressure may be slowing. Meanwhile, Lennaert Snyder marked $3,040 as a short-term resistance level. He called this a “ make or break ” zone and said that clearing it would open the way to $3,140 and $3,200. If ETH fails to hold, he sees the $2,950–$2,900 zone as possible support. The analyst also warned that losing this level could lead to a return to the $2,800 lows. Snyder added, “ If price gains $3,040, I’ll look to snipe a long ,” but noted that if ETH is rejected again, he would consider short positions. ETH/BTC Pair Nearing Breakout Pattern The ETH/BTC chart shows a rebound from the 0.0300–0.0325 BTC zone. ETH is now trading at about 0.0332 BTC. Michaël van de Poppe said this setup could lead to a breakout. “This cycle is far from over,” he said, referring to ETH’s broader structure. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Don pointed to a falling wedge forming inside a long-term descending channel. The price has moved above the wedge, and a breakout from the larger channel could push ETH/BTC toward the 0.0695 area. Large Wallet Activity and Exchange Supply Drop As CryptoPotato reported , wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH now control more than 21 million tokens. This is the highest level since Ethereum’s launch. Addresses with over 100,000 ETH have also increased holdings to around 4.3 million. Meanwhile, tokens held on exchanges continue to drop. This may show that larger holders are moving coins off trading platforms, possibly for long-term storage. Additionally, Ali Martinez noted that $2,250, $1,550, and $1,080 are “ strong zones to accumulate ETH ahead of the next rally .” The post Ethereum (ETH) Set for Lift-Off?

The fund, which began trading on NYSE Arca under the name “Franklin XRP Trust” (XRPZ), offers investors access to XRP through the regulated market. Thus, Franklin Templeton joins the ranks of XRP ETF issuers, following Bitwise, Grayscale, and Canary Capital. Making a statement after the launch of the XRP ETF, Franklin Templeton Digital Assets President Roger Bayston stated that basket ETFs will attract more attention than single ETFs. Speaking to The Block, Bayston stated that interest in cryptocurrency ETFs will continue to grow exponentially. Bayston acknowledged that single altcoin ETFs have attracted a lot of attention, but stated that the next wave of ETFs will be basket ETFs. “Single altcoin ETFs are very interesting. There is a lot of enthusiasm in the market for single crypto ETFs. But I think the next wave will be in diversified crypto ETFs. We look forward to providing our clients with diversified portfolios of cryptocurrencies.” Finally, Bayston stated that their goal as a company is not to produce single ETF products, and added that they are preparing new ETF models that offer various portfolios of cryptocurrencies for their customers instead of a single altcoin. Franklin Templeton's spot XRP ETF, which began trading on November 24, attracted a net inflow of $60 million on its first day of trading. *This is not investment advice.

The token now trades near the mid-$1.30 range after its steep pullback. Short squeeze reversal hits momentum ORCA’s surge on November 27 came after traders aggressively shorted the token in the aftermath of the $38 million Upbit hack involving Solana-linked assets. Negative funding rates signalled an overcrowded bearish trade, which later triggered one of the strongest ORCA squeezes of the year. As the Orca price began to rise, shorts scrambled to cover positions, pushing the token sharply higher in a cascade of forced buying. Orca Futures Open Interest surged to $22.7 million, reaching its highest level since April. That wave of leveraged activity powered the token above the $2 mark, but it also exposed it to a rapid cooldown once early longs started taking profits. The exaggerated unwinding explains why the recent pullback developed so quickly, even as traders remain watchful for the next move. Breakout tested after rapid selloff The rally also coincided with a technical breakout from a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. Indicators such as the RSI and MACD had pointed to strengthening bullish momentum as ORCA lifted from oversold levels. The shift encouraged momentum traders to enter the market, and the 24-hour trading volume surged more than 5,000% at the peak of the move. ORCA price analysis | Source: TradingView With the Orca coin price now retreating, the market is testing whether the breakout can hold. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.256 acts as the first major support after the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level gave way. If the token maintains this level, bulls may attempt to rebuild momentum toward the recent $1.524 resistance zone. A decisive close below support, however, could expose ORCA to deeper retracements toward the $1.055 technical floor. Strong Orca ecosystem growth counter market fear Beyond charts and liquidations, the broader backdrop for Orca still carries constructive signals. The Solana-based DEX has strengthened its position within the Solana ecosystem, supported by integrations such as Liquid Collective’s LsSOL and growing trading volumes. Governance proposals from the Orca DAO, including treasury-funded buybacks and new validator staking incentives, have reinforced bullish arguments about long-term demand for ORCA. While the Upbit hack cast temporary uncertainty over Solana-based assets, the exchange’s commitment to reimburse users helped limit the fallout. Strong ecosystem activity and expanded utility have countered some of the fear reflected in the broader crypto market, where sentiment remains weak. What’s next for the Orca coin price The next few trading sessions will determine whether ORCA’s recent drop marks a healthy correction or the start of a deeper cooldown. Eyes are on the support at $1.256, derivatives funding rates, and changes in Open Interest to gauge whether bullish pressure can return. If buyback plans progress and Solana’s DeFi sector continues to recover, ORCA could stabilise and work its way back toward key resistance levels. But for now, volatility remains high, and the Orca coin price continues to respond to shifts in both market sentiment and protocol developments.

This exact scenario is unfolding with Edel Finance, creating waves across the crypto community and raising serious questions about transparency in token launches. What Exactly Happened in the Edel Finance Token Controversy? The Edel Finance token controversy began when blockchain analysts discovered something alarming. Wallets connected to the project’s internal team acquired over 30% of the total EDEL token supply. This massive acquisition happened immediately after the token launch, despite the project publicly promoting a “fair launch” with only 12.7% allocated to team members. At current market prices, these holdings are valued at approximately $11 million. The timing and scale of these acquisitions have sparked outrage among investors who participated in what they believed was an equitable distribution process. How Does This Edel Finance Token Controversy Contradict Their Promises? The core of the Edel Finance token controversy lies in the stark contrast between their public statements and actual actions. The platform had explicitly stated in their tokenomics: Only 12.7% token allocation to team members Transparent fair launch principles Clear vesting schedules for insider holdings However, the reality proved dramatically different. The team’s acquisition of 30% tokens represents more than double their promised allocation. This discrepancy forms the heart of the ongoing Edel Finance token controversy that’s shaking investor confidence. What Was the Team’s Response to the Edel Finance Token Controversy? Edel Finance co-founder James Sherbon didn’t deny the acquisitions when confronted. Instead, he offered an explanation that has done little to calm concerned investors. Sherbon claimed the additional token acquisitions were part of a plan to place 60% of tokens into a vesting contract. However, critics highlight several problematic aspects: The plan wasn’t announced beforehand It directly contradicted published tokenomics Obfuscation techniques were used in transactions No clear communication timeline for vesting release Why Does This Edel Finance Token Controversy Matter to Crypto Investors? This Edel Finance token controversy represents more than just one project’s missteps. It highlights crucial issues that affect the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. When projects deviate from their published tokenomics, it undermines the trust that forms the foundation of decentralized finance. Investors now face important questions about due diligence and the need for better verification mechanisms. The Edel Finance token controversy serves as a stark reminder that published documents don’t always reflect actual practices. What Can We Learn From This Edel Finance Token Controversy? The ongoing Edel Finance token controversy provides valuable lessons for both project teams and investors. For teams, it emphasizes the critical importance of transparency and sticking to published plans. For investors, it underscores the need for: Thorough blockchain analysis before investing Verification of team claims through on-chain data Understanding that published tokenomics might not tell the whole story Demanding clearer communication from project teams The Edel Finance token controversy ultimately demonstrates that in the rapidly evolving crypto space, trust must be earned through consistent actions rather than just promises. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of tokens did Edel Finance team acquire? The internal team acquired over 30% of the total EDEL token supply, more than double their promised 12.7% allocation. How much are the controversially acquired tokens worth? At current prices, the team’s additional token acquisitions are valued at approximately $11 million. Did Edel Finance deny the allegations? No, co-founder James Sherbon didn’t deny the acquisitions but claimed they were part of a plan to place tokens in vesting contracts. What makes this different from normal team allocations? The controversy stems from the discrepancy between published tokenomics and actual actions, plus the lack of advance communication about the changes. How were the transactions discovered? Blockchain analysts identified wallet addresses linked to the project team that acquired tokens immediately after launch. What should investors look for in future token launches? Investors should verify on-chain data, look for transparent communication, and be wary of projects that deviate from published tokenomics.

At this point, according to XRP Insights data, four new XRP ETFs, including Grayscale GXRP and Franklin Templeton XRPZ, amassed approximately 80 million XRP within 24 hours of their launch on the 24th. This figure reportedly surpassed the initial inflows recorded in the recently launched spot Solana (SOL) ETF. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost also said that Binance’s XRP holdings have also been steadily decreasing since last month, dropping to around 2.7 billion. Stating that this figure is one of the lowest levels recorded for Binance, the analyst emphasized that the decrease in XRP assets means that investors are withdrawing XRP from Binance and moving it to their personal wallets. Stating that this situation is a positive sign for XRP, the analyst stated that XRP could move into a more constructive phase with increasing institutional interest. As interest in XRP continues to grow, analyst Peter Brandt, one of the well-known names in the financial world, shared an optimistic forecast for XRP. While Brandt didn't explicitly mention XRP, Thinking Crypto Podcast host Tony Edward immediately knew which chart he was referring to and pointed to XRP. At this point, legendary analyst Brandt hinted that XRP could perform quite well in the coming months. *This is not investment advice.

As the ADA price faces resistance, investors are watching to see if it can break through to higher targets. While Cardano addresses its own growth and challenges, a new project called GeeFi is emerging with a clear focus on simplifying the crypto experience for everyone, offering a fresh opportunity for investors. Navigating Crypto’s Growing Pains Cardano’s ecosystem is expanding, with the launch of a card that allows users to spend ADA and other cryptocurrencies. However, a recent network disruption that caused a temporary chain split highlights the technical hurdles that even established blockchains face. While developers work to strengthen the network and push ADA toward the $1 mark, these events remind us that the crypto world can still be complex and unpredictable for users. GeeFi was built to eliminate this complexity. Developed since 2023, the project provides a unified and user-friendly crypto solution. Its mobile app, which is already available on Android with an iOS version in development, features the non-custodial GeeFi Wallet . This wallet supports over 14 blockchains , allowing you to manage all of your assets from a single, secure interface, shielding you from the technical issues common in the crypto space. The Presale That Could Be a Game-Changer While Cardano works to overcome its technical challenges, the GeeFi (GEE) token presale offers a unique opportunity to invest in a project with enormous growth potential from its earliest stage. The most successful crypto investors often identify projects with strong fundamentals before they become widely known, and many analysts are flagging GeeFi’s GEE token as a potential 100x gem . The presale, which started on November 17, 2025 , has already gained significant traction, raising over $300,000 and selling more than 6.2 million GEE tokens . This strong initial performance reflects growing confidence in the project’s vision. The GEE token is currently priced at just $0.05 , but its planned listing price of $0.40 could deliver a 700% return for early investors. With some analysts predicting it could reach $2 , a $1,500 investment today could potentially grow to $60,000 , a remarkable 3,900% ROI . A Complete Ecosystem Built for You GeeFi is creating more than just a wallet; it’s building a full financial ecosystem. The team is also developing the GeeFi HUB , a web-based dashboard for comprehensive portfolio management. The HUB will include an integrated decentralized exchange ( GeeFi DEX ) for direct trading and on/off-ramp services to easily convert between crypto and traditional currencies. This strong utility is a primary reason analysts are so optimistic about GEE becoming the next 100x gem . The GEE token is the key to unlocking the platform’s full potential. By staking GEE, you can earn up to 55% APR for a 12-month lock-in, promoting long-term value and community growth. Stakers will also receive exclusive benefits for the upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card , such as higher cashback rewards and lower fees. This utility-driven model is designed to increase the token’s value as the platform attracts more users, making it a project with immense potential.

55000534,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=858821,1764262808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/55000534.jpeg,"Ethereum Is 58% ‘Undervalued’ Based On Intrinsic Metrics, Says Hashed CEO",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-is-58-undervalued-hashed-ceo/,"Ethereum is trading far below its modeled “intrinsic value,” according to a live valuation dashboard launched by Hashed CEO Simon Kim. On ETHval (ethval.com), the current snapshot shows Ethereum at a spot price of $3,034.0 while the reliability-weighted “Composite Fair Value” stands at $4,777.5, implying +57.8% upside versus the market. The median fair value across models is $4,026.68, or +33.8% above spot. The dashboard labels ETH “UNDERVALUED” and aggregates its eight models into five buy, one hold and two sell signals. How The Fair Value Of Ethereum Is Calculated Kim introduced the project on X with the explicit goal of shifting the discussion away from pure sentiment: “What is ETH actually worth? The crypto industry deserves better than price speculation. I built a dashboard to think about ETH’s intrinsic value with 8 models… Far from perfect and open to feedback.” ETHval makes those models and their outputs fully visible, along with their individual reliability tags. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Recover Or Crash? The Real ‘Leverage Point’ Investors Should Know About The tool’s central panel breaks out each valuation. The TVL Multiple model, which prices ETH off total value locked in DeFi using a 7× TVL-to-market-cap anchor, assigns a fair value of $4,026.6, judging ETH 32.7% undervalued (reliability: medium). A more conservative MC/TVL Fair Value mean-reversion model, treated as high reliability, lands at $3,453.1, only 13.8% above spot and classified as “fair.” Models that embed stronger network-effect or cash-flow claims are far more aggressive. The DCF (Staking) framework, which discounts an implied perpetual stream of staking rewards, values ETH at $9,101.9, indicating it is 200.0% undervalued. A high-reliability Metcalfe’s Law implementation, which scales value with TVL to the power of 1.5, is even more bullish at $9,585.9, or 216.8% above the current price. The Ethereum L2 ecosystem model, which adds twice the TVL of major rollups to Ethereum mainnet TVL before applying a multiple, generates a fair value of $4,640.0, implying 52.9% undervaluation, although ETHval marks this model’s reliability as low. A Staking Scarcity model, also low reliability and based on liquid-supply contraction, prices ETH at $3,538.2, or 16.6% undervalued. Related Reading: Ethereum Steadies Near $2,900 as Fed Rate-Cut Odds Fuel $3,400 Rebound Hopes Two income-style models push in the opposite direction and still receive high reliability scores. The P/E Ratio (25×) model treats annualized protocol fees as “earnings,” applies a 25× multiple and arrives at a fair value of only $957.4, reading ETH as 68.4% overvalued. The Revenue Yield model reverse-engineers price from a target protocol yield of 2.5%; at current revenue levels it outputs $1,531.8, implying 49.5% overvaluation. To synthesize these conflicting signals, ETHval applies a disclosed weighting scheme: high-reliability models are multiplied by 9, medium by 5 and low by 2 when computing the $4,780.7 composite. That weighting, combined with the extreme upside implied by the DCF and Metcalfe models, is what drives the overall conclusion that Ethereum is strongly undervalued despite two respected frameworks pointing to downside. The dashboard itself stops short of making investment recommendations. Underneath the numbers, ETHval reiterates that the outputs are for reference only and that each model rests on explicit, debatable assumptions. But by fixing the current ETH price at $3,034.0 against a live fair-value band stretching from $957.4 on the bearish end to $9,585.9 on the most bullish, Kim’s site quantifies a debate that usually plays out in anecdotes and narratives—and, for now, that quantified view leans clearly toward Ethereum being undervalued. At press time, ETH traded at $3,029.

The new framework, published on November 26 under Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2263, establishes strict requirements for how crypto firms collect, store, and report user information to tax authorities. It represents one of the EU’s most far-reaching attempts to tighten oversight of digital assets, and it will apply from January 1, 2026. New DAC8 Rules Force Standardised Crypto Reporting Across the EU At the centre of the changes is the expansion of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8), which mandates the automatic exchange of information between EU member states. The updated rules require crypto-asset service providers to report customer holdings and transactions in a standardised digital format. These reports will then be shared among tax authorities across the EU, giving regulators a much clearer view of crypto activity. The Commission says the goal is to “facilitate the communication of information” and ensure that all member states report the same level of detail. The regulation lays out technical rules, including new standard forms, a unified computerised reporting format, and the creation of a detailed Crypto-Asset Operator register. Every reporting crypto operator will be assigned a 10-digit identification number, beginning with an ISO country code, to streamline cross-border supervision. Under the amendments, information deleted from the operator register must still be retained for up to 12 months, showing the EU’s focus on continuity in regulatory oversight. Member states will also be required to update the Commission annually on their assessments using the newly issued reporting templates. EU’s Incoming Crypto Data Rules Spark Fresh Privacy Debate The new framework sits alongside other major rules coming into force. The Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) , which extends the “travel rule” to crypto, takes effect on December 30, 2024. Eurogroup President and Ireland's Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said that the EU would track crypto transfers for more transparency. #EU #CryptoTransactions #AMLR https://t.co/4lm0piAi3l — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 9, 2025 It requires exchanges and wallet providers to identify both senders and recipients for transfers, including interactions with self-hosted wallets. For transactions above €1,000, users may be asked to verify ownership of their private wallets. The broader regulatory package also works in tandem with MiCA , the EU’s flagship crypto framework, and the bloc’s upcoming anti-money laundering rules. Large crypto operators will need to carry out customer due diligence, report suspicious activity, and provide energy-consumption disclosures. The European Commission is also pushing for deeper integration of supervisory powers. According to recent proposals, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) could soon take direct oversight of major cross-border exchanges and clearing houses. Supporters, including ECB President Christine Lagarde, argue that fragmented national supervision has weakened the EU’s ability to enforce consistent rules. ESMA chair Verena Ross noted that every member state had to build its own crypto supervision framework, calling the duplication “a heavy burden” on regulators and industry. However, the plan faces resistance. Luxembourg, Malta, and Ireland have warned that shifting power to a central authority may disadvantage smaller financial hubs and raise compliance costs for firms operating under MiCA’s passporting regime. The privacy debate extends far beyond Europe. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), the G20’s top financial watchdog, recently warned that strict privacy laws around the world are limiting cross-border cooperation. In its latest review, the FSB said regulators from different jurisdictions often struggle to access the data they need to assess risks in the crypto market. It added that confidentiality rules delay information requests and, in some cases, halt cooperation entirely. For EU users, the new rules mean greater visibility for regulators into trading behaviour, wallet flows, and even changes in operator registration. While the measures are framed as tools to fight tax fraud, market abuse, and financial crime, they also raise questions about how much data governments should collect from crypto participants.

XRP Army Responds,https://timestabloid.com/whats-your-xrp-price-prediction-for-the-end-of-november-xrp-army-responds/,"The closing weeks of November have always been dramatic for XRP. This year, the token’s moderate rally has reignited hope. Community sentiment is divided, with some expecting a surge and others predicting stagnation. The latest discussions on X revealed just how polarized XRP holders remain. XRPcryptowolf recently asked followers for their end-of-November price predictions. The thread quickly filled with diverse opinions. “Angry Crypto Show” forecast $5.89, reflecting strong optimism. Derik Aasan offered a conservative $2.10–$2.50, highlighting exchange liquidity as a limiting factor. “The Real Bob C” suggested a wide $1.78–$50.47 range, while David predicted $2.20, expressing frustration over market inactivity. Market Reality: Technical Analysis and Price Trends Current trading data shows XRP hovering at $2.18. It recently slipped below the crucial $2.20 support level, signaling cautious investor sentiment. Technical indicators show XRP trading below its 30-day and 200-day moving averages, which often limit short-term upside. Analysts point out that without a catalyst, a major breakout remains unlikely. Machine learning forecasts from Finbold predict a modest end-of-month rally to $2.30–$2.45. This aligns more closely with conservative community forecasts, showing limited upside if market conditions remain unchanged. What’s your $XRP price prediction for the end of November? — XRPcryptowolf (@XRPcryptowolf) November 26, 2025 Extreme Predictions vs. Reasonable Estimates The extreme highs and lows in the XRP community reflect differing beliefs about market triggers. Optimists anticipate that thinning exchange liquidity could spark a strong price rally. They expect institutional buying or favorable macro events to push XRP higher. Conversely, skeptics focus on structural resistance, weak volumes, and macro challenges as constraints. “The Real Bob C” and “Angry Crypto Show” represent extreme bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, David and Derik Aasan illustrate cautious realism, balancing hope with technical constraints. AI Forecast AI forecasts are increasingly shaping community discussion. According to a previous report, Grok predicts $3.25 by November 30, 2025. This forecast assumes growing institutional adoption, rising on-chain activity, and ETF momentum. Grok’s prediction sits between conservative and extreme views, offering a realistic bullish scenario. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If key catalysts appear, such as reduced exchange supply or strong buying pressure, XRP could reach Grok’s target. The AI model provides a midpoint forecast, avoiding both panic and hype. Analyst Consensus and Likely Outcomes Independent analyst projections generally point to modest gains. Chart-based models suggest a potential $3.00–$3.05 breakout if XRP clears resistance around $2.75–$2.80. Analysts highlight that market behavior depends on both supply dynamics and institutional demand. Taken together, predictions fall into three main categories: modest bullish around $2.25–$2.45, realistic bullish near $3.00–$3.25, and extreme bullish above $5, which requires near-perfect market conditions. What’s Most Plausible Given current technicals, sentiment, and AI input, XRP finishing between $3.00–$3.25 seems most likely. Conservative estimates suggest $2.30–$2.50, while extreme moonshot predictions remain improbable. Community opinions and AI forecasts like Grok’s highlight optimism but also the need for caution. XRP’s final November price depends on exchange liquidity, institutional activity, and market sentiment, which remain unpredictable.

It has outperformed many leading digital assets, including Ripple’s XRP, within that timeframe, and according to multiple market observers, it may rise even more in the near future. What Happened and What’s Next? The token has pumped by 40% in the last seven days, with most of the gains coming in the past 24 hours. Currently, it trades at roughly $0.06 (per CoinGecko’s data) with a market capitalization of approximately $1.6 billion. This places KAS as the 72nd-largest cryptocurrency, or bigger than Worldcoin (WLD), Algorand (ALGO), Arbitrum (ARB), and other popular altcoins. KAS Price, Source: CoinGecko The primary catalyst for the latest pump seems to be the opening of the first decentralized Kaspa bridge. Just hours ago, the X account behind Dymension revealed that KAS was voted in as a new base asset on the platform. The ascent caught the eye of numerous analysts who believe this could be the start of a major rally. X user EuroSniper envisioned the potential jump to $0.16 in the following months. Crypto King predicted a similar outcome, outlining several factors that may support the bullish scenario, including clearing the multi-month downtrend and holding the $0.05 zone as support. Crypto Tony, an X user with over 550,000 followers who touches upon the performance of numerous cryptocurrencies, also chipped in. The analyst hoped for a further surge to $0.074, saying their “longs need it.” The Bearish Scenario While KAS’s recent revival is indeed significant, its current price is far below the peak levels seen during the summer of 2024. Back then, the asset’s valuation shot to $0.20, whereas its market capitalization neared $5 billion. Some technical indicators suggest KAS might not be able to reclaim its former glory (at least in the near future) and could be headed for a pullback. The recent exchange netflow is among those elements. According to data provided by CoinGlass, inflows have surpassed outflows over the past week, suggesting that investors have abandoned self-custody methods and flocked to centralized exchanges. This is generally considered bearish since it is interpreted as the step before selling.

While the broader crypto market continues to reel, the “Fear & Greed” index is firmly in “extreme fear” territory; however, a few emerging token projects are defying the trend. Below are three of the best altcoins to buy for investors looking for early-stage tokens with disruptive potential this Black Friday. At the top of the list is Digitap ($TAP) , the world’s first “omni-bank,” targeting a total addressable market in the hundreds of millions. Digitap ($TAP) : The creator of a fintech superbank app that blends fiat with crypto. BlockDAG (BDAG): A new layer-1 blockchain promising next-generation performance. BlockchainFX (BFX): An all-in-one decentralized multi-asset trading platform. Source: Digitap Digitap’s Utility Puts It High On Crypto To Buy Now Lists Digitap isn’t a typical crypto presale project; its live “omni-bank” platform can be downloaded on iOS and Android devices right now. The basic premise of Digitap is that it unifies traditional finance and crypto in one app. This all-in-one digital bank lets users send, receive, store, save, invest, and spend multiple fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Users can also spend their money with a Visa-branded card that can be preloaded with either fiat or crypto, which is automatically converted to fiat at the time of transaction. Essentially, Digitap blends an everyday bank account, a crypto wallet, and a debit card. Everything, from secure storage for more than 100 coins to offshore IBAN multi-currency accounts, lives under the same roof. Digitap’s optional no-KYC signup process provides a basic version of the app for users who don’t want to provide information or don’t have access to identification. There are around 800 million adults worldwide living in countries or regions where access to ID is difficult, if not impossible. As such, Digitap ranks as a top crypto to buy now because it provides the potential for real-world utility to hundreds of millions of users. These adults have been ignored or overlooked by big banks for years, but with Digitap, they can finally join the global financial community and transact with a modern fintech platform. Source: Digitap Digitap’s Hourly Black Friday Deals Begin in 24 Hours Digitap’s presale of its native $TAP is one of the few standout winners in the current crypto bear market. The $TAP token sale blasted past $2 million raised despite a sea of red in the crypto market. The presale is divided into stages, with the price of $TAP increasing after each round is complete. The token kicked off its presale in late summer at a price of $0.0125 and has since steadily climbed to $0.0326. However, the current stage is more than 90% complete, meaning investors who don’t buy the token very soon will have no option but to pay the next round price of $0.0334. Round-one investors are sitting on a more than 150% paper profit, which is nearly unheard of in this market environment. In fact, out of the top 100 crypto coins by market cap, only three have shown a return above 150% over the past three months. Digitap is pulling out all the stops for Black Friday. To celebrate the season, the team will launch a 96-hour event featuring a gamified presale widget that drops a new deal every hour. For four days straight, buyers can grab flash bonuses, extra token bundles, cashback credits, and free access to premium platform features. And this sale begins in less than 24 hours. BlockDAG’s $450M War Chest Raises The Execution Bar BlockDAG, a next-gen Layer 1 blockchain using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, is another presale project many label as the best crypto to buy now. BlockDAG promises investors high throughput and a “new era” of crypto scalability. So far, it has raised nearly $450 million in its presale, certainly making it one of the largest raises in recent memory. BlockDAG boasts a war chest that could position it to succeed. However, a deeper look reveals some red flags that keep it from being an altcoin to buy . First, BlockDAG claims its layer-1 will be able to handle more than 15,000 transactions per second, which makes it a highly speculative and risky play. But even if accurate, BlockDAG will still need to compete against established and trusted high-throughput networks like Solana, Avalanche, and Fantom. These rivals already have functioning ecosystems, developer traction, and real-world usage. If anything, BlockDAG is a prime example that bigger isn’t always better. It might have potential, but it lacks the traction, utility, and trust that other presales have demonstrated with their live products. Source: BlockDAG BlockchainFX’s Super-App Pitch Faces Crowded Competition BlockchainFX is another presale that many consider one of the best cryptos to buy now . BlockchainFX is a decentralized platform offering trading access and the ability to swap crypto, stocks, commodities, and more. The problem with BlockchainFX’s model is that it doesn’t solve any real-world problems. Users already have access to multiple trading platforms, such as eToro, that offer exposure to different asset classes. BlockchainFX would need to attract traders away from platforms that already offer deep liquidity. Also, the majority of traders aren’t really looking for an “all-in-one” platform. Crypto traders have no interest in starting to trade gold, while equity investors aren’t looking to add the USDJPY currency pair to their trading wishlists. Source: BlockchainFX Digitap’s 100x Case Looks Stronger Than Rival Presales BlockDAG has already raised hundreds of millions of dollars, implying it is worth billions of dollars today. Unless it can prove it is a better alternative to the likes of Ethereum and Avalanche, the token could just marginally gain ground. Similarly, the upside case for BlockchainFX is limited as it doesn’t really solve real problems or provide access to the unbanked community. Digitap, on the other hand, has the potential to gain 100x from its low valuation as a crypto presale project. Currently, Coinbase boasts 120 million users and trades on the Nasdaq at a $66 billion valuation. The math on this implies the market values each user at roughly $540. Applying a 50% haircut to Digitap, the company would need to onboard roughly 24 million users to justify a 100x return on its current valuation of around $65 million. This looks to be attainable, considering the market for the unbanked alone is roughly 800 million people. In other words, Digitap could handily justify a 100x return with a 3% market share of the global unbanked community, making it one of the best altcoins to buy . And with the Black Friday sale beginning tomorrow investors will be able to lock in fantastic entries this weekend.

According to analysts the following figures are an indication of an apparent upside and the further the presale goes in Phase 6 and over 90, the more the investors are gaining interest and urgency in the remaining supply. As the demand increases by the day, it is believed that this might be the breakout DeFi Crypto coin of early 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now one of the busiest emerging new crypto presales in 2025. Phase 6 is priced at $0.035 and interest has gained significantly in the Phase 6 as the allocation draws near the end. The project has collected approximately $18.9M and the number of holders has topped over 18.200. Of all the 4B available tokens, 45.5% are reserved to the presale. That is 1.82B tokens, and nearly 790M of the tokens already sold. One of its attractions has been the increment in price between Phase 1 and Phase 6. MUTM launched at $0.01 in early 2025. At $0.035 now that is a definite 250% growth. Phase 1 early purchasers are in good position with the established price of launch of 0.06 which will enable them to position for 500% token appreciation. Phase 6 is currently over 90% filled and according to analysts the remaining tokens are generally sold sooner than the previous stages as people do not wish to wait with a higher price in Phase 7. This rate provides a great momentum and puts even greater pressure on the remaining stock. What Mutuum Finance Is Building Mutuum Finance is developing a dual lending ecosystem to be developed on on-chain markets. It is aimed to ensure lending and borrowing are more transparent and efficient to crypto-users. The protocol will provide users with interest bearing tokens popularly known as mtTokens. As the users place assets in the system, they get mtTokens which appreciate as more yield is made to the pool. The buy-and-distribute model is also a major component of the system. Protocol revenue is purchased as a share, and they buy MUTM over the open market but pay user tokens, who stake on the safety module the mtTokens. This is a type of model that generates constant buying pressure once launched and analysts believe that this model can sustain growth in the long term. Security forms an important component of the project. Mutuum Finance also passed the CertiK audit with a high score of 90 of 100 of the Token Scan score and the team also offered a bug bounty of 50K to ensure the code is secured in the course of development. Stablecoin Plans Mutuum Finance will launch a USD pegged stablecoin earning interest on the lending protocol. According to the analysts, this makes the project a long-term revenue generator and provides real utility to DeFi users. A stable currency is also issued to enhance the liquidity and generate additional borrowing capacity within the platform. Another project being constructed is a fallback layer in combination with Chainlink feeds to ensure there is no delaying of prices during volatile markets. The analysts indicate that safe liquidations rely on strong oracles, and this is the significant benefit of a new protocol. The token has received attention as price models desired by multiple analysts indicate. Numerous analyst opinions indicate a potential 8x to 10x valuation in the event that the stablecoin and lending network become popular following the launch. Of the prevailing price of $0.035, that puts projections within the range of $0.30 to $0.35 in an optimistic position. Even some long-term models project 900% upside in case platform activity increases in 2026. Fast Sellout Pace and Whale Interest Mutuum Finance stated on its official X account that the V1 lending and borrowing contracts are complete and are currently under review by Halborn Security. The code is completed and the team will verify the Sepolia Testnet launch window in the near future. And this announcement caused another influx of purchasers who desired entering it before the first public release. Phase 6 is moving fast. The allocation has already passed 90%, so investors believe that there is not much supply left. There has been activity during the past several weeks and the close stages are being completed faster with large buys. According to the analysts, it is a good indication when the whale has built up at this point because it indicates confidence in the launch of the testnet and the revenue model that will be followed. As the presale is increasing, a functioning V1 draws closer to going public, and the future catalysts list is robust, numerous early adopters are referring to MUTM as one of the most popular new DeFi cryptos to observe prior to 2026.

XRP is now experiencing this shift as institutional products enter the scene. New U.S. ETFs have intensified attention on actual exchange liquidity, where the tradable supply is far smaller than many expect. CryptoDaantje50 explained this emerging supply squeeze in simple terms, using a clear analogy that resonated widely. Their breakdown highlighted how limited exchange balances can magnify every wave of institutional buying. Recent activity from ETF issuers now strengthens that narrative with real inflow data. Institutional Demand Reshapes Market Conditions New XRP ETFs generated heavy interest during their first week of trading . Early inflows forced issuers to acquire large amounts of XRP from the open market. These purchases immediately tightened liquidity across major exchanges. The 79 million XRP absorbed by ETFs in one day underscored the force behind this new demand. Franklin Templeton alone accounted for a major share of the early market pull. XRP BEGINNER ALERT: What Is This ""Supply Shock"" Everyone Is Talking About? Imagine XRP like concert tickets. Total tickets printed: ~100 billion Tickets locked in a vault (escrow + Ripple’s own wallets): ~60+ billion Tickets actually available on exchanges right… https://t.co/tskGi0G3Ku — CryptoDaantje50 (@daantjessz) November 26, 2025 Understanding the Real XRP Supply XRP has a total supply near 100 billion tokens. More than half remains locked in escrow or held by Ripple in long-term wallets. This structure leaves only a small portion available to trade on exchanges. Several independent trackers estimate that the liquid exchange supply sits near two to two-and-a-half billion tokens. This is the true float that ETF issuers must compete for when fulfilling inflows. Why the 79 Million XRP Matters The 79 million XRP accumulated by ETFs represents a meaningful slice of available supply. Some analysts estimate that this amount equals more than one percent of all exchange liquidity. Others place it closer to four percent, depending on the dataset used. Regardless of the exact measure, the conclusion remains simple. ETF activity is pulling real XRP out of circulation at a rapid pace. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Supply Shock Influences Price A supply shock occurs when demand rises faster than the available supply . When buyers cannot acquire enough tokens at current prices, the market must move higher. Sellers usually appear only when prices become more attractive. This process creates sustained upward pressure that can trigger extended rallies. Bitcoin experienced this effect in its 2024 ETF cycle. XRP may now be facing a similar structure. Key Implications for the Months Ahead ETF inflows will remain a major catalyst. As more investors gain exposure through regulated funds, issuers must keep acquiring XRP. This cycle reduces free supply and increases competition for remaining tokens. If inflows grow, the market may enter a phase where higher prices become necessary to unlock deeper liquidity. XRP’s current structure suggests that demand is rising while easy-to-access supply is shrinking. This imbalance is the foundation of the supply shock narrative now spreading through the market.

FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.2363 Market Cap $385.14M Trading Volume $5.72M Circulating Supply 1.62B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.157 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2382 24-hour Low $0.2323 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.24% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.2714 14-Day RSI 35.86 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 22 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $0.3705 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is stabilizing after hitting the lower Bollinger band but still struggles under $0.25–$0.26. Momentum indicators are flattening rather than turning bullish, signalling an early but weak recovery. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the 1-day price chart for November 27, FLOW has begun to settle after its drop toward $0.221, with small-bodied candles around $0.236 signalling fading sell pressure. Still, the mid-Bollinger band at $0.256 remains the key ceiling. The RSI at 40.23 and a flattening MACD histogram both show momentum stabilizing rather than turning bullish, meaning the recovery is still fragile. A daily close above $0.244–$0.246 is needed to confirm the start of a shift. Failing to do so risks drifting back toward $0.228–$0.230. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Flow coin 4-hour price analysis FLOW trades just above the Alligator lines at $0.234–$0.235, showing a modest intraday uptrend. The candles at $0.235–$0.236 show controlled buying but no breakout energy. The MACD crossing slightly above zero supports continuation, while PVT remains flat, confirming momentum is light. As long as price holds above $0.234, FLOW could push toward $0.240–$0.243, but real upside needs a break of $0.247.

FLOW can slowly recover as long as it stays above $0.232, but it won’t make any strong upward move until it breaks above $0.25–$0.26 with strong buying volume. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

Aquanow x Visa – Stablecoins Enter The Financial Mainstream. @Visa has selected @Aquanow to expand stablecoin settlement across CEMEA, enabling issuers and acquirers to settle with approved stablecoins like USDC. Faster cycles. Lower friction. 365-day settlement. Pilot →… pic.twitter.com/twyDRi4cSg — Aquanow (@aquanow) November 26, 2025 Why Visa’s Stablecoin Infrastructure According to Visa, the integration of Aquanow’s digital asset infrastructure with Visa’s technology stack will allow issuers and acquirers across the CEMEA region to settle transactions using approved stablecoins such as USDC. By leveraging blockchain-based settlement, Visa seeks to reduce operational costs, simplify workflows, and accelerate settlement cycles. The demand for faster and more efficient cross-border payments continues to rise among financial institutions. Stablecoins have emerged as a key solution for addressing pain points in settlement, including weekend limitations, intermediary fees, and unpredictable clearing times. Visa Builds on Strong Momentum Following USDC Pilot Visa’s engagement with stablecoin technology is not new. In 2023, the company became one of the first major payments networks to allow clients to settle obligations in USDC as part of a pilot initiative. The program has since scaled substantially, with monthly volume surpassing a $2.5 billion annualized run rate. “By harnessing the power of stablecoins and pairing them with our trusted global technology, we are enabling financial institutions in CEMEA to experience faster and simpler settlements,” said Godfrey Sullivan , Head of Product and Solutions for CEMEA at Visa. “Our partnership with Aquanow is another key step in modernizing the back-end rails of payments, reducing reliance on traditional systems with multiple intermediaries, and preparing institutions for the future of money movement.” Aquanow: Bringing Digital Asset Expertise to Visa’s Global Network Aquanow provides institutional-grade digital asset services for banks, neobanks, brokerages, and payments companies. It will serve as a key infrastructure partner in the rollout. The company processes billions of dollars in monthly crypto brokerage and payment transactions, making it a strong fit for Visa’s ambitions. “Visa’s reliable global network has long moved money securely and efficiently,” said Aquanow CEO Phil Sham. “Together, Visa and Aquanow are unlocking new ways for institutions to participate in the digital economy, leveraging stablecoin technology to settle with the speed and transparency of the internet.” Visa Says Tech Still Needs Regulatory Clarity In July this year, Visa surpassed $200 million in cumulative stablecoin settlement volume while expanding its crypto infrastructure through African partnerships and platform development. However, CEO Ryan McInerney warned that the technology still requires clearer regulations to reach its full potential. The payment giant reported strong Q2 2025 results with $9.6 billion in net revenue, up 9% year-over-year, as it continues building stablecoin capabilities, including its first seven-day-a-week settlement system and the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform for bank partnerships.

Published on November 27, 2025, the document mentions a proposal tagged the “no gain, no loss” treatment, and it has been gaining traction because of what it means for users. Stani Kulechov commends HMRC consultation In a post he shared via his X page, Kulechov referenced the official document , highlighting the “no gain, no loss” (NGNL) approach it is offering. “A particularly interesting conclusion is that when users deposit assets into Aave, the deposit itself is not treated as a disposal for capital gains tax purposes, creating a ‘no gain, no loss’ (NGNL) approach,” he wrote . As far as he is concerned, it is a major win for UK DeFi users, especially those who have an interest in borrowing stablecoins against their crypto collateral. “I’m proud that our team at Aave Labs participated in the consultation, advocating for DeFi and ensuring that the tax treatment of interactions with lending protocols reflects the economic reality: users are not intending to dispose of their assets when borrowing against their collateral for liquidity needs,” he posted. He ended the post by emphasizing that he, as well as those at Aave Labs, are fully supportive of the no loss no gain approach and are looking forward to seeing those changes implemented in UK tax legislation. Kulechov is not the only one pleased with the outcome of the HMRC’s consultation ; several other notable figures have also responded positively to the release, with many tagging it a step forward and claiming it could be a catalyst for adoption. Kulechov’s statement comes not long after he criticized the UK’s BoE Kulechov’s positive sentiments came after he criticized the Bank of England’s (BoE) proposal to temporarily cap individual stablecoin holdings at £20,000 and a £10 million cap per firm. On X (formerly Twitter), he claimed the proposal, which the bank says will stay in place while it ascertains there is no real risk to traditional banks, is a way to choke the market before it has the chance to grow. “Issuers would be forced to keep 40% of reserves unremunerated at the central bank and only 60% in yielding assets like UK government bonds,” Kulechov wrote . “That makes pound-backed stablecoins inefficient, uncompetitive and unattractive compared with global alternatives.” According to him, the HM Treasury is likely to copy the approach, which he believes will turn the UK into one of the least appealing places to issue a stablecoin, a direct contrast to what most in the industry want. “Instead of boosting the pound’s reach or supporting government gilts, the policy does the opposite,” Kulechov wrote. “The biggest losers? The UK and its consumers. This is another misguided move by the Bank of England, and again we have to fight for freedom.” Many people share Kulechov’s sentiment, with a majority of X users claiming the proposal is only an attempt to protect the banks at the expense of innovation.

Currently, the number of transactions per second processed on the network has increased significantly, reaching unprecedented levels. New Throughput Record For The Ethereum Network In a highly volatile cryptocurrency landscape, the Ethereum network has just reached a new milestone in terms of usage and adoption. On-chain data shows that more transactions are now being carried out on the leading blockchain, indicating renewed interest in the ETH ecosystem. The Ethereum network has surged to a new all-time high in Transaction Per Second (TPS) as shared by Joseph Young on the social media platform X. The new TPS peak suggests that the ecosystem is shifting into a higher gear, where demand for smart contracts, rollups, and L2s all come together to form a single upward push. According to the data, over 31,083 transactions are now being processed on the blockchain in one second. Young expects this TPS to expand further in the short term due to upcoming ETH updates such as Fusaka Upgrade , Peerdas, ZKetherum, Blob scaling, EIP-7928, and ZK. These crucial updates are proving latency reduction. Furthermore, Young stated that ethereal is scaling with an exponential curve. For a brief period, Ethereum seemed nearly weightless, sharper, leaner, and more equipped to handle whatever the upcoming surge in on-chain activity could require. Ethereum’s transactions have also grown exponentially in the daily time frame, hinting at fresh demand and revived conviction. Leon Waidmann, the head of research at On-Chain Foundation, delved into the ETH Transaction count, revealing that approximately 30.69 million transactions across the Ethereum Mainnet and Layer 2s are processed in a single day. Waidmann highlighted that the chart has witnessed a multi-month uptrend with the metric showing no signs of slowing down. This points to the rise in daily activity, which is up more than 5x since Q1, and consistent demand from PayFi, AI agents, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). All of these cement ETH as the fastest scaling ecosystem in the entire crypto sector. A spike of this magnitude is noticeable in ETH’s on-chain environment, indicating that something deeper may be awakening. A Decline In ETH’s Transaction Costs While transactions are spiking on the Ethereum network , its transaction cost appears to have collapsed sharply. In a post by Waidmann, the average transaction cost of Layer 1 was $0.17 per token transfer. Meanwhile, Layer 2’s average cost was $0.0007 per token transfer. With such low cost, the network is currently functioning cheaply at a scale, and transfers worth fractions of a cent are cleared by most optimistic rollups. However, zkEVM L2s like zkSync Era and Linea continue to be highly expensive compared to their optimistic peers.",Ethereum|AI|Blob scaling|decentralized finance|DeFi|EIP-7928|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Mainnet|Ethereum network|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Fusaka Upgrade|Joseph Young|Leon Waidmann|Linea|On-chain Foundation|PayFi|Peerdas|tps|Transaction Per Second|ZK|ZKetherum|zkEVM L2s|zkSync Era,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|RESEARCH|ZK|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-27 18:00:06

He highlighted three paths for XRP to reach this target, in what the analyst described as the final bull run for the altcoin. Analyst Maps Out Final XRP Bull Run Rally To $1,115 In a TradingView post, the crypto analyst mapped out three paths for XRP to rally to the $1,115 target. They tagged the first path as the immediate delivery, the second as a normal delivery, and the third as one that will trigger only if the XRP price stays suppressed. For the third path, NeverWishing stated that a final backup execution could happen between January 1 and 6 next year. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November For path A, NeverWishing stated that it will start between this month and next month, with the first impulse sparking an XRP rally to between $30 and $33. The secondary spike will send the altcoin to $186, while a consolidation phase will lead to a climb toward $285. After that, XRP will rally to its final blow-off target of $1,115. NeverWishing described the second path as the fastest, stating it will occur between January and March next year. The first stop will be between $30 and $33 for XRP, after which volatility waves will occur through February and March. The altcoin will then break into the macro expansion zone, with the major target at $285 and the final target at $1,115. The Third Path For XRP The analyst noted that the third path is smoother and slightly delayed. NeverWishing also reiterated that this is a suppressed variant and will only happen if the first and second paths fail. They explained that if the XRP price stays held down, then the algorithm will reset and fire between January 1 and 6 next year. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem – $20 Is Still The Target XRP will have the same opening move as the first two paths, rallying to between $30 and $33. It will then have the same structure as the second path, with the macro targets being $285 and $1,115. NeverWishing then outlined the key timing windows for XRP as it eyes a rally to this $1,115 target. The first key timing is between this month and January 2026, which marks the entry and breakout window. The analyst tagged March 21, 2026, as the mid-cycle reversal point in the XRP final bull run. August 14, 2026, marks the “warning zone,” while the pullback is expected between October and November 2026. Lastly, NeverWishing stated that January 1, 2027, is the final liquidity window. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.20, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Individual investors achieved 23 months of net buying for stocks, the longest streak since the period between 2020 and 2022. For the past 23 months, retail investors have made net stock purchases. This is the longest net buying streak since the 2020-2023 period. Retail has flowed into stocks in search of an offset to inflation among actively growing assets. Retail buying also extended the trend of meme investing, as Cryptopolitan reported . Previously, retail has achieved 32 months of straight buying. Retail has been buying ETFs for 158 straight days as well. Individual buyers are also quick to react to shifting conditions, causing some of the biggest rallies in 2025. The shift in retail behavior also coincided with the rise of AI companies. The perfect mix of a bull market and investors who prefer actively-managed portfolios created new rules for the stock market. Did retail investors abandon crypto? The shift to stock trading was one of the reasons for the outflow of retail investors from crypto. While BTC was seen as a potential store of value, it also acted as a risk-on asset. BTC and crypto more often behaved as a riskier version of NASDAQ. As a result, some retail investors switched to the stock market. In 2025, NASDAQ was already up a net 20%, while BTC was down a net 5.3% following a rapid correction. The significant upside of NASDAQ, with a lower risk of crashes, brought over some investors from crypto to stocks. In the short term, BTC and NASDAQ can have disparate performance. For November, BTC posted bigger gains compared to the index, but could not compensate for previous losses. BTC behaved as a more volatile version of NASDAQ, with bigger short-term gains and deeper losses. | Source: Just ETF At the same time, crypto trading has become the provenance of whales, with limited new inflows. Even crypto natives have attempted to trade stocks via tokenized assets. The rise of a global middle class with spare resources increased demand for US equities, with traders seeking ways to invest abroad. Robinhood was also one of the hubs for retail activity, with trading fees from equities rising by 132% in Q3. Individual traders are a permanent presence Individual retail traders are becoming a permanent presence, instead of sporadic players on the market. A wider number of traders are also participating in options markets, betting on a bullish development with call options exceeding put options. Retail investors have emerged as dip buyers, while larger funds sold stocks. US-based traders set new records for buying. In the EU, the trend was also notable, with a rise in share buying for Q3. For that period, over 780K new European investors bought shares, up 18% compared to the same period in 2024. Retail investors are also showing some signs of caution and cooling, while still accumulating selected shares.

That quiet can mislead traders, but sometimes it masks the build‑up for a powerful breakout. In the case of XRP, a growing number of technical analysts see just such a build‑up . One of them, Egrag Crypto, recently shared a chart suggesting XRP is forming a “3D fractal structure” that could presage a large move. Egrag Crypto openly warns against over‑reliance on fractals. Fractals are not guarantees — they are signals. Many traders worry that they encourage confirmation bias: we perceive what we want to see. Egrag Crypto echoes this caution, admitting fractals are “dangerous” when used uncritically. However, he argues, some patterns are too compelling to ignore. When a fractal pattern appears alongside other supportive signs — such as consolidation, volume behavior, and clean moving‑average relationships — it may carry weight. #XRP : I Hate Fractals… But This One Is Hard to Ignore: Why I hate !! Fractals are dangerous because they feed our bias , we see what we want to see. But this current 3D structure on #XRP looks too Good so far to dismiss. Historically, when #XRP spends months in… pic.twitter.com/NyaiNC9sy3 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 27, 2025 The Parallel: Late 2024–Early 2025 Looking at historical data, XRP offers a compelling precedent. In November 2024, XRP traded around $1.94. By January 2025, it had rallied to approximately $3.04, marking a strong bullish run. The context then was similar: a period of accumulation followed by a breakout that triggered widespread momentum. Egrag Crypto’s chart suggests a structure today that could echo that move . If the pattern repeats with similar strength — and broader market conditions cooperate — some analysts argue XRP might target far higher levels. Based solely on structure, the projection could take XRP toward the $10–$11 range, assuming a full fractal breakout. Not All Paths Lead Up — Why Caution Remains It is vital to remember: fractals do not guarantee outcomes. The current setup could fail. A breakdown might lead to deeper retests before any upward push. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 External factors remain at play. Market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and shifts in institutional interest can all derail the cleanest of chart patterns. Even strong technical setups may falter if volume remains low or if liquidity dries up. What to Watch For To validate a bullish breakout, traders should monitor a few things. First, a clean close above key long‑term moving averages — ideally on strong volume. Second, confirmation from supporting indicators, such as momentum oscillators and volume-based signals. Third, macro and on‑chain signals that reinforce demand — institutional flows, renewed investor confidence, or adoption news for XRP’s ecosystem. If these align, the fractal thesis gains credibility. If not, the structure could unravel and lead to consolidation or worse. In sum, while fractals are not evidence — they are warnings, not promises — the pattern seen by Egrag Crypto for XRP is compelling. Given historical parallels and current technical alignment, the upside could be substantial. Still, as with all things in crypto, outcomes remain uncertain.

The token price is already surging, the initial investors are buying more tokens, and investor demand is growing at a rate that is astounding even for long term market observers. As the updates about creating a new development arrive and the next phase of the project is approaching, it is believed that it may be one of the most significant plays of the early 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a lending and borrowing protocol that provides a more secure and efficient method of accessing liquidity to the user. All these operate on smart contracts eliminating the middlemen. The system has two forms of the lending markets to enable the users to earn or borrow more freely. LTV rules and liquidation tools are obvious to borrowers and provide security to the system, whereas the lenders earn interests by means of yield bearing tokens in the form of mTokens. In the Q4 2025, the project also confirmed on its official X account that the V1 version of the protocol shall go live on the Sepolia testnet. It has a working liquidity pool, yield-generating mtTokens, a borrowing tracking debt token, a liquidation bot that ensures market safety, and an initial support of ETH and USDT. Security is a major focus. Halborn Security also signed that it is now reviewing the code at Mutuum Finance. The team claimed that the code is completed and in the final stages of analysis and changes will be made by the time the review is concluded. In the case of a DeFi crypto project, such transparency has brought a lot of trust among investors. Increased Capital and Investor Development Mutuum Finance has raised over $18.9 million now. The number of investors that have joined the ecosystem is more than 18,200. These statistics are important since they reflect immediate momentum. Observers note a new crypto coin that accumulates such attention in the pre-launch phase as an indicator of a high fit into the market base. The token started at $0.01 in early 2025. It is now priced at $0.035. It is a 250% token appreciation. This may signify to most investors that demand may be more intensive during launch and early trade. It also implies that those who buy in Phase 1 would be placed to see a potential 500% movement once the token reaches its official price at the launch of $0.06. Daily Rewards Out of the 4 billion books supplied, 45.5 percent is allocated to the presale. That equals 1.82 billion tokens. Over 790 million of the tokens are already traded with Phase 6 having surpassed 90% allocation. This is an indication to investors that the demand is stable and that the supply is being drawn at a higher rate than anticipated. The project also operates a 24 hour leader board. The highest daily donor will be given $500 worth of MUTM. It has enhanced the daily turns particularly when the allocations are near to a sell out. The other cause of the demand increase is that the buying process is easy. Mutuum Finance enables an unlimited card payment. The investors are able to purchase immediately without undertaking complex procedures. This has served to attract new customers who desire to have a simple access to an expanding DeFi project. Why Analysts Are Paying Special Attention To this Project Mutuum Finance has a high-ranking of 90 out of 100 CertiK Token Scan which is already rated. Another initiative taken by the team was the initiation of a $50K bug bounty on the code risks. These measures illustrate the fact that the foundation is not a one-sided event of the afterthought. The company also has planned a USD pegged stablecoin in the project. The other important component of the design is strong oracles with Chainlink feeds and fallback systems. This is important as proper pricing insurers both the borrowers and the lenders in terms of liquidations as well as in turnover. According to the analysts, MUTM is likely to experience a high 7x upside potential upon the release of V1 protocol. Preliminary investor reaction shows that expansion narrative can take the initial route of undertakings such as Aave or Solana. The project is receiving serious consideration with practical utility, oracle systems, and increase in the number of holders. Phase 6 Nearly Sold Out And A $100K Whale Move Causes Urgency The Phase 6 allocation is left with 8% tokens left. The on chain activity in recent times indicates that an individual investor has contributed over 100K within a day. Such massive transfers are usually indications of increasing confidence, and tend to accelerate the concluding steps of a token sale. Provided the demand does not decrease, Phase 6 might be put out of business earlier than anticipated. Mutuum Finance is among the most promising crypto opportunities to consider at the end of 2025 with the release of the V1, the extensive work on a Halbon review, the developments of a stablecoin, and an opportunity to buy with the help of card payments.

This Avalanche ETF, set to trade under the ticker BAVA, could stake up to 70% of its holdings, offering a unique blend of growth and income. If approved, it marks a significant step toward mainstream crypto adoption, combining the stability of an ETF with the earning potential of staking. What Makes This Avalanche ETF a Game-Changer? The proposed Avalanche ETF by Bitwise stands out because it integrates staking directly into the fund. Staking allows investors to earn rewards by participating in network security, and with plans to stake most AVAX assets, this ETF could deliver passive income. This approach addresses common investor concerns about missing out on yield while holding cryptocurrencies. Moreover, it simplifies the process, as users don’t need to manage staking themselves. How Does Staking Enhance the Avalanche ETF? Staking in an Avalanche ETF means the fund actively uses its AVAX tokens to support the blockchain network, earning rewards in return. Bitwise’s filing indicates up to 70% staking, which could boost returns beyond simple price appreciation. Key benefits include: Passive income generation without extra effort Enhanced network security and decentralization Potential for higher overall yields compared to traditional ETFs However, challenges like regulatory oversight and market volatility remain, so investors should weigh risks carefully. Why Is Bitwise Leading the Charge for an Avalanche ETF? Bitwise, a seasoned asset manager in crypto, updated its S-1 with the SEC to push for this innovative Avalanche ETF. Their expertise in digital assets positions them to navigate regulatory hurdles, increasing the fund’s approval chances. By focusing on staking, they tap into growing demand for yield-bearing investments in a low-interest environment. This move could set a precedent for other crypto ETFs, expanding options for retail and institutional investors alike. What Are the Potential Impacts of This Avalanche ETF? If approved, the Avalanche ETF could drive greater adoption of AVAX and similar cryptocurrencies. It might attract new investors seeking exposure without technical barriers, thereby increasing liquidity and market stability. Actionable insights for readers include monitoring SEC decisions and diversifying into staking-based products. Ultimately, this ETF represents a fusion of innovation and accessibility, paving the way for a more inclusive financial future. In summary, Bitwise’s Avalanche ETF proposal is a bold step toward blending traditional finance with crypto rewards. By incorporating staking, it offers a compelling investment avenue that could redefine portfolios. As regulatory developments unfold, this ETF might just be the catalyst for broader crypto integration. Frequently Asked Questions What is an Avalanche ETF? An Avalanche ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of Avalanche (AVAX) cryptocurrency, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly holding the asset. How does staking work in this ETF? The ETF stakes a portion of its AVAX holdings to earn rewards, which are then distributed to investors, providing an additional income stream alongside potential price gains. What are the risks of investing in this Avalanche ETF? Risks include regulatory changes, market volatility, and staking-related issues like slashing, where penalties reduce rewards due to network faults. When will the Avalanche ETF be available? It depends on SEC approval; Bitwise has filed the necessary documents, but no specific timeline is confirmed yet. Can I stake AVAX on my own instead? Yes, but self-staking requires technical knowledge and carries risks like security breaches, whereas the ETF offers a managed, hands-off approach. How does this compare to other crypto ETFs? Unlike many crypto ETFs that only track prices, this Avalanche ETF includes staking, potentially offering higher returns through yield generation.

Sun accused FDUSD issuer First Digital Trust (FDT) and its CEO Vincent Chok of using loopholes in the city’s trust company regulations to move hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD reserves abroad without permission. At the meeting on Thursday, Sun alleged that Hong Kong-based FDT not only diverted stablecoin reserves to offshore entities but also created fake transaction documents to conceal these transfers. Techteryx acquired TUSD in 2020 and assigned FDT the task of managing the token's reserves. However, Sun revealed earlier this year that there was a large liquidity gap in TUSD reserves, alleging that Hong Kong regulations allowed FDT to unauthorizedly divert nearly half a billion dollars into illiquid offshore vehicles. According to court filings, Techteryx claims the reserves were not transferred to the Aria CFF fund, but to another Aria-affiliated entity called Aria Commodities DMCC. These assets are tied up in long-term, irreversible financing for commodity and infrastructure projects, making them ineligible for stablecoin reserves. Aria denies these accusations. The parties agree that the funds were diverted to Aria-linked entities. At the heart of the dispute is whether FDT was authorized to conduct these transactions and whether it knew the diverted assets would be tied up in long-term, illiquid trade finance projects. Since the initial press conference, the Dubai Digital Economy Court has imposed a global freeze on assets linked to the alleged irregular transactions. The court stated that this decision was not a finding of wrongdoing, but merely a serious legal dispute. Related News: Glassnode Warns! ""Bitcoin (BTC) Is Recovering, But Another Major Drop Could Happen!"" Here's That Critical Level! The decision blocks the assets while awaiting the expected Hong Kong judiciary to resolve the case and also increases pressure on Hong Kong regulators. The case presents a critical test of how trust companies are regulated as the city prepares for its upcoming stablecoin licensing regime. FDT maintains that it executed all transactions under Techteryx's direct instructions, that no funds were misappropriated, and that it did not control Aria. The company cites Aria's AML/KYC concerns regarding Techteryx's ownership as the reason for the difficulty in recovering the assets. Sun, however, claims that the instruction documents FDT relied on were forged. “We have evidence that they fabricated all the transaction documents,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

He added that he expects the price of Ethereum (ETH) to rise between $3,500 and $4,000. However, he disagreed with the view that the BTC price will break a new all-time high.

Privacy tokens, the only segment that remained in positive territory along with exchange tokens, recorded the strongest growth since the beginning of the year, attracting investor attention again. According to the data in the image, privacy-focused projects stand out from all other categories in both weekly performance and year-to-date growth. While the overall market remained negative during this period, established privacy coins like Zcash (ZEC), Monero (XMR), Dash (DASH), and Decred (DCR) gained strong momentum with double-digit gains. Zcash (ZEC), which topped the list, rose 26.02% in the last week, bringing its market capitalization to $8.3 billion. Monero (XMR) also saw a weekly increase of 11.08%, reaching a market capitalization of $7.28 billion. Another prominent privacy-themed project, Dash (DASH), continued its strong performance, closing the week up 16.03%. Even Decred (DCR), which had long been under the radar, provided support for the category with a 14.31% weekly increase. Most altcoins outside this segment remain in negative growth territory. For example, projects like Litecoin (LTC), Canton (CC), OriginTrail (TRAC), and Mina (MINA) have seen mostly sideways or limited gains during the week, while the overall market is currently showing a weak outlook. All categories except privacy and exchange tokens have been stuck in negative performance territory since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, ZKsync (ZK), among the newer projects in the privacy world or considered infrastructure-focused, has rallied 11.56% in the last week, while Starknet (STRK) has rallied a staggering 40.69%.

The drop has brought the price near a strong support level, which could decide its next move. In the last 24 hours, Ripple’s token rose by 1%, and over the past week, it gained 3%. Daily trading volume is $3.89 billion. XRP is still trading 40% below its July 2025 high of $3.65. XRP Tests Critical Support Analyst CRYPTOWZRD described the current move as another “inverse parabolic decline.” A similar drop earlier this year led to a quick rally. This recent drop is even sharper. According to the same analyst, “Sharp declines often precede an equally violent rally.” Notably, the market is now watching to see if the $2.00 support zone can hold. If it does, XRP could aim for the $2.60 area, which is the middle of its recent trading range. Consolidation Could Be a Setup ChartNerd shared a long-term chart showing XRP in a multi-month consolidation phase. This range is forming just above a major level that once marked its all-time high close and now acts as significant support. The asset has remained steady within this box for several months. If it holds, the next target could be around $8.00. This area comes from a Fibonacci projection used to estimate breakout moves. “Valid as long as support holds,” the analyst noted. Source: ChartNerd/X Moreover, another chart from ChartNerd shows XRP may be near the final leg of a wave pattern. This structure includes five stages, and XRP appears to be in the fourth phase. The current consolidation sits just above the 2021 high, now acting as support. The fifth and final move, if it happens, points toward $24. This view is based on the Elliott Wave structure, which tracks patterns in price over time. ETF Flows and Market Liquidity ETF activity around XRP has picked up. Data shared by CryptosRus shows strong inflows into new funds, with over 80 million tokens added on the first day. Grayscale and Franklin Templeton saw $130 million combined at launch. Canary’s fund holds the largest share, now at $331 million. Meanwhile, traders are also watching for a breakout from a possible flag pattern. The next short-term move could target $2.35 to $2.45. Heatmap data from Steph Is Crypto shows high liquidity between $2.30 and $2.40. “This zone remains a magnet,” the post read.

Despite the rebound, bulls remain under pressure as speculation of an incoming bear market continues to grow. Many investors are still digesting the sharp correction from October’s all-time high, and confidence has yet to fully return. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin LTH Sell-Off Signals Cycle Exhaustion as Supply Drops to 13.6M BTC According to top analyst Darkfost, one of the key indicators reinforcing this cautious environment is the Coinbase Premium Index, which remains negative. This metric compares Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase — the preferred exchange for US institutions and professional investors — with Binance, which is widely used by retail traders. When the index is negative, as it is now, it signals that institutional players and US whales are selling more aggressively than retail participants. Darkfost notes that part of this ongoing sell-side pressure is tied to continuous spot ETF outflows, which have weighed heavily on sentiment. Although the recent bounce above $90K shows a temporary shift in momentum, Bitcoin must demonstrate strong follow-through to prevent the market from slipping deeper into a bearish phase. Institutional Selling Pressure Begins to Ease Darkfost explains that since the peak in panic selling on November 21, institutional and US-based selling pressure has noticeably cooled off. During that period, the Coinbase Premium Index showed a sharp dive into negative territory, signaling that professional actors were offloading Bitcoin far more aggressively than retail participants. This imbalance amplified the market’s decline, helping push BTC toward its recent lows. However, over the past several days, the intensity of this selling has started to fade. While the Coinbase Premium Index remains negative — meaning institutions are still net sellers — the depth of that negativity has significantly softened. Darkfost notes that although the metric has not yet flipped into positive territory, the trend is improving. If this continues, it could give the market some much-needed breathing room and potentially stabilize price action. Still, analysts remain cautious. The next few sessions will be critical, as Bitcoin needs to demonstrate that this easing in sell pressure can translate into sustained demand. A decisive move — either reclaiming higher levels or breaking down again — appears imminent. As institutional activity continues to shift, the market may soon reveal whether this was only a temporary relief bounce or the start of a larger recovery.

On the 3-day chart, BTC has bounced sharply from the 200-day moving average (red line), a level that historically acts as a major dynamic support during deep corrections. This rebound pushed price back toward the $91,000 area, but momentum remains fragile. The chart shows BTC trading below both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which have now turned downward—an indication of short-term trend weakness. Until the price reclaims these moving averages, particularly the 100-day near $103,000, the broader structure remains vulnerable to further downside. Related Reading: XRP OI Collapses to Lowest Level Since Nov 2024: Binance Data Shows Liquidity Is Fading Volume during the sell-off was substantially higher than during the bounce, suggesting that sellers were more aggressive than buyers. This imbalance highlights that the recent uptick may be more of a reactionary relief move than a confirmed reversal. Still, the rejection wicks below $85,000 show clear buyer interest at lower levels. If BTC can maintain this higher low structure and continue closing above the 200-day MA, bullish momentum could gradually rebuild.

This institutional push has analysts talking, with some predicting a potential climb to $7 or even $17 . While the excitement is palpable, XRP’s future is still tied to institutional whims and market volatility. For investors looking for growth based on solid fundamentals, a new project called GeeFi offers a compelling alternative with a clear path to value. Ripple’s Speculation vs. GeeFi’s Tangible Utility Ripple’s recent success is heavily dependent on institutional adoption and ETF inflows. While the $180 million in institutional demand is impressive, it also highlights a core challenge: its growth is largely speculative and reliant on big players. Investors are essentially betting on continued institutional interest rather than the network’s independent strength. This creates a volatile environment where the average person is left hoping the big money keeps flowing. GeeFi sidesteps this dependency by building a decentralized ecosystem focused on real-world utility. With GeeFi, you have full control of your money through a non-custodial wallet , and the platform is designed to provide clear, reliable growth opportunities. For example, its upcoming staking feature is projected to offer an impressive APR of up to 55% . This creates a dependable way to earn passive income, protecting investors from the wild price swings driven by market speculation. The Presale Opportunity You Can’t Ignore While Ripple’s future is a topic of debate, the GeeFi Token (GEE) presale is delivering undeniable results right now. The project has already sold over 6.2 million tokens and raised more than $300,000 , demonstrating powerful momentum. This is your chance to get in on the ground floor of a project with massive upside potential. Early investors in crypto’s biggest success stories made their fortunes by acting before the crowd. GeeFi has all the potential needed to be the next $3 project. For those who invest now, this could translate into life-changing returns. An investment of just $1,000 today could become $60,000 , achieving an incredible 5900% ROI . With the current presale price at only $0.05 and a listing price of $0.40 already set, early investors are guaranteed a 700% return. This low price won’t last, so acting now secures the best possible entry point. Your All-in-One Crypto Command Center GeeFi is developing a unified platform to make crypto management simple. The GeeFi HUB will be an integrated dashboard connecting directly to the GeeFi DEX , a decentralized exchange built for fast, secure, and affordable trading across multiple blockchains. It’s designed to fix the common problems of high fees and confusing interfaces that hold many investors back. From the HUB, you will be able to track your portfolio, manage your assets, and execute trades with ease. It’s a complete toolset that puts control back in your hands, making cross-chain swaps and asset management more intuitive and cost-effective than ever before. An Ecosystem Built for Its Community The GeeFi Wallet is the core of the ecosystem and is already available for Android users, with an iOS version on the way. Supporting over 14 networks , it lets you consolidate all your crypto assets in one secure place. The GeeFi Team , which has been working on the project since 2023 , consistently releases updates, proving their commitment to building a durable and reliable platform. GeeFi also rewards its community for its support. The referral program gives you a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase your friends make with your link. While Ripple’s price is tied to unpredictable market forces, GeeFi is building a future with real utility and sharing its success with its community from day one.

Analyst Reveals When",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-solana-dogecoin-price-forecast/,"A crypto analyst known as NoLimit has shared a set of long-range price targets for several major cryptocurrencies, projecting where he believes they could peak by 2029. His list covers Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Monero, Sui, BNB, and Kaspa. These numbers were not presented as technical analyses or chart-based forecasts. Instead, they are expectations for how the market may grow over the next few years. XRP, Solana, And Dogecoin Dominate The Analyst’s Targets Among all the assets listed , the most surprising projections center on XRP at $10, Solana at $600, and Dogecoin at $0.75. His full list includes other major cryptocurrencies too, giving a broader context to his outlook: Bitcoin at $190,000; Ethereum at $4,800; Cardano at $1.10; Monero at $750; Sui at $25; BNB at $1,800; and Kaspa at $0.50. These numbers project a significant expansion in market capitalization and adoption over the next four years. NoLimit did not explain how he arrived at these targets or provide any structured reasoning. He shared them as peak expectations, not as chart-based predictions. The XRP target is especially interesting , as reaching $10 would push its price action more than 350% from the current level. Although this might be too exaggerated due to the inflows needed, it aligns with technical predictions from other analysts who are also projecting XRP to break above double digits in the near future. Solana’s prediction is also notable, as it places the cryptocurrency at a price range about 320% from its current price and well above its current all-time high of $293. Dogecoin’s outlook is different. Although the analyst’s $0.75 target for 2029 is almost a five-fold increase from its current price, it is only slightly above its all-time high of $0.7316. This means the meme coin is not expected to establish a significantly higher record anytime soon. Other Cryptocurrencies In The Analyst’s Scope The analyst’s full projection list spans other major coins with mixed expectations. Bitcoin is projected to reach $190,000, which implies a 120% rise from current levels around $86,000. Ethereum, on the other hand, was projected to be trading at $4,800 in 2029. This is a 1.6-fold increase from today’s $3,000 range, but it doesn’t put Ethereum above the $4,946 all-time high, which it set earlier this year. If the price targets come true exactly as stated, Ethereum at $4,800 and XRP at $10, then XRP would overtake Ethereum as the leading altcoin. Projections for altcoins like Cardano, Monero, Sui, BNB, and Kaspa vary, but all suggest significant upside from present values. The state of the market is currently really mediocre. This month, there has been pressure on the larger cryptocurrency market, with several large market-cap coins exhibiting little bullish movement. However, most cryptocurrencies have begun to move with gradual recovery over the past 48 hours, as Bitcoin regains momentum while most altcoins continue to trail behind in their rebound.",XRP|altcoins|bitcoin|BNB|Cardano|Ethereum|Kaspa|monero|NoLimit|ripple|SUI|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,DOGE|ETH|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-27 19:00:53

The CFX price in 2025 is expected to range between $0.3979 and $0.4773, with an average of $0.4123. However, the future market potential for Conflux entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation in China, and investor sentiment in long-term holding.

The launch of several spot XRP ETFs has pushed institutional attention higher. Yet, the token’s price has not matched community expectations. XRP’s performance in 2025 has been stronger than Bitcoin on a percentage basis. However, the token still trades below the explosive predictions made before ETF approvals. Liquidity remains deep, and the circulating supply sits above 60 billion tokens. These numbers suggest a market preparing for a larger move but still waiting for a strong trigger. XRP trades near $2.18 with strong daily volume and a market cap above $131 billion. Many investors now want a clearer outlook for 2025. This rising curiosity led us to consult the AI model ChatGPT to predict the XRP price by December 2025. ETF Launches and Institutional Demand The arrival of spot XRP ETFs changed the market structure . These funds absorb XRP from open circulation and store it in institutional custody. This process reduces the available supply on exchanges. Strong inflows can therefore create significant upward pressure. Early ETF numbers show interest from retail and institutions, with stunning inflows . If momentum grows, supply-side pressure may intensify. On-Chain Activity and Adoption Signals XRP’s long-term value depends on real usage. Settlement volumes, stablecoin flows, and DeFi activity on the XRPL are the main indicators. Adoption has grown in some regions but remains uneven across global corridors. If stablecoin expansion increases on XRPL, demand for XRP could rise. Actual adoption must now catch up with investor expectations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ChatGPT’s Price Targets for December 2025 ChatGPT’s model delivers three scenarios. The Base Case expects slow but steady ETF inflows and modest adoption. This projects $3.00 to $3.50 by December 2025. The Moderate Bull Case assumes stronger ETF momentum and wider global use. This places XRP between $4.50 and $6.00. The Aggressive Bull Case considers large institutional accumulation and rapid XRPL expansion. This pushes XRP toward $8.00 to $10.00 or higher. Each scenario relies on real, measurable factors, not speculation. Key Metrics to Watch in the Coming Months Investors should track ETF inflows, XRPL settlement data, and institutional custody reports. These indicators reveal the direction of long-term demand. Market liquidity, macro conditions, and regulatory commentary will also play major roles. A Market Preparing for a Defining Moment XRP enters the final months of 2025 with strong potential but mixed momentum. ETF demand and regulatory clarity offer powerful tailwinds. True growth, however, depends on the adoption of the XRPL. ChatGPT’s projections show meaningful upside, yet each path depends on clear signals. The coming weeks will determine which scenario becomes reality. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Teams often try to disguise their holdings by creating multiple wallets, which still reveal connections to one main wallet. Meme tokens are also sniped by insider wallets, front-running retail traders. A handful of bundled tokens originated in the EU, and only two were created by accounts based in India. Overall, meme token creation is highly concentrated and coincides with the general usage of networks like Solana. Additionally, meme tokens on the most active platforms track memes from English-speaking social media and are based on multiple American cultural trends. Meme token launches create short-lived assets Previous research also showed that a limited number of wallets created most of the tokens on Pump.fun. Those wallets relied on automation and short-term trading. Those wallets also switched platforms, at one point moving to Bonk.fun. Meme token creation moved through various stages. Initially, a meme had a long-running trajectory, based on a dedicated community. Later, meme tokens were often sold by the initial team, but became more decentralized with time. Memes also went through a cult phase, which encouraged holding. In late 2025, meme creation has slowed down, new tokens rarely build high valuations, and often stop trading or go through a rug pull within 24 hours of launching. Are meme tokens back? Meme tokens are slowing down on Pump.fun, and there are fewer runners. Older assets are also not recovering their previous levels. Despite this, new memes will still appear. Recent memes like WOJAK , launched this November, gained over 1,200% before winding down. WOJAK was one of the recently launched hot tokens, recently touching all-time highs. | Source: Coingecko Influencers are also mentioning new tokens. However, traders warn against chasing those new assets. Only individual tokens pump, while meme tokens as a whole remain weak. Some of the pumps are seen as the result of deliberate trading. Additionally, retail traders have moved out of meme tokens in fear of rug pulls, instead preferring to trade perpetual futures. At the same time, meme token launches continued, leading Bubblemaps to extend its tracking services to Monad, one of the recently launched L1 chains.

Sentiment, however, still sits in fear territory even after the bounce, indicating that positioning remains defensive and that confidence in a floor is still tentative. The discussion now centers on durability rather than round-number optics, since $100,000 has served as the more meaningful pivot in recent months, while $90,000 functions mainly as a waystation inside the current range. Market Signs To Watch A recovery that sticks usually appears alongside thicker order books on BTC and ETH pairs, narrower spreads through the U.S. session, and funding that drifts toward neutral. Those conditions suggest that market makers are willing to warehouse inventory and that spot buyers are replacing short squeezes that fade late in the day. When these signs strengthen together, intraday strength more often carries into the close; when they move in different directions, early gains tend to weaken as liquidity thins after hours. Stablecoin issuance and exchange balances help separate real cash inflows from position covering. Net issuance that turns higher for several sessions frequently aligns with firmer spot settlement, while flat or negative supply can undercut rebounds even when prices look better intraday. Order-book ladders around key U.S. data windows provide another read, since repeated gaps in depth leave the market vulnerable to cross-asset shocks. Bitcoin Flows, Liquidity, And Macro Links Spot Bitcoin and ETF flow direction continues to shape day-to-day closes. A turn toward creations in U.S. spot products generally supports stronger finishes , while persistent redemptions tend to cap rallies during the afternoon handoff. The pace of those flows has tracked risk appetite in other markets, which is why late moves in equity futures often spill into crypto when depth is still rebuilding. Macro context remains part of the setup. A firmer dollar or tighter financial conditions can reduce the willingness of traders to hold risk through event windows, while relief on rates can ease those drags and stabilize spreads. You are more powerful not as an individual, but with the support of a family. To our team, our shareholders, and the Bitcoin community, thank you for being part of ours. Happy Thanksgiving from Strategy. pic.twitter.com/Bs01DiqlPp — Strategy (@Strategy) November 27, 2025 Correlations have tightened during stress, so policy headlines or earnings guidance from large tech firms have continued to influence crypto, especially when liquidity is patchy. For now, a price north of $90,000 eases the strain without settling the argument about trend. A convincing turn usually arrives when spot books thicken through New York hours and into the evening, when funding and basis settle toward neutral rather than swinging from one side to the other, when ETF creations start to outpace redemptions for more than a day, and when net stablecoin issuance rises in a way that points to new cash rather than recycled leverage. Absent that mix, strength tends to exhaust itself before the close and the day finishes softer than it began, which keeps confidence brittle and keeps traders alert to policy headlines or earnings surprises that can drain bids in a few ticks. The market looks better than it did last week, yet it still trades like a place where one unwelcome headline can send price back to test the same ledges it just climbed.

Lee explained that the tepid view stems from the October 10 crash caused by a glitch that triggered automatic liquidations, wiping out nearly 2 million accounts. However, Lee pointed to rising gold demand from crypto-backed stablecoins helping establish a higher future price floor. USDT issuer Tether became the largest private gold holder globally, surpassing several central banks. Liquidity Zones Define Bitcoin Price Prediction According to analyst Tracer , Binance, Wintermute, and Bybit bought over $10 billion in Bitcoin in 5 hours, with continued accumulation. Currently, most liquidity is stacking to the upside, with significant clusters at $85,000-$86,000. Reclaiming $93,000-$94,000 zone could pull the price toward $100,000. Most of the liquidity for $BTC is still to the upside. But some liquidity clusters are building around the $85,000-$86,000 level too.

The $97,000-$98,000 area shows heavy liquidity after a sustained selloff, resulting in lower highs. Moreover, a 90-day spot taker CVD turned neutral, indicating easing selling pressure. Buying dominance could trigger a sustained rally. Source: X/@TedPillows Lower timeframe setup requires a break above resistance for bullish continuation toward $96,000-$98,000 targets. Break below the trendline, and a 4-hour close under $86,500 could drop toward lower zones, creating a double bottom. Notably, Thanksgiving historically weighs on sentiment , with an average loss of 0.8%. However, this year’s pre-holiday rally suggests 2025 could break the pattern as Glassnode warns Bitcoin remains structurally weak after losing the 50-week moving average. Looking forward, a successful hold above $90,000 can pave the way for an advance toward $92,000-$94,000 resistance, then potentially $98,000-$100,000. Failed support might trigger a retest of $88,000, with deeper corrections toward $81,000-$82,000 possible.

The rise of digital tokens adds transparency, security, global reach, and instant payouts, all driven by blockchain . “As interest grows in the fantasy basketball draft, the integration of cryptocurrencies adds a new layer of strategic and financial interaction, complementing both fantasy gameplay and adjacent sports betting markets.” Introduction to Fantasy Basketball Drafts and Crypto Rise Fantasy basketball leagues have become one of the most interactive ways for fans to stay engaged with the NBA season, drafting their preferred players, managing lineups, and competing for structured prize pools. As blockchain technology gains momentum across industries, cryptocurrency is beginning to shift the foundation of how fantasy leagues operate. Participants who once depended on credit cards or bank transfers to join leagues now see crypto tokens becoming the new standard. This shift brings more autonomy and flexibility to users while expanding access across borders. The fantasy basketball draft is where this transformation becomes most visible, as digital currency begins to redefine how fans join, compete, transact, and interact throughout the season. How Crypto Tokens Are Used for League Entry Fees and Prize Pools Crypto tokens are changing the financial side of NBA fantasy leagues by enabling players to enter contests and contribute to prize pools entirely through digital currency. Instead of relying on traditional banking systems, leagues can structure entry fees using tokens that are transferred instantly and securely. Participants contribute to decentralized prize pools that automatically grow as more entrants join. Smart contracts distribute rewards directly to winners, removing the delay and uncertainty associated with manual payout processes. The ability to pay seamlessly with tokens encourages more global participation and prevents issues related to currency conversion, bank processing times, or geographic limitations. Blockchain’s Role in Ensuring Security and Transparency Blockchain technology reinforces trust in fantasy leagues by ensuring that all financial and gameplay-related actions are transparent, auditable, and secure. Smart contracts automatically enforce rules for prize distribution, roster locks, transaction limits, and scoring verification. Because data written to the blockchain cannot be altered, players can verify each entry, trade, and reward calculation without relying on a central authority. This structure reduces fraud, eliminates hidden fees, and ensures that the league operator cannot manipulate outcomes or hold onto winnings longer than intended. Transparency becomes part of the product itself, providing reassurance that every participant is treated fairly. New In-Game Betting Opportunities Enabled by Crypto Crypto tokens allow fantasy platforms to introduce new in-game betting-style mechanics that operate within the fantasy ecosystem rather than traditional sportsbooks. Fans can place rapid-fire token-based predictions on live player stats, performance surges, game outcomes, or roster decisions. These micro-transactions provide instant feedback and immediate token payouts, supported by smart-contract automation. Because crypto transactions clear quickly and without geographical limitations, players around the world can participate in fast-paced interactive features that previously were impossible under fiat-based systems. These token-powered interactions give fantasy players a more dynamic connection to every possession and every roster decision. Benefits: Global Access, Instant Payments, Fairness in Payouts The use of digital tokens in fantasy leagues offers three major advantages: global access, instant payments, and payout fairness. Global access allows participants from any region to join leagues without dealing with complicated banking barriers or currency restrictions. Instant payments come from smart contracts that release tokens immediately after winners are determined, bypassing manual payout timelines. Fairness in payouts is guaranteed by blockchain transparency, ensuring no one can manipulate entries, alter results, or delay distribution. These benefits make token-based fantasy ecosystems more open, efficient, and equitable, appealing to both casual players and highly competitive participants alike. Subtle Sports Betting Parallels and Future Outlook Token-based fantasy leagues share structural similarities with sports betting, but the overlap is subtle. Both systems rely on predicting performance outcomes, managing stakes, and processing payouts. Blockchain strengthens both industries by supporting instant settlement, transparent transaction records, and decentralized rule enforcement. As cryptocurrencies and Web3 technologies continue to mature, fantasy platforms will expand their token-based features, integrating cross-platform economies, tokenized player assets, deeper trade mechanics, and global real-time interactions. The fantasy space is evolving toward ecosystems where tokens power everything from drafting to trading to competitive micro-markets, creating a more immersive digital sports experience. Evolving Beyond Traditional Fantasy Through Digital Innovation NBA fantasy leagues are entering a new era shaped by crypto tokens, smart contracts, and blockchain-driven fairness. Entry fees and prize pools gain efficiency; transactions become instant, global participation becomes frictionless, and in-game token interactions reshape how fans engage with basketball. These innovations create a hybrid world where fantasy sports and sports-betting-style mechanics coexist without losing the spirit of competitive roster-building. Digital currency is no longer a novelty in fantasy sports—it is becoming an infrastructure. As token-based fantasy systems continue to expand, fans will see deeper immersion, better rewards, and experiences that merge sports passion with digital financial innovation.

POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction November 2025 $0.15 $0.18 $0.25 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

While Bitcoin's price has retreated 36% since its all-time high, derivatives indicators suggest the market is trending upward again. Implied volatility, in particular, remains under control, suggesting a reshaping of risk transfer amid Bitcoin's institutional adoption. In Bitcoin's early stages, price movements were largely driven by short-term speculative traders seeking to profit from sharp fluctuations. However, current data suggests that a more institutional structure is emerging within the derivatives market, making market volatility more manageable. According to Coinglass data, long demand for Bitcoin perpetual futures has increased again. Open interest remains limited, suggesting the market is moving away from leveraged excesses. The return of funding rates to positive territory suggests that bullish bets, which turned negative at the beginning of the week, are regaining their dominance. Related News: Altcoins Are Suffering Heavy Losses, But There Are Two Exceptions - This Year Has Been Incredible for These Two Altcoin Groups The picture is similar on the options front. Deribit data shows that call options with a $100,000 strike price have the highest open interest. This suggests a strong upward shift in investor expectations, given that last week's emphasis was on bearish hedging positions in the $80,000-$85,000 range. Spencer Hallarn, head of OTC trading at GSR, claimed that the shift in positioning in recent weeks has paved the way for a rally: “Speculative long positions have decreased significantly in recent weeks. This was clearly reflected in the pullback in perpetual open interest and the decline in funding rates. This has helped the crypto market prepare for the next rally.” *This is not investment advice.

This isn’t just another market prediction; it’s a high-stakes confrontation that could determine the future of artificial intelligence investing.

The AI Bubble Warning Signs You Can’t Ignore Burry’s analysis points to several critical vulnerabilities in the AI boom narrative: Stock-based compensation costing Nvidia shareholders $112.5 billion Questionable accounting practices around equipment depreciation Circular financing schemes among AI customers Overstated useful lives of Nvidia GPUs Nvidia’s Fierce Defense Against Stock Market Critics Nvidia isn’t taking these accusations lightly. The company recently distributed a seven-page memo to Wall Street analysts countering Burry’s claims point by point. Nvidia argues that Burry’s math is fundamentally flawed, particularly regarding stock-based compensation calculations. The company maintains its practices are consistent with industry peers and vehemently denies any comparison to historical corporate failures. Burry’s Allegations Nvidia’s Response $112.5B stock compensation cost Actual figure is $91B after RSU taxes Questionable depreciation practices Standard industry accounting methods Circular financing among customers Strong, legitimate customer demand Comparison to Cisco bubble Fundamentally different market conditions Short Selling History Repeating Itself? Burry’s track record adds weight to his current warnings. His successful prediction of the housing crisis made him famous, but his post-2008 performance has been mixed. He missed the GameStop meme stock explosion and lost money shorting Tesla. However, his new Substack publication, “Cassandra Unchained,” has already attracted 90,000 subscribers in less than a week, demonstrating significant market influence. Could This AI Bubble Trigger Widespread Market Collapse? The most unsettling question isn’t whether Burry is right, but whether his growing platform could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. History shows that credible critics can accelerate market corrections – Jim Chanos with Enron and David Einhorn with Lehman Brothers demonstrated how vocal skepticism can trigger the very collapses they predict. With Nvidia’s $4.5 trillion market cap at stake, the stakes couldn’t be higher. FAQs: Michael Burry vs Nvidia Showdown What companies is Michael Burry targeting with his short positions? Burry has revealed bearish put options against Nvidia and Palantir , representing over $1 billion in potential losses if these stocks continue rising. How has Nvidia responded to Burry’s allegations? Nvidia issued a detailed memo to analysts disputing Burry’s calculations and defending their accounting practices as industry-standard. What is Michael Burry’s new publication? After deregistering Scion Asset Management with the SEC , Burry launched “Cassandra Unchained” on Substack to communicate directly with followers without regulatory constraints. How does this compare to previous market bubbles? Burry compares the current AI boom to Cisco in the late 1990s, where overbuilt infrastructure led to a 75% stock collapse when demand failed to materialize. This high-stakes confrontation between one of finance’s most controversial figures and the world’s most valuable company represents more than just a market disagreement – it’s a battle for the narrative surrounding artificial intelligence’s future. Whether Burry’s warnings prove prescient or premature, his ability to influence market sentiment could determine whether the AI revolution continues its meteoric rise or faces the reckoning he predicts.

The French competition authority, Autorité de la Concurrence, announced on Thursday, November 27, 2025, that it has dismissed a complaint filed by Qwant against Microsoft. Microsoft let off by French regulators Qwant, a France-based search engine, had accused Microsoft of abusing its dominant position by imposing exclusivity restrictions that limited Qwant’s ability to offer search results and advertising independently. The French regulator said Qwant failed to provide evidence that was convincing enough to support its claims. It also declined Qwant’s request to place a temporary injunction against Microsoft’s practices. According to the official statement published by the Autorité, Qwant alleged that Microsoft engaged in “exclusive supply arrangements” and “tying” by only letting Qwant use Microsoft’s search results and advertising tools together. Qwant argued that this limited its ability to build its own search engine and its own AI tools. The complaint argued that these practices created economic dependence, prevented access to advertising, and blocked Qwant’s growth. However, it was concluded by the regulator that Qwant did not show that Microsoft holds a dominant position in the relevant syndication market. Qwant also failed to show that it lacked viable alternative services. Regulators noted that in June 2025, Qwant partnered with another search engine to launch a new syndication service using its own technology. A spokesperson for Microsoft reaffirmed the company’s commitment to “providing high-quality search services and fostering innovation for consumers and partners in France and across Europe.” Regulatory pressure on Big Tech European and French regulators now scrutinize large tech firms due to their potential to leverage dominance in search result deals to influence competition. In Europe, many smaller search engines such as Ecosia, DuckDuckGo, and Lilo rely on such agreements from Microsoft or other large providers to supply backend search results. Earlier in 2025, Qwant had threatened to take legal action if the Autorité did not impose interim measures on Microsoft, and now, with today’s ruling , Microsoft has escaped a formal regulatory investigation under French law for now. In September 2025, the company reached a compromise with the EU after similar accusations of breaching competitive rules were made in June 2025. Microsoft was forced to make Teams optional in its Microsoft 365/Office suites, but it escaped having to pay a hefty fine. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The community of analysts is observing the possible development of the pattern “Death Cross,” which takes place when shorter-term exponential moving averages intersect below the longer-term ones. This trend may lead to an additional fall of 21.8%, sending SOL towards the $100 level as the realized losses experienced by investors reach critical levels. Although in the past, instances of over-sold levels being followed by reversals have been recorded, the short-term bias at the moment does lean to the downside and makes SOL prone to this volatile environment of the cryptocurrency market. This volatility has encouraged investors to move towards a predictable and high-growth region, which has recently been evident in promising Presales undergoing tangible development. SOL/USD Technical Analysis Leans Bearish The price movement of Solana signifies the growing weakness in the market. The altcoin has already dropped by 47% from its regional high, and the projected “Death Cross” pattern also indicates a possible fall to $98, which identifies a trend of a 59% correction as experienced from a similar pattern in the early part of this year. The net realized profit/loss ratio has moved to its trough since June of last year, due to which the investors are suffering severe losses. Although this indicator has always served as a bearish reversal indicator when it drops below the level of 0.1 in the past, the current momentum state provides no quick comfort. The value of Solana is being challenged at the $123 support level at the moment, but a break below this vital level might trigger intensified downward pressure, which may cause the price to depreciate to the level of $105 and eventually to the price of $100. Mutuum Finance Presale Progress In contrast to the volatility of the Solana coin market, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token is experiencing a phenomenal presale run and has positioned itself at the top of the list of the best cryptos to buy at this point. The project has raised an impressive $19,020,000 from a community of 18,250 holders. The Presale Phase 6, which provides tokens at only $0.035, has been largely filled to the extent of 95% of its capacity. However, this price available today has already achieved a growth of 250% from the initial price of $0.01 during the first Phase. The availability of MUTM at this price point will be short-lived since the next phase of buying will begin at a price of $0.040, approximately 20% higher than the previous price. The perfectly planned ascent to a listing price of $0.06 sets up the existing buyers properly to capitalize on gains above 400% from listing and makes this particular cryptocurrency an attractive asset to own today before the next price change. Effective Ecosystem and Security Guarantees The appeal of Mutuum Finance does not end at the presales since the platform has a sound and novel protocol system. The main product offered at the platform is the dual-market lending platform that combines the Peer-to-Contract pools meant for the high liquidity tokens of ETH and USDT with the Peer-to-Peer markets that allow for the lending of niche tokens according to the users’ preferences. Security has been a vital priority, and the audit of the loaning and borrowing smart contracts is already being conducted independently by Halborn Security. Additionally, the announcement of the V1 protocol’s launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 of 2025 has been a crucial step in the transformation of the product from an idea to a tangible entity that allows users to access the vital functionality of liquidity pools and mtTokens. For those analyzing the best cryptocurrencies to invest, Mutuum Finance has looming utility and the secure development roadmap. Final Opportunity Mutuum Finance makes a strong case as one of the best cryptos to invest in if one wishes to benefit from a project before its public launch. The coming together of a near sold-out phase of the presales, a product roadmap, and the building of robust security measures makes a strong case for investing. As Phase 6 is almost sold out, this is the last opportunity to get MUTM at this price point. Those who are looking for the next growth cryptocurrency will be buying this promising DeFi project because it has the ability to provide strong returns in the current landscape of digital assets.

Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November The stability comes at a time when institutional interest in Solana is accelerating, highlighted by Franklin Templeton’s recent Form 8-A filing with the U.S. SEC to launch a Solana ETF. Franklin Templeton’s Solana ETF Fuels Institutional Momentum The global investment giant, which manages $1.67 trillion in assets, is positioning itself at the forefront of crypto-focused investment products. The proposed ETF would offer regulated exposure to Solana without requiring investors to hold the token directly, a move widely seen as a bullish catalyst for long-term adoption. Historically, ETFs have had mixed but notable effects on crypto markets. Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs after its ETF debut in 2024, while Ethereum took months to show similar momentum. Analysts say it remains unclear whether SOL will follow the Bitcoin pattern or display a more gradual response once the ETF is approved. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Upbit’s $37M Solana Hack Sends Shockwaves, But SOL Stays Steady Upbit confirmed an unauthorized outflow of roughly 54 billion KRW (about $37 million) involving SOL and several Solana-based tokens. The exchange immediately halted deposits and withdrawals, moved remaining assets into cold storage, and pledged to fully reimburse affected customers from its own reserves. While such incidents typically trigger steep price drops, Solana’s ecosystem demonstrated surprising stability. Not only did SOL hold above $140, a multi-month high-timeframe support zone, but Solana memecoins such as BONK, TRUMP, and MOODENG barely reacted. Traders pointed to on-chain data showing buyers aggressively defending key support levels, even as broader market sentiment wavered. Upbit has already frozen ₩12 billion worth of stolen LAYER tokens and is working with partners to trace additional assets. The timing of the breach, occurring nearly six years to the day after Upbit’s notorious 2019 hack, has drawn attention but has not shaken confidence in Solana’s network. Technical Outlook: Rebound or Breakdown? Analysts highlight $142–$145 as the immediate resistance band, supported by an estimated 13 million SOL accumulated at that level. A breakout could open the path toward $165, $188, and even higher liquidity pockets at $220–$240. Longer-term projections suggest potential targets between $360 and $480 if Wyckoff reaccumulation patterns complete. However, a failure to maintain $143 support could send SOL toward deeper zones at $130–$127. Related Reading: Has The Bitcoin Price Hit Its Bottom?

55008041,635220,1764273615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55008041.jpeg,Game-Changer For Bitcoin: Nasdaq Targets 1M Option Limit For BlackRock’s IBIT,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-nasdaq-1m-option-limit-blackrock-ibit/,"Nasdaq’s options venue is moving to put BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in the same risk tier as the largest, most liquid ETFs in traditional markets, with a new proposal to multiply the ceiling on IBIT options positions to 1 million contracts. According to a rule filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nasdaq ISE is seeking to raise position and exercise limits for IBIT options from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. In parallel, the exchange wants to remove position limits entirely for physically settled FLEX IBIT options, a bespoke, institution-focused segment of the market. Why This Is A Major News For Bitcoin The request comes only months after IBIT options limits were raised from 25,000 to 250,000 contracts. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X that “they just raised the limit to 250,000 (from 25,000) in July,” adding that “IBIT is now the biggest bitcoin options market in the world by open interest.” The speed of that progression – 25,000 to 250,000 to a proposed 1,000,000 – is being read as an indication that institutional demand for IBIT options is already pressing against the existing cap. As one commenter put it, the exchanges “only raise limits when demand is genuinely straining the system,” and moving to 1 million “means IBIT options trading has grown so much that the current ceiling is constraining institutional strategies.” ProCap CIO Jeff Park framed the move as overdue, saying “IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves,” and highlighting that Nasdaq has filed “to increase options limit to 1 MILLION (from 25k a year ago). Institutional vol is finally here.” At last, IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves— Nasdaq just filed to increase options limit to 1 MILLION (from 25k a year ago) Institutional vol is finally here Happy Thanksgiving https://t.co/vqH75rUTSf pic.twitter.com/MpCHxHMW8q — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) November 26, 2025 On-chain and derivatives analyst James Van Straten emphasized two points: the size of the proposed jump and the treatment of FLEX contracts. “One million contracts and removing limits on physically settled FLEX IBIT options, matching major commodity ETFs like GLD,” he wrote. In his view, the result is that “Bitcoin liquidity [is] about to get even deeper,” to the point that “70% corrections will be a thing of the past.” When challenged on whether that would also dampen upside, he replied that it “depends on the liquidity size that enters the market,” underscoring that flows, not just structure, determine price dynamics. Market commentator Adam Livingston described the filing as “INCREDIBLY BULLISH NEWS FOR BITCOIN,” arguing that “Nasdaq just moved IBIT (BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF) into the same regulatory class as the largest, most liquid equities on Earth.” He highlighted that the change represents “40× MORE ROOM for institutional derivatives exposure” compared to the original 25,000-contract cap and framed it as the moment “from ‘ETF adoption phase’ to derivatives market phase.” In his words, “Bitcoin just got promoted to Mega-Cap Status,” with the rule filing justifying IBIT’s treatment based on its market cap, liquidity and trading frequency alongside the biggest ETFs. Structurally, the proposal would deepen the on-exchange derivatives stack built around Bitcoin. A 1 million contract limit broadens the space for hedging, income strategies and structured products, while unlimited physically settled FLEX options give large institutions more room to run customized exposures on a regulated venue instead of shifting overflow into opaque OTC markets . However, higher limits are not inherently directional. The same capacity that enables larger hedges and call overlays also allows larger outright short or volatility-based positions. Around key macro dates or crypto-specific events, bigger books and more leverage can cut both ways for realized volatility. For now, the change remains a proposal. The SEC must still review and decide whether to approve, modify, or reject Nasdaq ISE’s request. Until then, IBIT options stay capped at 250,000 contracts, and the “1 million era” of IBIT remains a forward-looking scenario rather than a fait accompli.

This reduces exchange liquidity and can amplify price movements . Market observers note that sustained inflows often support long-term valuations rather than short-term speculative swings. While large whales still influence short-term price swings, ETF accumulation offers stability.

A positive delta indicates that whales are aggressively buying and leaning into longs, while a negative delta typically reflects distribution, with whales reducing longs or opening shorts even as retail continues buying. Whale Confidence Amid Market Turnaround The latest observation by the analytics firm comes amidst a broader market rebound. Ethereum, for one, has shown a notable recovery after briefly dipping below $2,750 last week. The altcoin gained over 4% in the past 24 hours, bringing its price to $3,026. Despite this uptick, ETH remains down 26.37% over the past month as ongoing volatility continues to weigh on the market. Ethereum’s recovery appears to be heavily influenced by aggressive accumulation from large investors as the altcoin navigates the current “sensitive” phase. New analysis shows that wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH now collectively own more than 21 million ETH – a record level not seen since the network’s inception. Beyond this, holders with over 100,000 ETH have also expanded their positions, which pushed their total balance to roughly 4.3 million ETH, in what appears to be a growing conviction among institutional-scale investors and high-liquidity participants. This accumulation coincided with a trend of shrinking exchange supply, as Binance reserves dropped to approximately 3.764 million ETH in November. The data indicates a migration of ETH into staking contracts or offline storage. Adding to the momentum, Arkham also found a Hyperliquid “OG Whale,” previously known for profiting nearly $200 million from shorts, who has now invested $10 million into existing ETH longs. The total position has now increased to $44.5 million. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified potential accumulation zones of $2,250, $1,550, and $1,080 as important support levels. According to Martinez, these price points may serve as strategic entry areas for investors looking to position ahead of the much-anticipated ETH rally. ADA Bounces Back After Mishap Cardano’s price also followed a similar trajectory after a short-lived decline as the blockchain suffered a chain split, after a malformed transaction activated a previously known bug from 2022. The issue was accidentally triggered by a stake pool operator (SPO) following AI-generated guidance, which caused certain nodes to follow different chains. The resulting divergence created two parallel versions of the blockchain, prompting urgent action. A rapid patch deployment ultimately restored network stability. ADA stabilized shortly thereafter. On Thursday, it rose 4%, trading at $0.431 at the time of reporting. Despite this short-term rebound, the crypto remains significantly down over the past month, having lost more than 35% of its value during the same period.

Most individual investors maintain relatively small portfolios, and the bulk of the trading volume comes from fewer large participants in the nascent market, the regulator has found. Russian households invest 3.7 billion rubles in crypto derivatives since May Household investments in Russian crypto-based derivative instruments amount to around 3.7 billion rubles (almost $47.3 million), the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has estimated. The monetary authority has published the figures from the second and third quarters of 2025 in its periodic report on the state of the Russian financial market. According to the latest edition of the bank’s Financial Stability Review, the current level of this type of investment, which it permitted earlier this year, does not pose systemic risks. Part of the total is represented by Russian bonds, the yield of which is tied to the value of digital assets, the authors of the study elaborated, further detailing: “The volume of investments in such bonds by individuals and non-profit organizations serving the public amounted to 1.6 billion rubles as of the beginning of October. The volume of bonds outstanding at par value is only 2.9 billion rubles.” Investments in crypto-linked futures contracts made by private individuals on the Moscow Exchange ( MOEX ), Russia’s largest stock market, are also minimal, the central bank remarked. As of the beginning of last month, the volume of net positions in this case reached 2.1 billion rubles (close to $27 million), reveals the document, quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax on Thursday. The majority of the 1,900 investors trading the crypto futures have small portfolios of up to 500,000 rubles (approx. $6,400), the CBR pointed out. At the same time, the main contributors to the overall investment volume are the few large players, whose open positions exceeded 100 million rubles (nearly $1.28 million), the Bank of Russia highlighted. Volume of Russian transactions on foreign crypto exchanges declines The Bank of Russia has been gradually opening towards crypto investments this year. In March, the regulator proposed an “experimental legal regime” (ELR) for cryptocurrency transactions. Besides allowing Russian companies to make cross-border payments, bypassing sanctions, the arrangement gave a small group of “highly qualified” investors access to crypto assets and their derivatives. In May, the authority permitted Russian financial firms to offer the same category of investors derivative products tracking foreign crypto funds and indices, with more recent plans to add products directly linked to digital currencies and let mutual funds invest in crypto. Discussions have recently started with the Finance Ministry in Moscow on admitting more investors to the country’s young crypto derivatives market by easing the requirements that currently involve high thresholds for annual income and other investments. Meanwhile, the CBR has also established that the volume of transactions made by Russian citizens on foreign crypto exchanges dropped by 18% in Q2 and Q3 of 2025 over the previous two quarters, the business news outlet RBC noted in its report on the findings in the financial stability assessment. The average monthly balance of Russians’ funds on over a dozen popular crypto trading platforms, including global leaders such as Binance and Bybit, decreased by 20% during the examined period, to 933 billion rubles. The bulk of the total, equal to almost $12 billion, was held in Bitcoin (BTC), 62%, followed by Ethereum (ETH), with 16%, while other coins accounted for 22%. At the same time, Russian traffic to these websites fell by 28%, to 83.4 million visits. The Bank of Russia notes that the drop is in line with global trends as Russia’s share has remained unchanged at 4.2%. This scale of crypto trading on domestic exchanges remains a very distant possibility as Russia’s main financial regulator maintains its strong opposition to legalizing the free circulation of decentralized digital money in the nation’s economy.

Pictet Asset Management strategist Luca Paolini stated that they predict the US dollar will begin to weaken again next year. According to Paolini, the expected slowdown in the US economy will create room for further interest rate cuts by the Fed, and the dollar's interest rate advantage will rapidly shrink. Paolini stated, “We expect the US economy to weaken somewhat, which will gradually ease inflationary pressures.” He argued that, in contrast, economic growth in Europe and Japan will begin to recover.

Source: SoSoValue The outflow marked the first negative session since the products launched earlier this month and broke a 21-day accumulation streak that had helped position Solana as one of the fastest-growing ETF markets among non-Bitcoin assets. 21Shares’ TSOL Dragged Solana ETFs Into Red, As Solana ETFs Hold Nearly $1B The reversal was largely driven by the 21Shares Solana ETF, TSOL, which saw more than $34 million exit the fund in a single session. TSOL has now registered $26 million in total net outflows since launch, with current net assets standing at $86 million. While the sharp pullback from one issuer triggered the broader negative print, other Solana ETFs continued to attract steady capital, absorbing much of the imbalance. Source: SoSoValue The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF, BSOL, led inflows with a $13.33 million intake, bringing its cumulative total to $527.79 million. The Grayscale Solana Trust also posted a strong day, adding $10.42 million, while Fidelity’s FSOL fund logged $2.51 million. Combined, Solana ETF products now hold approximately 6.83 million SOL tokens valued at around $964 million, showing that institutional demand remains elevated even as short-term flows turn uneven. Despite Wednesday’s setback, Solana spot ETFs ended the week with a net addition of nearly $103 million, pushing cumulative inflows to $613.22 million and total net assets to $917.99 million. November alone has generated $414.01 million in inflows, surpassing the $199.21 million recorded in October during their debut month. The mixed day for Solana ETFs contrasts with the momentum seen in the newly launched XRP products , which have yet to log a single outflow session. XRP ETFs recorded another $21 million in combined inflows on Wednesday, lifting their cumulative total to $643 million. The Bitwise XRP ETF led with $7.4 million, followed by Canary’s XRPC with $5.2 million and roughly $4 million each for Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ and Grayscale’s GXRP. Elsewhere, Dogecoin ETF performance lagged expectations. The New York Stock Exchange approved the listing of Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust ETF, but the product fell short of analyst estimates, with a debut of only $11 million. Institutional Demand Lifts Bitcoin ETFs as Solana Market Indicators Turn Bearish Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs continued their pattern of modest strength, adding $21.12 million on November 26 despite recent volatility. Total cumulative Bitcoin ETF inflows now stand at $57.63 billion, supported by daily trading volumes above $4.5 billion. Ethereum ETFs also showed improving daily activity late in the month, with inflows above $60 million for three consecutive sessions. However, they continue to face sustained net outflows for November, totaling $1.50 billion as investors rotate toward Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP. Analysts monitoring Solana’s ETF performance note that the outflow coincides with a period of broader market caution and weakening on-chain activity. According to data from Nansen , there was a 6% decline in active Solana addresses and a 16% drop in network fees over the past week. The total value locked on the network has fallen 32% from its September peak of $13.23 billion, currently standing at roughly $9.1 billion. The slowdown has carried through to major Solana protocols, including Jito, Jupiter, Raydium, and Sanctum, each posting double-digit TVL declines this month. Technical readings point to continued uncertainty. Solana is trading within a bearish continuation pattern after retreating from the $170 region earlier in the month. Traders point out the $140–$145 area as a pivotal zone, with a break below potentially confirming a continuation toward lower support levels. Market strategists say the divergence between strong ETF inflows and weakening spot performance illustrates the broader tension in crypto markets, where institutional accumulation continues even as retail-led selling and cautious sentiment weigh on prices. In the coming days and weeks, analysts expect Solana to remain sensitive to market-wide volatility and ETF flow consistency.

The recent stabilization near the lower boundary of its long-term range has encouraged traders who have watched the asset test the same zone multiple times this year. Besides the steady price behavior, market data reveals that institutional exposure is expanding again after a brief slowdown. Treasury Flows Strengthen as Whales Increase Staked Holdings TedPillows, a market analyst, reports early recovery signs among major Solana treasury accounts. He notes improving inflows into key investment products linked to the asset. The strongest signal comes from the Bitwise Solana ETF , which has recorded more than $527.9 million in inflows since November 10. This trend suggests increasing institutional appetite during recent market weakness. However, analysts still expect stronger accumulation before calling a full trend reversal. Additionally, whale movements offer another important trend. Lookonchain data shows a large holder withdrawing 49,000 SOL from OKX before adding those tokens to a staking position. The same address now holds more than 761,000 staked SOL after the latest move. This stake is valued near $109 million at current market prices. Hence, long-term conviction among major holders appears firm despite short-term volatility across the broader market. Solana trades near $142 as of press time after a mild daily decline. However, the token still gained over 7% during the past week. The circulating supply stands near 560 million SOL, placing the market value at roughly $79.6 billion. Bull Flag Structure Forms on Monthly Chart Source: X Bitcoinsensus highlights a developing bull flag on Solana’s monthly chart. The setup formed after a strong rally from late 2023 into early 2024. Solana has since consolidated between $120 and $210 for more than a year. This compression indicates controlled cooling inside a defined range. Market analysts often interpret this structure as a continuation pattern that prepares the asset for the next expansion phase. Moreover, Solana trades close to the lower boundary of this range near $140. Buyers have protected this region several times, creating an important demand level. A decisive move above $210 could confirm the flag and open a path toward a higher target.

The firm signed a memorandum of understanding with the Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board to construct a massive 1-gigawatt (GW) campus spanning 400 acres in Visakhapatnam. The facility will be designed specifically for AI workloads, helping to provide the infrastructure that supports the global surge in demand for computing infrastructure capable of supporting machine learning and generative AI applications. The announcement and the size of the investment position Digital Connexion as a major player in India’s data center rush. The joint venture already operates a campus in Chennai and is developing a 40-megawatt (MW) facility in Mumbai , but the Visakhapatnam project represents a significant scaling of ambitions. Tech giants converge on India The investment joins the increasing list of companies, both international and local technology, pouring capital into India, betting that the world’s most populous nation will become a critical node in the global AI infrastructure network. Alphabet’s Google unveiled plans in October to invest approximately $15 billion over five years to build an AI hub in Andhra Pradesh. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is also pursuing plans to build a 1 GW data center in India, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) secured $1 billion for HyperVault, its AI data center business, from TPG, a private equity group. Amazon has also earmarked $12.7 billion for cloud infrastructure development by 2030. According to CBRE Group , total investments in India’s data center market are projected to exceed $100 billion by 2027, driven by the country’s competitive advantages, including development costs, second only to China and electricity rates far below those in the United States, United Kingdom, or Japan. Energy demands and environmental pressures However, the data center expansion is colliding with India’s chronic infrastructure challenges, especially with respect to its water and energy resources. The country accounts for over 17% of the global population, making it the most populous nation in the world; however, it only controls 4% of the world’s freshwater resources, according to World Bank data . Data centers are known for their high demand for water, and the consumption by the ones situated in India is projected to rise from 150 billion liters in 2025 to 358 billion liters by 2030, increasing pressure on already strained supplies. Data centers consume electricity equivalent to powering mid-size cities, and analysts say that investments in power by both public and private stakeholders have to be made to generate more power and support existing electrical grids globally. Supporting expanding data center capacity will require approximately $720 billion in investment by 2030. Goldman Sachs Research projects that worldwide data center capacity will reach roughly 122 GW by 2030, up from current levels. Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu of Andhra Pradesh said that the wave of data center investments will position the state as a global technology hub and also create thousands of jobs in construction, engineering, and digital services. The state has secured 5.5 GW of data center projects to date and aims to expand green energy output to power the facilities.

With analysts eyeing a potential rise to $15 by the end of the year, driven by increased subnet usage in gaming and DeFi, the network is capturing investor interest. While Avalanche builds on its strengths in real-world asset tokenization, a different project, GeeFi , is focused on a more immediate challenge: making crypto simple and accessible for everyone. Navigating the Complex World of Crypto The growth in Avalanche’s subnet activity and its appeal for institutional real-world asset (RWA) tokenization are positive signs for the network’s future. These developments demonstrate its technical strengths and ability to handle complex applications. However, this specialized focus can also highlight the complexity of the crypto space, which often leaves the average user feeling overwhelmed by different chains, wallets, and platforms. GeeFi was built to solve this problem. In development since 2023, the project offers a unified platform to manage all your crypto needs. Its non-custodial GeeFi Wallet , a mobile app already available for Android with an iOS version in the works, supports over 14 blockchains . This allows you to securely store and trade your assets from a single, user-friendly interface, removing the confusion and risk associated with managing multiple platforms. The Presale That Could Be a Game-Changer While AVAX works to regain its momentum, the GeeFi (GEE) token presale offers a unique opportunity to invest in a project from the ground up. Some of the biggest returns in crypto have come from identifying projects with strong real-world utility before they hit the mainstream. Many analysts believe GeeFi’s GEE token has the potential to be a 100x gem , and its presale is the perfect entry point. The presale, which started on November 17, 2025 , has already gained significant traction, raising over $300,000 with more than 6.2 million GEE tokens sold. This early success shows growing confidence in GeeFi’s vision. The GEE token is currently priced at just $0.05 , but its planned exchange listing price is $0.40 , offering early investors a potential 700% return . If analysts’ predictions of it reaching $2 come true, a $1,500 investment today could grow to $60,000 , delivering an incredible 3,900% ROI . A Complete Financial Ecosystem GeeFi is building more than just a wallet; it is creating a complete financial ecosystem. The team is also developing the GeeFi HUB , a web dashboard for total portfolio management. This platform will include an integrated decentralized exchange ( GeeFi DEX ) for direct trading and on/off-ramp services to convert crypto to fiat and back. This strong utility is a major reason why analysts are so optimistic about GEE’s potential to become a 100x gem . The GEE token is at the center of this ecosystem. By staking GEE, you can earn up to 55% APR for locking your tokens for 12 months, which promotes long-term value and stability. Stakers will also receive exclusive benefits for the upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card , including better rewards and lower fees. This utility-driven approach is designed to ensure the token’s value grows alongside the platform’s user base, making it a project with enormous potential.

Fidelity’s Global Macro Director , Jurrien Timmer, frames the latest Bitcoin crash as a necessary purge for overheated risk assets—clearing out leverage, cooling speculation, and restoring market discipline. The billion-dollar wealth manager describes the downturn as a structural reset that ultimately reinforces Bitcoin’s long-term investment profile. Bitcoin Price Crash Signals A Healthier Market Reset Bitcoin has shed 11.8% over the past two weeks, and while that might trigger headlines of panic, according to Timmer, a closer look reveals a healthier market adjustment at work. In a recent post on X, he frames this ongoing Bitcoin price decline as a necessary correction rather than a crisis. He points to a broad spectrum of speculative assets—including meme stocks, SPACs, unprofitable tech companies, recent IPOs, and equities highly sensitive to Bitcoin price—showing the same pattern: rapid gains through Q3 2025, followed by a synchronized pullback . Within this context, Bitcoin is simply adjusting its position, moving lower on the performance scale as the market sheds excess speculation. Timmer frames this decline as an orderly unwinding of overextended leverage rather than a collapse in market structure. His chart shows stretched valuations normalizing, risk exposure being reassessed , and the broader capital stack recalibrating after months of momentum-driven activity. These shifts remove structural distortions, strengthen market integrity, and restore disciplined capital allocation—foundations for long-term stability. The chart also highlights how the correction separates speculative noise from true fundamentals. As speculative excess retreats , Bitcoin’s price trajectory aligns more closely with adoption and real-world utility. Weakness in Bitcoin-sensitive equities reinforces this shift: the market is refining expectations, not abandoning the asset. Timmer presents this pullback as less a setback and more a course correction that positions Bitcoin for sustainable growth. Correction Highlights Market Discipline Even as the Bitcoin price drops to the lower end of the sector-return chart—well behind gold miners, equities, and thematic baskets—Timmer argues that its long-term network trajectory remains intact. The chart he posted shows a pattern consistent with past drawdowns that cleared excess leverage , slowed rapid inflows, and pulled the asset back toward its adoption curve. He notes that while other sectors surged and unwound sharply through 2025, Bitcoin’s path stayed more disciplined. For Timmer, this is the key distinction: corrections act as rebalancing events, resetting supply and demand and flushing out fast-money activity. In his framing, the crash is not a breakdown but a sanitation cycle—a broad risk repricing that removes speculative noise and restores order across overheated markets. Rather than a crisis, it becomes a detox that reinforces Bitcoin’s structural foundation and sets the stage for its next phase of maturation.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-27 21:00:10

His outlook was presented in response to the ultra-bullish forecasts from Michael Saylor and Jack Mallers, who have spoken openly about the possibility of Bitcoin reaching between $1 million and $20 million per coin. Rather than focusing on Bitcoin’s distant targets, the analyst directed attention to XRP, insisting that XRP will reach $100 long before Bitcoin touches the seven-figure mark. Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100 Before Bitcoin’s Million-Dollar Target There have been many bullish predictions of Bitcoin breaking above the $1 million mark in recent months, with notable names like Michael Saylor and Cathie Wood pointing to million-dollar targets. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Will Flip Bitcoin As These Developments Play Out However, an analyst who goes by the name 24HRSCRYPTO on the social media platform X referenced Saylor and Mallers’ price prediction, which places future Bitcoin valuations in the tens of millions per coin and implies a market cap approaching $500 trillion. He contrasted those long-range projections with what he believes is a more attainable and nearer-term milestone for XRP. Punching in the numbers shows that XRP is a 4,445% move away from $100 based on its current price level of around $2.2. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is 990% away from the $1 million price. Even with that difference, the analyst noted, “You will see XRP at $100 before Bitcoin hits $1 million.” The statement points to the view that XRP is positioned for faster price growth in the foreseeable future, as seen by price dynamics in the past few months. The crypto is increasingly being positioned in a situation where demand and adoption of the Ripple ecosystem could take it to new heights. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s price action is slowing down relative to XRP. Notably, technical analysis of the XRP/BTC pair places XRP on the path to outperforming Bitcoin in the coming weeks and months. The Altcoin Will Hit $1,000 Before Bitcoin Touches $19 Million The analyst extended his projection even further by asserting that XRP could rally to $1,000 before Bitcoin comes close to the $19 million figure referenced by Saylor. Such a valuation for Bitcoin would imply a market capitalization of roughly $500 trillion, a scale far beyond anything seen in global financial history. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Price Will Surge To $220 Due To ETFs, But Is This Possible? Measured from today’s levels, Bitcoin would need to climb roughly 20,635% to reach the $19 million mark. XRP’s path to $1,000 amounts to an even larger jump of about 45,300%, which corresponds to a market cap of $60 trillion based on its current circulating supply. Still, XRP reaching $1,000 is, in his view, more feasible than Bitcoin reaching millions per coin.

Renowned Economist Nouriel Roubini Weighs In,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-lies-ahead-for-the-us-economy-in-2026-renowned-economist-nouriel-roubini-weighs-in/,"Renowned economist Nouriel Roubini stated that massive investments in artificial intelligence gave a strong impetus to the economy in 2025, but uncertainties arising from President Donald Trump's tariffs and policies suppressed growth in the second half of the year, and drew three different scenarios for 2026. As the new year approaches, the U.S. economy could head into a “growth recession,” a “shallow recession,” or “strong growth without a dip,” according to Roubini, but the most likely scenario is the Goldilocks scenario, which is also the most positive. Roubini argues that the failure to properly release official employment and inflation data for months due to the longest government shutdown in history has clouded the economic management's view. Despite this, he notes that the prevailing scenario is one where the economy recovers after several months of below-trend growth and inflation gradually declines toward the Fed's 2% target. This outlook was made possible by the administration's reversal of the high tariffs announced in April, replacing them with trade agreements that include more moderate increases, and preserving the Fed's independence. In this positive scenario, the key drivers of a strong recovery towards mid-2026 are the Fed's additional easing measures, fiscal stimulus that has not yet been activated, robust household and corporate balance sheets, the financial comfort created by high stock prices and low bond yields, and strong capital spending driven by AI investments. This is further supported by the easing of tariffs due to the base effect and the return of inflation to decline as productivity growth takes hold. The second scenario, a “short and shallow recession,” is less likely but not entirely ruled out. Roubini says the lagged effects of tariffs could push up inflation, erode real wages, weaken consumer confidence, and create a “K-shaped” divergence between income groups. Additionally, if the debate about a bubble in AI investments intensifies, a sharp correction in stocks and companies' capital spending cuts are also risks. However, even in this negative scenario, the recession is expected to be overcome quickly with the Fed's more aggressive interest rate cuts and fiscal policy providing additional support. Related News: Billionaire Anthony Scaramucci Says “A Brutal Reset Is Coming for Altcoins,” Speaks Very Differently About Bitcoin The third, more bullish scenario is “no decline, continued growth.” According to this scenario, the US economy is proving more resilient than many estimates; the slowdown in employment is thought to be due to a reduced labor supply due to immigration pressures. If artificial intelligence and new technologies generate early productivity gains, wages and growth could remain strong, while core inflation could hover around 3%. In such a scenario, the Fed could hold off on interest rate cuts for an extended period due to concerns about the economy overheating. However, Roubini emphasizes that this scenario is not the most likely scenario, as recent data indicates weakness. Roubini points out that global risks, such as escalating US-China tensions or a new geopolitical shock driving oil prices, create vulnerabilities that could push the US economy into the latter scenario. However, he points out that these risks are largely under control. According to the renowned economist, if the US economy recovers in 2026 and China maintains growth near 5%, the global economy is poised for a significantly more positive year compared to 2025. Despite all the downside risks, Roubini argues that “cautious optimism” is a reasonable approach as we enter the new year. *This is not investment advice.

Cardano (ADA) is presently experiencing a stern test of investor trust after witnessing the disruption of their major network following a chain split and exchange halts. While ADA faces the situation of decreasing by 21% on a weekly basis and breaking critical levels of support, there is a new project gaining attention from smart money. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which can be purchased at $0.035 in its near complete presale stage 6, shows sound fundamental qualities & speedy development capabilities yet to be demonstrated by several established players making MUTM a crypto to buy. Cardano Confirms Ecosystem Fragility Cardano’s ecosystem has shown several loopholes following a malicious transaction involving an outdated cryptographic library, which resulted in creating a chain split and stopping the creation of blocks. The development resulted in a sharp sell-off in the market, pushing ADA closer to its critical level of $0.40. Several loopholes in Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem have come to light following several issues such as losing $6 million from its wallet because of very low liquidity in Automated Market Makers. Though the emergency update of the nodes has brought stabilization to the network, investor trust is still shaken. The reclaiming of the $0.53 resistance level looks far-fetched, so ADA will be considered a speculative hold asset relative to other promising ones such as Mutuum Finance, which starts to build its foundation with reliable security measures. Presale to Enter Imminent Phase Transition Although Cardano solves its inherent structural problems, Mutuum Finance records notable accomplishments. The project’s Phase 6 presale has passed the 95% allocation milestone and is headed towards a full sell-out. Mutuum Finance has raised $19 million and rallied 18,200 holders to date. The tokens will be available for purchase as long as they last at the live market rate of $0.035; however, this last chance is quickly running out. The switch to Phase 7 will cause a sharp escalation in price by about 20% to $0.040. Investors who purchase tokens now will be poised to reap returns of 400% when MUTM launches. The Dual Lending Model Maximizes Utility The chief innovation of Mutuum Finance regards their lending framework for two markets, aiming to cover a wider application range as opposed to single-model systems. The framework features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools for high liquidity tokens such as ETH and USDT, together with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets for special lending terms involving less widely used tokens. Users contributing to P2C pools receive mtTokens, which earn interests and signify their stake in the liquidity pool. The versatile framework allows several streams of revenue generation from just one platform; it solves for issues associated with liquidity fragmentation seen in Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem in creating value for MUTM as the top crypto to invest in. Security Framework Commits to Protecting Investors Contrary to other failures in global networks recently, Mutuum Finance has emphasized security as a core tenet even before its mainnet launch. The new blockchain lending and borrowing platform Mutuum Finance is currently going through a detailed security audit by Halborn Security. The audit will check the lending and borrowing smart contracts of Mutuum Finance to ensure their security and protect investor capital. Such an active security-oriented mindset sets Mutuum Finance apart from other initiatives which focus on patching glitches only after disasters have unfolded. For investor clients who would like to safeguard their portfolios from technical risks associated with tokens such as ADA, MUTM’s strong security-oriented mindset carries far less risks. Secure your position before price increase the obvious disparity between Cardano’s fluctuating network and Mutuum Finance’s planned progression provides market-seekers with a tempting alternative. Though ADA seeks to re-gain market trust, MUTM exemplifies transparency of forward momentum, security features, and incremental value increases demanded by the market.

Ripple (XRP) has displayed the first signs of a possible reversal of its downward trend, while there has been rapid growth of the pre-launch state of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The defining question that portfolio stocks seeking to achieve exponential growth need to answer will be which asset class offers the best opportunity. Even though XRP aims to overcome its previous losses, the organized presales and novel protocol model of MUTM makes it a strong rival to those seeking to achieve big returns and hence offer the best cryptocurrency to invest in today. XRP Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) is currently trying to hold a crucial support level of $1.85, which has been known to witness strong reversals in the past. The development of a bullish Morning Star pattern in the daily chart also confirms that the bearish phase might be coming to an end soon. The on-chain analytics also support this viewpoint and confirm that the investors have accumulated a large quantity of 1.80 billion XRP at the support level of $1.75 in the past. A clear downturn in exchange reserves due to the reported outflow of 3 million XRP from Binance indicates the beginning of accumulation patterns, which eases short-term selling pressure. Although there are perfect conditions favoring XRP at the current market state, the price remains below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average. Additionally, the indicator Chaikin Money Flow has been negative at -0.07, which shows continuous outflows of money from the market. To break through the existing trend and be considered the best possible investing option within the cryptocurrencies market, XRP must first break through the $2.07 level. Presale Momentum As opposed to the XRP’s purely speculative approach to its tech incorporation, there’s a concrete and urgent opportunity being presented in the case of MUTM’s developing presale. MUTM has managed to garner a lot of investor trust and has raised over $19,020,000 with a community of 18,250 holders. The current phase of their presale event is the sixth phase at $0.035 per token, which has already experienced a price escalation of 250% from its initial price. One of the most attractive aspects of the current phase of the project’s presale is the fact that an impressive 95% of Phase 6 has been committed already, which will be the final opportunity to participate before the costs escalate to $0.040 in Phase 7. This will be the final opportunity to get involved before the launch at $0.06, which has the possibility of yielding returns of over 400% of the current holders’ investments. The clear advancement of the presale makes this one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. Anchor Concept What makes Mutuum Finance a unique project is that it involves the existence of a rich ecosystem that has been built to promote longevity. One of the building blocks of this particular ecosystem involves the development of its own stablecoin that will retain the same value equivalent to the US dollar. The particular stablecoin will not be algorithmic because it will be over-collateralized through its own lending pools. Security has also been of utmost importance, and a thorough audit of the smart contract code of the lending and borrowing platform has been carried out by Halborn Security. The fact that the roadmap of the project has testnet development this quarter also gives the community the sense of operational security. For investors who are trying to decide which cryptocurrency to invest in at this point to maximize their returns, the security of MUTM makes the case clear. In the case of the projection of possible return of 22x, the decision becomes easy. Even though XRP indicates short-term signals of being bullish in the market trends, the development of XRP has not been verified and has numerous technological challenges. In this regard, Mutuum Finance has been demonstrated to be better than XRP due to the security offered by its dual-layer lending protocol. The investment window for MUTM at this price will soon be closing. This makes it imperative that immediate action be taken if one wishes to be part of the next big thing. The coming together of technological innovations and proven demand makes MUTM the better option when it relates to the return of investments in portfolios.

With Bitcoin struggling to recover and altcoins posting steep losses, many analysts are warning that XRP could face a continued decline in the coming days. Investors are bracing for more volatility as liquidity thins and market confidence weakens. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin LTH Sell-Off Signals Cycle Exhaustion as Supply Drops to 13.6M BTC Yet, despite the bearish narrative, the XRP ecosystem has shown unusual levels of activity—particularly on the institutional front. The arrival of the first US spot XRP ETFs has reshaped its market profile. Canary Capital was the first to launch on November 13, soon followed by Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale. In a matter of days, XRP transitioned from a conventional crypto asset to one accessible through regulated institutional vehicles, potentially shifting its long-term demand dynamics. This new backdrop makes one ongoing trend on Binance even more striking. Since October, XRP reserves on the exchange have been falling sharply. Current data shows reserves have dropped to roughly 2.7 billion XRP, one of the lowest levels ever recorded on the platform. Such consistent outflows signal rising demand for self-custody—an important metric as XRP navigates this critical market phase. XRP Exchange Outflows Signal Strengthening Long-Term Demand According to a new CryptoQuant report by analyst Darkfost, XRP is experiencing one of its most notable exchange outflow trends in years. Since October 6, roughly 300 million XRP have left Binance alone—a figure far too large and too consistent to dismiss as simple internal reshuffling. While a small portion of these transfers may be operational movements by the exchange, the broader pattern is unmistakable: investors are steadily withdrawing XRP from trading platforms. This behavior is typically interpreted as a bullish long-term signal. Day after day, the decline in exchange reserves continues, suggesting that buyers are choosing to move their XRP into private wallets rather than leaving them on exchanges for trading or short-term speculation. Historically, large-scale withdrawals reflect strong conviction, as holders position themselves for longer-term appreciation rather than immediate selling. The supply dynamics created by this trend are significant. With fewer tokens available on exchanges, liquidity tightens. When combined with the rising institutional interest brought by newly launched U.S. spot ETFs, this creates the potential foundation for a powerful shift in momentum. If exchange reserves continue dropping at the current pace, XRP could enter a more structured phase of accumulation—one driven not by hype, but by growing confidence from both retail and institutional participants.

After weeks of decline, XRP found temporary support near the $2 psychological zone, where buyers briefly stepped in to prevent a deeper breakdown. This area aligns closely with the 200-day moving average (red line), which has acted as a final line of defense during multiple market cycles. Despite the small rebound, XRP continues to trade well below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which are now sloping downward and reinforcing the broader bearish trend. The inability to reclaim the $2.40–$2.50 zone — an important previous support turned resistance — suggests that sellers still dominate the market structure. Volume also remains muted compared to earlier phases of the cycle, indicating that strong conviction buying has not yet returned.
